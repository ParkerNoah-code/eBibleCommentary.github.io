          ON the revival of science in the 16th century, some of the earliest
          conclusions at which philosophers arrived were found to be at variance
          with popular and long-established belief. The Ptolemaic system of
          astronomy, which had then full possession of the minds of men,
          contemplated the whole visible universe from the earth as the
          immovable centre of things. Copernicus changed the point of view, and
          placing the beholder in the sun, at once reduced the earth to an
          inconspicuous globule, a merely subordinate member of a family of
          planets, which the terrestrials had until then fondly imagined to be
          but pendants and ornaments of their own habitation. The Church
          naturally took a lively interest in the disputes which arose between
          the philosophers of the new school and those who adhered to the old
          doctrines, inasmuch as the Hebrew records, the basis of religious
          faith, manifestly countenanced the opinion of the earth's immobility
          and certain other views of the universe very incompatible with those
          propounded by Copernicus. Hence arose the official proceedings against
          Galileo, in consequence of which he submitted to sign his celebrated
          recantation, acknowledging that the proposition that the son is the
          centre of the world and immovable from its place is absurd,
          philosophically false, and formally heretical, because it is expressly
          contrary to the Scripture;' and that the proposition that earth is not
          the centre of the world, nor immovable but that it moves and also with
          a diurnal motion, is absurd, philosophically false, and at least
          erroneous in faith.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romish Church, it is presumed, adheres to the old views to the
          present day. Protestant instincts however, in the 17th century were
          strongly in sympathy with the augmentation of science, and
          consequently Reformed Churches more easily allowed themselves to be
          helped over the difficulty, which, according to the views of
          inspiration then held and which have survived to the present day, was
          in reality quite as formidable for them as for those of the old faith.
          The solution of the difficulty offered by Galileo and others was, that
          the object of a revelation or divine unveiling of mysteries, must be
          to teach man things which he is unable and must ever remain unable to
          find out for himself; but not physical truths, for the discovery of
          which he has faculties specially provided by his Creator. Hence it was
          not unreasonable that, in regard to matters of fact merely, the Sacred
          Writings should use the common language and assume the common belief
          of mankind, without purporting to correct errors upon points morally
          indifferent. So, in regard to such a text as, The world is
          established, it cannot be moved,' though it might imply the sacred
          penman's ignorance of the fact that the earth does move, yet it does
          not put forth this opinion as an indispensable point of faith. And
          this remark is applicable to a number of texts which present a similar
          difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be thought to have been less easy to reconcile in men's minds
          the Copernican view of universe with the very plain and direct
          averments contained in the opening chapter of Genesis. It can scarcely
          be said that this chapter is not intended in part to teach and convey
          at least some physical truth, and taking its words in their plain
          sense it manifestly gives a view of the universe adverse to that of
          modern science. It represents the sky as a watery vault in which the
          sun, moon, and stars are set. But the discordance of this description
          with facts does not appear to have been so palpable to the minds of
          the seventeenth century as it is to us. The mobility of the earth was
          a proposition startling not only to faith but to the senses. The
          difficulty involved in this belief having been successfully got over,
          other discrepancies dwindled in importance. The brilliant progress of
          astronomical science subdued the minds of men; the controversy between
          faith and knowledge gradually fell to slumber; the story of Galileo
          and the Inquisition became a school commonplace, the doctrine of the
          earth's mobility found its way into children's catechisms, and the
          limited views of the nature of the universe indicated in the Old
          Testament, ceased to be felt as religious difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have been well if theologians had made up their minds to
          accept frankly the principle that those things for the discovery of
          which man has faculties specially provided are not fit objects of a
          divine revelation. Had this been unhesitatingly done, either the
          definition and idea of divine revelation must have been modified, and
          the possibility of an admixture of error have been allowed, or such
          parts of the Hebrew writings as were found to be repugnant to fact
          must have been pronounced to form no part of revelation. The first
          course is that which theologians have most generally adopted, but with
          such limitations, cautels, and equivocations as to be of little use in
          satisfying those who would know how and what God really has taught
          mankind, and whether anything beyond that which man is able and
          obviously intended to arrive at by the use of his natural faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficulties and disputes which attended the first revival of
          science have recurred in the present century in consequence of the
          growth of geology. It is in truth only the old question over again --
          precisely the same point of theology which is involved, -- although
          the difficulties which present themselves are fresh. The school-books
          of the present day, while they teach the child that the earth moves,
          yet assure him that it is a little less than six thousand years old,
          and that it was made in six days. On the other hand, geologists of all
          religious creeds are agreed that the earth has existed for an immense
          series of years, -- to be counted by millions rather than by
          thousands; and that indubitably more than six days elapsed from its
          first creation to the appearance of man upon its surface. By this
          broad discrepancy between old and new doctrine is the modern mind
          startled, as were the men of the sixteenth century when told that the
          earth moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          When this new cause of controversy first arose, some writers more
          hasty than discreet, attacked the conclusions of geologists, and
          declared them scientifically false. This phase may now be considered
          past, and although school-books probably continua to teach much as
          they did, no well-instructed person now doubts the great antiquity of
          the earth any more than its motion. This being so, modern theologians,
          forsaking the maxim of Galileo, or only using it vaguely as an
          occasional make-weight, have directed their attention to the
          possibility of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with those geological
          facts which are admitted to be beyond dispute. Several modes of doing
          this have been proposed which have been deemed more or less
          satisfactory. In a text-book of theological instruction widely used,
          we find it stated in broad terms, Geological investigations, it is now
          known, all prove the perfect harmony between scripture and geology, in
          reference to the history of creation.'
        </p>
        <p>
          In truth, however, if we refer to the plans of conciliation proposed,
          we find them at variance with each other and mutually destructive. The
          conciliators are not agreed among themselves, and each holds the views
          of the other to be untenable and unsafe. The ground is perpetually
          being shifted, as the advance of geological science may require. The
          plain meaning of the Hebrew record is unscrupulously tampered with,
          and in general the pith of the whole process lies in divesting the
          text of all meaning whatever. We are told that Scripture not being
          designed to teach us natural philosophy, it is in vain to attempt to
          make out a cosmogony from its statements. If the first chapter of
          Genesis convey to us no information concerning the origin of the
          world, its statements cannot indeed be contradicted by modern
          discovery. But it is absurd to call this harmony. Statements such as
          that above quoted are, we conceive, little calculated to be
          serviceable to the interests of theology, still less to religion and
          morality. Believing, as we do, that if the value of the Bible as a
          book of religious instruction is to be maintained, it must be not by
          striving to prove it scientifically exact, at the expense of every
          sound principle of interpretation, and in defiance of common sense,
          but by the frank recognition of the erroneous views of nature which it
          contains, we have put pen to paper to analyse some of the popular
          conciliation theories. The inquiry cannot be deemed a superfluous one,
          nor one which in the interests of theology had better be let alone.
          Physical science goes on unconcernedly pursuing its own paths.
          Theology, the science whose object is the dealing of God with man as a
          moral being, maintains but a shivering existence, shouldered and
          jostled by the sturdy growths of modern thought, and bemoaning itself
          for the hostility which it encounters. Why should this be, unless
          because theologians persist in clinging to theories of God's procedure
          towards man, which have long been seen to be untenable? If,
          relinquishing theories, they would be content to inquire from the
          history of man what this procedure has actually been, the so-called
          difficulties of theology would, for the most part, vanish of
          themselves.

          The account which astronomy gives of the relations of our earth to the
          rest of the universe, and that which geology gives of its internal
          structure and the development of its surface, are sufficiently
          familiar to most readers. But it will be necessary for our purpose to
          go over the oft-trodden ground, which must be done with rapid steps.
          Nor let the reader object to be reminded of some of the most
          elementary facts of his knowledge. The human race has been ages in
          arriving at conclusions now familiar to every child.

          This earth apparently so still and stedfast, lying in majestic repose
          beneath the ætherial vault, is a globular body of comparatively
          insignificant size, whirling fast through space round the sun as the
          centre of its orbit, and completing its revolution in the course of
          one year, while at the same time it revolves daily once about its own
          axis, thus producing the changes of day and night. The sun, which
          seems to leap up each morning from the east, and traversing the skyey
          bridge, slides down into the west, is relatively to our earth
          motionless. In size and weight it inconceivably surpasses it. The
          moon, which occupies a position in the visible heavens only second to
          the sun, and far beyond that of every other celestial body in
          conspicuousness, is but a subordinate globe, much smaller than our
          own, and revolving round the earth as its centre, while it accompanies
          it in yearly revolutions about the sun. Of itself it has no lustre,
          and is visible to us only by the reflected sunlight. Those beautiful
          stars which are perpetually changing their position in the heavens,
          and shine with a soft and moon-like light, are bodies, some much
          larger, some less, than our earth, and like it revolve round the sun,
          by the reflection of whose rays we see them. The telescope has
          revealed to us the fact that several of these are attended by moons of
          their own, and that besides those which the unassisted eye can see,
          there are others belonging to the same family coursing round the sun.
          As for the glittering dust which emblazons the nocturnal sky, there is
          reason to believe that each spark is a self-luminous body, perhaps of
          similar material to our sun, and that the very nearest of the whole
          tribe is at an incalculable distance from us, the very least of them
          of enormous size compared with our own humble globe. Thus has modern
          science reversed nearly all the primâ facie views to which our senses
          lead us as to the constitution of the universe; but so thoroughly are
          the above statements wrought into the culture of the present day, that
          we are apt to forget that mankind once saw these things very
          differently, and that but a few centuries have elapsed since such
          views were startling novelties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our earth then is but one of the lesser pendants of a body which is
          itself only an inconsiderable unit in the vast creation. And now if we
          withdraw our thoughts from the immensities of space, and look into the
          construction of man's obscure home, the first question is whether it
          has ever been in any other condition than that in which we now see it,
          and if so, what are the stages through which it has passed, and what
          was its first traceable state. Here geology steps in and successfully
          carries back the history of the earth's crust to a very remote period,
          until it arrives at region of uncertainty, where philosophy is reduced
          to mere guesses and possibilities, and pronounces nothing definite. To
          this region belong the speculations which have been ventured upon as
          to the original concretion of the earth and planets out of nebular
          matter of which the sun may have been the. nucleus. But the first
          clear view which we obtain of the early condition of the earth,
          presents to us a ball of matter, fluid with intense heat, spinning on
          its own axis and revolving round the sun. How long it may have
          continued in this state is beyond calculation or surmise. It can only
          be believed that a prolonged period, beginning and ending we know not
          when, elapsed before the surface became cooled and hardened and
          capable of sustaining organized existences. The water which now
          enwraps a large portion of the face of the globe, must for ages have
          existed only in the shape of steam, floating above and enveloping the
          planet in one thick curtain of mist. When the cooling of the surface
          allowed it to condense and descend, then commenced the process by
          which the lowest stratified rocks were formed, and gradually spread
          out in vast layers. Rains and rivers now acted upon the scoriaceous
          integument, grinding it to sand and carrying it down to the depths and
          cavities. Whether organized beings co-existed with this state of
          things we know not, as the early rocks have been acted upon by
          interior heat to an extent which must have destroyed all traces of
          animal and vegetable life, if any such ever existed. This period has
          been named by geologists the Azoic, or that in which life was not. Its
          duration no one presumes to define.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in the system of beds which overlies these primitive formations
          that the first records of organisms present themselves. In the
          so-called Silurian system we have a vast assemblage of strata of
          various kinds, together many thousands of feet thick, and abounding in
          remains of animal life. These strata were deposited at the bottom of
          the sea, and the remains are exclusively marine. The creatures whose
          exaviæ have been preserved belong to those classes which are placed by
          naturalists the lowest with respect to organization, the mollusca,
          articulata, and radiata. Analogous beings exist at the present day,
          but not their lineal descendants, unless time can effect transmutation
          of species, an hypothesis not generally accepted by naturalists. In
          the same strata with these inhabitants habitants of the early seas are
          found remains of fucoid or seaweed-like plants, the lowest of the
          vegetable tribe, which may have been the first of this kind of
          existences introduced into the world. But, as little has yet been
          discovered to throw light upon the state of the dry land and its
          productions at this remote period, nothing can be asserted positively
          on the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the upper strata of the Silurian system is found the commencement
          of the race of fishes, the lowest creatures of the vertebrate type,
          and in the succeeding beds they become abundant. These monsters
          clothed in mail who must have been the terror of the seas they
          inhabited, have left their indestructible coats behind them as
          evidence of their existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next come the carboniferous strata, containing the remains of a
          gigantic and luxuriant vegetation, and here reptiles and insects begin
          to make their appearance. At this point geologists make a kind of
          artificial break, and for the sake of distinction, denominate the
          whole of the foregoing period of animated existences the Palæozoic, or
          that of antique life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next great geological section, the so-called Secondary period,
          in which are comprised the oolitic and cretaceous systems, the
          predominant creatures are different from those which figured
          conspicuously in the preceding. The land was inhabited by gigantic
          animals, half-toad, half-lizard, who hopped about, leaving often their
          foot-prints like those of a clumsy human hand, upon the sandy shores
          of the seas they frequented. The waters now abounded with monsters,
          half-fish, half-crocodile, the well-known saurians, whose bones have
          been collected in abundance. Even the air had its tenantry from the
          same family type, for the pterodactyls were creatures, half-lizard,
          half-vampyre, provided with membranous appendages which must have
          enabled them to fly. In early stage of this period traces of birds
          appear, and somewhat later those of mammals, but of the lowest class
          belonging to that division, namely, the marsupial or pouch-bearing
          animals, in which naturalists see affinities to the oviparous tribes.
          The vegetation of this period seems to have consisted principally of
          the lower classes of plants, according to the scale of organization
          accepted by botanists, but it was luxuriant and gigantic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, comes the Tertiary period, in which mammalia of the highest
          forms enter upon the scene, while the composite growths of the
          Secondary period in great part disappear, and the types of creatures
          approach more nearly to those which now exist. During long ages this
          state of things continued, while the earth was the abode principally
          of mastodons, elephants, rhinoceroses, and their thick-hided
          congeners, many of them of colossal proportions, and of species which
          have now passed away. The remains of these creatures have been found
          in the frozen rivers of the north, and they appear to have roamed over
          regions of the globe where their more delicate representatives of the
          present day would be unable to live. During this era the ox, horse,
          and deer, and perhaps other animals, destined to be serviceable to
          man, became inhabitants of the earth. Lastly, the advent of man may be
          considered as inaugurating a new and distinct epoch, that in which we
          now are, and during the whole of which the physical conditions of
          existence cannot have been very materially different from what they
          are now. Thus, the reduction of the earth into the state in which we
          now behold it has been the slowly continued work of ages. The races of
          organic beings which have populated its surface have from time to time
          passed away, and been supplanted by others, introduced we know not
          certainly by what means, but evidently according to a fixed method and
          order, and with a gradually increasing complexity and fineness of
          organization, until we come to man as the crowning point of all.
          Geologically speaking, the history of his first appearance is obscure,
          nor does archæology do much to clear this obscurity. Science has,
          however, made some efforts towards tracing man to his cradle, and by
          patient observation and collection of facts much more may perhaps be
          done in this direction. As for history and tradition, they afford
          little upon which anything can be built. The human race, like each
          individual man, has forgotten its own birth, and the void of its early
          years has been filled up by imagination, and not from genuine
          recollection. Thus much is clear, that man's existence on earth is
          brief, compared with the ages during which unreasoning creatures were
          the sole possessors of the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pass to the account of the creation contained in the Hebrew record.
          And it must be observed that in reality two distinct accounts are
          given us in the book of Genesis, one being comprised in the first
          chapter and the first three verses of the second, the other commencing
          at the fourth verse of the second chapter and continuing till the end.
          This is so philologically certain that it were useless to ignore it.
          But even those who may be inclined to contest the fact that we have
          here the productions of two different writers, will admit that the
          account beginning at the first verse of the first chapter, and ending
          at the third verse of the second, is a complete whole in itself. And
          to this narrative, in order not to complicate the subject
          unnecessarily, we intend to confine ourselves. It will sufficient for
          our purpose to enquire, whether this account can be shown to be in
          accordance with our astronomical and geological knowledge. And for the
          right understanding of it the whole must be set out, so that the
          various parts may be taken in connexion with one another.
        </p>

          We are told that in the beginning God created the heaven and the
          earth.' It has been matter of discussion amongst theologians whether
          the word created' (Heb. bara) here means simply shaped or formed, or
          shaped or formed out of nothing. From the use of the verb bara in
          other passages, it appears that it does not necessarily mean to make
          out of nothing, but it certainly might impliedly mean this in a case
          so peculiar as the present. The phrase the heaven and the earth,' is
          evidently used to signify the universe of things, inasmuch as the
          heaven in its proper signification has no existence until the second
          day. It is asserted then that God shaped the whole material universe,
          whether out of nothing, or out of pre-existing matter. But which sense
          the writer really intended is not material for our present purpose to
          enquire, since neither astronomical nor geological science affects to
          state anything concerning the first origin of matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second verse the earliest state of things is described;
          according to the received translation, the earth was without form and
          void.' The prophet Jeremiah uses the same expression to describe the
          desolation of the earth's surface occasioned by God's wrath, and
          perhaps the words empty and waste' would convey to us at present
          something more nearly approaching the meaning of tohu va-bohu, than
          those which the translators have used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earth itself is supposed to be submerged under the waters of the
          deep, over which the breath of God -- the air or wind -- flutters
          while all is involved in darkness. The first special creative command
          is that which bids the light appear, whereupon daylight breaks over
          the two primæval elements of earth and water -- the one lying still
          enveloped by the other; and the space of time occupied by the original
          darkness and the light which succeeded, is described as the first day.
          Thus light and the measurement of time are represented as existing
          before the manifestation of the sun, and this idea, although repugnant
          to our modern knowledge, has not in former times appeared absurd. Thus
          we find Ambrose (Hexaemeron lib.4, cap.3) remarking: -- We must
          recollect that the light of day is one thing, the light of the sun,
          moon, and stars another, -- the sun by his rays appearing to add
          lustre to the daylight. For before sunrise the day dawns, but is not
          in full refulgence, for the midday sun adds still further to its
          splendour.' We quote this passage to show how a mind unsophisticated
          by astronomical knowledge understood the Mosaic statement; and we may
          boldly affirm that those for whom it was first penned could have taken
          it in no other sense than that light existed before and independently
          of the sun, nor do we misrepresent it when we affirm this to be its
          natural and primary meaning. How far we are entitled to give to the
          writer's words an enigmatical and secondary meaning, as contended by
          those who attempt to conciliate them with our present knowledge, must
          be considered further on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work of the second day of creation is to erect the vault of Heaven
          (Heb. rakia; Gr. stereoma; Lat. firmamentum) which is represented as
          supporting an ocean of water above it. The waters are said to be
          divided, so that some are below, some above the vault. That the
          Hebrews understood the sky, firmament, or heaven to be a permanent
          solid vault, as it appears to the ordinary observer, is evident enough
          from various expressions made use of concerning it. It is said to have
          pillars (Job xxvi.1), foundations (2 Sam. xxii.8), doors (Ps.
          lxxviii.23), and windows (Gen. vii.1). No quibbling about the
          derivation of the word rakia, which is literally something beaten out,
          can affect the explicit description of the Mosaic writer, contained in
          the words the waters that are above the firmament,' or avail to show
          that he was aware that the sky is but transparent space.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the third day, at the command of God, the waters which have
          hitherto concealed the earth are gathered together in one place -- the
          sea, -- and the dry land emerges. Upon the same day the earth brings
          forth grass, herb yielding seed and fruit trees, the destined food of
          the animals and of man (v.29). Nothing is said of herbs and trees
          which are not serviceable to this purpose, and perhaps it may be
          contended, since there is no vegetable production which may not
          possibly be useful to man, or which is not preyed upon by some animal,
          that in this description the whole terrestrial flora is implied. We
          wish, however, to call the attention of the reader to the fact, that
          trees and plants destined for food are those which are particularly
          singled out here as the earliest productions of the earth, as we shall
          have occasion to refer to this again presently.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the fourth day, the two great lights, the sun and moon, are made
          (Heb. hasah) and set in the firmament of heaven to give light to the
          earth, but more particularly to serve as the means of measuring time,
          and of marking out years, days, and seasons. This is the most
          prominent office assigned to them (v.14-18). The formation of the
          stars is mentioned in the most cursory manner. It is not said out of
          what materials all these bodies were made, and whether the writer
          regarded them as already existing, and only waiting to have a proper
          place assigned them, may be open to question. At any rate, their
          allotted receptacle -- the firmament -- was not made until the second
          day, nor were they set in it until the fourth; vegetation, be it
          observed, having already commenced on the third, and therefore
          independently of the warming influence of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the fifth day the waters are called into productive activity, and
          bring forth fishes and marine animals, as also the birds of the air.
          It is also said that God created or formed (bara) great whales and
          other creatures of the water and air. On the sixth day the earth
          brings forth living creatures, cattle, and reptiles, and also the
          beast of the field,' that is, the wild beasts. And here also it is
          added that God made (hasah) these creatures after their several kinds.
          The formation of man is distinguished by a variation of the creative
          fiat. Let us make man in our image after our likeness.' Accordingly,
          man is made and formed (bara) in the image and likeness of God, a
          phrase which has been explained away to mean merely perfect, sinless,'
          although the Pentateuch abounds in passages showing that the Hebrews
          contemplated the Divine being in the visible form of a man. Modern
          spiritualism has so entirely banished this idea, that probably many
          may not without an effort be able to accept the plain language of the
          Hebrew writer in its obvious sense in the 26th verse of the 1st
          chapter of Genesis, though they will have no difficulty in doing so in
          the (3rd verse of the 5th chapter, where the same words image' and
          likeness' are used. Man is said to have been created male and female,
          and the narrative contains nothing to show that a single pair only is
          intended. He is commanded to increase and multiply, and to assume
          dominion over all the other tribes of beings. The whole of the works
          of creation being complete, God gives to man, beast, fowl, and
          creeping thing, the vegetable productions of the earth as their
          appointed food. And when we compare the verses Gen. i.29, 30, with
          Gen. ix.3, in which, after the Flood, animals are given to man for
          food in addition to the green herb, it is difficult not to come to the
          conclusion that in the earliest view taken of creation, men and
          animals were supposed to have been, in their original condition, not
          carnivorous. It is needless to say that this has been for the most
          part the construction put upon the words of the Mosaic writer, until a
          clear perception of the creative design which destined the tiger and
          lion for flesh-eaters, and latterly the geological proof of
          flesh-eating, monsters having existed among the pre-adamite
          inhabitants of the globe, rendered it necessary to ignore this
          meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd verses of the second chapter of Genesis, which
          have been most absurdly divided from their context, conclude the
          narrative. On the seventh day God rests from His work, and blesses the
          day of rest, a fact which is referred to in the Commandment given from
          Sinai as the ground of the observance of Sabbatic rest imposed upon
          the Hebrews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remarkable as this narrative is for simple grandeur, it has nothing in
          it which can be properly called poetical. It bears on its face no
          trace of mystical or symbolical meaning. Things are called by their
          right names with a certain scientific exactness widely different from
          the imaginative cosmogonies of the Greeks, in which the powers and
          phenomena of nature are invested with personality, and the passions
          and qualities of men are represented as individual existences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The circumstances related in the second narrative of creation are
          indeed such as to give at least some ground for the supposition that a
          mystical interpretation was intended to be given to it. But this is
          far from being the case with the first narrative, in which none but a
          professed mystifier of the school of Philo could see anything but a
          plain statement of facts. There can be little reasonable dispute then
          as to the sense in which the Mosaic narrative was taken by those who
          first heard it, nor is it indeed disputed that for centuries, putting
          apart the Philonic mysticism, which after all did not exclude a
          primary sense, its words have been received in their genuine and
          natural meaning. That this meaning is primâ facie one wholly adverse
          to the present astronomical and geological views of the universe is
          evident enough. There is not a mere difference through deficiency. It
          cannot be correctly said that the Mosaic writer simply leaves out
          details which modern science supplies, and that, therefore, the
          inconsistency is not a real but only an apparent one. It is manifest
          that the whole account is given from a different point of view from
          that which we now unavoidably take; that the order of things as we now
          know them to be, is to a great extent reversed, although here and
          there we may pick out some general analogies and points of
          resemblance. Can we say that the Ptolemaic system of astronomy is not
          at variance with modern science, because it represents with a certain
          degree of correctness some of the apparent motions of the heavenly
          bodies?
        </p>
        <p>
          The task which sundry modern writers have imposed upon themselves is
          to prove, that the Mosaic narrative, however apparently at variance
          with our knowledge, is essentially, and in fact true, although never
          understood properly until modern science supplied the necessary
          commentary and explanation.

          Two modes of conciliation have been propounded which have enjoyed
          considerable popularity, and to these two we shall confine our
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is that originally brought into vogue by Chalmers and
          adopted by the late Dr. Buckland in his Bridgewater Treatise, and
          which is probably still received by many as a sufficient solution of
          all difficulties. Dr. Buckland's treatment of the case may be taken as
          a fair specimen of the line of argument adopted, and it shall be given
          in his own words. The word beginning,' he says, as applied by Moses in
          the first verse of the book of Genesis, expresses an undefined period
          of time which was antecedent to the last great change that affected
          the surface of the earth, and to the creation of its present animal
          and vegetable inhabitants, during which period a long series of
          operations may have been going on; which as they are wholly
          unconnected with the history of the human race, are passed over in
          silence by the sacred historian, whose only concern was barely to
          state, that the matter of the universe is not eternal and
          self-existent, but was originally created by the power of the
          Almighty.' The Mosaic narrative commences with a declaration that in
          the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.' These few first
          words of Genesis may be fairly appealed to by the geologist as
          containing a brief statement of the creation of the material elements,
          at a time distinctly preceding the operations of the first day; it is
          nowhere affirmed that God created the heaven and the earth in the
          first day, but in the beginning; this beginning may have been an epoch
          at an unmeasured distance, followed by periods of undefined duration
          during which all the physical operations disclosed by geology were
          going on.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The first verse of Genesis, therefore, seems explicitly to assert the
          creation of the universe; the heaven, including the sidereal systems;
          and the earth, especially specifying our own planet, as the subsequent
          scene of the operations of the six days about to be described; no
          information is given as to events which may have occurred upon this
          earth, unconnected with the history of man, between the creation of
          its component matter recorded in the first verse, and the era at which
          its history is resumed in the second verse: nor is any limit fixed to
          the time during which these intermediate events may have been going
          on: millions of millions of years may have occupied the indefinite
          interval, between the beginning in which God created the heaven and
          the earth, and the evening or commencement of the first day of the
          Mosaic narrative.'
        </p>
        <p>
          ' The second verse may describe the condition of the earth on the
          evening of this first day (for in the Jewish mode of computation used
          by Moses each day is reckoned from the beginning of one evening to the
          beginning of another evening). This first evening may be considered as
          the termination of the indefinite time which followed the primeval
          creation announced in the first verse, and as the commencement of the
          first of the six succeeding days in which the earth was to be filled
          up, and peopled in a manner fit for the reception of mankind. We have
          in this second verse, a distinct mention of earth and waters, as
          already existing and involved in darkness; their condition also is
          described as a state of confusion and emptiness (tohu bohu), words
          which are usually interpreted by the vague and indefinite Greek term
          chaos, and which may be geologically considered as designating the
          wreck and ruins of a former world. At this intermediate point of time
          the preceding undefined geological periods had terminated, a new
          series of events commenced, and the work of the first morning of this
          new creation was the calling forth of light from a temporary darkness,
          which had overspread the ruins of the ancient earth.'
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to the formation of the sun and moon, Dr. Buckland
          observes, p.27, We are not told that the substance of the sun and moon
          was first called into existence on the fourth day; the text may
          equally imply that these bodies were then prepared and appointed to
          certain offices, of high importance to mankind, to give light upon the
          earth, and to rule over the day, and over the night, to be for signs,
          and for seasons, and for days, and for years.' The fact of their
          creation had been stated before in the first verse.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of the meaning of the word bara, create, has been
          previously touched upon; it has been acknowledged by good critics that
          it does not of itself necessarily imply to make out of nothing,' upon
          the simple ground that it is found used in cases where such a meaning
          would be inapplicable. But the difficulty of giving to it the
          interpretation contended for by Dr. Buckland, and of uniting with this
          the assumption of a six days' creation, such as that described in
          Genesis, at a comparatively recent period, lies in this, that the
          heaven itself is distinctly said to have been formed by the division
          of the waters on the second day. Consequently during the indefinite
          ages which elapsed from the primal creation of matter until the first
          Mosaic day of creation, there was no sky, no local habitation for the
          sun, moon, and stars, even supposing those bodies to have been
          included in the original material. Dr. Buckland does not touch this
          obvious difficulty, without which his argument that the sun and moon
          might have been contemplated as pre-existing, although they are not
          stated to have been set in the heaven until the fourth day, is of no
          value at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Buckland appears to assume that when it is said that the heaven
          and the earth were created in the beginning, it is to be understood
          that they were created in their present form and state of
          completeness, the heaven raised above the earth as we see it, or seem
          to see it now. This is the fallacy of his argument. The circumstantial
          description of the framing of the heaven out of the waters, proves
          that the words heaven and earth,' in the first verse, must be taken
          either proleptically, as a general expression for the universe, the
          matter of the universe in its crude and unformed shape, or else the
          word bara must mean formed, not created, the writer intending to say
          God formed the heaven and earth in manner following,' in which case
          heaven is used in its distinct and proper sense. But these two senses
          cannot be united in the manner covertly assumed in Dr Buckland's
          argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having, however, thus endeavoured to make out that the Mosaic account
          does not negative the idea that the sun, moon, and stars had been
          created at the indefinitely distant time designated by the word
          beginning,' he is reduced to describe the primæval darkness of the
          first day as a temporary darkness, produced by an accumulation of
          dense vapours upon the face of the deep.' An incipient dispersion of
          these vapours may have readmitted light to the earth, upon the first
          day, whilst the exciting cause of light was obscured, and the further
          purification of the atmosphere upon the fourth day, may have caused
          the sun and moon and stars to re-appear in the firmament of heaven, to
          assume their new relations to the newly modified earth and to the
          human race.'
        </p>
        <p>
          It is needless to discuss the scientific probability of this
          hypothesis, but the violence done to the grand and simple words of the
          Hebrew writer must strike every mind. And God said, Let there be light
          -- and there was light -- and God saw the light that it was good. And
          God divided the light from the darkness, and God called the light day,
          and the darkness called he night; and the evening and the morning were
          the first day.' Can any one sensible the value of words suppose, that
          nothing more is here described, or intended to be described, than the
          partial clearing away of a fog? Can such a manifestation of light have
          been dignified by the appellation of day? Is not this reducing the
          noble description which has been the admiration of ages to a pitiful
          caput mortuum of empty verbiage?
        </p>
        <p>
          What were the new relations which the heavenly bodies according to Dr.
          Buckland's view, assumed to the newly modified earth and to the human
          race? They had, as we well know, marked out seasons, days and years,
          and had given light for ages before to the earth, and to the animals
          which preceded man as its inhabitants, as is shown, Dr. Buckland
          admits, by the eyes of fossil animals, optical instruments of the same
          construction as those of the animals of our days, and also by the
          existence of vegetables in the early world, to the development of
          which light must have been as essential then as now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypothesis adopted by Dr. Buckland was first promulgated at a time
          when the gradual and regular formation of the earth's strata was not
          seen or admitted so clearly as it is now. Geologists were more
          disposed to believe in great catastrophes and sudden breaks.
          Buckland's theory supposes that previous to the appearance of the
          present races of animals and vegetables there was a great gap in the
          globe's history, -- that the earth was completely depopulated, as well
          of marine as land animals; and that the creation of all existing
          plants and animals was coæval with that of man. This theory is by no
          means supported by geological phenomena, and is, we suppose, now
          rejected by all geologists whose authority is valuable. Thus writes
          Hugh Miller in 1857 -- I certainly did once believe with Chalmers and
          with Buckland that the six days were simply natural days of
          twenty-four hours each -- that they had comprised the entire work of
          the existing creation -- and that the latest of the geologic ages was
          separated by a great chaotic gap from our own.My labours at the time
          as a practical geologist had been very much restricted to the
          palæozoic and secondary rocks, more especially to the old red and
          carboniferous systems of the one division, and the oolitic system of
          the other; and the long-extinct organisms organisms which I found in
          them certainly did not conflict with the view of Chalmers. All I found
          necessary at the time to the work of reconciliation was some scheme
          that would permit me to assign to the earth a high antiquity, and to
          regard it as the scene of many succeeding creations. During the last
          nine years, however, I have spent a few weeks every autumn in
          exploring the late formations, and acquainting myself with their
          particular organisms. I have traced them upwards from the raised
          beaches and old coast lines of the human period, to the brick clays,
          Clyde beds, and drift and boulder deposits of the Pleistocene era; and
          again from them, with the help of museums and collections, up through
          the mammaliferous crag of England to its red and coral crags; and the
          conclusion at which I have been compelled to arrive is, that for many
          long ages ere man was ushered into being, not a few of his humbler
          contemporaries of the fields and woods enjoyed life in their present
          haunts, and that for thousands of years anterior to even their
          appearance, many of the existing molluscs lived in our seas. That day
          during which the present creation came into being, and in which God,
          when he had made the beast of the earth after his kind, and the cattle
          after their kind,' at length terminated the work by moulding a
          creature in His own image, to whom He gave dominion over them all, was
          not a brief period of a few hours' duration, but extended over,
          mayhap, millenniums of centuries. No blank chaotic gap of death and
          darkness separated the creation to which man belongs from that of the
          old extinct elephant, hippopotamus, and hyæna; for familiar animals,
          such as the red deer, the roe, the fox, the wild cat, and the badger,
          lived throughout the period which connected their time with our own;
          and so I have been compelled to hold that the days of creation were
          not natural but prophetic days, and stretched far back into the bygone
          eternity.'

          Hugh Miller will be admitted by many as a competent witness to the
          untenability of the theory of Chalmers and Buckland on mere geological
          grounds. He had, indeed, a theory of his own to propose, which we
          shall presently consider; but we may take his word that it was not
          without the compulsion of what he considered irresistible evidence
          that he relinquished a view which would have saved him infinite time
          and labour, could he have adhered to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But whether contemplated from a geological point of view, or whether
          from a philological one, that is, with reference to the value of
          words, the use of language, and the ordinary rules which govern
          writers whose object it is to make themselves understood by those to
          whom their works are immediately addressed, the interpretation
          proposed by Buckland to be given to the Mosaic description will not
          bear a moment's serious discussion. It is plain, from the whole tenor
          of the narrative, that the writer contemplated no such representation
          as that suggested, nor could any such idea have entered into the minds
          of those to whom the account was first given. Dr. Buckland endeavours
          to make out that we have here simply a case of leaving out facts which
          did not particularly concern the writer's purpose, so that he gave an
          account true so far as it went, though imperfect. We may fairly ask,'
          he argues, of those persons who consider physical science a fit
          subject for revelation, what point they can imagine short of a
          communication of Omniscience at which such a revelation might have
          stopped without imperfections of omission, less in degree, but similar
          in kind, to that which they impute to the existing narrative of Moses?
          A revelation of so much only of astronomy as was known to Copernicus
          would have seemed imperfect after the discoveries of Newton; and a
          revelation of the science of Newton would have appeared defective to
          La Place: a revelation of all the chemical knowledge of the eighteenth
          century would have been as deficient in comparison with the
          information of the present day, as what is now known in this science
          will probably appear before the termination of another age; in the
          whole circle of sciences there is not one to which this argument may
          not be extended, until we should require from revelation a full
          development of all the mysterious agencies that uphold the mechanism
          of the material world.' Buckland's question is quite inapplicable to
          the real difficulty, which is, not that circumstantial details are
          omitted -- that might reasonably be expected -- but that what is told,
          is told so as to convey to ordinary apprehensions an impression at
          variance with facts. We are indeed told that certain writers of
          antiquity had already anticipated the hypothesis of the geologist, and
          two of the Christian fathers, Augustine and Episcopius, are referred
          to as having actually held that a wide interval elapsed between the
          first act of creation, mentioned in the Mosaic account, and the
          commencement of the six days' work. If, however, they arrived at such
          a conclusion, it was simply because, like the modern geologist, they
          had theories of their own to support, which led them to make somewhat
          similar hypotheses.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all,' says Buckland, it should be recollected that the question
          is not respecting the correctness of the Mosaic narrative, but of our
          interpretation of it,' proposition which can hardly be sufficiently
          reprobated. Such a doctrine, carried out unreservedly, strikes at the
          root of critical morality. It may, indeed, be sometimes possible to
          give two or three different interpretations to one and the same
          passage, even in a modern and familiar tongue, in which case this may
          arise from the unskilfulness of the writer or speaker who has failed
          clearly to express his thought. In a dead or foreign language the
          difficulty may arise from our own want of familiarity with its forms
          of speech, or in an ancient book we may be puzzled by allusions and
          modes of thought the key to which has been lost. But it is no part of
          the commentator's or interpreter's business to introduce obscurity or
          find difficulties where none exist, and it cannot be pretended that,
          taking it as a question of the use of words to express thoughts, there
          are any peculiar difficulties about understanding the first chapter of
          Genesis, whether in its original Hebrew or in our common translation,
          which represents the original with all necessary exactness. The
          difficulties arise for the first time, when we seek to import a
          meaning into the language which it certainly never could have conveyed
          to those to whom it was originally addressed. Unless we go the whole
          length of supposing the simple account of the Hebrew cosmogonist to be
          a series of awkward equivocations, in which he attempted to give a
          representation widely different from the facts, yet, without
          trespassing against literal truth, we can find no difficulty in
          interpreting his words. Although language may be, and often has been,
          used for the purpose, not of expressing, but concealing thought, no
          such charge can fairly be laid against the Hebrew writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be borne in mind,' says Dr. Buckland, that the object of the
          account was, not to state in what manner, but by whom the world was
          made.' Every one must see that this is an unfounded assertion,
          inasmuch as the greater part of the narrative consists in a minute and
          orderly description of the manner in which things were made. We can
          know nothing as to the object of the account, except from the account
          itself. What the writer meant to state is just that which he has
          stated, for all that we can know to the contrary. Or can we seriously
          beleive that if appealed to by one of his Hebrew hearers or readers as
          to his intention, he would have replied, My only object in what I have
          written is to inform you that God made the world; as to the manner of
          His doing it, of which I have given so exact an account, I have no
          intention that my words should be taken in their literal meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          We come then to this, that if we sift the Mosaic narrative of all
          definite meaning, and only allow it to be the expression of the most
          vague generalities, if we avow that it admits of no certain
          interpretation, of none that may not be shifted and altered as often
          as we see fit, and as the exigencies of geology may require, then may
          we reconcile it with what science teaches. This mode of dealing with
          the subject has been broadly advocated by a recent writer of
          mathematical eminence, who adopts the Bucklandian hypothesis, a
          passage from whose work we shall quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mosaic account of the six days' work is thus harmonized by some.
          On the first day, while the earth was without form and void,' the
          result of a previous convulsion in nature, and darkness was upon the
          face of the deep,' God commanded light to shine upon the earth. This
          may have been effected by such a clearing of the thick and loaded
          atmosphere, as to allow the light of the sun to penetrate its mass
          with a suffused illumination, sufficient to dispel the total darkness
          which had prevailed, but proceeding from a source not yet apparent on
          the earth. On the second day a separation took place in the thick
          vapoury mass which lay upon the earth, dense clouds were gathered up
          aloft and separated by an expanse from the waters and vapours below.
          On the third day these lower vapours, or fogs and mists which hitherto
          concealed the earth, were condensed and gathered with the other waters
          of the earth into seas, and the dry land appeared. Then grass and
          herbs began to grow. On the fourth day the clouds and vapours so
          rolled into separate masses, or were so entirely absorbed into the air
          itself, that the sun shone forth in all its brilliancy, the visible
          source of light and heat to the renovated earth, while the moon and
          stars gave light by night, and God appointed them henceforth for
          signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years, to his creatures
          whom he was about to call into existence, as he afterwards set or
          appointed his bow in the clouds, which had appeared ages before, to be
          a sign to Noah and his descendants. The fifth and sixth days' work
          needs no comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this explanation, the first chapter of Genesis does not
          pretend (as has been generally assumed) to be a cosmogony, or an
          account of the original creation of the material universe. The only
          cosmogony which it contains, in that sense at least, is confined to
          the sublime declaration of the first verse, In the beginning God
          created the heavens and the earth.' The inspired record thus stepping
          over an interval of indefinite ages with which man has no direct
          concern, proceeds at once to narrate the events preparatory to the
          introduction of man on the scene; employing phraseology strictly
          faithful to the appear- ances which would have met the eye of man,
          could, he have been a spectator on the earth of what passed during
          those six days. All this has been commonly supposed to be a more
          detailed account of the general truth announced in the first verse, in
          short, a cosmogony: such was the idea of Josephus; such probably was
          the idea of our translators; for their version, without form and void,
          points to the primæval chaos, out of which all things were then
          supposed to emerge; and these words standing in limine, have tended,
          perhaps more than anything else, to foster the idea of a cosmogony in
          the minds of general readers to this very day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The foregoing explanation many have now adopted. It is sufficient for
          my purpose, if it be a possible explanation, and if it meet the
          difficulties of the case. That it is possible in itself, is plain from
          the fact above established, that the Scriptures wisely speak on
          natural things according to their appearances rather than their
          physical realities. It meets the difficulties of the case, because all
          the difficulties hitherto started against this chapter on scientific
          grounds proceeded on the principle that it is a cosmogony; which this
          explanation repudiates, and thus disposes of the difficulties. It is
          therefore an explanation satisfactory to my own mind. I may be tempted
          to regret that I eau gain no certain scientific information from
          Genesis regarding the process of the original creation; but I resist
          the temptation, remembering the great object for which the Scripture
          was given -- to tell man of his origin and fall, and to draw his mind
          to his Creator and Redeemer. Scripture was not designed to teach us
          natural philosophy, and it is vain to attempt to make a cosmogony out
          of its statements. The Almighty declares himself the originator of all
          things, but he condescends not to describe the process or the laws by
          which he worked. All this he leaves for reason to decipher from the
          phenomena which his world displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exploration, however, I do not wish to impose on Scripture; and
          am fully prepared to surrender it, should further scientific discovery
          suggest another better fitted to meet all the requirements of the
          case.'
        </p>
        <p>
          We venture to think that the world at large will continue to consider
          the account in the first chapter of Genesis to be a cosmogony. But as
          it is here admitted that it does not describe physical realities, but
          only outward appearances, that is, gives a description false in fact,
          and one which can teach us no scientific truth whatever, it seems to
          matter little what we call it. If its description of the events of the
          six days which it comprises be merely one of appearances and not of
          realities, it can teach us nothing regarding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dissatisfied with the scheme of conciliation which has been discussed,
          other geologists have proposed to give an entirely mythical or
          enigmatical sense to the Mosaic narrative, and to consider the
          creative days described as vast periods of time. This plan was long
          ago suggested, but it has of late enjoyed a high degree of popularity,
          through the advocacy of the Scotch geologist Hugh Miller, an extract
          from whose work has been already quoted. Dr. Buckland gives the
          following account of the first form in which this theory was
          propounded, and of the grounds upon which he rejected it in favour of
          that of Chalmers: --
        </p>
        <p>
          A third opinion has been suggested both by learned theologians and by
          geologists, and on grounds independent of one another -- viz., that
          the days of the Mosaic creation need not be understood to imply the
          same length of time which is now occupied by a single revolution of
          the globe, but successive periods each of great extent; and it has
          been asserted that the order of succession of the organic remains of a
          former world accords with the order of creation recorded in Genesis.
          This assertion, though to a certain degree apparently correct, is not
          entirely supported by geological facts, since it appears that the most
          ancient marine animals occur in the same division of the lowest
          transition strata with the earliest remains of vegetables, so that the
          evidence of organic remains, as far as it goes, shows the origin of
          plants and animals to have been contemporaneous: if any creation of
          vegetables preceded that of animals, no evidence of such an event has
          yet been discovered by the researches of geology. Still there is, I
          believe, by no sound critical or theological objection to the
          interpretation of the word day' as meaning a long period.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Archdeacon Pratt also summarily rejects this view as untenable: --
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one other class of interpreters, however, with whom I find it
          impossible to agree, -- I mean those who take the six days to be six
          periods of unknown indefinite length. This is the principle of
          interpretation in a work on the Creation and the Fall, by the Rev. D.
          Macdonald; also in Mr. Hugh Miller's posthumous work, the Testimony of
          the Rocks, and also in an admirable treatise on the Præ-Adamite Earth
          in Dr. Lardner's Museum of Science. In this last it is the more
          surprising because the successive chapters are in fact an accumulation
          of evidence which points the other way, as a writer in the Christian
          Observer, Jan.1858, has conclusively shown. The late M. D'Orbigny has
          demonstrated in his Prodrome de Palæontologie, after an elaborate
          examination of vast multitudes of fossils, that there have been at
          least twenty-nine distinct periods of animal and vegetable existence
          -- that is, twenty nine creations separated one from another by
          catastrophes which have swept away the species existing at the time,
          with a very few solitary exceptions, never exceeding one and a-half
          per cent, of the whole number discovered which have either survived
          the catastrophe, or have been erroneously designated. But not a single
          species of the preceding period survived the last of these
          catastrophes, and this closed the Tertiary period and ushered in the
          Human period. The evidence adduced by M. D'Orbigny shows that both
          plants and animals appeared in every one of those twenty-nine periods.
          The notion, therefore, that the days' of Genesis represent periods of
          creation from the beginning of things is at once refuted. The parallel
          is destroyed both in the number of the periods (thirty, including the
          Azoic, instead of six), and also in the character of the things
          created. No argument could be more complete; and yet the writer of the
          Præ-Admite Earth, in the last two pages, sums up his lucid sketch of
          M. D'Orbigny's researches by referring the account in the first
          chapter of Genesis to the whole creation from the beginning of all
          things, a selection of epochs being made, as he imagines, for the six
          days or periods.'
        </p>
        <p>
          In this trenchant manner do theological geologists overthrow one
          another's theories. However, Hugh Miller was perfectly aware of the
          difficulty involved in his view of the question, and we shall
          endeavour to show the reader the manner in which he deals with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He begins by pointing out that the families of vegetables and animals
          were introduced upon earth as nearly as possible according to the
          great classes in which naturalists have arranged the modern flora and
          fauna. According to the arrangement of Lindley, he observes --
          Commencing at the bottom of the scale we find the thallogens, or
          flowerless plants, which lack proper stems and leaves -- a class which
          includes all the algæ. Next succeed the acrogens, or flowerless plants
          that possess both stems and leaves -- such as the ferns and their
          allies. Next, omitting an inconspicuous class, represented by but a
          few parasitical plants incapable of preservation as fossils, come the
          endogens -- monocotyledonous flowering plants, that include the palms,
          the liliaceæ, and several other families, all characterised by the
          parallel venation of their leaves. Next, omitting another
          inconspicuous tribe, there follows a very important class, the
          gymnogens -- polycotyledonous trees, represented by the comferæ and
          cycadaceæ. And last of all come the dicotyledonous exogens -- a class
          to which all our fruit and what are known as our forest trees belong,
          with a vastly preponderating majority of the herbs and flowers that
          impart fertility and beauty to our gardens and meadows.' The order in
          which fossils of these several classes appear in the strata, Hugh
          Miller states to be as follows: -- In the Lower Silurian we find only
          thallogens, in the Upper Silurian acrogens are added. The gymnogens
          appear rather prematurely, it might be thought, in the old red
          sandstone, the endogens (monocotyledonous) coming after them in the
          carboniferous group. Dicotyledonous exogens enter at the close of the
          oolitic period, and come to their greatest development in the
          tertiary. Again, the animal tribes have been introduced in an order
          closely agreeing with the geological divisions established by Cuvier.
          In the Silurian beds the invertebrate creatures, the radiata,
          articulata, and mollusca, appear simultaneously. At the close of the
          period, fishes, the lowest of the vertebrata, appear: before the old
          red sandstone period had passed away, reptiles had come into
          existence; birds, and the marsupial mammals, enter in the oolitic
          period; placental mammals in the tertiary; and man last of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, these facts do certainly tally to some extent with the Mosaic
          account, which represents fish and fowl as having been produced from
          the waters on the fifth day, reptiles and mammals from the earth on
          the sixth, and man as made last of all. The agreement, however, is far
          from exact, as according to geological evidence, reptiles would appear
          to have existed ages ages before birds and mammals, whereas here the
          creation of birds is attributed to the fifth day, that of reptiles to
          the sixth. There remains, moreover, the insuperable difficulty of the
          plants and trees being represented as made on the third day -- that
          is, more than an ago before fishes and birds; which is clearly not the
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, therefore, there is a superficial resemblance in the Mosaic
          account to that of the geologists, it is evident that the bare theory
          that a day' means an age or immense geological period might be made to
          yield some rather strange results. What becomes of the evening and
          morning of which each day is said to have consisted? Was each geologic
          age divided into two long intervals, one all darkness, the other all
          light? and if so, what became of the plants and trees created in the
          third day or period, when the evening of the fourth day (the evenings,
          be it observed, precede the mornings) set in? They must have passed
          through half a seculum of total darkness, not even cheered by that dim
          light which the sun, not yet completely manifested, supplied on the
          morning of the third day. Such an ordeal would have completely
          destroyed the whole vegetable creation, and yet we find that it
          survived, and was appointed on the sixth day as the food of man and
          animals. In fact, we need only substitute the word period' for day' in
          the Mosaic narrative to make it very apparent that the writer at least
          had no such meaning, nor could he have conveyed any such meaning to
          those who first heard his account read.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been held,' says Hugh Miller, by accomplished philologists,
          that the days of Mosaic creation may be regarded without doing
          violence to the Hebrew language, as successive periods of great
          extent.' We do not believe that there is any ground for this doctrine.
          The word day' is certainly used occasionally in particular phrases, in
          an indefinite manner, not only in Hebrew, but other languages. As for
          instance, Gen. xxxix.11 -- About this time,' Heb. literally, about
          this day.' But every such phrase explains itself and not only
          philology but common sense disclaims the notion, that when day' is
          spoken of in terms like those in the first chapter of Genesis, and
          described as consisting of an evening and a morning, it can be
          understood to mean a seculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archdeacon Pratt, treating on the same subject, says (p, 41, note),
          Were there no other ground of objection to this mode of
          interpretation, I think the wording of the fourth commandment is
          clearly opposed to it. Ex. xx.8. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
          holy.9. Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work.10. But the
          seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou, shalt not
          do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor
          thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
          gates.11. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and
          all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord
          blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not a harsh and forced interpretation to suppose that the six
          days in v.9 do not mean the same as the six days in v.11, but that in
          this last place they mean six periods? In reading through the eleventh
          verse, it is extremely difficult to believe that the seventh day is a
          long period, and the sabbath day an ordinary day, that is, that the
          same word day should be used in two such totally different senses in
          the same short sentence and without any explanation.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Hugh Miller saw the difficulty; but he endeavours to escape the
          consequences of a rigorous application of the periodic theory by
          modifying it in a peculiar, and certainly ingenious manner. Waiving,'
          he says, the question as a philological one, and simply holding with
          Cuvier, Parkinson and Silliman, that each of the six days of the
          Mosaic account in the first chapter were what is assuredly meant by
          the day referred to in the second, not natural days but lengthened
          periods, I find myself called on, as a geologist, to account for but
          three out of the six. Of the period during which light was created, of
          the period during which it firmament was made to separate the waters
          from the waters, or of the period during which the two great lights of
          the earth, with the other heavenly bodies, became visible from the
          earth's surface -- we need expect to find no record in the rocks. Let
          me, however, pause for a moment, to remark the peculiar character of
          the language in which we are first introduced in the Mosaic narrative,
          to the heavenly bodies -- sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though
          absolutely one of the smallest lights of our system, is described as
          secondary and subordinate to only its greatest light, the sun. It is
          the apparent, then, not the actual, which we find in the passage --
          what seemed to be, not what was; and as it was merely what appeared to
          be greatest that was described as greatest, on what grounds are we to
          hold that it may not also have been what appeared at the time to be
          made that has been described as made? The sun, moon, and stars, may
          have been created long before, though it was not until this fourth day
          of creation that they became visible from the earth's surface.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory founded upon this hint is that the Hebrew writer did not
          state facts, but merely certain appearances, and those not of things
          which really happened, as assumed in the explanation adopted by
          Archdeacon Pratt, but of certain occurrences which were presented to
          him in a vision, and that this vision greatly deceived him as to what
          he seemed see; and thus, in effect, the real discrepancy of the
          narrative with facts is admitted. He had in all, seven visions, to
          each of which he attributed the duration of a day, although indeed
          each picture presented to him the earth during seven long and
          distinctly marked epochs. While on the one hand this supposition
          admits all desirable latitude for mistakes and misrepresentations,
          Hugh Miller, on the other hand, endeavours to show that a substantial
          agreement with the truth exists, and to give sufficient reason for the
          mistakes. We must let him speak for himself. The geologist, in his
          attempts to collate the Divine with the geologic record, has, I
          repeat, only three of the six periods of creation to account for --
          the period of plants, the period of great sea-monsters and creeping
          things, and the period of cattle and beasts of the earth. He is called
          on to question his systems and formations regarding the remains of
          these three great periods, and of them only. And the question once
          fairly stated, what, I ask, is the reply? All geologists agree in
          holding that the vast geological scale naturally divides into three
          great parts. There are many lesser divisions -- divisions into
          systems, formations, deposits, beds, strata; but the master divisions,
          in each of which we find a type of life so unlike that of the others,
          that even the unpractised eye can detect the difference, are simply
          three: the Palaeozoic, or oldest fossiliferous division; the
          secondary, or middle fossiliferous division; and the tertiary, or
          latest fossiliferous division. In the first, or palæozoic division, we
          find corals, crustaceans, molluscs, fishes; and in its later
          formations, a few reptiles. But none of these classes give its leading
          character to the palæozoic; they do not constitute its prominent
          feature, or render it more remarkable as a scene of life than any of
          the divisions which followed. That which chiefly distinguished the
          palæozoic from the secondary and tertiary periods was its gorgeous
          flora. It was emphatically the period of plants -- of herbs yielding
          seed after their kind.' In no other age did the world ever witness
          such a flora; the youth of the earth was peculiarly a green and
          umbrageous youth -- a youth of dusk and tangled forests, of huge pines
          and stately araucarians, of the reed-like calamite, the tall
          tree-fern, the sculptured sigillaria, and the hirsute lepidodendrons.
          Wherever dry land, or shallow lakes, or running stream appeared, from
          where Melville Island now spreads out its icy coast under the star of
          the pole, to where the arid plains of Australia lie solitary beneath
          the bright cross of the south, a rank and luxuriant herbage cumbered
          every foot-breadth of the dank and steaming soil; and even to distant
          planets our earth must have shone through the enveloping cloud with a
          green and delicate ray. . . . The geologic evidence is so complete as
          to be patent to all, that the first great period of organized being
          was, as described in the Mosaic record, peculiarly a period of herbs
          and trees yielding seed after their kind.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The middle great period of the geologist -- that of the secondary
          division -- possessed, like the earlier one, its herbs and plants, but
          they were of a greatly less luxuriant and conspicuous character than
          their predecessors, and no longer formed the prominent trait or
          feature of the creation to which they belonged. The period had also
          its corals, its crustaceans, molluscs, its fishes, and in some one or
          two exceptional instances, its dwarf mammals. But the grand existences
          of the age -- the existences in which it excelled every other
          creation, earlier or later -- were its enormous creeping things -- its
          enormous monsters of the deep, and, as shown by the impressions of
          their footprints stamped upon the rocks, its gigantic birds. It was
          peculiarly the age of egg-bearing animals, winged and wingless. Its
          wonderful whales, not however, as now, of the mammalian, but of the
          reptilian class, -- ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and cetosaurs, must
          have tempested the deep; its creeping lizards and crocodiles, such as
          the teliosaurns, megalosaurus, and iguanodon -- creatures, some of
          which more than rivalled the existing elephant in height, and greatly
          more than rivalled him in bulk -- must have crowded the plains, or
          haunted by myriads the rivers of the period; and we know that the
          foot-prints of at least one of its many birds are of fully twice the
          size of those made by the horse or camel. We are thus prepared to
          demonstrate, that the second period of the geologist was peculiarly
          and characteristically a period of whale-like reptiles of the sea, of
          enormous creeping reptiles of the land, and of numerous birds, some of
          them of gigantic size; and in meet accordance with the fact, we find
          that the second Mosaic period with which the geologist is called on to
          deal, was a period in which God created the fowl that flieth above the
          earth, with moving (or creeping) creatures, both in the waters and on
          land, and what our translation renders great whales, but that I find
          rendered in the margin great sea-monsters. The tertiary period had
          also its prominent class of existences. Its flora seems to have been
          no more conspicuous than that of the present time; its reptiles occupy
          a very subordinate place; but its beasts of the field were by far the
          most wonderfully developed, both in size and numbers, that ever
          appeared on earth. Its mammoths and its mastodons, its rhinoceri and
          its hippopotami, its enormous dinotherium, and colossal megatherium,
          greatly more than equalled in bulk the hugest mammals of the present
          time, and vastly exceeded them in number * * * Grand, indeed,' says an
          English naturalist, was the fauna of the British Islands in these
          early days. Tigers as large again as the biggest Asiatic species
          lurked in the ancient thickets; elephants a nearly twice the bulk of
          the largest individuals that now exist in Africa or Ceylon roamed in
          herds; at least two species of rhinoceros forced their way through the
          primæval forest; and the lakes and rivers were tenanted by hippopotami
          as bulky and with as great tusks as those of Africa.' The massive
          cave-bear and large cave-hyæna belonged to the same formidable group,
          with at least two species of great oxen (Bos longifrons and Bos
          primigenius), with a horse of smaller size, and an elk (Megaceros
          Hibernicus) that stood ten feet four inches in height. Truly this
          Tertiary age -- this third and last of the great geologic periods --
          was peculiarly the age of great beasts of the earth after their kind,
          and cattle after their kind.''
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus by dropping the invertebrata, and the early fishes and reptiles
          of the Palæozoic period as inconspicuous and of little account, and
          bringing prominently forward the carboniferous era which succeeded
          them as the most characteristic feature of the first great division,
          by classing the great land reptiles of the secondary period with the
          moving creatures of the waters, (for in the Mosaic account it does not
          appear that any inhabitants of the land were created on the fifth
          day). and evading the fact that terrestrial reptiles seem to have
          preceded birds in their order of appearance upon earth, the geologic
          divisions are tolerably well assimilated to the third, fifth, and
          sixth Mosaic days. These things were represented, we are told, to
          Moses in visionary pictures, and resulted in the short and summary
          account which he has given.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is something in this hypothesis very near to the obvious truth,
          while at the same time something very remote from that truth is meant
          to be inferred. If it be said the Mosaic account is simply the
          speculation of some early Copernicus or Newton who devised a scheme of
          the earth's formation, as nearly he might in accordance with his own
          observations of nature, and with such views of things as it was
          possible for an unassisted thinker in those days to take, we may
          admire the approximate correctness of the picture drawn, while we see
          that the writer, as might be expected, took everything from a
          different point of view from ourselves, and consequently represented
          much quite differently from the fact. But nothing of this sort is
          really intended. We are asked to believe that a vision of creation was
          presented to him by Divine power, for the purpose of enabling him to
          inform the world of what he had seen, which vision inevitably led him
          to give a description which has misled the world for centuries, and in
          which the truth can now only with difficulty be recognised. The Hebrew
          writer informs us that on the third day the earth brought forth grass,
          the herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,
          whose seed was in itself, after his kind;' and in the 29th verse, that
          God on the sixth day said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
          seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the
          which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for
          meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
          and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life,
          I have given every green herb for meat.' Can it be disputed that the
          writer here conceives that grass, corn, and fruit, were created on the
          third day, and with a view to the future nourishment of man and beast?
          Yet, according to the vision hypothesis, he must have been greatly
          deceived; for that luxuriant vegetation which he saw on the third day,
          consisted not of plants destined for the food of man, but for his
          fuel. It was the flora of the carboniferous period which he beheld;
          concerning which Hugh Miller makes the following remark, p.24: -- The
          existing plants whence we derive our analogies in dealing with the
          vegetation of this early period, contribute but little, if at all, to
          the support of animal life. The ferns and their allies remain
          untouched by the grazing animals. Our native club-mosses, though once
          used in medicine, are positively deleterious; the horsetails, though
          harmless, so abound in silex, which wraps them round with a cuticle of
          stone, that they are rarely cropped by cattle; while the thickets of
          fern which cover our hill-sides, and seem so temptingly rich and green
          in their season, scarce support the existence of a single creature,
          and remain untouched in stem and leaf from their first appearance in
          spring, until they droop and wither under the frosts of early winter.
          Even the insects that infest the herbaria of the botanist almost never
          injure his ferns. Nor are our resin-producing conifers, though they
          nourish a few beetles, favourites with the herbivorous tribes in a
          much greater degree. Judging from all we yet know, the earliest
          terrestrial flora may have covered the dry land with its mantle of
          cheerful green, and served its general purposes, chemical and others,
          in the well-balanced economy of nature; but the herb-eating animals
          would have fared but ill, even where it throve most luxuriantly; and
          it seems to harmonize with the fact of its unedible character that up
          to the present time we know not that a single herbivorous animal lived
          amongst its shades. The Mosaic writer is, however, according to the
          theory, misled by the mere appearance of luxurious vegetation, to
          describe fruit trees and edible seed-bearing vegetables as products of
          the third day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hugh Miller's treatment of the description of the first dawn of light
          is not more satisfactory than that of Dr. Buckland. He supposes the
          prophet in his dream to have heard the command Let there be light'
          enunciated, whereupon straightway a grey diffused light springs up in
          the east, and casting its sickly gleam over a cloud-limited expanse of
          steaming vaporous sea, journeys through the heavens towards the west.
          One heavy, sunless day is made the representative of myriads; the
          faint light waxes fainter, -- it sinks beneath the dim, undefined
          horizon.'
        </p>
        <p>
          We are then asked to imagine that a second and a third day, each
          representing the characteristic features of a great distinctly-marked
          epoch, and the latter of them marked by the appearance of a rich and
          luxuriant vegetation, are presented to the seer's eye; but without
          sun, moon, or stars as yet entering into his dream. These appear first
          in his fourth vision, and then for the first time we have a brilliant
          day,' and the seer, struck with the novelty, describes the heavenly
          bodies as being the most conspicuous objects in the picture. In
          reality we know that he represents them (v.16) as having been made and
          set in the heavens on that day, though Hugh Miller avoids reminding us
          of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one respect the theory of Hugh Miller agrees with that advocated by
          Dr. Buckland and Archdeacon Pratt. Both these theories divest the
          Mosaic narrative of real accordance with fact; both assume that
          appearances only, not facts, are described, and that in riddles, which
          would never have been suspected to be such, had we not arrived at the
          truth from other sources. It would be difficult for controversialists
          to cede more completely the point in dispute, or to admit more
          explicitly that the Mosaic narrative does not represent correctly the
          history of the universe up to the time of man. At the same time, the
          upholders of each theory see insuperable objections in details to that
          of their allies, and do not pretend to any firm faith in their own.
          How can it be otherwise when the task proposed is to evade the plain
          meaning of language, and to introduce obscurity into one of the
          simplest stories ever told, for the sake of making it accord with the
          complex system of the universe which modern science has unfolded? The
          spectacle of able and, we doubt not, conscientious writers engaged in
          attempting the impossible is painful and humiliating. They evidently
          do not breathe freely over their work, but shuffle and stumble over
          their difficulties in a piteous manner; nor are they themselves again
          until they return to the pure and open fields of science.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is refreshing to return to the often-echoed remark, that it could
          not have been the object of a Divine revelation to instruct mankind in
          physical science, man having had faculties bestowed upon him to enable
          him to acquire this knowledge by himself. This is in fact pretty
          generally admitted; but in the application of the doctrine, writers
          play at fast and loose with it according to circumstances. Thus an
          inspired writer may be permitted to allude to the phenomena of nature
          according to the vulgar view of such things, without impeachment of
          his better knowledge; but if he speaks of the same phenomena
          assertively, we are bound to suppose that things are as he represents
          them, however much our knowledge of nature may be disposed to
          recalcitrate. But if we find a difficulty in admitting that such
          misrepresentations can find a place in revelation, the difficulty lies
          in our having previously assumed what a Divine revelation ought to be.
          If God made use of imperfectly informed men to lay the foundations of
          that higher knowledge for which the human race was destined, is it
          wonderful that they should have committed themselves to assertions not
          in accordance with facts, although they may have believed them to be
          true? On what grounds has the popular notion of Divine revelation been
          built up? Is it not plain that the plan of Providence for the
          education of man is a progressive one, and as imperfect men have been
          used as the agents for teaching mankind, is it not to be expected that
          their teachings should be partial and, to some extent, erroneous?
          Admitted, as it is, that physical science is not what the Hebrew
          writers, for the most part, profess to convey, at any rate, that it is
          not on account of the communication of such knowledge that we attach
          any value to their writings, why should we hesitate to recognise their
          fallibility on this head?
        </p>
        <p>
          Admitting, as is historically and in fact the case, that it was the
          mission of the Hebrew race to lay the foundation of religion upon the
          earth, and that Providence used this people specially for this
          purpose, is it not our business and our duty to look and see how this
          has really been done? not forming for ourselves theories of what a
          revelation ought to be, or how we, if entrusted with the task, would
          have made one, but enquiring how it has pleased God to do it. In all
          his theories of the world, man has at first deviated widely from the
          truth, and has only gradually come to see how far otherwise God has
          ordered things than the first daring speculator had supposed. It has
          been popularly assumed that the Bible, bearing the stamp of Divine
          authority, must be complete, perfect, and unimpeachable in all its
          parts, and a thousand difficulties and incoherent doctrines have
          sprung out of this theory. Men have proceeded in the matter of
          theology, as they did with physical science before inductive
          philosophy sent them to the feet of nature, and bid them learn in
          patience and obedience the lessons which she had to teach. Dogma and
          groundless assumption occupy the place of modest enquiry after truth,
          while at the same time the upholders of these theories claim credit
          for humility and submissiveness. This is exactly inverting the fact;
          the humble scholar of truth is not he who, taking his stand upon the
          traditions of rabbins, Christian fathers, or school-men, insists upon
          bending facts to his unyielding standard, but he who is willing to
          accept such teaching as it has pleased Divine Providence to afford,
          without murmuring that it has not been furnished more copiously or
          clearly.

          The Hebrew race, their works, and their books, are great facts in the
          history of man; the influence of the mind of this people upon the rest
          of mankind has been immense and peculiar, and there can be no
          difficulty in recognising therein the hand of a directing Providence.
          But we may not make ourselves wiser than God, nor attribute to Him
          methods of procedure which are not His. If, then, it is plain that He
          has not thought it needful to communicate to the writer of the
          Cosmogony that knowledge which modern researches have revealed, why do
          we not acknowledge this, except that it conflicts with a human theory
          which presumes to point out how God ought to have instructed man? The
          treatment to which the Mosaic narrative is subjected by the
          theological geologists is anything but respectful. The writers of this
          school, as we have seen, agree in representing it as a series of
          elaborate equivocations -- a story which palters with us in a double
          sense.' But if we regard it as the speculation of some Hebrew
          Descartes or Newton, promulgated in all good faith as the best and
          most probable account that could be then given of God's universe, it
          resumes the dignity and value of which the writers in question have
          done their utmost to deprive it. It has been sometimes felt as a
          difficulty to taking this view of the case, that the writer asserts so
          solemnly and unhesitatingly that for which he must have known that he
          had no authority. But this arises only from our modern habits of
          thought, and from the modesty of assertion which the spirit of true
          science has taught us. Mankind has learnt caution through repeated
          slips in the process of tracing out the truth.

          The early speculator was harassed by no such scruples, and asserted as
          facts what he knew in reality only as probabilities. But we are not on
          that account to doubt his perfect good faith, nor need we attribute to
          him wilful misrepresentation, or consciousness of asserting that which
          he knew not to be true. He had seized one great truth, in which,
          indeed, he anticipated the highest revelation of modern enquiry --
          namely, the unity of the design of the world, and its subordination to
          one sole Maker and Lawgiver. With regard to details, observation
          failed him. He knew little of the earth's surface, or of its shape and
          place in the universe; the infinite varieties of organized existences
          which people it, the distinct floras and faunas of its different
          continents, were unknown to him. But he saw that all which lay within
          his observation bad been formed for the benefit and service of man,
          and the goodness of the Creator to his creatures was the thought
          predominant in his mind. Man's closer relations to his Maker is
          indicated by the representation that he was formed last of all
          creatures, and in the visible likeness of God. For ages, this simple
          view of creation satisfied the wants of man, and formed a sufficient
          basis of theological teaching, and if modern research now shows it to
          be physically untenable, our respect for the narrative which has
          played so important a part in the culture of our race need be in
          nowise diminished. No one contends that it can be used as a basis of
          astronomical or geological teaching, and those who profess to see in
          it an accordance with facts, only do this sub modo, and by processes
          which despoil it of its consistency and grandeur, both which may be
          preserved if we recognise in it, not an authentic utterance of Divine
          knowledge, but a human utterance, which it has pleased Providence to
          use Providence a special way for the education of mankind.
