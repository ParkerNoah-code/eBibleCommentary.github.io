        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.989)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"The time of my departure is at hand." -- 2 Timothy 4:6.</p>
        <p>
          SO NEAR, SO VERY NEAR THE CHANGE -- his removal from this to another
          world; and so very conscious of it; yet Paul looked back with calm
          satisfaction; he looked forward with sweet assurance; and he looked
          round with deepest interest on the mission that had engaged his life.
          As you must have noticed while we were reading the chapter, in his
          case "the ruling passion was strong in death." Writing what he well
          knows is the last letter he shall ever write, its main topic is care
          for the church of God -- anxiety for the promotion of the truth --
          zeal for the furtherance of the gospel. When he is dead, and gone from
          the post of service, the scene of suffering, the field of enterprise,
          on whom shall his mantle fall? He desires that in Timothy he may find
          a worthy successor, strong in the faith, sincere of heart, and having
          dauntless courage withal, one who will wield the sword and hold the
          banner when his hand is palsied in death. Men have usually shown us
          what lies at the bottom of their heart when they have come to die.
          Often their last expiring expressions have been indicative of their
          entire character. Certainly you have before you in the last sentences
          of Paul's pen a fair epitome of his entire life. He is trusting in the
          Savior; he is anxious to show his love for that Savior. The welfare of
          the Christian church and the advancement of the holy cause of the
          gospel are uppermost in his mind. May it be yours and mine to live
          wholly for Christ, and to die also for him. May this ever be foremost
          in our thoughts, "How can I advance the kingdom of our Lord and
          Savior? By what means can I bless his church and people?" It is very
          beautiful to observe the way in which Paul describes his death in this
          verse. According to our translation he speaks of it as an offering. "I
          am now ready," saith he, "to be offered." If we accept this version he
          may be supposed to mean that he felt as one standing like a bullock or
          a lamb, ready to be laid on an altar. He foresaw he would die a
          martyr's death. He knew he could not be crucified as his brother Peter
          had been, for a Roman citizen was, as a rule, exempt from that
          ignominious death. He expected to die in some other manner. Probably
          he guessed it would be by the sword, and so he describes himself as
          waiting for the sacrificial knife to be used, that he might be
          presented as a sacrifice. So I say the words of our translation would
          lead us to think. But the original is far more instructive. He here
          likens himself, in the Greek, not to an offering, but to the
          drink-offering. Every Jew would know what that meant. When there was a
          burnt-sacrifice offered, the bullock or the victim then slain was the
          main part of the sacrifice. But sometimes there was a little, what if
          I say an unimportant, supplement added to that sacrifice -- a little
          oil and a little wine were poured on to the altar or the bullock, and
          thus a drink-offering was said to be added to the burnt-offering. Now,
          Paul does not venture to call himself an offering, -- Christ is his
          offering. Christ is, so to speak, the sacrifice on the altar. He
          likens himself only to that little wine and oil poured out as a
          supplement thereto, not necessary to its perfection, but tolerated in
          performing a vow, or allowed in connection with a free will offering,
          as you will find if you refer at leisure to the fifteenth chapter of
          Numbers, from the fourth to the eighth verses. The drink-offering was
          thus a kind of addendum, by which the person who gave it showed his
          thankfulness. So Paul is resolved to show his thankfulness to Christ,
          the great sacrifice, and he is willing that his blood should be poured
          as a drink-offering on the altar where his Lord and Master was the
          great burnt-offering. He rejoices when he can say, "I am ready to be
          presented as a drink-offering unto God."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have mainly to do with the second description which he gives of his
          death. What does he say when the hour that this grim monster must be
          grappled with is at hand? I do not find him sad. Those who delight in
          gloomy poetry have often represented death in terrible language. "It
          is hard," says one --
        </p>
        <p>To feel the hand of death arrest one's steps,</p>
        <p>Throw a chill blight on all one's budding hopes,</p>
        <p>And hurl one's soul untimely to the shades."</p>
        <p>And another exclaims --</p>
        <p>"O God, it is a fearful thing</p>
        <p>To see the human soul take wing,</p>
        <p>In any shape, in any mood!</p>
        <p>I've seen it rushing forth in blood,</p>
        <p>I've seen it on the breaking ocean,</p>
        <p>Strive with a swollen convulsive motion."</p>
        <p>
          Not so the apostle Paul. I do not even hear him speak of flying
          through the gate as our grand old poet has described death. He does
          not say, "The hour of my dissolution is at hand" -- a very proper word
          if he had used it; but he is not looking so much at the process as at
          the result of his dying. He does not even say, "The hour of my death
          is at hand," but he adopts a beautiful expression, "The time of my
          departure" -- words which are used sometimes to signify the departure
          of a vessel from the port; the pulling up of the anchor so that it
          looses its moorings, when about to put out to sea -- so he feels
          himself like a ship lying at the harbor for awhile -- but he says,
          "The time for pulling up the anchor, the time for letting loose the
          cable, and cutting from the mooring is at hand; I shall soon be
          launched upon my voyage." And he knew right well where that voyage
          would end, in the fair havens of the port of Peace in the better
          country, whither his Lord had gone before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we will proceed very briefly to say a word about departure; and
          then a shorter word still about the time of our departure; and then a
          little more about the time of our departure being at hand -- trying
          here, especially, to bring forward some lessons which may be of
          practical usefulness to each one of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, dear brethren, let us think a little about OUR
          DEPARTURE.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is quite certain we shall not dwell here for ever: we shall not
          live here below as long as the first man did, or as those antediluvian
          fathers, who tarried some eight or nine hundred years. The length of
          human life then led to greatness of sin. Monstrosities of evil were
          ripened through the long continuance of physical strength, and the
          accumulating force of eager passions. All things considered, it is a
          mercy that life is abridged and not prolonged to a thousand years.
          Amidst the sharp competition of man with man, and class with class,
          there is a bound to every scheme of personal aggrandisement, a limit
          to all the spoils of individual despotism, a restraint upon the
          hoardings of any one's avarice. It is well, I say, that it should be
          so. The narrow span of life clips the wings of ambition, and baulks it
          of its prey. Death comes in to deprive the mighty of his power, to
          stay the rapacity of the invader, to scatter abroad the possessions of
          the rich. The most reprobate men must end their career after they have
          had their three score years and ten, or their four score years of
          wickedness. And as for the good and godly, though we mourn their exit,
          especially when we think that they have been prematurely taken from
          us, we remember how the triumphs of genius have been for the most part
          achieved in youth, and how much the world has been enriched by the
          heads and hearts of those who have but sown the seeds of faith and
          left others to reap the fruits. If into less than the allotted term
          they have crowded the service of their generation, we may save our
          tears, for our regrets are needless. The summons will reach each one
          of us ere long. We cannot stop here as long as the grey fathers of our
          race: we expect, and it is meet that we should prepare, to go. The
          world itself is to be consumed one day. "The elements shall melt with
          fervent heat." The land on which we stand we are wont to call terra
          firma, but beneath it is probably an ocean of fire, and it shall
          itself feel the force of the ocean. We must not marvel, the house
          being so frail, that the tenants are unsettled and migratory.
          Certainly, whether we doubt it or not, we shall have to go. There will
          be a departure for us. Beloved believer in Christ Jesus, to you the
          soft term, "Departure" is not more soft than the truth it represents.
          To die is to depart out of this world unto the Father. What say you
          about your departure? What say you of that from which you go, and what
          think you of that land to which you go? Well, of the land from which
          we go, my brethren, we might say many hard things if we would, but I
          think we had better not. We shall speak more correctly, if we say the
          hard things of ourselves. This land, my brethren, has been a land of
          mercy to us: there have been sorrows in it; but in bidding it farewell
          we will do it justice and speak the truth concerning it. Our sorrows
          have usually sprung up in our own bosoms, and those that have come
          from the soil itself would have been very light if it had not been for
          the plague of our hearts, which made us vex, and fret over them. Oh,
          the mercy you and I have enjoyed even in this life! It has been worth
          while to live for us who are believers. Even had we to die like a dog
          dieth, it has been worth while to live for the joy and blessedness
          which God has made to pass before us. I dare not call that an evil
          country in which I have met my Savior, and received the pardon of my
          sin. I dare not call that an ill life in which I have seen my Savior,
          though it be through a glass darkly. How shall I speak ill of that
          lamb where Zion is built, beautiful for situation, the joy of the
          whole earth, the place of our solemn assemblies, where we have
          worshipped God? No; cursed of old as the earth was to bring forth the
          thorn and the thistle, the existence of the church of God in that land
          seems to a great degree to have made reparation for the blight to such
          as know and love the Savior. Oh, have we not gone up to the house of
          God in company with songs of ecstatic joy, and have we not when we
          have gathered round the table of the Lord -- though nothing was upon
          it but the type and emblem -- have we not felt it a joyous thing to be
          found in the assembly of the saints, and in the courts of the Lord's
          house even here? When we loose our cable, and bid farewell to earth,
          it shall not be with bitterness in the retrospect. There is sin in it,
          and we are called to leave it; there has been trial in it, and we are
          called to be delivered from it; there has been sorrow in it, and we
          are glad that we shall go where we shall sorrow no more. There have
          been weakness, and pain, and suffering in it, and we are glad that we
          shall be raised in power; there has been death in it, and we are glad
          to bid farewell to shrouds and to knells; but for all that there has
          been such mercy in it, such lovingkindness of God in it, that the
          wilderness and the solitary place have been made glad, and the desert
          has rejoiced and blossomed as a rose. We will not bid farewell to the
          world, execrating it, or leaving behind us a cold shudder and a sad
          remembrance, but we will depart, bidding adieu to the scenes that
          remain, and to the people of God that tarry therein yet a little
          longer, blessing him whose goodness and mercy have followed us all the
          days of our life, and who is now bringing us to dwell in the house of
          the Lord for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear brethren, if I have had to speak in a somewhat apologetic
          manner of the land from which we depart, I shall need to use many
          apologies for my own poor talk about the land to which we are bound.
          Ah, whither goest thou, spirit loosened from thy clay -- dost know?
          Whither goest thou? The answer must be, partly, that we know not. None
          of us have seen the streets of gold of which we sang just now; those
          harpings of the harpers, harping with their harps, have never fallen
          on these ears; eye hath not seen it, ear hath not heard it: it is all
          unrevealed to the senses; flesh and blood cannot inherit it, and,
          therefore, flesh and blood cannot imagine it. Yet it is not unknown,
          for God hath revealed it unto us by his Spirit. Spiritual men know
          what it is to feel the spirit, their own new-born spirit, living,
          glowing, burning, triumphing within them. They know, therefore, that
          if the body should drop off they would not die. They feel there is a
          life within them superior to blood and bone, and nerve and sinew. They
          feel the life of God within them, and none can gainsay it. Their own
          experience has proven to them that there is an inner life. Well, then,
          when that inner life is strong and vigorous, the spirit often reveals
          to it what the world of spirits will be. We know what holiness is, do
          we not, brethren? Are we not seeking it? That is heaven -- perfect
          holiness is heaven. We know what peace means; Christ is our peace.
          Rest -- he gives us rest: we find that when we take his yoke. Rest is
          heaven. And rest in Jesus tells us what heaven is. We know, even
          to-day, what communion with God is. If any one should say, "I do not
          know it," I should reply to him thus: Suppose I said to you, "You know
          not what it is to eat and drink:" the man would tell me that I belied
          him, for he knew, as he knew his own existence, what it was to eat and
          drink; and, as surely as I live, I have communion with God. I know it
          as certainly as you know that I have declared it to you. Well,
          friends, that is heaven. It has but to be developed from the germ to
          the produce, and there is heaven in its full development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communion with saints in like manner -- know we not what that is? Have
          we not rejoiced in each other's joys, been made glad with the
          experience of our brethren? That, too, carried to perfection, will be
          heaven. Oh, to throw yourself into the bosom of the Savior and lie
          there taken up with his mind and his love, yielding all things to his
          supremacy, beholding your King in him! When you have been in that
          state you have had an antepast of heaven. Your view may have been but
          as one seeing a man's face in shadow yet you would know that man again
          even by the shadow; so know we what heaven is. We shall not be
          strangers in a strange land when we get there. Though, like the Queen
          of Sheba, we shall say, "The half has not been told me," yet we shall
          reflect on it thus: "I did surmise there would be something of this
          sort. I did know from what I felt of its buddings in my soul below
          that the full-blown flower would be somewhat of this kind." Whither
          away, then, spirit that art departing to soar through backs to thyself
          unknown? Thine answer is, "I am away: away to the throne of him whose
          cross first gave me life, and light, and hope. I am away to the very
          bosom of my Savior, where I hope to rest and to have fellowship with
          the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven." This
          is your departure that you have in near prospect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose, dear friend, the thought of departing from this world to the
          glory-world should ever startle you, let me remind you that you are
          not the first that ever went that way. Your vessel is in the pool, as
          it were, or in the dock; she is going out on her voyage; oh, but you
          will not go alone, nor have to track your course through paths
          unnavigated or unknown before! When the Portuguese captain first went
          by the Cape of Storms it was a venturous voyage, and he called it the
          Cape of Good Hope when he had rounded it. When Columbus first went in
          search of the New World, his was a brave spirit that dared cross the
          unnavigated Atlantic. But oh, there are tens of thousands that have
          gone whither you go. The Atlantic that severs us from Canaan is white
          with the sails of the vessels that are on voyage thither. Fear not,
          they have not been wrecked; we hear good news of their arrival there
          is good hope for you. There are no icebergs on the road, no mists, no
          counter currents, and no sunken vessels or quicksands; you have but to
          cut your moorings, and with Christ on board you shall be at your
          desired haven at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, your Savior went that way. Have you to depart? So
          Christ departed too. Some of my brethren are always so pleased --
          pleased as some children are with a new toy -- at the idea that they
          shall never die; that Christ will come, it may be before the time of
          their decease; for, "we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
          changed." Well, let him come, ay, let him come; come quickly. But if I
          had my choice, were it permitted me to choose, I would prefer to pass
          through the portals of the grave. Those that are alive and remain unto
          the coming of the Lord will not prevent, go before, or steal a march
          on them which are asleep. But surely they will lack one point of
          conformity to their Lord, for he disdained not to sojourn awhile in
          the tomb, though it was impossible that he should be holden of death.
          Let the seal of death, then, be set upon this face of mine, that my
          fate in the matter may be like his. Enoch and Elias were exempt from
          this privilege -- privilege, I call it -- of conformity to his death.
          But it is safe to go by the beaten track, and desirable to travel by
          the ordinary route to the heavenly city. Jesus died. Through the
          valley of shadows, the vale of death-shades, there are the foot-prints
          of Immanuel all the way along: go down into it and fear not. Bethink
          you, too, dear brethren and sisters, that we may well look forward to
          our departure, and look forward to it comfortably too? Is it not
          expedient by reason of nature? Is it not desirable by reason of grace?
          Is it not necessary by reason of glory? I say, is not our departure
          needful by reason of nature? Men are not, when they come to hoary age,
          what they were in the prime of their days. The staff is needed for the
          foot, and the glass is wanted for the eye; and after a certain number
          of years, even those on whom Time hath gently laid his hand, find the
          taste is gone. They might proclaim, like old Barzillai, that they know
          not what they eat or drink. The hearing fails, the daughters of music
          are silent, the whole tenement gets very crazy. Oh, it were a
          melancholy thing if we had to continue to live! Perhaps there is no
          more hideous picture than that which the satirist drew of men who
          lived on to six or seven hundred years of age -- that strange
          satirical man, Swift. Be thankful that we do not linger on in
          imbecility. Kind Nature says we may depart; she gives us notice, and
          makes it welcome by the decays that come upon us. Besides, grace
          desires it; for it were a poor experience of his kindness as our best
          and truest friend that did not make us long to see our Savior's face.
          It is no mere drivelling sentiment, I hope, when we join to sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Father, I long, I faint to see</p>
        <p>The place of thine abode;</p>
        <p>I'd leave thy earthly courts, and flee</p>
        <p>Up to thy seat, my God!"</p>
        <p>
          I must confess there was one verse in the hymn we sung just now which
          I could not quite chime in with. I am not eagerly wishing to go to
          heaven this night. I have a great deal more to do here; therefore I do
          not want to take a hasty leave of all below. To full many of us, I
          suppose, there are times of quiet contemplation and times of rapt
          devotion, when our thoughts surmount these lower skies, and look
          within the veil and then, Oh, how we wish to be there! Yet there are
          other times; times of strenuous activity when we buckle on the armor
          and press to the front; and then we see such a battle to be waged,
          such a victory to be won, such a work to be wrought, that we say:
          "Well to abide in the flesh, to continue with you all for the joy and
          furtherance of your faith, seems more loyal to Christ, more needful
          for you, and more in accord with our present feelings." I think it is
          idle for us to be crying, to go home; it is too much like the lazy
          workman, that wants Saturday night to come when it is only Tuesday
          morning. Oh, no; if God spare us to do a long life's work, so much the
          better. At the same time, as a spark flies upward to the sun, the
          central source of flame, so does the newborn spirit aspire towards
          heaven, towards Jesus, by whom it was kindled. And, I add, that glory
          demands it, and makes our departure needful. Is not Christ in heaven
          praying that we may be with him where he is? Are there not the saints
          in heaven, of whom it is said, they without us cannot be perfect? The
          circle of the skies cannot be completed until all the redeemed be
          there. The grand orchestra of glory misses some notes as yet. What if
          the bass be full, there are wanting still some trebles and tenors!
          There are some sopranos that will be requisite to swell the enchanting
          melodies, and consummate the worship of the Eternal! What, therefore,
          nature prepares for, grace desires, and glory itself demands, we have
          no just cause to shudder at. Our departure need not make us afraid.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus occupied so much time on this first point, I have
          little or no room to enlarge on the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE TIME OF OUR DEPARTURE, though unknown to us, is fixed by God,
          unalterably fixed; so rightly, wisely, lovingly settled, and prepared
          for, that no chance or haphazard can break the spell of destiny. The
          wisdom of divine love shall be proven by the carefulness of its
          provision. Perhaps you will say: "It is not easy to discern this; the
          natural order of things is so often disturbed by casualties of one
          kind or another." Let me remind you, then, that it is through faith,
          only through faith, we can understand these things; for it is as true
          now of the providence of God as it was of old of the creation of God
          that "things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
          Because the mode of your departure is beyond your own ken, it does not
          follow that the time of your departure is not foreseen by God. "Ah!
          but," say you, "it seems so shocking for any one to die suddenly,
          unexpectedly, without warning, and so come to an untimely end!" I
          answer you thus. If you take counsel with death your flesh will find
          no comfort; but if you trust in God your faith will cease to parley
          with these feverish anxieties, and your spirit will enjoy a sweet
          calm. Dire calamities befell Job when he was bereaved of his children
          and his servants, his herds and his flocks. Yet he took little heed of
          the different ways in which his troubles were brought about; whether
          by an onslaught of the Sabeans or by a raid of the Chaldeans; whether
          the fire fell from heaven, or the wind came from the wilderness; it
          mattered little. Whatever strange facts broke on his ear, one thought
          penetrated his heart, and one expression broke from his lips. "The
          Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the
          Lord." So, too, beloved, when the time of your departure arrives -- be
          it by disease or decay, be it by accident or assault, that your soul
          quits its present tenement -- rest assured that "thy times are in his
          hand;" and know of a surety that "all his saints are in his hand"
          likewise. Besides this, dear friends, since the time of our departure
          must come, were the manner of it at our own disposal, I think we
          should most of us say, "What I shall choose, I wot not." Fevers and
          agues, the pangs and tortures of one malady and another, or the
          delirium incident to sickness, are not so much to be preferred to the
          shock of a disaster, or the terror of a wreck at sea, because one is
          the prolonging of pain, and the other the despatch of fate, that we
          need to covet, and desire weeks or months spent in the vestibule of
          the grave. Rather should we say, Let the Lord do with me as seemeth
          him good. To live in constant communion with God is a sure relief from
          all these bitter frettings. Those who have walked with him have often
          been favored with such presentiments of their departure as no
          physician could give them. Survivors will tell you that though death
          seemed to come suddenly to the godly merchant, he had in the last acts
          of his life appeared to expect and prepare for it, and even to have
          taken an affecting farewell of his family while in the vigor of
          health, as though he were aware that he was setting out on his last
          journey, which a few hours afterwards it proved to be. So, too, the
          minister of Christ has sometimes fallen, expiring in his pulpit with a
          nunc dimittis, "Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace" on his
          lips; secretly, but surely, made ready to depart and to be with his
          Lord. There is a time to depart; and God's time to call me is my time
          to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, to our third point -- the THE TIME AT HAND. "The time of my
          departure is at hand."
        </p>
        <p>
          In a certain sense, every Christian here may say this; for whatever
          interval may interpose between us and death, how very short it is!
          Have you not all a sense that time flows faster than it did? In our
          childish days, we thought a year was quite a period of time, a very
          epoch in our career; now as for weeks -- one can hardly reckon them!
          We seem to be travelling by an express train, flying along at such a
          rate that we can hardly count the months. Why, the past year only
          seemed to come in at one door and go out at the other; it was over so
          soon. We shall soon be at the terminus of life, even if we live for
          several years; but in the case of some of us, God knows of whom, this
          year, perhaps this month, will be our last. I think to-morrow night we
          shall have to report at the church meeting the deaths of nine members
          of this church within the last eight or nine days. Since these have
          gone, some of us may expect to follow them. There are those who will
          evidently go; disease has set in upon them. Some of those disorders
          that in this land seem to be always fatal, tell these dear friends
          that the time of their departure is undoubtedly at hand. And then old
          age, which comes so gracefully and graciously to many of our matrons
          and our veterans, shows, past all dispute, "the time of your departure
          is at hand." The lease of your life is almost up. Not indeed that I
          would address myself to such special cases only. I speak to every
          brother and sister in Christ here. "The time of our departure is at
          hand." What then, dear friends?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not this a reason for surveying our condition again? If our vessel
          is just launching, let us see that she is seaworthy. It would be a sad
          thing for us to be near departing, and yet to be just as near
          discovering that we are lost. Remember, dear friends, it is possible
          for any one to maintain a decent Christ profession for fifty years,
          and be a hypocrite after all; possible to occupy an office in the
          church of God, and that of the very highest, and yet to be a Judas;
          and one may not only serve Christ, but suffer for him too, and yet,
          like Demas, may not persevere to the end; for all that looks like
          grace is not grace. Where true grace is, there it will always be; but
          where the semblance of it is, it will ofttimes suddenly disappear.
          Search thyself, good brother; set thine house in order, for thou must
          die and not live. Hast thou the faith of God's elect? Art thou built
          on Christ? Is thy heart renewed? Art thou verily an heir of heaven? I
          charge every man and woman within this place, since the time of his
          departure may be far nearer than he thinks, to take stock, and reckon
          up, and see whether he be Christ's or no.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the time of my departure be at hand, and I am satisfied that it
          is all right with me, is there not a call for me to do all I can for
          my household? Father, the time of your departure is at hand; is your
          wife unsaved? Will you pass another night without lovingly speaking to
          her of her soul? Are those dear boys unregenerate? Is that girl still
          thoughtless? The time of your departure is at hand. You can do little
          more for the lads and lasses; you can do little more for the wife and
          the brother. Oh! do what you can now. Sister, you are consumptive; you
          will soon be gone. You are the only Christ in the family. God sent you
          there to be a missionary. Do not have to say, when you are dying, "The
          last hope of my family is going out, for I have not cared for their
          souls." Masters, you that have servants about you, you must soon be
          taken away. Will you not do something for their souls? I know if there
          were a mother about to go to Australia, and she had to leave some of
          her children behind, she would fret if she thought, "I have not done
          all that needs to be done for those poor children. Who will care for
          them now their mother is gone?" Well, but to have neglected something
          necessary for their temporal comfort would be little in comparison
          with not having cared for their souls! Oh, let it not be so! Let it
          not be a thorn in your dying pillow that you did not fulfill the
          relations of life while you had the opportunity. "The time of my
          departure is at hand."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is a third lesson. Let me try to finish all my work, not
          only as regards my duty to my family, but in respect to all the world
          so far as my influence or ability can reach. Rich men, be your own
          executors. Do what you can with your substance while it is your own.
          Men of talent, speak for Jesus before your tongue has ceased to
          articulate, and becomes a piece of clay. George Whitfield may supply
          us with a fine model of this uniform consistency. He was so orderly
          and precise in his habits, and so scrupulous and holy in his life,
          that he used to say he would not like to go to bed if there were a
          pair of gloves out of place in the house, much less were his will not
          made, or any part of his duty unfulfilled to the best of his
          knowledge. He wished to have all right, and to be fully prepared for
          whatever might happen, so that, if he never woke again from the
          slumbers of the night, nobody would have cause to reflect upon
          anything he had left undone, entailing needless trouble on his wife or
          his children. Such care bestowed on what some account to be trifles is
          a habit; worthy of our imitation. The main work of life may be sadly
          spoiled by negligence in little things. This is a striking test of
          character. "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful
          also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
          much." Oh, then! time is fleeting, despatch is urgent; gather up your
          thoughts, quicken your hands, speed your pace, for God commandeth thee
          to make haste. If you have ought to do, you must do it soon. The
          wheels of eternity are sounding behind you. Press on! If you are to
          run a race you must run it fast, for Death will soon overtake you. You
          may almost feel the hot breath of the white horse of Death upon your
          cheeks already. O God, help us to do something ere we go hence and be
          no more seen. It was grand of the apostle that in the same breath,
          when he said, "The time of my departure is at hand," he could also
          say, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
          kept the faith." So may we be able to say when the time of our
          departure has arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the time of our departure is at hand, let it cheer us amid our
          troubles. Sometimes, when our friends go to Liverpool to sail for
          Canada, or any other distant region, on the night before they sail
          they get into a very poor lodging. I think I hear one of them
          grumbling, "What a hard bed! What a small room! What a bad look-out"
          "Oh," says the other, "never mind, brother; we are not going to live
          here; we are off to-morrow." Bethink you in like manner, ye children
          of poverty, this is not your rest. Put up with it, you are away
          tomorrow. Ye sons of sorrow, ye daughters of weakness, ye children of
          sickness, let this cheer you: --
        </p>
        <p>"The road may be rough,</p>
        <p>But it cannot be long</p>
        <p>And I'll smooth it with hope,</p>
        <p>And cheer it with song."</p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes when I have been travelling on the Continent I have been
          obliged to put up at an hotel that was full, where the room was so
          inconvenient, that it scarcely furnished any accommodation at all. But
          we have said, "Oh, never mind: we are off in the morning! What matters
          it for one night?" So, as we are soon to be gone, and the time of our
          departure is at hand, let us not be ruffling our tempers about
          trifles, nor raise evil spirits around us by cavilling and finding
          fault. Take things as you find them, for we shall soon be up and away.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if the time of my departure is at hand, I should like to be on
          good terms with all my friends on earth. Were you going to stop here
          always, when a man treated you badly, apart from a Christ spirit, you
          might as well have it out with him; but as we are going to stop such a
          little while, we may well put up with it. It is not desirable to be
          too ready at taking an offense. What if my neighbor has an ugly
          temper, the Lord has to put up with him, and so I may. There are some
          people with whom I would rather dwell in heaven for ever than abide
          with them half an hour on earth. Nevertheless, for the love of the
          brethren, and for the peace of the church, we may tolerate much during
          the short time we have to brook with peevish moods and perverse
          humors. Does Christ love them, and shall not we? He covers their
          offenses; why, then, should we disclose them or publish them abroad?
          If, any of you have any grievances with one another, if there is any
          bickering, or jealousy between you, I should like you to make it up
          to-night, because the time of your departure is at hand. Suppose there
          is some one you spoke harshly to, you would not like to hear to-morrow
          that he was dead. You would not have minded what you said to him if he
          had lived, but now that the seal is set upon all your communications
          one with another, you could wish that the last impress had been more
          friendly. There has been a little difference between two brothers -- a
          little coldness between two sisters. Oh, since one or other of you
          will soon be gone, make it up! Live in love, as Christ loved you and
          gave himself for you. If one of you were going to Australia to-morrow,
          never to come back again, and you had had a little tiff with your
          brother, why I know before you started you would say, "Come, brother,
          let us part good friends." So now, since you are so soon to depart,
          end all strife, and dwell together in blessed harmony till the
          departure actually occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the time of my departure is at hand, then let me guard against
          being elated by any temporal prosperity. Possessions, estates,
          creature comforts dwindle into insignificance before this out-look.
          Yes, you may have procured a comfortable house and a delightful
          garden, but it is not your rest: your tenure is about to expire. Yes,
          you may say, "God did prosper me last year, the bank account did
          swell, the premises were enlarged, and the business thrived beyond all
          expectation." Ah! hold them loose. Do not think that they are to be
          your heaven. Be very jealous lest you should get your good things
          here, for if you do you will not have them hereafter. Be not lifted up
          too much when you grasp the pain, of which you must so soon quit your
          hold. As I said of the discomfort of the hotel, we did not think much
          of it, because we were going away. So, if it happens to be very
          luxurious, do not be enamoured of it, for you must go to-morrow.
          "These are the things," said one, when he looked at a rich man's
          treasures, "that make it hard to die." But it need not be so, if you
          hold them as gifts of God's kindness, and not as gods to be worshipped
          with self-indulgence, you may take leave of them with composure;
          "knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring
          substance."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, if the time of our departure is at hand, let us be prepared to
          bear our testimony. We are witnesses for Christ. Let us bear our
          testimony before we are taken up and mingle with the cloud of
          witnesses who have finished their course and rested from their labors.
          Dost thou say, "I hope to do that on my dying bed?" Brother, do it
          now: do it now, for you may never have opportunity to do it then. Mr.
          Whitfield was always desirous that he might bear a testimony for
          Christ in the hour of death; but he could not do so at that momentous
          crisis, for as you well know, he was suddenly taken ill after
          preaching, and very soon expired. Was this to be grievously deplored?
          Ah, no. Why, dear friends, he had borne so many testimonies for his
          Lord and Master while he was alive, there was no need to add anything
          in the last few moments before his death, or to supply the
          deficiencies of a life devoted to the proclamation of the gospel. Oh,
          let you and I bear our testimony now! Let us tell to others wherever
          we can what Christ hath done for us. Let us help Christ's cause with
          all our might while it is called to-day. Let us work for Jesus while
          we can work for him. As to thinking we can undo the effect of our
          idleness by the spasmodic effort of our dying breath, that were a vain
          hope indeed compared with living for Jesus Christ. Your dying
          testimony, if you are able to bear it, will have the greater force if
          it is not a sickly regret, but a healthy confirmation of your whole
          career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only wish these words about departure were applicable to all here.
          "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints." But,
          "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
          wicked, but that the wicked turn from his ways, and live." O
          unconverted man, the time for letting loose your cable draws nigh; it
          is even at the door. You must shortly, set sail for a far country.
          Alas! then yours is not the voyage of a passenger, with a sweeter
          clime, a happier home, a brighter prospect in view. Your departure is
          the banishment of a convict, with a penal settlement looming in the
          distance; fear all rife, and hope all blank, for the term of your
          banishment is interminable. I fear there are some of you who may
          depart ere long full of gloom with a fearful looking for of judgment
          and of fiery indignation. I seem to see the angel of death hovering
          over my audience. He may, perhaps, select for his victim an
          unconverted soul. If so, behind that death-angel attends there
          something far more grim. Hell follows death to souls that love not
          Christ. Oh, make haste, make haste! Seek Christ. Lay hold on eternal
          life; and may infinite mercy save you, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen
          and Amen.
