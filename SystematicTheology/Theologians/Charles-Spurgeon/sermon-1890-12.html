          Those, too, who are excommunicated by the priests, let no one receive
          previous to the just examination of both sides; nor let him have any
          intercourse with such in speech, or in eating or drinking, or in the
          salutation with the kiss, nor let him greet such; because, whosoever
          wittingly holds intercourse with the excommunicated in these or other
          prohibited matters, will subject himself, according to the ordinance
          of the apostles, to like excommunication. From these, therefore, let
          clergy and laity keep themselves if they would not have the same
          penalty to endure. Also do not join the unbelievers, neither have any
          fellowship with them. They who do such things, indeed, are judged not
          as believers, but as unbelievers. Whence the apostle says: "What part
          hath he that believeth with an infidel? or what fellowship hath
          righteousness with unrighteousness?" <br />
