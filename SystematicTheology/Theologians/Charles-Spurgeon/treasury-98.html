 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">TITLE. <br/>
    This Psalm has no title, and all we know of its authorship is that Paul 
    quotes it as "saying in David." (Heb 4:7.) It is true that this may merely 
    signify that it is to be found in the collection known as David's Psalms; 
    but if such were the Apostle's meaning it would have been more natural for 
    him to have written, "saying in the Psalms;" we therefore incline to the 
    belief that David was the actual author of this poem. It is in its original 
    a truly Hebrew song, directed both in its exhortation and warning to the 
    Jewish people—but we have the warrant of the Holy Spirit in the epistle to 
    the Hebrews for using its appeals and entreaties when pleading with Gentile 
    believers. </p>
<p align="justify">It is a psalm of invitation to worship. It has about it a 
    ring like that or church bells, and like the bells it sounds both merrily 
    and solemnly, at first ringing out a lively peal, and then dropping into a 
    funeral knell as if tolling at the funeral of the generation which perished 
    in the wilderness. We will call it THE PSALM OF THE PROVOCATION.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. It would be correct as to the sense to divide 
    this psalm into an <i>invitation </i>and a <i>warning, </i>so as to commence 
    the second part with the last clause of verse 7.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O come, let us sing unto the LORD.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Other nations sing unto their gods, let us sing unto 
    Jehovah. We love him, we admire him, we reverence him, let us express our 
    feelings with the choicest sounds, using our noblest faculty for its noblest 
    end. It is well thus to urge others to magnify the Lord—but we must be 
    careful to set a worthy example ourselves, so that we may be able not only 
    to cry "Come"—but also to add "let <i>us </i>sing", because we are singing 
    ourselves. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">It is to be feared that very much even of religious 
    singing is not unto the Lord, but unto the ear of the congregation</p></i>. 
    Above all things we must in our service of song take care that all we offer 
    is with the heart's sincerest and most fervent intent directed toward the 
    Lord himself. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">With holy enthusiasm let us sing, making a sound which 
    shall indicate our earnestness; with abounding joy let us lift up our 
    voices, actuated by that happy and peaceful spirit which trustful love is 
    sure to foster.</p>
<p align="justify">As the children of Israel sang for joy when the smitten 
    rock poured forth its cooling streams, so let us make a joyful noise to the 
    rock of our salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">The author of this song had in his mind's eye the rock, 
    the tabernacle, the Red Sea, and the mountains of Sinai, and he alludes to 
    them all in this first part of his hymn. <i>God is our abiding, immutable, 
    and mighty rock, and in him we find deliverance and safety, therefore it 
    befits us to praise him with heart and with voice </i>from day to day; and 
    especially should we delight to do this when we assemble as his people for 
    public worship.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Let us come before his presence with 
    thanksgiving. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here is probably a reference to the peculiar presence of 
    God in the Holy of Holies above the mercy seat, and also to the glory which 
    shone forth out of the cloud which rested above the tabernacle.<i> 
    Everywhere God is present—but there is a peculiar presence of grace and 
    glory into which men should never come without the profoundest reverence.
    </i>We may make bold to come before the immediate presence of the Lord—for 
    the voice of the Holy Spirit in this psalm invites us, and when we do draw 
    near to him we should remember his great goodness to us and cheerfully 
    confess it. </p>
<p align="justify">Our worship should have reference to the <i>past </i>as 
    well as to the <i>future</i>; if we do not bless the Lord for what we have 
    already received, how can we reasonably look for more. We are permitted to 
    bring our petitions, and therefore we are in honor bound to bring our 
    thanksgivings. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">We should shout as exultingly as those do who triumph in 
    war, and as solemnly as those whose utterance is a psalm. <i>It is not 
    always easy to unite enthusiasm with reverence, and it is a frequent fault 
    to destroy one of these qualities while straining after the other. The 
    perfection of singing is that which unites joy with gravity, exultation with 
    humility, fervency with sobriety. </i></p>

<p align="justify">The invitation given in the first verse (Psalm 95:1) is 
    thus repeated in the second (Psalm 95:2) with the addition of directions, 
    which indicate more fully the intent of the writer. </p>
<p align="justify">One can imagine David in earnest tones persuading his 
    people to go up with him to the worship of Jehovah with sound of harp and 
    hymn, and holy delight. The happiness of his exhortation is noteworthy, the 
    noise is to be <b>joyful</b>; this quality he insists upon twice. It is to 
    be feared that this is too much overlooked in ordinary services, people are 
    so impressed with the idea that they ought to be serious that they put on 
    the aspect of misery, and quite forget that joy is as much a characteristic 
    of true worship as solemnity itself.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. For the LORD is a great God, and a great King 
    above all gods.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No doubt the surrounding nations imagined Jehovah to be a 
    merely local deity, the God of a small nation, and therefore one of the 
    inferior deities; the psalmist utterly repudiates such an idea. Idolaters 
    tolerated gods many, and lords many, giving to each a certain measure of 
    respect. </p>
<p align="justify">The monotheism of the Jews was not content with this 
    concession, it rightly claimed for Jehovah the chief place, and the supreme 
    power. He is great, for he is all in all. He is a great King above all other 
    powers and dignitaries, whether angels or princes, for they owe their 
    existence to him. As for the <i>idol gods</i>, they are not worthy to be 
    mentioned. This verse and the following supply some of the reasons for 
    worship, drawn from the being, greatness, and sovereign dominion of the 
    Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. In his hand are the deep places of the earth.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He is the God of the valleys and the hills, the caverns, 
    and the peaks. Far down where the miners sink their shafts, deeper yet where 
    lie the secret oceans by which springs are fed, and deepest of all in the 
    unknown abyss where the huge central fires of earth rage and flame—there 
    Jehovah's power is felt, and all things are under the dominion of his hand.
    </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">As princes hold the model globe in their hands, so does 
    the Lord in very deed hold the earth. </p></i>When Israel drank of the crystal 
    fount which welled up from the great deep, below the smitten rock, the 
    people knew that in the Lord's hands were the deep places of the earth. 
<b>
<p align="justify">The strength of the mountains is his also. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When Sinai was altogether on smoke the tribes learned 
    that Jehovah was God of the hills as well as of the valleys. Everywhere and 
    at all times is this true; the Lord rules upon the high places of the earth 
    in solemn majesty. The vast foundations, the gigantic mountains, the 
    incalculable masses, the untrodden heights of the mountains are all the 
    Lord's. These are his treasure houses, where he stores the tempest and the 
    rain; whence also he pours the ice torrents and looses the avalanches. The 
    granite peaks and adamantine pinnacles of rock are his. </p>
<p align="justify">Strength is the main thought which strikes the mind when 
    gazing on those vast ramparts of cliff which front the raging sea, or peer 
    into the azure sky, piercing the clouds—but it is to the devout mind the 
    strength of God. Hints of Omnipotence are given by those stern rocks which 
    brave the fury of the elements, and like walls of brass defy the assaults of 
    nature in her wildest rage.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. The sea is his. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This was seen to be true at the Red Sea when the waters 
    saw their God, and obediently stood aside to open a pathway for his people. 
    It was not Edom's sea though it was red, nor Egypt's sea though it washed 
    her shores. The Lord on high reigned supreme over the flood, as King far 
    ever and ever. So is it with the broad ocean, whether known as Atlantic or 
    Pacific, Mediterranean or Arctic; no man can map it out and say "It is 
    mine." </p>
<p align="justify">The illimitable acreage of waters knows no other lord but 
    God alone. Jehovah rules the waves. Far down in vast abysses, where no eye 
    of man has gazed, or foot of diver has descended, he is sole proprietor. 
    Every rolling billow and foaming wave owns him for monarch; Neptune is but a 
    phantom, the Lord is God of ocean. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he made it. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Hence his right and sovereignty. He scooped the 
    unfathomed channel and poured forth the overflowing flood; seas were not 
    fashioned by chance, nor their shores marked out by the imaginary finger of 
    fate. God made the main, and every creek, and bay, and current, and far 
    sounding tide—owns the great Maker's hand. All hail, Creator and Controller 
    of the sea, let those who fly in the swift ships across the wonder realm of 
    waters worship you alone! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his hands formed the dry land. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Whether fertile field or sandy waste, he made all that 
    men called <i>terra firma</i>, lifting it from the floods and fencing it 
    from the overflowing waters. "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness 
    thereof." He bade the islands upraise their heads, he leveled the vast 
    plains, upreared the table lands, cast up the undulating hills, and piled 
    the massive Alps.<i> As the potter molds his clay, so did Jehovah with his 
    hands fashion the whole the earth</i>. Come you, then, who dwell on this 
    fair world, and worship him who is conspicuous wherever you tread! Count it 
    all as the floor of a temple where the footprints of the present Deity are 
    visible before your eyes, if you do but care to see. The argument is 
    overpowering if the heart be right; the command to adore is alike the 
    inference of reason and the impulse of faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. O come, let us worship and bow down. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here the exhortation to worship is renewed and backed 
    with a motive which, to Israel of old and to Christians now, is especially 
    powerful; for both the Israel after the flesh and the Israel of faith may be 
    described as the people of his pasture, and by both he is called "our God."
    </p>
<p align="justify">The adoration is to be humble. The "joyful noise" is to 
    be accompanied with lowliest reverence. We are to worship in such style that 
    the <i>bowing down </i>shall indicate that we count ourselves to be as 
    nothing in the presence of the all glorious Lord. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let us kneel before the Lord our maker. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As suppliants must we come; joyful—but not presumptuous; 
    familiar as children before a father—yet reverential as creatures before 
    their maker. Posture is not everything—yet is it something; prayer is heard 
    when knees cannot bend—but it is fitting that an adoring heart should show 
    its awe by prostrating the body, and bending the knee.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. For he is our God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here is the master reason for worship. Jehovah has 
    entered into covenant with us, and from all the world beside has chosen us 
    to be his own elect. If others refuse him homage, we at least will render it 
    cheerfully. He is ours, and our God; ours, therefore will we love him; our 
    God, therefore will we worship him. Happy is that man who can sincerely 
    believe that this sentence is true in reference to himself. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of 
    his hand.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As he belongs to us, so do we belong to him. "My Beloved 
    is mine, and I am his." And we are his as the people whom he daily feeds and 
    protects. Our pastures are not ours—but his; we draw all our supplies from 
    his stores. We are his, even as sheep belong to the shepherd, and his hand 
    is our rule, our guidance, our government, our support, our source of 
    supply. </p>
<p align="justify">Israel was led through the desert, and we are led through 
    this life by "that great Shepherd of the sheep." The hand which cleft the 
    sea and brought water from the rock is still with us, working equal wonders. 
    Can we refuse to "worship and bow down" when we clearly see that "this God 
    is our God forever and ever, and will be our guide, even unto death"?</p>
<p align="justify">But what is this warning which follows? Alas, it was 
    sorrowfully needed by the Lord's ancient people, and is not one whit the 
    less required by ourselves. The favored nation grew deaf to their Lord's 
    command, and proved not to be truly his sheep, of whom it is written, "My 
    sheep hear my voice": will this turn out to be our character also? God 
    forbid. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Today <i>if </i>you will hear his voice.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Dreadful "if." Many would not hear, they put off the 
    claims of love, and provoked their God. "Today," is the hour of grace, in 
    the day of mercy, we are tried as to whether we have an ear for the voice of 
    our Creator. Nothing is said of tomorrow, "he limits a certain day," he 
    presses for immediate attention, for our own sakes he asks instantaneous 
    obedience. Shall we yield it? The Holy Spirit says "Today," will we grieve 
    him by delay?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Harden not your heart.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">If you will hear, learn to fear also. The sea and the 
    land obey him, do not prove more obstinate than they!</p>
<p align="justify">We cannot soften our hearts—but we can harden them, and 
    the consequences will be fatal. Today is too good a day to be profaned by 
    the hardening of our hearts against our own mercies. While mercy reigns let 
    not obduracy rebel. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">As in the provocations, and as in the day of testing in 
    the wilderness. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or, "like Meribah, like the day of Massah in the 
    wilderness". Be not willfully, wantonly, repeatedly, obstinately rebellious. 
    Let the example of that unhappy generation serve as a beacon to you; do not 
    repeat the offences which have already more than enough provoked the Lord.
    <i>God remembers men's sins, and the more memorably so when they are 
    committed by a favored people, against frequent warnings, in defiance of 
    terrible judgments, and in the midst of superlative mercies; such sins write 
    their record in marble</i>. Reader, this verse is for you, for you even if 
    you can say, "He is our God, and we are the people of his pasture." Do not 
    seek to turn aside the edge of the warning—you have good need of it, give 
    good heed to it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. When your fathers tempted me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As far as they could do so, they tempted God to change 
    his usual way, and to do their sinful bidding, and though he cannot be 
    tempted of evil, and will never yield to wicked requests—yet their intent 
    was the same, and their guilt was none the less. </p>
<p align="justify">God's way is perfect, and when we would have him alter it 
    to please us, we are guilty of tempting him; and the fact that we do so in 
    vain, while it magnifies the Lord's holiness, by no means excuses our guilt. 
    We are in most danger of this sin in times of need, for then it is that we 
    are apt to fall into unbelief, and to demand a change in those arrangements 
    of providence which are the transcript of perfect holiness and infinite 
    wisdom. </p>
<p align="justify">Not to acquiesce in the will of God is virtually to tempt 
    him to alter his plans to suit our imperfect views of how the universe 
    should be governed. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Proved me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They put the Lord to needless tests, demanding new 
    miracles, fresh interpositions, and renewed tokens of his presence. Do not 
    we also peevishly require frequent signs of the Lord's love other than those 
    which every hour supplies? Are we not prone to demand special treatments, 
    with the alternative secretly offered in our hearts, that if they do not 
    come at our bidding we will disbelieve? True, the Lord is very 
    condescending, and frequently grants us marvelous evidences of his power—but 
    we ought not to require them. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Steady faith is due to one who is so constantly kind. </p></i>
    After so many proofs of his love, we are ungrateful to wish to prove him 
    again, unless it be in those ways of his own appointing, in which he has 
    said, "Prove me now." 
<p align="justify">If we were forever testing the love of our wife or 
    husband, and remained unconvinced after years of faithfulness, we would wear 
    out the utmost human patience. Friendship only flourishes in the atmosphere 
    of confidence, suspicion is deadly to it: shall the Lord God, true and 
    immutable, be day after day suspected by his own people? Will not this 
    provoke him to anger? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And saw my work. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They tested him again and again, through out forty years, 
    though each time his work was conclusive evidence of his faithfulness. 
    Nothing could convince them for long.</p>
<p align="justify">"They saw his wonders wrought,<br/>
    And then his praise they sung; <br/>
    But soon his works of power forgot,<br/>
    And murmured with their tongue."</p>
<p align="justify">"Now they believe his word,<br/>
    While rocks with rivers flow; <br/>
    Now with their lusts provoke the Lord,<br/>
    And he reduced them low."</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Fickleness is bound up in the heart of man, unbelief is 
    our besetting sin; we must forever be seeing, or we waver in our believing.</p></i> 
    This is no mean offence, and will bring with it no small punishment.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Forty years long was I grieved with this 
    generation. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The impression upon the divine mind is most vivid; he 
    sees them before him now, and calls them "this generation." He does not 
    leave his prophets to upbraid the sin—but himself utters the complaint and 
    declares that he was <i>grieved, nauseated, and disgusted</i>. It is no 
    small thing which can grieve our long suffering God to the extent which the 
    Hebrew word here indicates, and if we reflect a moment we shall see the 
    abundant provocation given; for <i>no one who values his veracity can endure 
    to be suspected, mistrusted, and belied, when there is no ground for it—but 
    on the contrary the most overwhelming reason for confidence. </i></p>

<p align="justify">To such base treatment was the tender Shepherd of Israel 
    exposed, not for a day or a month—but for forty years at a stretch, and that 
    not by here and there an unbeliever—but by a whole nation, in which only two 
    men were found so thoroughly believing as to be exempted from the doom which 
    at last was pronounced upon all the rest. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Which shall we most wonder at, the cruel insolence of 
    man—or the tender patience of the Lord? </p></i>Which shall leave the deepest 
    impression on our minds, the sin or the punishment? Unbelief, or the barring 
    of the gates of Jehovah's rest against the unbelievers? 
<b>
<p align="justify">And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and 
    they have not known my ways. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Their heart was obstinately and constantly at fault. It 
    was not their <i>head </i>which erred—but their very <i>heart </i>was 
    perverse. Love, which appealed to their affections, could not convert them. 
    The heart is the main spring of the man, and if it is not in order, the 
    entire nature is thrown out of gear. <i>If sin were only skin deep, it might 
    be a slight matter; but since it has defiled the soul, the case is bad 
    indeed. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Taught as they were by Jehovah himself in lessons 
    illustrated by miracles, which came to them daily in the manna from Heaven, 
    and the water from the flinty rock—they ought to have learned something. It 
    was a foul shame that they remained obstinately ignorant, and would not know 
    the ways of God. Wanderers in body, they were also wanderers in heart, and 
    the plain providential goodness of their God remained to their blinded minds 
    as great a maze as those twisting paths by which he led them through the 
    wilderness. </p>
<p align="justify">Are we better than they?<i> Are we not quite as apt to 
    misinterpret the dealings of the Lord? </i>Have we suffered and enjoyed so 
    many things in vain? With many it is even so. Forty years of providential 
    wisdom, yes, and even a longer period of experience, have failed to teach 
    them serenity of assurance, and firmness of reliance. There is ground for 
    much searching of heart concerning this. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Many treat unbelief as a minor fault, they even regard it 
    rather as an infirmity than a sin</p></i>—but the Lord thinks not so. Faith is 
    Jehovah's due, especially from those who claim to be the people of his 
    pasture, and yet more emphatically from those whose long life has been 
    crowded with evidences of his goodness. Unbelief insults one of the dearest 
    attributes of Deity, it does so needlessly and without the slightest ground 
    and in defiance of all sufficient arguments, weighty with the eloquence of 
    love. <i>Let us in reading this psalm examine ourselves, and lay these 
    things to heart.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Unto whom I swore in my wrath that they should 
    not enter into my rest. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There can be no rest to an unbelieving heart. If manna 
    and miracles could not satisfy Israel, neither would they have been content 
    with the land which flowed with milk and honey. Canaan was to be the typical 
    resting place of God, where his ark should abide, and the ordinances of true 
    religion should be established. The Lord had for forty years borne with the 
    ill manners of the generation which came out of Egypt, and it was but right 
    that he should resolve to have no more of them. Was it not enough that they 
    had revolted all along that marvelous wilderness march? Should they be 
    allowed to make new Massahs and Meribahs in the Promised Land itself? 
    Jehovah would not have it so.</p>
<p align="justify">He not only <i>said </i>but <i>swore </i>that into his 
    rest they should not come, and that oath excluded every one of them; their 
    carcasses fell in the wilderness. <i>Solemn warning to all who leave the way 
    of faith for paths of petulant murmuring and mistrust. </i>The rebels of old 
    could not enter in because of unbelief, "let us therefore fear, lest, a 
    promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should even seem 
    to come short of it." </p>
<p align="justify">One blessed inference from this psalm must not be 
    forgotten. It is clear that there is a rest of God, and that some must enter 
    into it: but "they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of 
    unbelief, there remains therefore a rest to the people of God." The 
    unbelievers could not enter—but "we who have believed do enter into rest." 
    Let us enjoy it, and praise the Lord for it forever. Ours is the true 
    Sabbatic rest, it is ours to rest from out own works as God did from his. 
    While we do so, let us "come into his presence with thanksgiving, and make a 
    joyful noise unto him with psalms."</p>
