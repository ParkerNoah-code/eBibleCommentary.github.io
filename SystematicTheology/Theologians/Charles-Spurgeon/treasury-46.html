<p align="center">PSALM 45<br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. The many titles of this Psalm mark its royalty, 
    its deep and solemn import, and the delight the writer had in it. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To the Chief Musician </p></b>upon Shoshannim. The most 
    probable translation of this word is <i>upon the lilies</i>, and it is 
    either a poetic title given to this noblest of songs after the Oriental 
    manner, or it may relate to the tune to which it was set, or to the 
    instrument which was meant to accompany it. We incline to the first theory, 
    and if it be the true one, it is easy to see the fitness of borrowing a name 
    for so beautiful, so pure, so choice, so matchless a poem from the golden 
    lilies, whose bright array outshone the glory of Solomon. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For the sons of Korah</p></b>. Special singers are appointed 
    for so divine a hymn. King Jesus deserves to be praised not with random, 
    ranting ravings—but with the sweetest and most skillful music of the best 
    trained choristers. <i>The purest hearts in the spiritual temple are the 
    most harmonious songsters in the ears of God</i>. <i>Acceptable song is not 
    a matter so much of tuneful voices as of sanctified affections</i>, but in 
    no case should we sing of Jesus with unprepared hearts. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Maschil</p></b>, an instructive ode, not an idle lay, or a 
    romancing ballad, but a Psalm of holy teaching, didactic and doctrinal. This 
    proves that it is to be spiritually understood. Blessed are the people who 
    know the meaning of its joyful sound. 
<b>
<p align="justify">A Song of loves</p></b>. Not a carnal sentimental love song, 
    but a celestial canticle of everlasting love fit for the tongues and ears of 
    angels.
<p align="justify">SUBJECT. Some here see Solomon and Pharaoh's daughter 
    only—they are short-sighted. Others see both Solomon and Christ—they are 
    cross-eyed. Well focused spiritual eyes see here Jesus only—or if Solomon be 
    present at all, it must be like those hazy shadows of by passers which cross 
    the face of the camera, and therefore are dimly traceable upon a 
    photographic landscape. </p>
<p align="justify">"The King," the God whose throne is forever and ever, is 
    no mere mortal and his everlasting dominion is not bounded by Lebanon and 
    Egypt's river. This is no wedding song of earthly nuptials, but an 
    Epithalamium for the Heavenly Bridegroom and his elect spouse.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. Verses 1 is an announcement of intention, a 
    preface to the song. </p>
<p align="justify">Verses 3 adores the matchless beauty of Messiah.</p>
<p align="justify">In Verses 3-9, he is addressed in admiring ascriptions of 
    praise.</p>
<p align="justify">Verses 10-12 are spoken to the bride. </p>
<p align="justify">The church is further spoken of in Verses 13-15.</p>
<p align="justify">The Psalm closes with another address to the King, 
    foretelling his eternal fame, Verses 16-17.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. My heart</p></b>.<i> There is no writing like that 
    dictated by the heart. Heartless hymns are insults to Heaven. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Is inditing a good matter.</p></b> A good heart will only be 
    content with good thoughts. Where the fountain is good, good streams will 
    flow forth. 
<p align="justify">The learned tell us that the word may be read <i>
    overflows</i>, or as others, boils or <i>bubbles </i>up—denoting the warmth 
    of the writer's love, the fullness of his heart, and the consequent richness 
    and glow of his utterance, as though it were the ebullition of his inmost 
    soul, when most full of affection. </p>
<p align="justify">We have here no single cold expression; the writer is not 
    one who frigidly studies the elegancies and proprieties of poetry, <i>his 
    stanzas are the natural outburst of his soul</i>. As the corn offered in 
    sacrifice was parched in the pan, so is this tribute of love hot with 
    sincere devotion. </p>
<p align="justify">It is a sad thing when the heart is cold with a good 
    matter, and worse when it is warm with a bad matter, but incomparably 
    blessed when a warm heart and a good matter meet together. O that we may 
    often offer to God acceptable worship, a sweet oblation fresh from the pan 
    of hearts warmed with gratitude and admiration. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I speak of the things which I have made touching the 
    King.</p></b> This song has "the King" for its only subject, and for the King's 
    honor alone was it composed—well might its writer call it a good matter. The 
    psalmist did not write carelessly; he calls his poem his works, or things 
    which he had made. We are not to offer to the Lord that which costs us 
    nothing.
<p align="justify">Good material deserves good workmanship. We should well 
    digest in our heart's affections and our mind's meditations, any discourse 
    or poem in which we speak of one so great and glorious as our Royal Lord.
    </p>
<p align="justify">As our version reads it, the psalmist wrote <i>
    experimentally </i>things which he had made his own, and personally tasted 
    and handled concerning the King. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">My tongue is the pen of a ready writer</p></b>, not so much 
    for rapidity, for there the tongue always has the preference, but for 
    exactness, elaboration, deliberation, and skilfulness of expression.
<p align="justify">Seldom are the excited utterances of the mouth equal in 
    real weight and accuracy to the writings of a thoughtful accomplished 
    penman; but here the writer, though filled with enthusiasm, speaks as 
    correctly as a practiced writer; his utterances therefore are no ephemeral 
    sentences, but such as fall from men who sit down calmly to write for 
    eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not always that the best of men are in such a key, 
    and when they are they should not restrain the gush of their hallowed 
    feelings. Such a condition of heart in a gifted mind creates that gracious 
    hour in which poetry pours forth her tuneful numbers to enrich the service 
    of song in the house of the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. You. </p></b>As though the King himself had suddenly 
    appeared before him—the psalmist lost in admiration of his person, turns 
    from his preface to address his Lord. 
<i>
<p align="justify">A loving heart has the power to realize its object.</p></i> 
    The eyes of a true heart see more than the eyes of the head. 
<p align="justify">Moreover, Jesus reveals himself when we are pouring forth 
    our affections towards him. It is usually the case that when we are ready 
    Christ appears. If our heart is warm, it is an index that the sun is 
    shining, and when we enjoy his heat we shall soon behold his light. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You are fairer than the children of men.</p></b> In person, 
    but especially in mind and character, the King of saints is peerless in 
    beauty. The Hebrew word is doubled, "Beautiful, beautiful are you."<i> Jesus 
    is so emphatically lovely that words must be doubled, strained, yes, 
    exhausted before he can be described. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Among the children of men many have through grace been 
    lovely in character—yet they have each had flaws. But in Jesus we behold 
    every feature of a perfect character in harmonious proportion. He is lovely 
    everywhere, and from every point of view—but never more so than when we view 
    him in conjugal union with his church; then love gives a ravishing flush of 
    glory to his loveliness. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Grace is poured into your lips. </p></b><i>Beauty </i>and <i>
    eloquence </i>make a man majestic when they are united. They both dwell in 
    perfection in the all fair, all eloquent Lord Jesus. Grace of <i>person </i>
    and grace of <i>speech </i>reach their highest point in him. Grace has in 
    the most copious manner been poured upon Christ, for it pleased the Father 
    that in him should all fullness dwell, and now <i>grace is in 
    superabundance, poured forth from his lips to cheer and enrich his people</i>.
    
<p align="justify">The testimony, the promises, the invitations, the 
    consolations of our King pour forth from him in such volumes of meaning that 
    we cannot but contrast those cataracts of grace with the speech of Moses 
    which did but drop as the rain, and distill as the dew. Whoever in personal 
    communion with the Well-beloved has listened to his voice will feel that 
    "never man spoke like this man." </p>
<p align="justify">Well did the bride say of him, "his lips are like lilies 
    dropping sweet smelling myrrh." One word from himself dissolved the heart of 
    Saul of Tarsus, and turned him into an apostle. Another word raised up John 
    the Divine when fainting in the Isle of Patmos. Oftentimes a sentence from 
    his lips has turned our own midnight into morning, our winter into spring.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Therefore God has blessed you forever.</p></b> Calvin reads 
    it,<i> Because God has blessed you forever. </i>Christ is blessed of God, 
    blessed forever. This is to us one great reason for his beauty, and the 
    source of the gracious words which proceed out of his lips. The rare 
    endowments of the man Christ Jesus are given to him by the Father, that by 
    them his people may be blessed with all spiritual blessings in union with 
    himself. 
<p align="justify">But if we take our own translation, we read that the 
    Father has blessed the Mediator as a reward for all his gracious labors; and 
    right well does he deserve the recompense. Whom God blesses we should bless, 
    and the more so because all his blessedness is communicated to us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Gird your sword upon your thigh.</p></b> Loving 
    spirits jealous of the Redeemer's glory long to see him putting forth his 
    power to vindicate his own most holy cause. Why should the sword of the 
    Spirit lie still, like a weapon hung up in an armory; it is sharp and 
    strong, both for cutting and piercing. O that the divine power of Jesus were 
    put forth to use against error. 
<p align="justify">The words before us represent our great King as urged to 
    arm himself for battle, by placing his sword where it is ready for use. 
    Christ is the true champion of the church, others are but underlings who 
    must borrow strength from him; the single arm of Immanuel is the sole hope 
    of the faithful. </p>
<p align="justify">Our prayer should be that of this verse. There is at this 
    moment an apparent suspension of our Lord's former power, we must by 
    importunate prayer call him to the conflict, for like the Greeks without 
    Achilles we are soon overcome by our enemies, and we are but dead men if 
    Jesus be not in our midst. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O most mighty One.</p></b> A title well deserved, and not 
    given from empty courtesy like the serenities, excellencies and highnesses 
    of our fellow mortals—titles, which are but sops for vain glory. 
<p align="justify">Jesus is the truest of heroes. Hero worship in his case 
    alone is commendable. He is mighty to save, mighty in love. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">With your glory and your majesty.</p></b> Let your sword both 
    win you renown and dominion, or as it may mean, gird on with your sword your 
    robes which indicate your royal splendor. 
<p align="justify">Love delights to see the Beloved arrayed as befits his 
    excellency; she weeps as she sees him in the garments of humiliation, she 
    rejoices to behold him in the vestments of his exaltation. </p>
<p align="justify">Our precious Christ can never be made too much of. Heaven 
    itself is but just good enough for him. All the pomp that angels and 
    archangels, and thrones, and dominions, and principalities, and powers can 
    pour at his feet, is too little for him. Only his own essential glory is 
    such as fully answers to the desire of his people, who can never extol him 
    enough.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. And in your majesty ride prosperously.</p></b> The 
    hero monarch armed and appareled is now entreated to ascend his triumphal 
    chariot. Would to God that our Immanuel would come forth in the chariot of 
    love to conquer our spiritual foes and seize by power the souls whom he has 
    bought with blood. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Because of truth and meekness and righteousness. </p></b>
    These words may be rendered, ride forth upon truth and meekness and 
    righteousness. These are three noble chargers to draw the war chariot of the 
    gospel. In the sense of our translation it is a most potent argument to urge 
    with our Lord that the cause of the true, the humble, and the good, calls 
    for his advocacy. <i>Truth </i>will be ridiculed, <i>meekness </i>will be 
    oppressed, and <i>righteousness </i>slain—unless the God, the Man in whom 
    these precious things are incarnated, shall arise for their vindication. 
<p align="justify">Our earnest petition ought ever to be that Jesus would 
    lay his almighty arm to the work of grace lest the good cause languish and 
    wickedness prevail. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And your right hand shall display awesome deeds.</p></b> 
    Foreseeing the result of divine working, the psalmist prophesies that the 
    uplifted arm of Messiah will reveal to the King's own eyes the terrible 
    overthrow of his foes. Jesus needs no guide but his own right hand, no 
    teacher but his own might; may he instruct us all in what he can perform, by 
    achieving it speedily before our gladdened eyes.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Your arrows. </p></b>Our King is master of all 
    weapons: he can strike those who are near and those afar off with equal 
    force. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Are sharp.</p></b> Nothing that Jesus does is ill done, he 
    uses no blunted shafts, no pointless darts. 
<b>
<p align="justify">In the heart of the King's enemies. </p></b>Our Captain aims 
    at men's hearts rather than their heads, and he hits them too; point blank 
    are his shots, and they enter deep into the vital part of man's nature. 
    Whether for <i>love </i>or <i>vengeance</i>—Christ never misses aim, and 
    when his arrows stick, they cause a smart not soon forgotten, a wound which 
    only he can heal.
<p align="justify">Jesus' <i>arrows of conviction </i>are sharp in the 
    quiver of his <i>word</i>, and sharp when on the bow of his <i>ministers</i>, 
    but they are most known to be so when they find a way into careless hearts. 
    They are his arrows, he made them, he shoots them. He makes them sharp, and 
    he makes them enter the heart. </p>
<p align="justify">May none of us ever fall under the darts of his judgment, 
    for none kill so surely as they. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Whereby the people fall under you.</p></b> On either side the 
    slain of the Lord are many when Jesus leads on the war. Nations tremble and 
    turn to him when he shoots abroad his truth. Under his power and presence, 
    men are stricken down as though pierced to the heart. There is no standing 
    against the Son of God when his bow of might is in his hands. Terrible will 
    be that hour when his bow shall be made quite naked, and bolts of devouring 
    fire shall be hurled upon his adversaries—then shall princes fall and 
    nations perish.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. </p></b>To 
    whom can this be spoken but our Lord? The psalmist cannot restrain his 
    adoration. His enlightened eye sees in the royal Husband of the church, God, 
    God to be adored, God reigning, God reigning everlastingly. 
<p align="justify">Blessed sight! Blind are the eyes that cannot see God in 
    Christ Jesus! We never appreciate the tender condescension of our King in 
    becoming one flesh with his church, and placing her at his right hand, until 
    we have fully rejoiced in his essential glory and deity. What a mercy for us 
    that our Savior is God, for who but a God could execute the work of 
    salvation? What a glad thing it is that he reigns on a throne which will 
    never pass away, for we need both <i>sovereign grace </i>and <i>eternal love
    </i>to secure our happiness. Could Jesus cease to reign, then we should 
    cease to be blessed. Were he not God, and therefore eternal, this must be 
    the case. No throne can endure forever, but that on which God himself sits.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The scepter of your kingdom is a righteous scepter.</p></b> 
    He is the lawful monarch of all things that be. His rule is founded in 
    right, its law is right, its result is right. Our King is no usurper and no 
    oppressor. Even when he shall break his enemies with a rod of iron, he will 
    do no man wrong; his vengeance and his grace are both in conformity with 
    justice. Hence we trust him without suspicion; he cannot err. <i>No 
    affliction is too severe, for he sends it; no judgment too harsh, for he 
    ordains it. </i>O blessed hands of Jesus! the reigning power is safe with 
    you. All the just rejoice in the government of the King who reigns in 
    righteousness.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. You love righteousness, and hate wickedness.</p></b> 
    Christ Jesus is not neutral in the great contest between right and wrong: as 
    warmly as he loves the one, he abhors the other. What qualifications for a 
    sovereign! what grounds of confidence for a people! 
<p align="justify">The whole of our Lord's life on earth proved the truth of 
    these words. His <i>death </i>to put away sin and bring in the reign of 
    righteousness, sealed the fact beyond all question. His <i>providence </i>by 
    which he rules from his mediatorial throne, when rightly understood, reveals 
    the same. His final <i>assize </i>will proclaim it before all worlds. </p>
<p align="justify">We should imitate him both in his love and hate; they are 
    both needful to complete a righteous character. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of 
    gladness above your fellows.</p></b> Jesus as Mediator owned God as his God, to 
    whom, being found in fashion as a man, he became obedient. On account of our 
    Lord's perfect life, he is now rewarded with superior joy. Others there are 
    to whom grace has given a sacred fellowship with him, but by their universal 
    consent and his own merit, he is prince among them, the gladdest of all 
    because the cause of all their gladness.
<p align="justify">At Oriental feasts <i>oil </i>was poured on the heads of 
    distinguished and very welcome guests. God himself anoints the man Christ 
    Jesus, as he sits at the heavenly feasts, anoints him as a reward for his 
    work, with higher and fuller joy than any else can know; thus is the Son of 
    man honored and rewarded for all his pains.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe the indisputable testimony to Messiah's Deity in 
    verse six, and to his manhood in the present verse. Of whom could this be 
    written but of Jesus of Nazareth? Our Christ is our Elohim. Jesus is God 
    with us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and 
    cassia.</p></b> The divine anointing causes fragrance to distill from the robes 
    of the Mighty Hero. He is delightful to every sense: to the <i>eyes </i>most 
    fair, to the <i>ear </i>most gracious, to the spiritual <i>nostril </i>most 
    sweet. 
<p align="justify">The excellencies of Jesus are all most precious, 
    comparable to the rarest spices. They are most varied, and to be likened not 
    to myrrh alone, but to all the perfumes blended in due proportion. </p>
<p align="justify">The Father always finds a pleasure in him, in him he is 
    well pleased; and all regenerated spirits rejoice in him, for he is made of 
    God unto us, "wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption." </p>
<p align="justify">Note that not only is Jesus most sweet, but even his 
    garments are so; everything that he has to do with, is perfumed by his 
    person. All his garments are thus fragrant; not some of them, but all. We 
    delight as much in his purple of dominion as in the white of his priesthood. 
    His mantle as our prophet is as dear to us as his seamless coat as our 
    friend. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">All his dress is fragrant with all sweetness.</p></b> To 
    attempt to spiritualize each spice here mentioned would be unprofitable—the 
    evident sense is that all sweetnesses meet in Jesus, and are poured forth 
    wherever he is present. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you 
    glad.</p></b> The abode of Jesus now is imperial in splendor, ivory and gold but 
    faintly image his royal seat. There he is made glad in the presence of the 
    Father, and in the company of his saints. 
<p align="justify">Oh, to behold him with his perfumed garments on! The very 
    smell of him from afar ravishes our spirit, what must it be to be on the 
    other side of the pearl gate, within the palace of ivory, amid those halls 
    of Zion, jubilant with song—where the throne of David is, and the abiding 
    presence of the Prince! To think of his gladness, to know that he is full of 
    joy, gives gladness at this moment to our souls. We poor exiles can sing in 
    our banishment since our King, our Well-beloved, has come to his throne!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. King's daughters were among your honorable 
    women.</p></b> Our Lord's courts lack not for courtiers, and those the fairest 
    and noblest. Virgin souls are maids of honor to the court, the true lilies 
    of Heaven. <i>The lowly and pure in heart are esteemed by the Lord Jesus as 
    his most familiar friends, their place in his palace is not among the 
    menials but near the throne</i>. The day will come when those who are 
    "king's daughters" literally will count it their greatest honor to serve the 
    church, meanwhile every believing sister is spiritually a King's daughter, a 
    member of the royal family of Heaven. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Upon your right hand</p></b>, in the place of love, honor, 
    and power, did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. The church shares her 
    Lord's honor and happiness, he sets her in the place of dignity, he clothes 
    her with the best of the best. Gold is the richest of metals, and Ophir gold 
    the purest known. 
<p align="justify">Jesus bestows nothing inferior or of secondary value upon 
    his beloved church. In <i>imparted </i>and <i>imputed </i>righteousness the 
    church is divinely arrayed. Happy those who are members of a church so 
    honored, so beloved; unhappy those who persecute the beloved people, for as 
    a husband will not endure that his wife should be insulted or maltreated, so 
    neither will the heavenly Husband; he will speedily avenge his own elect.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Mark, then, the solemn pomp of the verses we have read. 
    The King is seen with rapture, he girds himself as a warrior, robes himself 
    as a monarch, mounts his chariot, darts his arrows, and conquers his foes. 
    Then he ascends his throne with his scepter in his hand, fills the palace 
    hall with perfume brought from his secret chambers, his retinue stand around 
    him, and, fairest of all, his bride is at his right hand, with daughters of 
    subject princes as her attendants. Faith is no stranger to this sight, and 
    every time she looks she adores, she loves, she rejoices, she expects.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Hearken, O daughter, and consider.</p></b> Ever is 
    this the great duty of the church. Faith comes by hearing, and confirmation 
    by consideration. No precept can be more worthy of the attention of those 
    who are honored to be espoused to Christ that that which follows. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And incline your ear.</p></b> Lean forward so that no 
    syllable may be unheard. The whole faculties of the mind should be bent upon 
    receiving holy teaching. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Forget also your own people, and your father's house. </p></b>
    To renounce the world is not easy, but it must be done by all who are 
    affianced to the Great King, for a divided heart he cannot endure; it would 
    be misery to the beloved one as well as dishonor to her Lord. 
<p align="justify">Evil acquaintances, and even those who are but neutral, 
    must be forsaken, they can confer no benefits, they must inflict injury. </p>
<p align="justify">The house of our nativity is the house of sin—we were 
    shaped in iniquity; the carnal mind is enmity against God, we must come 
    forth of the house of fallen nature, for it is built in the City of 
    Destruction. Not that natural ties are broken by grace, but ties of the 
    sinful nature, bonds of graceless affinity. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">We have much to forget as well as to learn</p></i>, and the 
    unlearning is so difficult that only diligent hearing, and considering, and 
    bending of the whole soul to it, can accomplish the work; and even these 
    would be too feeble did not divine grace assist. 
<p align="justify">Yet why should we remember the Egypt from which we cam 
    out? Are the leeks and the garlic, and the onions anything—when the iron 
    bondage, and the slavish tasks, and the death dealing Pharaoh of Hell are 
    remembered? We part . . .<br/>
    with folly, for wisdom,<br/>
    with bubbles, for eternal joys,<br/>
    with deceit, for truth,<br/>
    with misery, for bliss,<br/>
    with idols, for the living God. </p>
<p align="justify">O that Christians were more mindful of the divine precept 
    here recorded. But, alas! worldliness abounds; the church is defiled; and 
    the glory of the Great King is veiled. Only when the whole church leads the
    <i>separated life </i>will the full splendor and power of Christianity shine 
    forth upon the world.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. So shall the king greatly desire your beauty.
    </p></b>Wholehearted love is the duty and bliss of the marriage state in every 
    case, but especially so in this lofty mystical marriage. The church must 
    forsake all others and cleave to Jesus only, or she will not please him nor 
    enjoy the full manifestation of his love. What less can he ask, what less 
    may she dare propose, than to be wholly his? 
<p align="justify">Jesus sees a beauty in his church, a beauty which he 
    delights in most when it is not marred by worldliness. He has always been 
    most near and precious to his saints when they have cheerfully taken up his 
    cross and followed him outside the camp. His Spirit is grieved when they 
    mingle themselves among the people and learn their ways. No great and 
    lasting revival of religion can be granted us until the professed lovers of 
    Jesus prove their affection by coming out from an ungodly world, being 
    separated, and touching not the unclean thing. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For he is your Lord; worship him.</p></b> He has royal rights 
    still; his condescending grace does not lessen but rather enforce his 
    authority.<i> Our Savior is also our Ruler. </i>The husband is the head of 
    the wife; the love he bears her does not lessen, but strengthen her 
    obligation to obey. The church must reverence Jesus, and bow before him in 
    prostrate adoration. His tender union with her gives her liberty, but not 
    license. It frees her from all other burdens, but places his easy yoke upon 
    her neck. Who would wish it to be otherwise? The service of God is Heaven in 
    Heaven, and perfectly carried out. It is Heaven upon earth. 
<p align="justify">Jesus, you are he whom your church praises in her 
    unceasing songs, and adores in her perpetual service. Teach us to be wholly 
    your. Bear with us, and work by your Spirit in us until your will is done by 
    us on earth as it is in Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a 
    gift.</p></b> When the church abounds in holiness, she shall know no lack of 
    homage from the surrounding people. Her glory shall then impress and attract 
    the heathen around, until they also unite in doing honor to her Lord. 
<p align="justify">The power of missions abroad lies at home—a holy church 
    will be a powerful church. </p>
<p align="justify">Nor shall there be lack of treasure in her coffers, when 
    grace is in her heart. The free gifts of a willing people shall enable the 
    workers for God to carry on their sacred enterprise without stint. Commerce 
    shall send in its revenue to endow, not with forced levies and imperial 
    taxes, but with willing gifts, the church of the Great King. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.
    </p></b><i>Not by pandering to their follies, but by testifying against their 
    sins, shall the wealthy be won to the faith of Jesus. </i>They shall come 
    not to favor the church but to beg for her favor. She shall not be the 
    hireling of the great, but as a queen shall she dispense her favors to the 
    suppliant throng of the rich among the people. 
<p align="justify">We go about to beg for Christ like beggars for alms, and 
    many who should know better will make compromises and become reticent of 
    unpopular truth to please the great ones of the earth; not so will the true 
    bride of Christ degrade herself, when her sanctification is more deep and 
    more visible; then will the hearts of men grow liberal, and offerings from 
    afar, abundant and continual, shall be presented at the throne of the 
    Pacific Prince.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. The king's daughter is all glorious within. </p></b>
    Within her secret chambers her glory is great. Though unseen of men her Lord 
    sees her, and commends her. "It does not yet appear what we shall be." 
<p align="justify">Or the passage may be understood as meaning within 
    herself—her beauty is not outward only or mainly; <i>the choicest of her 
    charms are to be found in her heart, her secret character, her inward 
    desires</i>. Truth and wisdom in the hidden parts are what the Lord regards; 
    mere skin deep beauty is nothing in his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">The church is of royal extraction, of imperial dignity, 
    for she is a king's daughter; and she has been purified and renewed in 
    nature; for she is glorious within. </p>
<p align="justify">Note the word <b>all</b>. The Bridegroom was said to have 
    all his garments perfumed, and now the bride in all glorious 
    within—entireness and completeness are great points. There is no mixture of 
    ill savor in Jesus, nor shall there be alloy of unholiness in his people, 
    his church shall be presented without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Her clothing is of wrought gold.</p></b> Best material and 
    best workmanship. How laboriously did our Lord work out the precious 
    material of his righteousness into a vesture for his people! No embroidery 
    of golden threads can equal that masterpiece of holy art. Such clothing 
    befits one so honored by relationship to the Great King. The Lord looks to 
    it that nothing shall be wanting to the glory and beauty of his bride.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. She shall be brought unto the king in 
    embroidered garments.</p></b> The day comes when the celestial marriage shall be 
    openly celebrated, and these words describe the nuptial procession wherein 
    the queen is brought to her royal Husband attended by her handmaidens.
<p align="justify">In the latter-day glory, and in the consummation of all 
    things, the glory of the bride, the Lamb's wife, shall be seen by all the 
    universe with admiration!</p>
<p align="justify">While she was within doors, and her saints hidden ones, 
    the church was glorious; what will be her splendor when she shall appear in 
    the likeness of her Lord in the day of his manifestation? The finest 
    embroidery is but a faint image of the perfection of the church when 
    sanctified by the Spirit. This verse tells us of the ultimate rest of the 
    church—the King's own bosom; of the <i>way </i>she comes to it, she is 
    brought by the power of sovereign grace; of the <i>time </i>when this is 
    done—in the future, she shall be, it does not yet appear; of the state in 
    which she shall come—clad in richest array, and attended by brightest 
    spirits.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The virgins her companions that follow her shall be 
    brought unto you.</p></b> Those who love and serve the church for her Lord's 
    sake shall share in her bliss "in that day." In one sense they are a part of 
    the church, but for the sake of the imagery they are represented as maids of 
    honor; and, though the figure may seem incongruous, they are represented as 
    brought to the King with the same loving familiarity as the bride, because 
    the true servants of the church are of the church, and partake in all her 
    happiness.
<p align="justify">Note that those who are admitted to everlasting communion 
    with Christ, are pure in heart—virgins; pure in company—her companions; pure 
    in walk—that follow her. Let none hope to be brought into Heaven at last who 
    are not purified now.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be 
    brought. </p></b>Joy befits a marriage feast. What joy will that be which will 
    be seen at the feasts of paradise when all the redeemed shall be brought 
    home! Gladness in the saints themselves, and rejoicing from the angels shall 
    make the halls of the New Jerusalem ring again with shoutings. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They shall enter into the King's palace. </p></b>Their 
    peaceful abodes shall be where Jesus the King reigns in state forever. They 
    shall not be shut out, but shut in. Rights of free entrance into the holiest 
    of all shall be accorded them. Brought by grace, they shall enter into 
    glory. If there was joy in the bringing—then what in the entering? What in 
    the abiding? The glorified are not field laborers in the <i>plains </i>of 
    Heaven—but sons who dwell at home, princes of the blood, resident in the 
    royal palace. Happy hour when we shall enjoy all this and <i>forget the 
    sorrows of time in the triumph of eternity.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. Instead of your fathers shall be your children.</p></b> 
    The ancient saints who stood as fathers in the service of the Great King 
    have all passed away; but a spiritual seed is found to fill their places. 
    The veterans depart, but volunteers fill up the vacant places.<i> The line 
    of grace never becomes extinct. </i>As long as time shall last, the true 
    apostolic succession will be maintained. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Whom you may make princes in all the earth.</p></b> Servants 
    of Christ are kings. Where a man has preached successfully, and evangelized 
    a tribe or nation—he gets to himself more than regal honors, and his name is 
    like the name of the great men that be upon the earth. Jesus is the king 
    maker. Ambition of the noblest kind shall win her desire in the army of 
    Christ; immortal crowns are distributed to his faithful soldiers. The whole 
    earth shall yet be subdued for Christ. Honored are they, who shall, through 
    grace, have a share in the conquest—these shall reign with Christ at his 
    coming.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. I will make your name to be remembered in all 
    generations.</p></b> Jehovah by the prophet's mouth, promises to the Prince of 
    Peace eternal fame as well as a continuous progeny. <i>His name is his fame, 
    his character, his person</i>. These are dear to his people now—they never 
    can forget them; and it shall be so as long as men exist. Names renowned in 
    one generation have been unknown to the next era, but the laurels of Jesus 
    shall ever be fresh, his renown ever new. God will see to this; his 
    providence and his grace shall make it so.
<p align="justify">The fame of Messiah is not left to human guardianship; 
    the Eternal guarantees it, and his promise never fails. All down the ages 
    the memories of Gethsemane and Calvary shall glow with inextinguishable 
    light; nor shall the lapse of time, the smoke of error, or the malice of 
    Hell—be able to dim the glory of the Redeemer's fame.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Therefore shall the people praise you forever and ever.</p></b> 
    They shall confess you to be what you are, and shall render to you in 
    perpetuity the homage due. Praise is due from every heart—to him who loved 
    us, and redeemed us by his blood. This praise will never be fully paid, but 
    will be ever a standing and growing debt. His daily benefits enlarge our 
    obligations—let them increase the number of our songs. Age to age reveals 
    more of his love, let every year swell the volume of the music of earth and 
    Heaven, and let thunders of song resound to the throne of him who lives, and 
    was dead, and is alive for evermore, and has the keys of Hell and of death.
<p align="justify">"Let him be crowned with majesty<br/>
    Who bowed his head to death,<br/>
    And be his honors sounded high<br/>
    By all things that have breath!"</p>
