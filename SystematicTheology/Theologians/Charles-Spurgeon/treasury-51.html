          TITLE. <b>A Psalm of Asaph. </b>This is the first of the Psalms of
          Asaph, but whether the production of that eminent musician, or merely
          dedicated to him, we cannot tell. The titles of twelve Psalms bear his
          name, but it could not in all of them be meant to ascribe their
          authorship to him, for several of these Psalms are of too late a date
          to have been composed by the same writer as the others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There was an Asaph in David's time, who was one of David's chief
          musicians, and his family appear to have continued long after in their
          hereditary office of temple musicians.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An Asaph is mentioned as a recorder or secretary in the days of
          Hezekiah 2 Kings 18:18, and another was keeper of the royal forests
          under Artaxerxes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That Asaph did most certainly write some of the Psalms is clear from 2
          Chronicles 29:30, where it is recorded that the Levites were commanded
          to "sing praises unto the Lord with the words of David, and of Asaph
          the seer," but that other Asaphic Psalms were not of his composition,
          but were only committed to his care as a musician, is equally certain
          from 1 Chronicles 16:7, where David is said to have delivered a Psalm
          into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. It matters little to us
          whether he wrote or sang, for poet and musician are near akin, and if
          one composes words and another sets them to music, they rejoice
          together before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. The Lord is represented as summoning the whole earth to hear
          his declaration, Verses 1-6;

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. The mighty God, even the Lord.</p></b>
        El, Elohim, Jehovah, three glorious names for the God of Israel. To
        render the address the more impressive, these august titles are
        mentioned, just as in royal decrees the names and dignities of monarchs
        are placed in the forefront. Here the true God is described as Almighty,
        as the only and perfect object of adoration and as the self-existent
        One.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun until
            the going down thereof.
          </p></b
        >The dominion of Jehovah extends over the whole earth, and therefore to
        all mankind is his decree directed. The east and the west are bidden to
        hear the God who makes his sun to rise on every quarter of the globe.
        Shall the summons of the great King be despised? Will we dare provoke
        him to anger by slighting his call?
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined.
          </p></b
        >The Lord is represented not only as speaking to the earth, but as
        coming forth to reveal the glory of his presence to an assembled
        universe. God of old dwelt in Zion among his chosen people, but here the
        beams of his splendor are described as shining forth upon all nations.
        <p align="justify">
          The sun was spoken of in the first verse, but here is a far brighter
          sun. The majesty of God is most conspicuous among his own elect, but
          is not confined to them; the church is not a dark lantern, but a
          candlestick. God shines not only <i>in </i>Zion, but <i>out </i>of
          her. She is made perfect in beauty by his indwelling, and that beauty
          is seen by all observers when the Lord shines forth from her. Observe
          how with trumpet voice and flaming ensign the infinite Jehovah summons
          the heavens and the earth to hearken to his word.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. Our God shall come.</p></b>The psalmist
        speaks of himself and his brethren as standing in immediate anticipation
        of the appearing of the Lord upon the scene. "He comes," they say, "our
        covenant God is coming; "they can hear his voice from afar, and perceive
        the splendor of his attending train.
        <p align="justify">
          Even thus should we await the long promised appearing of the Lord from
          Heaven.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And shall not keep silence.</p></b>He comes to
        speak, to plead with his people, to accuse and judge the ungodly. He has
        been silent long in patience, but soon he will speak with power. What a
        moment of awe when the Omnipotent is expected to reveal himself! What
        will be the reverent joy and solemn expectation when the poetic scene of
        this Psalm becomes in the last great day an actual reality!
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            A fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous
            round about him.
          </p></b
        >
        Flame and hurricane are frequently described as the attendants of the
        divine appearance. "Our God is a consuming fire." "At the brightness
        that was before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of
        fire." Psalm 18:12. "He rode upon a cherub, and flew; yes, he flew upon
        the wings of the wind." "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven
        with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that
        know not God." 2 Thessalonians 1:7-8.
        <i> <p align="justify">Fire</p></i>is the emblem of justice in action,
        and the <i> tempest </i>is a token of his overwhelming power. Who will
        not listen in solemn silence when such is the tribunal from which the
        judge pleads with Heaven and earth?
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth.
          </p></b
        >
        Angels and men, the upper and the lower worlds, are called to witness
        the solemn scene. The whole creation shall stand in court to testify to
        the solemnity and the truth of the divine pleading. Both earth beneath
        and Heaven above shall unite in condemning sin; the guilty shall have no
        appeal, though all are summoned that they may appeal if they dare.
        <p align="justify">
          Both angels and men have seen the guilt of mankind and the goodness of
          the Lord, they shall therefore confess the justice of the divine
          utterance, and say "Amen" to the sentence of the supreme Judge.

          Alas, you despisers! What will you do and to whom will you fly?
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">That he may judge his people.</p></b> Judgment
        begins at the house of God. The trial of the visible people of God will
        be a most solemn ceremonial. He will thoroughly purge his floor.
        <i>He will discern between his nominal and his real people</i>, and that
        in open court, the whole universe looking on. My soul, when this
        actually takes place, how will it fare with you? Can you endure the day
        of his coming?
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 5. Gather my saints together unto me.</p></b
        >
        Go, you swift winged messengers, and separate the precious from the
        vile. Gather out the wheat of the heavenly garner. Let the long
        scattered, but elect people, known by my separating grace to be my
        sanctified ones, be now assembled in one place.
        <p align="justify">
          All are not saints who seem to be so—a severance must be made;
          therefore let all who profess to be saints be gathered before my
          throne of judgment, and let them hear the word which will search and
          try the whole, that the false may be convicted and the true revealed.

        >
        this is the grand test, and yet some have dared to imitate it. The
        covenant was ratified by the slaying of victims, the cutting and
        dividing of offerings; this the righteous have done by accepting with
        true faith the great propitiatory sacrifice, and this the pretenders
        have done in merely outward form. Let them be gathered before the throne
        for trial and testing, and as many as have really ratified the covenant
        by faith in the Lord Jesus shall be attested before all worlds as the
        objects of distinguishing grace, while
        <i>formalists shall learn that outward sacrifices are all in vain</i>.
        Oh, solemn assize, how does my soul bow in awe at the prospect thereof!
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness.
          </p></b
        >
        Celestial intelligences and the spirits of just men made perfect, shall
        magnify the infallible judgment of the divine tribunal. Now they
        doubtless wonder at the hypocrisy of men; then they shall equally marvel
        at the exactness of the severance between the true and the false.
        <b> <p align="justify">For God is judge himself.</p></b> This is the
        reason for the correctness of the judgment. Priests of old, and churches
        of later times, were readily deceived, but not so the all discerning
        Lord. No deputy judge sits on the great white throne; the injured Lord
        of all himself weighs the evidence and allots the vengeance or reward.
        The scene in the Psalm is a grand poetical conception, but it is also an
        inspired prophecy of that day which shall burn as an oven, when the Lord
        shall discern between him that fears and him, that fears him not.
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah</p></b>. Here we may well pause in reverent
        prostration, in deep searching of heart, in humble prayer, and in awe
        struck expectation. <b> <p align="justify">Verses 7-15.</p></b> The
        address which follows is directed to the professed people of God. It is
        clearly, in the first place, meant for Israel; but is
        <i>equally applicable to the visible church of God in every age</i>. It
        declares the futility of external worship when spiritual faith is
        absent, and the mere outward ceremonial is rested in.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak.
          </p></b
        >
        Because Jehovah speaks and they are avowedly his own people, they are
        bound to give earnest heed. "Let me speak," says the great I AM. The
        heavens and earth are but listeners, the Lord is about both to testify
        and to judge.
        <b> <p align="justify">O Israel, and I will testify against you.</p></b>
        Their covenant name is mentioned to give point to the address; it was a
        double evil that the chosen nation should become so carnal, so
        unspiritual, so false, so heartless to their God. God himself, whose
        eyes sleep not, who is not misled by rumor, but sees for himself, enters
        on the scene as witness against his favored nation.
        <p align="justify">
          Alas! for us when God, even our fathers' God, testifies to the
          hypocrisy of the visible church!
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">I am God, even your God.</p></b> He had taken
        them to be his peculiar people above all other nations, and they had in
        the most solemn manner avowed that he was their God. Hence the special
        reason for calling them to account. The law began with, "I am the Lord
        your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt," and now the
        session of their judgment opens with the same reminder of their singular
        position, privilege, and responsibility. It is not only that Jehovah is
        God, but <i>your </i>God, O Israel; this is that makes you so amenable
        to his searching reproofs.

        >
        Though they had not failed in maintaining his outward worship, or even
        if they had, he was not about to call them to account for this: a more
        weighty matter was now under consideration.
        <p align="justify">
          They thought the daily sacrifices and the abounding burnt offerings to
          be everything: he counted them nothing if the inner sacrifice of heart
          devotion had been neglected. What was greatest with them, was least
          with God.

        Foolishly they dreamed that bullocks with horns and hoofs could please
        the Lord, when indeed he sought for hearts and souls. Impiously they
        imagined that Jehovah needed these supplies, and that if they fed his
        altar with their fat beasts, he would be content. What he intended for
        their instruction, they made their confidence. They remembered not that
        "to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
        <b> <p align="justify">Nor he goats out of your folds.</p></b> He
        mentions these lesser victims as if to rouse their common sense to see
        that the great Creator could find not satisfaction in mere animal
        offerings. If he needed these, he would not appeal to their scanty
        stalls and folds; in fact, he here refuses to take so much as one, if
        they brought them under the false and dishonoring view, that they were
        in themselves pleasing to him.

          This shows that

        Even if God cared for these things, he could supply himself. Their
        cattle were not, after all, their own, but were still the great
        Creator's property, why then should he be indebted to them. From Dan to
        Beersheba, from Nebaioth to Lebanon, there was not a beast which was not

          under the gospel, when it is so much more plainly revealed, that "God

        No longer look at your sacrifices as in themselves gifts pleasing to me,
        but present them as the tributes of your gratitude; it is then that I
        will accept them, but not while your poor souls have no love and no
        thankfulness to offer me.
        <p align="justify">
          The sacrifices, as considered in themselves, are despised, but the
          internal emotions of love consequent upon a remembrance of divine
          goodness, are commended as the substance, meaning, and soul of
          sacrifice.

          of thankful adoration before the Lord. She excelled in the visible,

        live up to our profession! To be, indeed, the servants of the Lord, the

        Oh blessed verse! Is this then true sacrifice? Is it an offering to ask
        the alms of Heaven? It is even so. The King himself so regards it. For
        herein is faith manifested, herein is love proved, for in the hour of
        peril we fly to those we love. It seems a small think to pray to God
        when we are distressed—yet is it a more acceptable worship than the mere
        heartless presentation of bullocks and goats.

        be, and I will prove it so by my gracious reply to your supplication.
        <p align="justify">
          This promise is very large, and may refer both to temporal and eternal

        endure the practical part of Scripture. They are disgusted at duty, they
        abhor responsibility, they disembowel texts of their plain meanings,
        they wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction.

          It is an ill sign when a man dares not look a Scripture in the face,

          something less condemnatory of his sins, and endeavors to prove it to
          be less sweeping in its demands. How powerful is the argument that
          such men have no right to take the covenant of God into their mouths,
