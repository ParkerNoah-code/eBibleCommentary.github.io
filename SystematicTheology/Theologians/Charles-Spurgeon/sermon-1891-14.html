          1. But the followers of Ptolemy say that he [Bythus] has two consorts,
          which they also name Diatheses (affections), viz., Ennoea and
          Thelesis. For, as they affirm, he first conceived the thought of
          producing something, and then willed to that effect. Wherefore, again,
          these two affections, or powers, Ennoea and Thelesis, having
          intercourse, as it were, between themselves, the production of
          Monogenes and Aletheia took place according to conjunction. These two
          came forth as types and images of the two affections of the Father, --
          visible representations of those that were invisible, -- Nous (i.e.,
          Monogenes) of Thelesis, and Aletheia of Ennoea, and accordingly the
          image resulting from Thelesis was masculine, while that from Ennoea
          was feminine. Thus Thelesis (will) became, as it were, a faculty of
          Ennoea (thought). For Ennoea continually yearned after offspring; but
          she could not of herself bring forth that which she desired. But when
          the power of Thelesis (the faculty of will) came upon her, then she
          brought forth that on which she had brooded.

          2. These fancied beings (like the Jove of Homer, who is represented as
          passing an anxious sleepless night in devising plans for honouring
          Achilles and destroying numbers of the Greeks) will not appear to you,
          my dear friend, to be possessed of greater knowledge than He who is
          the God of the universe. He, as soon as He thinks, also performs what
          He has willed; and as soon as He wills, also thinks that which He has
          willed; then thinking when He wills, and then willing when He thinks,
          since He is all thought, [all will, all mind, all light,] all eye, all
          ear, the one entire fountain of all good things.

          3. Those of them, however, who are deemed more skilful than the
          persons who have just been mentioned, say that the first Ogdoad was
          not produced gradually, so that one Æon was sent forth by another, but
          that all the Æons were brought into existence at once by Propator and
          his Ennoea. He (Colorbasus) affirms this as confidently as if he had
          assisted at their birth. Accordingly, he and his followers maintain
          that Anthropos and Ecclesia were not produced, as others hold, from
          Logos and Zoe; but, on the contrary, Logos and Zoe from Anthropos and
          Ecclesia. But they express this in another form, as follows: When the
          Propator conceived the thought of producing something, he received the
          name of Father. But because what he did produce was true, it was named
          Aletheia. Again, when he wished to reveal himself, this was termed
          Anthropos. Finally, when he produced those whom he had previously
          thought of, these were named Ecclesia. Anthropos, by speaking, formed
          Logos: this is the first-born son. But Zoe followed upon Logos; and
          thus the first Ogdoad was completed.

          4. They have much contention also among themselves respecting the
          Saviour. For some maintain that he was formed out of all; wherefore
          also he was called Eudocetos, because the whole Pleroma was well
          pleased through him to glorify the Father. But others assert that he
          was produced from those ten Æons alone who sprung from Logos and Zoe,
          and that on this account he was called Logos and Zoe, thus preserving
          the ancestral names. Others, again, affirm that he had his being from
          those twelve Æons who were the offspring of Anthropos and Ecclesia;
          and on this account he acknowledges himself the Son of man, as being a
          descendant of Anthropos. Others still, assert that he was produced by
          Christ and the Holy Spirit, who were brought forth for the security of
          the Pleroma; and that on this account he was called Christ, thus
          preserving the appellation of the Father, by whom he was produced. And
          there are yet others among them who declare that the Propator of the
          whole, Proarche, and Proanennoetos is called Anthropos; and that this
          is the great and abstruse mystery, namely, that the Power which is
          above all others, and contains all in his embrace, is termed
          Anthropos; hence does the Saviour style himself the "Son of man."
