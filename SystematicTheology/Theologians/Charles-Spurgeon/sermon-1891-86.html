          1. But there are some who say that Jesus was merely a receptacle of
          Christ, upon whom the Christ, as a dove, descended from above, and
          that when He had declared the unnameable Father He entered into the
          Pleroma in an incomprehensible and invisible manner: for that He was
          not comprehended, not only by men, but not even by those powers and
          virtues which are in heaven, and that Jesus was the Son, but that
          Christ was the Father, and the Father of Christ, God; while others say
          that He merely suffered in outward appearance, being naturally
          impassible. The Valentinians, again, maintain that the dispensational
          Jesus was the same who passed through Mary, upon whom that Saviour
          from the more exalted [region] descended, who was also termed Pan,
          because He possessed the names (vocabula) of all those who had
          produced Him; but that [this latter] shared with Him, the
          dispensational one, His power and His name; so that by His means death
          was abolished, but the Father was made known by that Saviour who had
          descended from above, whom they do also allege to be Himself the
          receptacle of Christ and of the entire Pleroma; confessing, indeed, in
          tongue one Christ Jesus, but being divided in [actual] opinion: for,
          as I have already observed, it is the practice of these men to say
          that there was one Christ, who was produced by Monogenes, for the
          confirmation of the Pleroma; but that another, the Saviour, was sent
          [forth] for the glorification of the Father; and yet another, the
          dispensational one, and whom they represent as having suffered, who
          also bore [in himself] Christ, that Saviour who returned into the
          Pleroma. I judge it necessary therefore to take into account the
          entire mind of the apostles regarding our Lord Jesus Christ, and to
          show that not only did they never hold any such opinions regarding
          Him; but, still further, that they announced through the Holy Spirit,
          that those who should teach such doctrines were agents of Satan, sent
          forth for the purpose of overturning the faith of some, and drawing
          them away from life.
        </p>

          2. That John knew the one and the same Word of God, and that He was
          the only begotten, and that He became incarnate for our salvation,
          Jesus Christ our Lord, I have sufficiently proved from the word of
          John himself. And Matthew, too, recognising one and the same Jesus
          Christ, exhibiting his generation as a man from the Virgin, even as
          God did promise David that He would raise up from the fruit of his
          body an eternal King, having made the same promise to Abraham a long
          time previously, says: |The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
          the son of David, the son of Abraham.| Then, that he might free our
          mind from suspicion regarding Joseph, he says: |But the birth of
          Christ was on this wise. When His mother was espoused to Joseph,
          before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy
          Ghost.| Then, when Joseph had it in contemplation to put Mary away,
          since she proved with child, [Matthew tells us of] the angel of God
          standing by him, and saying: |Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
          wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she
          shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He
          shall save His people from their sins. Now this was done, that it
          might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet:
          Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall
          call His name Emmanuel, which is, God with us;| clearly signifying
          that both the promise made to the fathers had been accomplished, that
          the Son of God was born of a virgin, and that He Himself was Christ
          the Saviour whom the prophets had foretold; not, as these men assert,
          that Jesus was He who was born of Mary, but that Christ was He who
          descended from above. Matthew might certainly have said, |Now the
          birth of Jesus was on this wise;| but the Holy Ghost, foreseeing the
          corrupters [of the truth], and guarding by anticipation against their
          deceit, says by Matthew, |But the birth of Christ was on this wise;|
          and that He is Emmanuel, lest perchance we might consider Him as a
          mere man: for |not by the will of the flesh nor by the will of man,
          but by the will of God was the Word made flesh;| and that we should
          not imagine that Jesus was one, and Christ another, but should know
          them to be one and the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Paul, when writing to the Romans, has explained this very point:
          |Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, predestinated unto the Gospel of
          God, which He had promised by His prophets in the holy Scriptures,
          concerning His Son, who was made to Him of the seed of David according
          to the flesh, who was predestinated the Son of God with power through
          the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead of our Lord
          Jesus Christ.| And again, writing to the Romans about Israel, he says:
          |Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ according to the
          flesh, who is God over all, blessed for ever.| And again, in his
          Epistle to the Galatians, he says: |But when the fulness of time had
          come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to
          redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
          adoption;| plainly indicating one God, who did by the prophets make
          promise of the Son, and one Jesus Christ our Lord, who was of the seed
          of David according to His birth from Mary; and that Jesus Christ was
          appointed the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of
          holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, as being the first
          begotten in all the creation; the Son of God being made the Son of
          man, that through Him we may receive the adoption, -- humanity
          sustaining, and receiving, and embracing the Son of God. Wherefore
          Mark also says: |The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son
          of God; as it is written in the prophets.| Knowing one and the same
          Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was announced by the prophets, who from
          the fruit of David's body was Emmanuel, |the messenger of great
          counsel of the Father;| through whom God caused the day-spring and the
          Just One to arise to the house of David, and raised up for him an horn
          of salvation, |and established a testimony in Jacob;| as David says
          when discoursing on the causes of His birth: |And He appointed a law
          in Israel, that another generation might know [Him,] the children
          which should he born from these, and they arising shall themselves
          declare to their children, so that they might set their hope in God,
          and seek after His commandments.| And again, the angel said, when
          bringing good tidings to Mary: |He shall he great, and shall be called
          the Son of the Highest; and the Lord shall give unto Him the throne of
          His father David;| acknowledging that He who is the Son of the
          Highest, the same is Himself also the Son of David. And David, knowing
          by the Spirit the dispensation of the advent of this Person, by which
          He is supreme over all the living and dead, confessed Him as Lord,
          sitting on the right hand of the Most High Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But Simeon also -- he who had received an intimation from the Holy
          Ghost that he should not see death, until first he had beheld Christ
          Jesus -- taking Him, the first-begotten of the Virgin, into his hands,
          blessed God, and said, |Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
          peace, according to Thy word: because mine eyes have seen Thy
          salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a
          light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel;|
          confessing thus, that the infant whom he was holding in his hands,
          Jesus, born of Mary, was Christ Himself, the Son of God, the light of
          all, the glory of Israel itself, and the peace and refreshing of those
          who had fallen asleep. For He was already despoiling men, by removing
          their ignorance, conferring upon them His own knowledge, and
          scattering abroad those who recognised Him, as Esaias says: |Call His
          name, Quickly spoil, Rapidly divide.| Now these are the works of
          Christ. He therefore was Himself Christ, whom Simeon carrying [in his
          arms] blessed the Most High; on beholding whom the shepherds glorified
          God; whom John, while yet in his mother's womb, and He (Christ) in
          that of Mary, recognising as the Lord, saluted with leaping; whom the
          Magi, when they had seen, adored, and offered their gifts [to Him], as
          I have already stated, and prostrated themselves to the eternal King,
          departed by another way, not now returning by the way of the
          Assyrians. |For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, Father
          or mother, He shall receive the power of Damascus, and the spoils of
          Samaria, against the king of the Assyrians;| declaring, in a
          mysterious manner indeed, but emphatically, that the Lord did fight
          with a hidden hand against Amalek. For this cause, too, He suddenly
          removed those children belonging to the house of David, whose happy
          lot it was to have been born at that time, that He might send them on
          before into His kingdom; He, since He was Himself an infant, so
          arranging it that human infants should be martyrs, slain, according to
          the Scriptures, for the sake of Christ, who was born in Bethlehem of
          Judah, in the city of David.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Therefore did the Lord also say to His disciples after the
          resurrection, |O thoughtless ones, and slow of heart to believe all
          that the prophets have spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these
          things, and to enter into His glory?| And again does He say to them:
          |These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you,
          that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of
          Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me. Then
          opened He their understanding, that they should understand the
          Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it
          behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, and that
          repentance for the remission of sins be preached in His name among all
          nations.| Now this is He who was born of Mary; for He says: |The Son
          of man must suffer many things, and be rejected, and crucified, and on
          the third day rise again.| The Gospel, therefore, knew no other son of
          man but Him who was of Mary, who also suffered; and no Christ who flew
          away from Jesus before the passion; but Him who was born it knew as
          Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that this same suffered and rose
          again, as John, the disciple of the Lord, verifies, saying: |But these
          are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
          of God, and that believing ye might have eternal life in His name,| --
          foreseeing these blasphemous systems which divide the Lord, as far as
          lies in their power, saying that He was formed of two different
          substances. For this reason also he has thus testified to us in his
          Epistle: |Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard
          that Antichrist doth come, now have many antichrists appeared; whereby
          we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were
          not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with
          us: but [they departed], that they might be made manifest that they
          are not of us. Know ye therefore, that every lie is from without, and
          is not of the truth. Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is
          the Christ? This is Antichrist.|
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But inasmuch as all those before mentioned, although they certainly
          do with their tongue confess one Jesus Christ, make fools of
          themselves, thinking one thing and saying another; for their
          hypotheses vary, as I have already shown, alleging, [as they do,] that
          one Being suffered and was born, and that this was Jesus; but that
          there was another who descended upon Him, and that this was Christ,
          who also ascended again; and they argue, that he who proceeded from
          the Demiurge, or he who was dispensational, or he who sprang from
          Joseph, was the Being subject to suffering; but upon the latter there
          descended from the invisible and ineffable [places] the former, whom
          they assert to be incomprehensible, invisible, and impassible: they
          thus wander from the truth, because their doctrine departs from Him
          who is truly God, being ignorant that His only-begotten Word, who is
          always present with the human race, united to and mingled with His own
          creation, according to the Father's pleasure, and who became flesh, is
          Himself Jesus Christ our Lord, who did also suffer for us, and rose
          again on our behalf, and who will come again in the glory of His
          Father, to raise up all flesh, and for the manifestation of salvation,
          and to apply the rule of just judgment to all who were made by Him.
          There is therefore, as I have pointed out, one God the Father, and one
          Christ Jesus, who came by means of the whole dispensational
          arrangements [connected with Him], and gathered together all things in
          Himself. But in every respect, too, He is man, the formation of God;
          and thus He took up man into Himself, the invisible becoming visible,
          the incomprehensible being made comprehensible, the impassible
          becoming capable of suffering, and the Word being made man, thus
          summing up all things in Himself: so that as in super-celestial,
          spiritual, and invisible things, the Word of God is supreme, so also
          in things visible and corporeal He might possess the supremacy, and,
          taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as constituting Himself
          Head of the Church, He might draw all things to Himself at the proper
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. With Him is nothing incomplete or out of due season, just as with
          the Father there is nothing incongruous. For all these things were
          foreknown by the Father; but the Son works them out at the proper time
          in perfect order and sequence. This was the reason why, when Mary was
          urging [Him] on to [perform] the wonderful miracle of the wine, and
          was desirous before the time to partake of the cup of emblematic
          significance, the Lord, checking her untimely haste, said, |Woman,
          what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come| -- waiting for
          that hour which was foreknown by the Father. This is also the reason
          why, when men were often desirous to take Him, it is said, |No man
          laid hands upon Him, for the hour of His being taken was not yet
          come;| nor the time of His passion, which had been foreknown by the
          Father; as also says the prophet Habakkuk, |By this Thou shalt be
          known when the years have drawn nigh; Thou shalt be set forth when the
          time comes; because my soul is disturbed by anger, Thou shalt remember
          Thy mercy.| Paul also says: |But when the fulness of time came, God
          sent forth His Son.| By which is made manifest, that all things which
          had been foreknown of the Father, our Lord did accomplish in their
          order, season, and hour, foreknown and fitting, being indeed one and
          the same, but rich and great. For He fulfils the bountiful and
          comprehensive will of His Father, inasmuch as He is Himself the
          Saviour of those who are saved, and the Lord of those who are under
          authority, and the God of all those things which have been formed, the
          only-begotten of the Father, Christ who was announced, and the Word of
          God, who became incarnate when the fulness of time had come, at which
          the Son of God had to become the Son of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. All, therefore, are outside of the [Christian] dispensation, who,
          under pretext of knowledge, understand that Jesus was one, and Christ
          another, and the Only-begotten another, from whom again is the Word,
          and that the Saviour is another, whom these disciples of error allege
          to be a production of those who were made Æons in a state of
          degeneracy. Such men are to outward appearance sheep; for they appear
          to be like us, by what they say in public, repeating the same words as
          we do; but inwardly they are wolves. Their doctrine is homicidal,
          conjuring up, as it does, a number of gods, and simulating many
          Fathers, but lowering and dividing the Son of God in many ways. These
          are they against whom the Lord has cautioned us beforehand; and His
          disciple, in his Epistle already mentioned, commands us to avoid them,
          when he says: |For many deceivers are entered into the world, who
          confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver
          and an antichrist. Take heed to them, that ye lose not what ye have
          wrought.| And again does he say in the Epistle: |Many false prophets
          are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every
          spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
          God; and every spirit which separates Jesus Christ is not of God, but
          is of antichrist.| These words agree with what was said in the Gospel,
          that |the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.| Wherefore he again
          exclaims in his Epistle, |Every one that believeth that Jesus is the
          Christ, has been born of God;| knowing Jesus Christ to be one and the
          same, to whom the gates of heaven were opened, because of His taking
          upon Him flesh: who shall also come in the same flesh in which He
          suffered, revealing the glory of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Concurring with these statements, Paul, speaking to the Romans,
          declares: |Much more they who receive abundance of grace and
          righteousness for [eternal] life, shall reign by one, Christ Jesus.|
          It follows from this, that he knew nothing of that Christ who flew
          away from Jesus; nor did he of the Saviour above, whom they hold to be
          impassible. For if, in truth, the one suffered, and the other remained
          incapable of suffering, and the one was born, but the other descended
          upon him who was born, and left him again, it is not one, but two,
          that are shown forth. But that the apostle did know Him as one, both
          who was born and who suffered, namely Christ Jesus, he again says in
          the same Epistle: |Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized in
          Christ Jesus were baptized in His death? that like as Christ rose from
          the dead, so should we also walk in newness of life.| But again,
          showing that Christ did suffer, and was Himself the Son of God, who
          died for us, and redeemed us with His blood at the time appointed
          beforehand, he says: |For how is it, that Christ, when we were yet
          without strength, in due time died for the ungodly? But God commendeth
          His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died
          for us. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be
          saved from wrath through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we were
          reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being
          reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.| He declares in the
          plainest manner, that the same Being who was laid hold of, and
          underwent suffering, and shed His blood for us, was both Christ and
          the Son of God, who did also rise again, and was taken up into heaven,
          as he himself [Paul] says: |But at the same time, [it, is] Christ
          [that] died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right
          hand of God.| And again, |Knowing that Christ, rising from the dead,
          dieth no more:| for, as himself foreseeing, through the Spirit, the
          subdivisions of evil teachers [with regard to the Lord's person], and
          being desirous of cutting away from them all occasion of cavil, he
          says what has been already stated, [and also declares:] |But if the
          Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that
          raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies.|
          This he does not utter to those alone who wish to hear: Do not err,
          [he says to all:] Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is one and the same,
          who did by suffering reconcile us to God, and rose from the dead; who
          is at the right hand of the Father, and perfect in all things; |who,
          when He was buffeted, struck not in return; who, when He suffered,
          threatened not;| and when He underwent tyranny, He prayed His Father
          that He would forgive those who had crucified Him. For He did Himself
