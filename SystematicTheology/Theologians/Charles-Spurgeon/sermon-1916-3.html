          "Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these
          things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which
          shall be fulfilled in their season." -- Luke 1:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          UNBELIEF is everywhere a great sin, and a grievous mistake. Unbelief
          has proved the ruin of those countless multitudes who, having heard
          the gospel, rejected it, died in their sins, have been consigned to
          the place of torment, and await the fiercer judgment of the last day.
          I might ask the question concerning this innumerable host, "Who slew
          all these?" The answer would be, "Unbelief." And when unbelief comes
          into the Christian's heart, as it does at times -- for the truest
          believer has his times of doubt; even Abraham, the father of the
          faithful, sometimes had his misgivings -- that unbelief does not
          assail his thoughts without withering his joys, and impairing his
          energies. There is nothing in the world that costs a saint so dear as
          doubt. If he disbelieve his God, he most assuredly robs himself of
          comfort, deprives himself of strength, and does himself a real injury.
          The case of Zacharias may be a, lesson to the Lord's people. It is to
          them I am going to speak: Zacharias is a striking example of the ills
          a good man may have to suffer as the result of his unbelief. In
          reviewing these, we mark: --
        </p>
        <p>I. THE CHARACTER AND POSITION OF ZACHARIAS.</p>
        <p>
          Here we cannot fail to discover some profitable lesson. He was
          undoubtedly a believer. He is said, in the sixth verse, to have been
          righteous before God. No man ever obtained such a reputation except by
          faith. "The just shall live by faith." No other righteousness than
          that which is faith is of any esteem in God's account. Such was the
          righteousness of Abraham, and such was the righteousness of all the
          saints before the advent of our Redeemer. Such, too, has been the
          standard ever since. Zacharias evidently was a real believer. Yet for
          all that, when the angel appeared to him, and God gave him the promise
          of a son, he was amazed, bewildered, incredulous, and could not
          credit, but only question the announcement. "How shall I know that
          these things shall be?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor was he merely a genuine believer; he was well instructed and
          greatly enlightened, for he was a priest, and, as a priest considered,
          he was righteous before God, and blameless, walking in all the
          commandments and ordinances of the Lord. That he was well instructed
          in the Word of God is undeniable. He could not otherwise have
          discharged his duty, for the priest's lips must keep knowledge, and he
          must teach men. Being proficient in the one, and competent for the
          other, ignorance offered him no excuse. Moreover, as a man of years,
          he was probably to be classed among the experienced saints of his
          time. He had borne the burden and heat of the day, and received proof
          upon proof of the abundant mercy of God. Now mark this. For any of us
          to doubt, who have been justified by faith is a shameful delinquency.
          For those to doubt who have, in addition to their first convictions, a
          thousand confirmations of the truth they have embraced, who are
          acquainted with the covenant and its rich inventory of promises, who
          are deeply taught in the things of God -- for such to doubt involves a
          higher degree of guilt. I do not think that had Zacharias been a mere
          babe in grace, or an inexperienced stripling, his unbelief would have
          met with so stern a rebuke. It eras because he was a venerable priest,
          one thoroughly schooled in sacred truth, a man who for many years
          instructed the people of Israel in the oracles of God, that it became
          a crying evil for him to say, "Whereby shall I know this?" when the
          angel told him of his prayer being heard, and of the manner of answer
          the Lord would vouchsafe him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high office that Zacharias held as a priest caused him to be
          looked up to. Hence his conduct was more narrowly watched, and his
          example had a wider influence. On a similar account we have need, all
          of us in our several spheres, to consider the effect of our actions
          upon others. The higher a man's position, the greater his
          responsibility; and in the event of any delinquency, the graver his
          offense. For you to disbelieve, my dear brother, who are at the head
          of a household, is worse than a personal infirmity; it is a violation
          of duty to your family. And you, dear friend, who preach the gospel,
          for you to disbelieve, who are looked upon by many as an advanced
          Christian, as a mature saint whose example may be safely followed by
          those who listen to your counsels -- this is a great and a crying
          evil, whereby you disonour the Lord. I pray God that your conscience
          may be tenderly sensitive, and that you may be aroused to a sense of
          the dishonour you bring to him by your faithlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          How peculiarly favoured Zacharias was! An angel of the Lord appeared
          unto him. Not to any of the other priests, when they were offering
          incense, did such a heavenly visitor come. And what welcome tidings he
          brought! It was a wonderful message that he was to be the father of a
          child great in the sight of the Lord, one who should minister in the
          spirit and power of Elias, and become the forerunner of the Messiah.
          This surely was a signal instance of Divine favour. And mark this,
          beloved, our God is very jealous of those whom he highly favours. You
          cannot have privileged communications from the Lord, or be admitted
          into close communion with him, without finding that he is a jealous
          God. The nearer we draw to him, the more hallowed our sense of his
          presence will be. But to doubt his Word, or question the fulfillment
          of his promise when he speaks kindly to us, must incur his censure. I
          speak after the manner of men; we do not expect from a stranger the
          esteem which we ought to merit from our servants. But our friends, who
          know us better than servants, ought to trust us more implicitly. And
          yet beyond common friendship in the near relation and tender
          attachment of a wife to her husband, the most unqualified confidence
          should be reposed. Even so, my brethren, if you and I have ever been
          permitted to lean our heads on Jesus' bosom; if we have sat down at
          his banquets, and his banner over us has been love; if we have been
          separated from the world by peculiar fellowship with Christ, and have
          had choice promises given us, we cannot, like Zacharias, ask, "Whereby
          shall I know" without grieving the Holy Spirit of God, and bringing
          upon ourselves some sad chastisement as the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          What soothing comfort had just been administered to Zacharias by the
          angel of the Lord! Was not the manner of the salutation fitted to
          allay terror, and inspire him with trust? The troubled thoughts that
          perplexed him, and the fear that fell upon him when the angel appeared
          standing at the right hand of the altar, met with no rebuke. If it was
          natural that so unwonted a vision should startle him, there was a
          gentle sympathising tenderness in the angel's address that might well
          hays stilled the throbbings of his heart. "Fear not, Zacharias, for
          thy prayer is heard." And so is it with us when the consolations of
          God have been neither few nor small, and when his good will towards us
          has been pointedly expressed, does it not make doubt and questioning
          more inexcusable? Do we not thereby aggravate the sin? Some of us have
          lived in the very bosom of comfort. Precious promises have been
          brought home to our souls; we have eaten of the marrow and the
          fatness; we have drunk the wines on the lees well refined. We are no
          strangers to the blessing of his eternal and unchanging love, or to
          the light of his countenance, which they prove who find grace in his
          eyes. Oh! if we begin to doubt after these discriminating love tokens,
          what apology can we offer? How can we hope to escape from the
          chastening rod?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the misgivings that Zacharias betrayed relate to the very
          subject on which his supplications were offered. It was in response to
          his own petition that the angel said to him, "Thy prayer is heard." I
          marvel at his faith that he should persevere in prayer for a boon
          which seemed, at his own and his wife's age, to have been out of the
          course of nature, and beyond the domain of hope, but I marvel a great
          deal more that, when the answer came to that very prayer, Zacharias
          could not believe it. So full often is it with us; nothing would
          surprise some of us more than to receive an answer to some of our
          prayers. Though we believe in the efficacy of prayer, at times we
          believe so feebly that when the answer comes, as come it does, we are
          astounded and filled with amazement. We can scarcely think of it as a
          purpose of God, it seems rather to us like a happy coincidence. Surely
          this adds greatly to the sin of unbelief. If we have been asking for
          mercy without expecting it, and pleading promises while harbouring
          mistrust, every prayer we have offered has been only a repetition of
          our secret unbelief; and it is God's faithfulness that brings our
          inconsistency to light.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other reflection is suggested by the narrative. Zacharias appears
          to have staggered at a promise which others, whom we might well
          imagine to have been weaker in faith then himself, implicitly
          believed. The veteran falters where a babe in grace might have taken
          courage. And is it not always a scandal if any of us who have been
          conspicuously favoured of God are ready to halt, while our feebler
          brethren and sisters are animated and encouraged? No dubious thought
          seems to have crossed the mind of Elizabeth, no incredulous expression
          fell from her lips. She said, "Thus hath the Lord dealt with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          This case was the very opposite of that of Abraham and Sarah. There
          Abraham believed, but Sarah doubted; here the wife believes in the
          face of her husband's scruples. In like manner, Mary, that humble
          village maiden, accepts with simple faith the high and holy salutation
          with which she was greeted. She just basks a natural question, and
          that being answered, she replies, "Be it unto me, according to thy
          Word." Her surprise was soon exchanged for joy, and by-and-by she
          begins to sing with a loud voice, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and
          my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." Not a little remarkable is
          this opening chapter of the Gospel according to Luke. Woman, who had
          been in the background through long preceding generations, seems
          suddenly to take a foremost place. Zacharias and Joseph stand in
          doubt, while Elizabeth and Mary exultingly believe. And who knows but
          I may be addressing some poor woman here who, in the depth of
          affliction, bodily suffering, and poverty, nevertheless rejoices in
          God with all her heart? But without a doubt, I am now speaking to many
          a man who is vexed with trifling cares, murmurs bitterly because of
          petty annoyances, and distrusts his God when clouds come over the sky
          so that ho sees not his way. Shame on our unbelief. Think shame of
          yourselves because of it, I pray you. Never does it disgrace us more
          than when the weaklings of the Lord's family put us to the blush by
          the simplicity and sincerity of their faith. The character and
          position of Zacharias may furnish a striking moral, but I do urgently
          entreat each Christian to point the keen edge of criticism at himself,
          and consider how much he is personally to blame for his own unbelief.
          Let us now proceed to investigate: --
        </p>
        <p>II. THE FAULT OF ZACHARIAS.</p>
        <p>
          Whence this perilous wavering at that privileged hour His fault was
          that he looked at the difficulty. "I am an old man," said he, "and my
          wife is well stricken in years." And while he looked at the difficulty
          he would fain suggest a remedy; he wanted a sign. "Whereby shall I
          know this?" It was not enough for him that God had said so; he wanted
          some collateral evidence to guarantee the truth of the word of the
          Lord. This is a very common fault among really good people. They look
          for a sign. I have often trembled in my own soul when I have felt an
          inclination thus to tempt the Lord by looking for some minute
          circumstance to verify a magnificent promise. When I have thought,
          "Hereby shall I know whether he does hear prayer or not," a cold
          shiver has passed over me, the shudder has gone through my soul that
          ever I should think of challenging the truth of God's word, when the
          fact is so certain. To us who have full often cried unto the Lord in
          our distresses and been delivered out of our troubles, to raise such a
          question is indeed ungrateful. For a child of God who habitually prays
          to his Father in heaven to look upon his faithfulness as a matter of
          uncertainty is to degrade himself, and to dishonour his Lord. Yet
          there is no denying the tendency and disposition among us to want a
          sign. As we read a prophecy of the future, we crave a token in the
          present. If the Lord were pleased to give us a sign, or if he told us
          to ask for a sign, we should be quite right in attaching a high
          importance thereto, but for us to doubt a plain promise, and,
          therefore, ask a sign, is to sin against the Lord. Sometimes we have
          wanted signs in spiritual things. Meet and proper is it for us to
          rejoice in the true delights of fellowship with Christ, but it ill
          becomes us to make our feelings a kind of test of our acceptance, or
          to say, "I will not believe God if he does not indulge me with certain
          manifestations of grace; unless he gives me the sweetmeats I crave, I
          will be sulky and sullen, and refuse to eat the children's bread."
          Why, such conduct is wilful and wicked; it is weak, and utterly
          inexcusable. Yet how many of us have been guilty of this folly? Now,
          as Zacharias stood upon the threshold of the gospel dispensation, and
          he was the first among those who heard the glad tidings to express
          unbelief, it was necessary that he should be made an example of.
        </p>
        <p>
          God would show at the very outset, even before John the Baptist was
          born, that unbelief could not be tolerated nor should it go
          unchastened. Therefore, his servant, Zacharias, must, as soon as he
          had asked for a sign, have such a sign as would make him suffer for
          months to come, constrain him to be sorry that he had ever dared to
          proffer the request. Oh! beloved, is our faith still so weak, and our
          experience still so contracted, that we cannot yet trust our God?
          Twenty years have we known him. Has he been a wilderness to us? Have
          his mercy and truth ever failed us in time of need? Shall all his
          tender dealings with us count for nothing? Do ye think so lightly of
          the gift of his Son, the gift of the Holy Ghost, of the dally
          providence which has guarded you, and of the hourly benediction which
          has been vouchsafed to you, that ye would fain put aside these
          unfailing benefits from your grateful remembrance, while you indulge
          in some paltry whim, and tempt the Lord your God by your mistrust?
          That be far from any of us! We would rather take up the position of
          Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who, when arraigned before
          Nebuchadnezzar, and adjudged to be thrown into the furnace of fire,
          said, "Our God is able to deliver us; but," they added, "if not
          (though he should do nothing of the kind), nevertheless be it known
          unto thee, O king, we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
          image which thou hast set up." That is the spirit in which we ought to
          walk before God -- "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." What
          if he does not spare my mothers precious life? What if he does not
          preserve my child from the ravages of the fatal epidemic? What if he
          take away the desire of mine eyes with a stroke? What if my business
          should cease to thrive? What if my health fail and my strength decay?
          What if I be dishonoured by the scandal of my neighbours? Shall I,
          therefore, cast off my allegiance to God, or betray my trust in him?
          Am I to engage in rebellion like this? Not flood nor flame could
          quench or extinguish his love to me. Shall anxiety or tribulation,
          disappointment or disaster sever my heart from devotion to him? Nay,
          God give me grace to see my cattle destroyed, and my goods swept away,
          and my children cut off in their prime, and to hear cruel taunts from
          the wife of my bosom; to be covered with sore boils, and to sit on a
          dunghill and scrape myself with a potsherd and find my best friends
          miserable comforters, and yet, in the midst of accumulated distresses,
          to be able to say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth; he has not failed
          to deliver me hitherto, and though, after my skin, worms destroy this
          body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. Though the fig-tree should not
          blossom, though the flocks and herds be cut off, yet will I trust in
          the Lord, and glory in the God of my salvation." If true to our high
          profession, the Christian's faith should not borrow its hue from the
          circumstances by which he is surrounded. To hanker after signs that a
          promise shall be fulfilled is obviously to show distrust of the
          prosmiser. "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace, in
          believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy
          Ghost." So shall you be restrained from asking for a petty sign to
          justify you in relying on his princely bounty. The Lord keep you from
          this great transgression! We pass on to observe: --
        </p>
        <p>III. THE PENALTY ZACHARIAS INCURRED.</p>
        <p>
          His morbid propensity was followed by a mortifying punishment. He had
          doubted, and he became dumb, and as the narrative clearly shows us, he
          was deaf likewise. Such was his chastisement, and it was sent not in
          anger, but in God's own covenant love. What a salutary medicine!
          Although bitter to the taste, how effective it was! Read his song, and
          you will see the evidence. He had been for months silent, quiet, shut
          out from all sound, and unable to make any. But well he had occupied
          his months of seclusion. He had searched the prophets -- do you see
          that? He had been musing much upon the coming one -- do you see that?
          Deep humility had taken the place of arrogant presumption. He was
          bowed down before the majesty of God, yet at the same time full of
          peace and blissful hope. Thus he looked into the glorious future. Oh!
          dear brethren, if you are prone to doubt, this sickness of the mind
          will require a strong corrective. Very likely God will give you some
          sharp medicine, but it shall work for your good. As his child, he will
          not chasten you so as to injure you, but he will chasten you so as to
          benefit you. I do not think children generally court the rod, however
          beneficial it may be, and yet I am quite sure there is no wise child
          of God who would not shrink from the graver ills which render such
          discipline essential to his soul's health.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how judgment was tempered with mercy. The punishment sent to
          Zacharias was not so severe as it might have been. Instead of being
          struck deaf and dumb, he might have been struck dead. As I read this
          passage, I wondered that God had not struck me deaf and dumb when I
          have spoken unbelieving words -- when I have been depressed in spirit,
          and spoken unadvisedly with my lips. Oh! had the Lord been wroth with
          me, and said, "If that is your witness about me, you shall never speak
          again." That would have been most just, and I might have been a
          mournful instance of his indignation against his unbelieving servants;
          he has not dealt so with me; glory be to his name!

        <p>
          And this chastisement did not invalidate the promise. The Lord did not
          say, "Well, Zacharias, as you don't believe it, your wife, Elizabeth,
          shall not have a son. There shall be a John born, but he shall not
          come to your house." Oh! no; that is a grand passage -- "If we believe
          not, yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny himself." The promise
          still stands. God does not take advantage of our unbelief to cry off
          and say, "I will give thee no blessings because thou doubtest me" --
          no, but having said it, he does it and his Word does not return unto
          him void. Even the trembling, doubting children, though they get the
          rod, get the blessing too; and the promise is fulfilled, though the
          father is dumb when the blessing comes. Very painful, indeed, was his
          chastisement. One would not like to be deaf and dumb for a day; but to
          be deaf and dumb for the space of nine months must have been a very
          painful trial to this man. Moreover, he could not bless the people; he
          could not speak a word; he could not instruct the people; he was
          useless for that part of the priest's work; and when the song went up
          within the hallowed walls of the temple, he could not hear it. He
          might know by signs that they were singing a hallelujah, yet his ears
          could not catch its grateful strains. That poor tongue of his was
          silent. He could not add a note to the volume of praise that went up
          to the God he loved. It must have been mournful to him to have no
          prayer in the family which he could hear, and in which he could join,
          and to be as good as dead for all practical purposes. Now I am afraid
          thence are many believers who have had to suffer something like this,
          for many days, on account of their unbelief. I think I can point out
          some who are unable to hear the gospel as once they did many years
          ago, a friend said that he could not hear me preach. I said to him,
          "Buy a horn." "No," he said, "it is not your voice; I can hear that,
          but I don't enjoy it." My reply was, "Perhaps that is my fault, but I
          am far from sure that it is not your own." I fear, in such cases, it
          is quite as often the hearer's fault as the preacher's fault. At any
          rate, when others profit, and our judgment approves, though our hearts
          find no refreshment, there is reason to suspect that in the dullness
          of our senses we are compelled to bear chastisement for our unbelief.
          You go where others go, and find no solace. You hear what edifies and
          comforts them, but there is no cheer for you. You are deaf; your ears
          are closed to what the Lord says. Very often it has happened, I fear,
          to some here, that, for want of faith, they have lost their speech.
          Time was when they could tell of the Lord's goodness, but they seem
          silent now. They could sing once, but their harps are hung on the
          willows now. As they get with their companions, they seem as if they
          have lost all their pleasant conversation. If they try the old
          accustomed strings of the time-worn harp, the ancient skill is gone.
          They cannot praise God as once they did; and all because on one
          occasion, when the promise was clear before their eyes, they would
          challenge and mistrust it. They could not rely upon their God. Little
          do we know how many Fatherly chastisements come upon us as the result
          of our unbelief.

          The lessons I gather, and with which I conclude, are these -- First,
          if any of you, beloved, are weak in faith, do not be satisfied about
          it. Cry to God. Our God deserves better homage of us than a weak,
          attenuated faith can render him. He deserves to be trusted with such
          confidence as a child gives his parent. Ask him to increase your
          faith. And you who have faith, oh! keep it jealously, exercise it
          habitually; pray to the Lord to preserve it. Never begin to walk
          according to the sight of the eyes. Confer not with flesh and blood.
          Don't come down from that blessed height of simple confidence in God,
          but ask that you may abide there, and no longer doubt. The Church
          wants believers to believe for her, and to pray for her. "He that
          wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. Let
          not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord." Art
          thou strong in faith, be thou stronger still; art thou weak in faith,
          be thou strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let the unbeliever, the utter unbeliever, tremble. If a good man,
          a saved man, a noble and a blameless man was nevertheless for months
          struck dumb for unbelief, what will become of you who have no faith at
          all? He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
          believed on the Son of God. To you, unbeliever, no angel Gabriel will
          appear, but the destroying angel awaits you. What shall be your
          fearful chastisement? You will be silent; it will be eternal. Oh! you
          shall stand silent at the judgment-seat of Christ, unable to offer any
          excuse for your rebellion and unbelief. Unbelief will destroy the best
          of us: faith will save the worst of us. He that believeth on the Lord
          Jesus Christ hath eternal life -- he that believeth not (whatever else
          his apparent excellences will assuredly perish. Faith, faith! this is
          the priceless saving thing to every one of us. The gift be yours to
          believe. The grace be yours to inherit the righteousness of faith. The
          joy be yours to believe in Jesus Christ with all your hearts. The
          triumph be yours to believe now to the saving of your souls. Amen.
