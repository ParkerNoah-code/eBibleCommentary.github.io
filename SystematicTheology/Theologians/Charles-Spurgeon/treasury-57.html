          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician with stringed instruments</b>. Another
          song to be accompanied by stringed instruments. The strain is at one
          time mournful, and at another softly sweet. It needed the chief
          musician's best care to see that the music was expressive of the
          sentiment.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">A Maschil</p></b>. It is not a mere personal
        hymn, there is <i>teaching </i>in it for us all, and where our Lord
        shines through David, his personal type, there is a great deep of
        meaning. <b> <p align="justify">Of David</p></b>. The man of many
        conditions, much tried, and much favored, persecuted but delivered and
        exalted, was from experience enabled to write such precious verses in
        which he sets forth not only the sorrows of common pilgrims, but of the
        Lord of the way himself.
        <p align="justify">
          SUBJECT. It would be idle to fix a time, and find an occasion for this
          Psalm with any dogmatism. It reads like a song of the time of Absalom
          and Ahithophel. It was after David had enjoyed peaceful worship (verse
          14), when he was or had just been a dweller in a city (verses 9-11),
          and when he remembered his former roamings in the wilderness.
          Altogether it seems to us to relate to that mournful era when the King
          was betrayed by his trusted counselor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The spiritual eye ever and anon sees the Son of David and Judas, and
          the chief priests appearing and disappearing upon the glowing canvas
          of the Psalm.

        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. From verses 1-8, the suppliant spreads his case in general
          before his God; <br />
          in verses 9-11, he portrays his enemies; <br />
          in verses 12-14, he mentions one special traitor, <br />
          and cries for vengeance, or foretells it in verses 15. <br />
          From verses 16-19 he consoles himself by prayer and faith; <br />
          in verses 20-21 he again mentions the deceitful covenant breaker,
          <br />
          and closes with a cheering exhortation to the saints (verse 22),
          <br />
          and a denunciation of destruction upon the wicked and deceitful (verse
          23).<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Give ear to my prayer, O God.</p></b>
        The fact is so commonly before us, otherwise we should be surprised to
        observe
        <i
          >how universally and constantly the saints resort to prayer in seasons
          of distress</i
        >. From the Great Elder Brother down to the very least of the divine
        family, all of them delight in prayer. They run as naturally to the
        mercy-seat in time of trouble, as the little chicks to the hen in the
        hour of danger.
        <p align="justify">
          But note well that it is never the bare act of prayer which satisfies
          the godly, they crave an audience with Heaven, and an answer from the
          throne—and nothing less will content them.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Hide not yourself from my supplication</p></b>.
        Do not stop your ear, or restrain your hand. When a man saw his neighbor
        in distress, and deliberately passed him by, he was said to hide himself
        from him; and the psalmist begs that the Lord would not so treat him.
        <p align="justify">
          In that dread hour when Jesus bore our sins upon the tree, his Father
          did hide himself, and this was the most dreadful part of all the Son
          of David's agony.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Well may each of us deprecate such a calamity as that God should
          refuse to hear our cries.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. Hear me and answer me.</p></b>This is
        the third time he prays the same prayer. He is in earnest, in deep and
        bitter earnest. If his God does not hear, he feels that all is over with
        him. He begs for his God to be a listener and an answerer.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            I am restless in my complaint, and moan noisily.
          </p></b
        >
        He gives reign to his sorrows, permits his mind to rehearse her griefs,
        and then to pour them out in such language as suggests itself at the
        time, whether it be coherent or not.
        <p align="justify">
          What a comfort that we may be thus familiar with our God!<i>
            We may not complain of him, but we may complain to him. </i
          >Our rambling thoughts when we are distracted with grief we may bring
          before him, and that too in utterances rather to be called a moan than
          language. He will attend so carefully that he will understand us, and
          he will often fulfill desires which we ourselves could not have
          expressed in intelligible words.
          <i>
            "Groanings that cannot be uttered"—are often prayers which cannot be
            refused. </i
          >Our Lord himself used strong crying and tears, and was heard in that
          he feared.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 3. Because of the voice of the enemy.</p></b
        >
        The enemy was vocal and voluble enough, and found a voice where his
        godly victim had nothing better than a "moan."
        <p align="justify">
          Slander is seldom short of expression, it prates and prattles
          evermore.
          <i
            >Neither David, nor our Lord, nor any of the saints were allowed to
            escape the attacks of venomous tongues, and this evil was in every
            case the cause of acute anguish</i

        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Because of the oppression of the wicked.</p></b
        >The unjust pressed and oppressed the righteous. Like an intolerable
        burden they crushed them down, and brought them to their knees.
        <p align="justify">
          This is a thrice told story, and to the end of time it will be true:
          he who is born after the flesh will persecute him that is born after
          the Spirit. The great seed of the woman suffered from a bruised heel.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For they cast iniquity upon me</p></b>, they
        black me with their soot bags, throw the dust of their lying over me,
        cast the vitriol of their calumny over me. They endeavor to trip me up,
        and if I do not fall they say I do.
        <b> <p align="justify">And in wrath they hate me.</p></b> With a hearty
        ill will they detested the holy man. It was no sleeping animosity, but a
        mortal rancor which reigned in their bosoms. The reader needs not that
        we show how applicable this is to our Lord.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 4. My heart is sore pained within me.</p></b
        >
        His spirit writhed in agony, like a poor worm; he was mentally as much
        in pain as a woman in travail physically. His inmost soul was touched—a
        wounded spirit who can bear? If this were written when David was
        attacked by his own favorite son, and ignominiously driven from his
        capital, he had reason enough for using these expressions.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p></b
        >Mortal fears seized him, he felt like one suddenly surrounded with the
        glooms of the shadow of death, upon whom the eternal night suddenly
        descends. Within and without he was afflicted, and his chief terror
        seemed to come from above, for he uses the expression, "Fallen upon me."
        <p align="justify">
          He gave himself up for lost. He felt that he was as good as dead. The
          inmost center of his nature was moved with dismay.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Think of our Lord in the garden, with his "soul exceeding sorrowful
          even unto death," and you have a parallel to the griefs of the
          psalmist.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Perhaps, dear reader, if as yet you have not trodden this gloomy way,
          you will do soon; then be sure to
          <i>mark the footprints of your Lord in this miry part of the road.</i>

            Verse 5. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me.
          </p></b
        >
        Like house breakers these robbers were entering his soul. Like one who
        feels a fainting fit coming over him, so the oppressed suppliant was
        falling into a state of terror. His fear was so great as to make him
        tremble. He did not know what would happen next, or how soon the worst
        would come.
        <p align="justify">
          The sly, mysterious whisperings of slander often cause a noble mind
          more fear than open antagonism; we can be brave against an open
          foe—but cowardly, plotting conspiracies bewilder and distract us.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And horror has overwhelmed me.</p></b> He was as
        one enveloped in a darkness that might be felt. As Jonah went down into
        the sea, so did David appear to go down into deeps of horror. He was
        unmanned, confounded, brought into a hideous state of suspense and
        mortal apprehension.

          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would

        >
        If he could not resist as an eagle—he would escape as a dove. Swiftly,
        and unobserved, on strong, untiring pinions would he would fly away from
        the abodes of slander and wickedness. His love of peace made him sigh
        for an escape from the scene of strife.
        <p align="justify">
          "O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,<br />
          Some boundless contiguity of shade,<br />

          Might never reach me more."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are all too apt to utter this vain desire, for vain it is—no wings
          of doves or eagles could bear us away from the sorrows of a trembling
          heart. Inward grief knows nothing of peace. Moreover, it is cowardly
          to shun the battle which God would have us fight<i
            >. We had better face the danger, for we have no armor for our
            backs. </i
          >He had need of a swifter conveyance than doves' pinions who would

          to her ark, and we amid all our sorrow may find rest in Jesus. We need
          not depart—all will be well if we trust in him.

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 7. Lo, then would I wander far off.</p></b

          present</i
        >. We shall be called to fly far enough away, and perhaps we shall be
        hesitant to go; we need not indulge vain notions of premature escape
        from earth.
        <b> <p align="justify">And remain in the wilderness.</p></b> He found it
        not such a dear abode when there—yet resolves now to make it his
        permanent abode. Had he been condemned to receive his wish he would
        before long have felt like Selkirk, in the poet's verse—
        <p align="justify">
          "O solitude, where are your charms<br />
          That sages have found in your face?<br />
          Better dwell in the midst of alarms<br />
          Than reign in this horrible place."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord, while free from all idle wishes, found much strength in
          solitude, and loved the mountain's brow at midnight, and the quiet
          shade of the olive trees of Gethsemane. It is better
          <i>practically to use </i>retirement than
          <i>pathetically to sigh </i>for it. Yet it is natural, when all men do
          us wrong, to wish to separate ourselves from their society. Nature,
          however, must yield to grace, and we must endure the contradiction of
          sinners against ourselves, and not be weary and faint in our minds.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> After such a flight well may the
        mind rest. When we are going too fast, and giving way too freely to
        regrets, it is well to cry, "halt," and pause awhile, until more sober
        thoughts return.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 8. I would hasten my escape.</p></b>He
        tried to pause but could not, like a horse which when pulled up, slips
        on a little because of the speed at which he was going. David declares
        that he would not waste a moment, or stay to bid adieu to his friends,
        but up and away at once, for fear he should be too late, and because he
        could bear the clamor of his foes no longer.
        <b> <p align="justify">From the windy storm and tempest.</p></b> A storm
        was brewing, and, like a dove, he would outfly it and reach a calmer
        region. Swifter than the storm cloud would he fly, to avoid the deluge
        of rain, and the flash of the lightning.

          None are such real enemies as false friends. Reproaches from those who
          have been intimate with us, and trusted by us, cut us to the quick;

        treason for such a one to prove false hearted. There was no excuse for
        such villainy.

          Judas stood very much in this relation to our Lord, he was treated as
          an equal, trusted as treasurer, and in that capacity often consulted

        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 14. We took sweet counsel together.</p></b>
        It was not merely the counsel which men take together in public or upon
        common themes, their fellowship had been tender and confidential. The
        traitor had been treated lovingly, and trusted much. Solace, mutual and
        cheering, had grown out of their intimate communings. There were secrets
        between them of no common kind. Soul had been in converse with soul, at
        least on David's part.

        <p align="justify">
          However feigned might have been the affection of the treacherous one,
          the betrayed friend had not dealt with him coldly, or guarded his
          utterance before him. Shame on the wretch who could belie such
          fellowship, and betray such confidence!

          All this was true of Ahithophel, and in a measure of Judas. His union
          with the Lord was on the score of faith, they were joined in the
          holiest of enterprises, he had been sent on the most gracious of
          errands. His cooperation with Jesus to serve his own abominable ends,
          stamped him as the firstborn of Hell. Better had it been for him had
          he never been born.

        soldier, as such, desires the overthrow of his foes, for this very end
        he fights. Viewed as a matter of law and justice, David was right in his
        wish; he was waging a just, defensive war against men utterly regardless
        of truth and justice.
        <p align="justify">Read these words as a warrior's imprecation.</p>

          There is, however, no need to read this verse as an imprecation, it is

          The three periods chosen are most fitting; to begin, continue, and end
          the day with God is supreme wisdom. Where time has naturally set up a
          boundary, there let us set up an altar-stone. The psalmist means that
          he will always pray; he will run a line of prayer right along the day,
          and track the sun with his petitions. Day and night he saw his enemies
          busy (verse 10), and therefore he would meet their activity by
