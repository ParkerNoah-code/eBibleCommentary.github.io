          IT is a strange, though familiar fact, that great differences of
          opinion exist respecting the Interpretation of Scripture. All
          Christians receive the Old and New Testament as sacred writings, but
          they are not agreed about the meaning which they attribute to them.
          The book itself remains as at the first; the commentators seem rather
          to reflect the changing atmosphere of the world or of the Church.
          Different individuals or bodies of Christians have a different point
          of view, to which their interpretation is narrowed or made to conform.
          It is assumed, as natural and necessary, that the same words will
          present one idea to the mind of the Protestant, another to the Roman
          Catholic; one meaning to the German, another to the English
          interpreter. The Ultramontane or Anglican divine is not supposed to be
          impartial in his treatment of passages which afford an apparent
          foundation for the doctrine of purgatory or the primacy of St. Peter
          on the one hand, or the three orders of clergy and the divine origin
          of episcopacy on the other. It, is a received view with many, that the
          meaning of the Bible is to be defined by that of the Prayer-book;
          while there are others who interpret the Bible and the Bible only'
          with a silent reference to the traditions of the Reformation.
          Philosophical differences are in the background, into which the
          differences about Scripture also resolve themselves. They seem to run
          up at last into a difference of opinion respecting Revelation itself
          -- whether given beside the human faculties or through them, whether
          an interruption of the laws of nature or their perfection and
          fulfilment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This effort to pull the authority of Scripture in different directions
          is not peculiar to our own day; the same phenomenon appears in the
          past history of the Church. At the Reformation, in the Nicene or
          Pelagian times, the New Testament was the ground over which men
          fought; it might also be compared to the armoury which furnished them
          with weapons. Opposite aspects of the truth which it contains were
          appropriated by different sides, Justified by faith without works' and
          justified by faith as well as works' are equally Scriptural
          expressions; the one has become the formula of Protestants, the other
          of Roman Catholics. The fifth and ninth chapters of the Romans, single
          verses such as a 1 Corinthians iii.15, John iii.3, still bear traces
          of many a life-long strife in the pages of commentators. The
          difference of interpretation which prevails among ourselves is partly
          traditional, that is to say, inherited from the controversies of
          former ages. The use made of Scripture by Fathers of the Church, as
          well as by Luther and Calvin, affects our idea of its meaning at the
          present hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another cause of the multitude of interpretations is the growth or
          progress of the human mind itself. Modes of interpreting vary as time
          goes on; they partake of the general state of literature or knowledge.
          It has not been easily or at once that mankind have learned to realize
          the character of sacred writings -- they seem almost necessarily to
          veil themselves from human eyes as circumstances change; it is the old
          age of the world only that has at length understood its childhood. (Or
          only rather perhaps is beginning to understand it, and learning to
          make allowance for its own deficiency of knowledge; for the infancy of
          the human race, as of the individual, affords but few indications of
          the workings of the mind within.) More often than we suppose the great
          sayings mid doings upon the earth, thoughts that breathe and words
          that burn,' are lost in a sort of chaos to the apprehension of those
          that come after. Much of past history is dimly seen and receives only
          a conventional interpretation, even when the memorials of it remain.
          There is a time at which the freshness of early literature is lost;
          mankind have turned rhetoricians, and no longer write or feel in the
          spirit which created it. In this unimaginative period in which sacred
          or ancient writings are partially unintelligible, many methods have
          been taken at different times to adapt the ideas of the past to the
          wants of the present. One age has wandered into the flowery paths of
          allegory,
        </p>
        <p>In pious meditation fancy fed.'</p>
        <p>
          Another has straitened the liberty of the Gospel by a rigid
          application of logic, the former being a method which was at first
          more naturally applied to the Old Testament, the latter to the New.
          Both methods of interpretation, the mystical and logical, as they may
          be termed, have been practised on the Vedas and the Koran, as well as
          on the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, the true glory and note of
          divinity in these latter being not that they have hidden mysterious or
          double meanings, but a simple and universal one, which is beyond them
          and will survive them. Since the revival of literature, interpreters
          have not unfrequently fallen into error of another kind from a
          pedantic and misplaced use of classical learning; the minute
          examination of words often withdrawing the mind from more important
          matters. A tendency may be observed within the last century to clothe
          systems of philosophy in the phraseology of Scripture. But new wine
          cannot thus be put into old bottles.' Though roughly distinguishable
          by different ages, these modes or tendencies also exist together; the
          remains of all of them may be remarked in some of the popular
          commentaries of our own day.
        </p>
        <p>
          More common than any of these methods, and not peculiar to any age, is
          that which may be called by way of distinction the rhetorical one. The
          tendency to exaggerate or amplify the meaning of simple words for the
          sake of edification may indeed have a practical use is sermons, the
          object of which is to awaken not so much the intellect as the heart
          and conscience. Spiritual food, like natural, may require to be of a
          certain bulk to nourish the human mind. But this tendency to
          edification' has had an unfortunate influence on the interpretation of
          Scripture. For the preacher almost necessarily oversteps the limits of
          actual knowledge, his feelings overflow with the subject; even if he
          have the power, he has seldom the time for accurate thought or
          inquiry. And in the course of years spent in writing, perhaps, without
          study, he is apt to persuade himself, if not others, of the truth of
          his own repetitions. The trivial consideration of making a discourse
          of sufficient length is often a reason why he overlays the words of
          Christ and his Apostles with commonplaces. The meaning of the text is
          not always the object which he has in view, but some moral or
          religious lesson which he has found it necessary to append to it; some
          cause which he is pleading, some error of the day he has to combat And
          while in some passages which he hardly dares to trust himself with the
          full force of Sciripture (Matthew v.34; ix.13; xix.21; Acts v.29), in
          others he extracts more from words than they really imply (Matthew
          xxii.21; xxviii.20; Romans xiii.1; &amp;c.), being more eager to guard
          against the abuse of some precept than to enforce it, attenuating or
          adapting the utterance of prophecy to the requirements or to the
          measure of modern times. Any one who has ever written sermons is aware
          how hard it is to apply Scripture to the wants of his hearers and at
          the same time to preserve its meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phenomenon which. has been described in the preceding pages is so
          familiar, and yet so extraordinary, that it requires an effort of
          thought to appreciate its true nature. We do not at once see the
          absurdity of the same words having many senses, or free our minds from
          the illusion that the Apostle or Evangelist must have written with a
          reference to the creeds or controversies or circumstances of other
          times. Let it be considered, then, that this extreme variety of
          interpretation is found to exist in the case of no other book, but of
          the Scriptures only. Other writings are preserved to us in dead
          languages -- Greek, Latin, Oriental, some of them in fragments, all of
          them originally in manuscript. It is true that difficulties arise in
          the explanation of these writings, especially in the most ancient,
          from our imperfect acquaintance with the meaning of words, or the
          defectiveness of copies, or the want of some historical or
          geographical information which is required to present an event or
          character in its true bearing. In comparison with the wealth and light
          of modern literature, our knowledge of Greek classical authors, for
          example, may be called imperfect and shadowy. Some of them have
          another sort of difficulty arising from subtlety or abruptness in the
          use of language; in lyric poetry especially, and some of the earlier
          prose, the greatness of the thought struggles with the stammering
          lips. It may he observed that all these difficulties occur also in
          Scripture; they are found equally in sacred and profane literature.
          But the meaning of classical authors is known with comparative
          certainty; and the interpretation of them seems to rest on a
          scientific basis. It is not, therefore, to philological or historical
          difficulties that the greater part of the uncertainty in the
          interpretation of Scripture is to be attributed. No ignorance of
          Hebrew or Greek is sufficient to account for it. Even the Vedas and
          the Zendavesta, though beset by obscurities of language probably
          greater than are found in any portion of the Bible, are interpreted,
          at least by European scholars, according to fixed rules, and beginning
          to be clearly understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring the parallel home, let us imagine the remains of some
          well-known Greek author, as Plato or Sophocles, receiving the same
          treatment at the hands of the world which the Scriptures have
          experienced. The text of such an author, when first printed by Aldus
          or Stephens, would be gathered from the imperfect or miswritten copies
          which fell in the way of the editors; after awhile older and better
          manuscripts come to light, and the power of using and estimating the
          value of manuscripts is greatly improved. We may suppose, further,
          that the readings of these older copies do not always conform to some
          received canons of criticism. Up to the year 1550, or 1624,
          alterations, often proceeding on no principle, have been introduced
          into the text; but now a stand is made -- an edition which appeared at
          the latter of the two dates just mentioned is invested with authority;
          this authorized text is a pièce de resistance against innovation. Many
          reasons are given why it is better to have bad readings to which the
          world is accustomed than good ones which are novel and strange -- why
          the later manuscripts of Plato or Sophocles are often to be preferred
          to earlier ones -- why it is useless to remove imperfections where
          perfect accuracy is not to be attained. A fear of disturbing the
          critical canons which have come down from former ages is, however,
          suspected to be one reason for the opposition. And custom and
          prejudice, and the nicety of the subject, and all the arguments which
          are intelligible to the many against the truth, which is intelligible
          only to the few, are thrown into the scale to preserve the works of
          Plato or Sophocles as nearly as possible in the received text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving the text we proceed to interpret and translate. The meaning of
          Greek words is known with tolerable certainty; and the grammar of the
          Greek language has been minutely analysed both in ancient and modern
          times. Yet the interpretation of Sophocles tentative and uncertain; it
          seems to vary from age to age: to some the great tragedian has
          appeared to embody in his choruses certain theological or moral ideas
          of his own age or country; there are others who find there an allegory
          of the Christian religion or of the history of modern Europe. Several
          schools of critics have commented on his works; to the Englishman he
          has presented one meaning, to the Frenchman another, to the German a
          third; the interpretations have also differed with the philosophical
          systems which the interpreters espoused. To one the same words have
          appeared to bear a moral, to another a symbolical meaning; a third is
          determined wholly by the authority of old commentators; while there is
          a disposition to condemn the scholar who seeks to interpret Sophocles
          from himself only and with reference to the ideas and beliefs of the
          age in which he lived. And the error of such an one is attributed not
          only to some intellectual but even to a moral obliquity which prevents
          his seeing the true meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be tedious to follow into details the absurdity which has
          been supposed. By such methods it would be truly said that Sophocles
          or Plato may be made to mean anything. It would seem as if Novum
          Organum were needed to lay down rules of interpretation for ancient
          literature. Still one other supposition has to be introduced which
          will appear, perhaps, more extravagant than any which have preceded.
          Conceive then that these modes of interpreting Sophocles had existed
          for ages; that great institutions and interests had become interwoven
          with them, and in some degree even the honour of nations and churches
          -- is it too much to say that in such a case they would be changed
          with difficulty, and that they would continue to be maintained long
          after critics and philosophers had seen that they were indefensible?
        </p>
        <p>
          No one who has a Christian feeling would place classical on a level
          with sacred literature; and there are other particulars in which the
          preceding comparison fails, as, for example, the style and subject.
          But, however different the subject, although the interpretation of
          Scripture requires a vision and faculty divine,' or at least a moral
          and religious interest which is not needed in the study of a Greek
          poet or philosopher, yet in what may be termed the externals of
          interpretation, that is to say, the meaning of words, the connexion of
          sentences, the settlement of the text, the evidence of facts, the same
          rules apply to the Old and New Testaments as to other books. And the
          figure is no exaggeration of the erring fancy of men in the use of
          Scripture, or of the tenacity with which they cling to the
          interpretations of other times, or of the arguments by which they
          maintain them. All the resources of knowledge may be turned into a
          means not of discovering the true rendering, but of upholding a
          received one. Grammar appears to start from an independent point of
          view, yet inquiries into the use of the article or the preposition
          have been observed to wind round into a defence of some doctrine.
          Rhetoric often magnifies its own want of taste into the design of
          inspiration. Logic (that other mode of rhetoric) is apt to lend itself
          to the illusion, by stating erroneous explanations with a clearness
          which is mistaken for truth. Metaphysical aid' carries away the common
          understanding into a region where it must blindly follow. Learning
          obscures as well as illustrates; it heaps up chaff when there is no
          more wheat. These are some of the ways in which the sense of Scripture
          has become confused, by the help of tradition, in the course of ages,
          under a load of commentators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book itself remains as at the first unchanged amid the changing
          interpretations of it. The office of the interpreter is not to add
          another, but to recover original one; the meaning, that is, of the
          words as they first struck on the ears or flashed before the eyes of
          those who heard and read them. He has to transfer himself to another
          age; to imagine he is a disciple of Christ or Paul; to disengage
          himself from all that follows. The history of Christendom is nothing
          to him; but only the scene at Galilee or Jerusalem, the handful of
          believers who gathered themselves together at Ephesus, or Corinth, or
          Rome. His eye is fixed on the form of one like the Son of man, or of
          the prophet who was girded with a garment of camel's hair, or of the
          Apostle who had a thorn in the flesh. The greatness of the Roman
          Empire is nothing to him; it is an inner not an outer world that he is
          striving to restore. All the after-thoughts of theology are nothing to
          him; they are not the true lights which light him in difficult places.
          His concern is with a book in which as in other ancient writings are
          some things of which we are ignorant; which defect of our knowledge
          cannot however be supplied by the conjectures of fathers or divines.
          The simple words of that book he tries to preserve absolutely pure
          from the refinements or distinctions of later times. He acknowledges
          that they are fragmentary, and would suspect himself, if out of
          fragments he were able to create a well-rounded system or a continuous
          history. The greater part of his learning is a knowledge of the text
          itself; he has no delight in the voluminous literature which has
          overgrown it. He has no theory of interpretation; a few rules guarding
          against common errors are enough for him. His object is to read
          Scripture like any other book, with a real interest and not merely a
          conventional one. He wants to be able open his eyes and see or imagine
          things as they truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing would be more likely to restore a natural feeling on this
          subject than a history of the Interpretation of Scripture. It would
          take us back to the beginning; it would present in one view the causes
          which have darkened the meaning of words in the course of ages; it
          would clear away the remains of dogmas, systems, controversies, which
          are encrusted upon them. It would show us the erring fancy' of
          interpreters assuming sometimes to have the Spirit of God Himself, yet
          unable to pass beyond the limits of their own age, and with a judgment
          often biassed by party. Great names there have been among them, names
          of men who may be reckoned also among the benefactors of the human
          race, yet comparatively few who have understood the thoughts of other
          times, or who have bent their minds to interrogate' the meaning of
          words. Such a work would enable us to separate the elements of
          doctrine and tradition with which the meaning of Scripture is
          encumbered in our own day. It would mark the different epochs of
          interpretation from the time when the living word was in process of
          becoming a book to Origen and Tertullian, from Origen to Jerome and
          Augustine, from Jerome and Augustine to Abelard and Aquinas; again
          making a new beginning with the revival of literature, franc Erasmus,
          the father of Biblical criticism in more recent times, with Calvin and
          Beza for his immediate successors, through Grotius and Hammond, down
          to De Witte and Meier, our own contemporaries. We should see how the
          mystical interpretation of Scripture originated in the Alexandrian
          age; how it blended with the logical and rhetorical; how both received
          weight and currency from their use in support of the claims and
          teaching of the Church. We should notice how the new learning' of the
          fifteenth and sixteenth centuries gradually awakened the critical
          faculty in the study of the sacred writings; how Biblical criticism
          has slowly followed in the track of philosophical and historical (not
          without a remoter influence exercised upon it also by natural
          science); how, too, the form of the scholastic literature, and even of
          notes on the classics, insensibly communicated itself to commentaries
          on Scripture. We should see how the word inspiration, from being used
          in a general way to express what may be called the prophetic spirit of
          Scripture, has passed, within the last two centuries, into a sort of
          technical term; how in other instances, the practice or feeling of
          earlier ages has been hollowed out into the theory or system of later
          ones, We should observe how the popular explanations of prophecy as in
          heathen (Thucyd. ii.54), so also in Christian times, had adapted
          themselves to the circumstances of mankind. We might remark that in
          our own country, and in the present generation especially, the
          interpretation of Scripture had assumed an apologetic character, as
          though making an effort to defend itself against some supposed inroad
          of science and criticism; while among German commentators there is,
          for the first time in the history of the world, an approach to
          agreement and certainty. For example, the diversity among German
          writers on prophecy is far less than among English ones. That is a new
          phenomenon which has to be acknowledged. More than any other subject
          of human knowledge, Biblical criticism has hung to the past; it has
          been hitherto found truer to the traditions of the Church than to the
          words of Christ. It has made, however, two great steps onward -- at
          the time of the Reformation and in our day. The diffusion of a
          critical spirit in history and literature is affecting the criticism
          of the Bible in our own day in a manner not unlike the burst of
          intellectual life in the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. Educated
          persons are beginning to ask, not what Scripture may be made to mean,
          but what it does. And it is no exaggeration to say that he who in the
          present state of knowledge will confine himself to the plain meaning
          of words and the study of their context may know more of the original
          spirit and intention of the authors of the New Testament than all the
          controversial writers of former ages put together.

          Such a history would be of great value to philosophy as well as to
          theology. It would be the history of the human mind in one of its most
          remarkable manifestations. For ages which are not original show their
          character in the interpretation of ancient writings. Creating nothing,
          and incapable of that effort of imagination which is required in a
          true criticism of the past, they read and explain the thoughts of
          former times by the conventional modes of their own. Such a history
          would form a kind of preface or prolegomena to the study of Scripture.
          Like the history of science, it would save many a useless toil; it
          would indicate the uncertainties on which it is not worth while to
          speculate further; the byepaths or labyrinths in which men lose
          themselves; the mines that are already worked out. He who reflects on
          the multitude of explanations which already exist of the number of the
          beast,' the two witnesses,' the little horn,' the man of sin,' who
          observes the manner in which these explanations have varied with the
          political movements of our own time, will be unwilling to devote
          himself to a method of inquiry in which there is so little appearance
          of certainty or progress. These interpretations would destroy one
          another if they were all placed side by side in a tabular analysis. It
          is an instructive fact, which may be mentioned in passing, that Joseph
          Mede, the greatest authority on this subject, twice fixed the end of
          the world in the last century and once during his own lifetime. In
          like manner, he who notices the circumstance that the explanations of
          the first chapter of Genesis have slowly changed, and, as it were,
          retreated before the advance of geology, will be unwilling to add
          another to the spurious reconcilements of science and revelation. Or
          to take an example of another kind, the Protestant divine who
          perceives that the types and figures of the Old Testament are employed
          by Roman Catholics in support of the tenets of their church, will be
          careful not to use weapons which it is impossible to guide, and which
          may with equal force be turned against himself. Those who have handled
          them on the Protestant side have before now fallen victims to them,
          not observing as they fell that it was by their own hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of the uncertainty which prevails in the interpretation of
          Scripture arises out of party efforts to wrest its meaning to
          different aides. There are, however, deeper reasons which have
          hindered the natural meaning of the text from immediately and
          universally prevailing. One of these is the unsettlement of many
          questions which have an important but indirect bearing on this
          subject. Some of these questions veil themselves in ambiguous terms;
          and no one likes to draw them out of their hiding-place into the light
          of day. In natural science it is felt to be useless to build on
          assumptions; in history we look with suspicion on a priori ideas of
          what ought to have been; in mathematics, when a step is wrong, we pull
          the house down until we reach the point at which the error is
          discovered. But in theology it is otherwise; there the tendency has
          been to conceal the unsoundness of the foundation under the fairness
          and loftiness of the superstructure. It has been thought safer to
          allow arguments to stand which, although fallacious, have been on the
          right side, than to point out their defect. And thus many principles
          have imperceptibly grown up which have overridden facts. No one would
          interpret Scripture, as many do, but for certain previous suppositions
          with which we come to the perusal of it. There can be no error in the
          Word of God,' therefore the discrepancies in the books of Kings and
          Chronicles are only apparent, or may be attributed to differences in
          the copies. It is a thousand times more likely that the interpreter
          should err than the inspired writer.' For a like reason the failure of
          a prophecy is never admitted, in spite of Scripture and of history
          (Jer. xxxvi.30; Isai. xxiii.; Amos vii.10-17); the mention of a name
          later than the supposed age of the prophet is not allowed, as in other
          writings, to be taken in evidence of the date (Isaiah xlv.1). The
          accuracy of the Old Testament is measured not by the standard of
          primeval history, but of a modern critical one, which, contrary to all
          probability, is supposed to be attained; this arbitrary standard once
          assumed, it becomes a point of honour or of faith to defend every
          name, date, place, which occurs. Or to take another class of
          questions, it is said that the various theories of the origin of the
          three first Gospels see all equally unknown to the Holy Catholic
          Church,' or as another writer of a different school expresses himself,
          they tend to sap the inspiration of the New Testament.' Again, the
          language in which our Saviour speaks of his own union with the Father
          is interpreted by the language of the creeds. Those who remonstrate
          against double senses, allegorical interpretations, forced
          reconcilements, find themselves met by a sort of presupposition that
          God speaks not as man speaks.' The limitation of the human faculties
          is confusedly appealed to as a reason for abstaining from
          investigations which are quite within their limits. The suspicion of
          Deism, or perhaps of Atheism, awaits inquiry. By such fears a good man
          refuses to be influenced, a philosophical mind is apt to cast them
          aside with too much bitterness. It is better or to close the book than
          to read it under conditions of thought which are imposed from without.
          Whether those conditions of thought are the traditions of the Church,
          or the opinions of the religious world -- Catholic or Protestant --
          makes no difference. They are inconsistent with the freedom of the
          truth and the moral character of the Gospel. It becomes necessary,
          therefore, to examine briefly some of these prior questions which lie
          in the way of a reasonable criticism.

          Among. these previous questions, that which first presents itself is
          the one already alluded to -- the question of inspiration. Almost all
          Christians agree in the word, which use and tradition have consecrated
          to express the reverence which they truly feel for the Old and New
          Testaments. But here the agreement of opinion ends; the meaning of
          inspiration has been variously explained, or more often passed over in
          silence from a fear of stirring the difficulties that would arise
          about it. It is one of those theological terms which may be regarded
          as great peacemakers,' but which are also sources of distrust and
          misunderstanding. For while we are ready to shake hands with any one
          who uses the same language as ourselves, a doubt is apt to insinuate
          itself whether he takes language in the same senses -- whether a
          particular term conveys all the associations to another which it does
          to ourselves -- whether it is not possible that one who disagrees
          about the word may not be more nearly agreed about the thing. The
          advice has, indeed, been given to the theologian that he should take
          care of words and leave things to themselves;' the authority, however,
          who gives the advice is not good -- it is placed by Goethe in the
          mouth of Mephistopheles. Pascal seriously charges the Jesuits with
          acting an similar maxim -- excommunicating those who meant the same
          thing and said another, holding communion with those who said the same
          thing and meant another. But this is not the way to heal the wounds of
          the Church of Christ; we cannot thus skin and film' the weak places of
          theology. Errors about words, and the attribution to words themselves
          of an excessive importance, lie at the root of theological as of other
          confusions. In theology they are more dangerous than in other
          sciences, because they cannot so readily be brought to the test of
          facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word inspiration has received more numerous gradations and
          distinctions of meaning than perhaps any other in the whole of
          theology. There is an inspiration of superintendence and an
          inspiration of suggestion; an inspiration which would have been
          consistent with the Apostle or Evangelist falling into error, and an
          inspiration which would have prevented him from erring; verbal organic
          inspiration by which the inspired person is the passive utterer of a
          Divine Word, and an inspiration which acts through the character of
          the sacred writer; there is an inspiration which absolutely
          communicates the fact to be revealed or statement to be made, and an
          inspiration which does not supersede the ordinary knowledge of human
          events; there is an inspiration which demands infallibility in matters
          of doctrine, but allows for mistakes in fact. Lastly, there is a view
          of inspiration which recognises only its supernatural and prophetic
          character, and a view of inspiration which regards the Apostles and
          Evangelists as equally inspired in their writings and in their lives,
          and in both receiving the guidance of the Spirit of truth in a manner
          not different in kind but only in degree from ordinary Christians.
          Many of these explanations lose sight of the original meaning and
          derivation of the word; some of them are framed with the view of
          meeting difficulties; all perhaps err in attempting to define what,
          though real, is incapable of being defined in an exact manner. Nor for
          any of the higher or supernatural views of inspiration is there any
          foundation in the Gospels or Epistles. There is no appearance in their
          writings that the Evangelists or Apostles had any inward gift, or were
          subject to any power external to them different from that of preaching
          or teaching which they daily exercised; nor do they anywhere lead us
          to suppose that they were free from error or infirmity. St. Paul
          writes like a Christian teacher, exhibiting all the emotions and
          vicissitudes of human feeling, speaking, indeed, with authority, but
          hesitating in difficult cases and more than once correcting himself,
          corrected, too, by the course of events in his expectation of the
          coming of Christ. The Evangelist who saw it, bare record, and his
          record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true' (John xix.35).
          Another Evangelist does not profess to be an original narrator, but
          only to set forth in order a declaration of what eye-witnesses had
          delivered,' like many others whose writings have not been preserved to
          us (Luke i.1, 2). And the result is in accordance with the simple
          profession and style in which they describe themselves; there is no
          appearance, that is to say, of insincerity or want of faith; but
          neither is there perfect accuracy or agreement. One supposes the
          original dwelling-place of our Lord's parents to have been Bethlehem
          (Matthew ii.1, 22), another Nazareth (Luke ii.4); they trace his
          genealogy in different ways; one mentions the thieves blaspheming,
          another has preserved to after-ages the record of the penitent thief;
          they appear to differ about the day and hour of the Crucifixion; the
          narrative of the woman who anointed our Lord's feet with ointment is
          told in all four, each narrative having more or less considerable
          variations. These are a few instances of the differences which arose
          in the traditions of the earliest ages respecting the history of our
          Lord. But he who wishes to investigate the character of the sacred
          writings should not be afraid to make a catalogue of them all with the
          view of estimating their cumulative weight. (For it is obvious that
          the answer which would be admitted in the case of a single
          discrepancy, will not be the true answer when there are many.) He
          should further consider that the narratives in which these
          discrepancies occur are short and partly identical -- a cycle of
          tradition beyond which the knowledge of the early fathers never
          travels, though if all the things that Jesus said and did had been
          written down, the world itself could not have contained the books that
          would have been written' (John xx.30; xxi.25). For the proportion
          which these narratives bar to the whole subject, as well as their
          relation to one another, is an important element in the estimation of
          differences. In the same way, he who would understand the nature of
          prophecy in the Old Testament, should have the courage to examine how
          far its details were minutely fulfilled. The absence of such a
          fulfilment may further lead him to discover that he took the letter
          for the spirit in expecting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject will clear of itself if we bear in mind two
          considerations: -- First, that the nature of inspiration can only be
          known from the examination of Scripture. There is no other source to
          which we can turn for information; and we have no right to assume some
          imaginary doctrine of inspiration like the infallibility of the Roman
          Catholic Church. To the question, What is inspiration?' the first
          answer therefore is, That idea of Scripture which we gather from the
          knowledge of it.' It is no mere a priori notion, but one to which the
          book is itself a witness. It is a fact which we infer from the study
          of Scripture -- not of one portion only, but of the whole. Obviously
          then it embraces writings of very different kinds -- the book of
          Esther, for example, or the Song of Solomon, as well as the Gospel of
          St. John. It is reconcileable with the mixed good and evil of the
          characters of the Old Testament, which nevertheless does not exclude
          them from the favour of God, with the attribution to the Divine Being
          of actions at variance with that higher revelation, which he has given
          of himself in the Gospel; tit is not inconsistent with imperfect or
          opposite aspects of the truth as in the book of Job or Ecclesiastes,
          with variations of the fact in the Gospels or the books of Kings and
          Chronicles, with inaccuracies of language in the Epistles of St. Paul.
          For these are all found in Scripture; neither is there any reason why
          they should not be, except a general impression that Scripture ought
          to have been written in a way different from what it has. A principle
          of progressive revelationadmits them all; and this is already
          contained in the words of our Saviour, Moses because of the hardness
          of your hearts;' or even in the Old Testament Henceforth there shall
          be no more this proverb in the house of Israel.' For what is
          progressive is necessarily imperfect in its earlier stages, and even
          erring to those who come after, whether it be the maxims of a
          half-civilized world which are compared with those of a civilized one,
          or the law with the Gospel. Scripture itself points the way to answer
          the moral objections to Scripture. Lesser difficulties remain, but
          only such as would be found commonly in writings of the same age or
          country. There is no more reason why imperfect narratives should be
          excluded from Scripture than imperfect grammar; no more ground for
          expecting that the New Testament would be logical or Aristotelian in
          form, than that it would be written in Attic Greek.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other consideration is one which has been neglected by writers on
          this subject. It is this -- that any true doctrine of inspiration must
          conform to all well-ascertained facts of history or of science. The
          same fact cannot be true and untrue, any more than the same words can
          have two opposite meanings. The same fact cannot be true in religion
          when seen by the light of faith, and untrue in science when looked at
          through the medium of evidence or experiment It is ridiculous to
          suppose that the sun goes round the earth in the same sense in which
          the earth goes round the sun; or that the world appears to have
          existed, but has not existed during the vast epochs of which geology
          speaks to us. But if so, there is no need of elaborate reconcilements
          of revelation and science; they reconcile themselves the moment any
          scientific truth is distinctly ascertained. As the idea of nature
          enlarges, the idea of revelation also enlarges; it was a temporary
          misunderstanding which severed them. And as the knowledge of nature
          which is possessed by the fee is communicated in its leading features
          at least to the many, they will receive with it a higher conception of
          the ways of God to man. It may hereafter appear as natural to the
          majority of mankind to see the providence of God in the order of the
          world, as it once was to appeal to interruptions of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that there are a class of scientific facts with which
          popular opinions on theology often conflict which do not seem to
          conform in all respects to the severer conditions of inductive
          science: such especially are the facts relating to the formation of
          the earth and the beginnings of the human race. But it is not worth
          while to fight on this debateable ground a losing battle in the hope
          that a generation will pass away before we sound a last retreat.
          Almost all intelligent persons are agreed that the earth has existed
          for myriads of ages; the best informed are of opinion that the history
          of nations extends back some thousand years before the Mosaic
          chronology; recent discoveries in geology may perhaps open a further
          vista of existence for the human species, while it is possible, and
          may one day be known, that mankind spread not from one but from many
          centres over the globe; or as others say, that the supply of links
          which are at present wanting in the chain of animal life may lead to
          new conclusions respecting the origin of man. Now let it be granted
          that these facts, being with the past, cannot be shown in the same
          palpable and evident manner as the facts of chemistry or physiology;
          and that the proof of some of them, especially of those last
          mentioned, is wanting; still it wanting; still it is a false policy to
          set up inspiration or revelation in opposition to them, a principle
          which can have no influence on them and should be rather kept out of
          their way. The sciences of geology and comparative philology are
          steadily gaining ground (many of the guesses of twenty years ago have
          become certainties, and the guesses of twenty years ago have become
          certainties, and the guesses of to-day may hereafter become so). Shall
          we peril religion on the possibility of their untruth? on such a cast
          to stake the life of man implies not only a recklessness of facts but
          a misunderstanding of the nature of the Gospel. If it is fortunate for
          Christian truth, that the admission of Galileo's discovery has for
          ever settled the principle of the relations between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A similar train of thought may be extended to the results of
          historical inquiries. These results cannot be barred by the dates or
          narrative of Scripture; neither should they be made to wind round into
          agreement with them. Again, the idea of inspiration must expand and
          take them in. Their importance in a religious point of view is not
          that they impugn or confirm the Jewish history, but that they show
          more clearly the purposes of God towards the whole human race. The
          recent chronological discoveries from Egyptian monuments do not tend
          to overthrow revelation, nor the Ninevite inscriptions to support it.
          The use of them on either side may indeed arouse a popular interest in
          them; it is apt to turn a scientific inquiry into a semi-religious
          controversy. And to religion either use is almost equally injurious,
          because seeming to rest truths important to human life on the mere
          accident of an archaeological discovery. Is it to be thought that
          Christianity gains anything from the deciphering of the names of some
          Assyrian and Babylonian kings, contemporaries chiefly with the later
          Jewish history? As little as it ought to lose from the appearance of a
          contradictory narrative of the Exodus in the chamber of an Egyptian
          temple of the year B.C.1500. This latter supposition may not be very
          probable. But it is worth while to ask ourselves the question whether
          we can be right in maintaining view of religion which can be affected
          by such a probability.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be a further assistance in the consideration of this subject,
          to observe that the interpretation of Scripture has nothing to do with
          any opinion respecting its origin. The meaning of Scripture is one
          thing; the inspiration of Scripture is another. It is conceivable that
          those who hold the most different views about the one, may be able to
          agree about the other. Rigid upholders of the verbal inspiration of
          Scripture, and those who deny inspiration of altogether, may
          nevertheless meet on the common ground of the meaning of words. If the
          term inspiration were to fall into disuse, no fact of nature, or
          history, or language, no event in the life of man, or dealings of God
          with him, would be in any degree altered. The word itself is but of
          yesterday, not found in the earlier confessions of the reformed faith;
          the difficulties that have arisen about it are only two or three
          centuries old. Therefore the question of inspiration, though in one
          sense important, is to the interpreter as though it were not
          important; he is in no way called upon to determine a matter with
          which he has nothing to do, and which was not determined by fathers of
          the Church. And he had better go on his way and leave the more precise
          definition of the word to the progress of knowledge and the results of
          the study of Scripture, instead of entangling himself with a theory
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one evil of conditions or previous suppositions in the study of
          Scripture that the assumption of them has led to an apologetic temper
          in the interpreters of Scripture. The tone of apology is always a tone
          of weakness and does injury to a good cause. It is the reverse of ye
          shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.' It is
          hampered with the necessity of making a defence, and also with
          previous defences of the same side; it accepts, with an excess of
          reserve and caution, the truth itself, when it comes from an opposite
          quarter. Commentators are often more occupied with the proof of
          miracles than with the declaration of life and immortality; with the
          fulfilment of the details of prophecy than with its life and power;
          with the reconcilement of the discrepancies in the narrative of the
          infancy, pointed out by Schleiermacher, than with the importance of
          the great event of the appearance of the Saviour. To this end was I
          born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear
          witness unto the truth.' The same tendency is observable also in
          reference to the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles, which are not
          only brought into harmony with each other, but interpreted with a
          reference to the traditions of existing communions. The natural
          meaning of particular expressions, as for example: Why are they then
          baptized for the dead' (1 Corinthians xv.29)? or the words because of
          the angels' (1 Corinthians xi.10); or, this generation shall not pass
          away until all these things be fulfilled' (Matthew xxiv.34); or, upon
          this rock will I build my Church (Matthew xvi.18), is set aside in
          favour of others, which, however improbable, are more in accordance
          with preconceived opinions, or seem to be more worthy of the Sacred
          writers. The language, and also the text, are treated on the same
          defensive and conservative principles. The received translations of
          Philippians ii.6 (Who, being in the form of God, thought it not
          robbery to be equal with God'), or of Romans iii.25 (Whom God hath set
          forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood'), or Romans
          xv.6 (God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ'), though
          erroneous, are not given up without a struggle; the 1 Timothy iii.16,
          and 1 John v.7, (the three witnesses), though the first (God manifest
          in the flesh, ThS for OS) is not found in the best manuscripts, and
          the second in no Greek manuscript worth speaking of, have not yet
          disappeared from the editions of the Greek Testament commonly in use
          in England, and still less from the English translation. An English
          commentator who, with Lachman and Tischendorf, supported also by
          authority of Erasmus, ventures to alter the punctuation of the
          doxology in Romans ix.5 (Who is over all God blessed for ever') hardly
          escapes the charge of heresy. That in most of these cases the words
          referred to have a direct bearing on important controversies is a
          reason not for retaining, but for correcting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temper of accommodation shows itself especially in two ways:
          first, in the attempt to adapt the truths of Scripture to the
          doctrines of the creeds; secondly, in the adaptation of the precepts
          and maxims of Scripture to the language or practice of our own age.
          Now the creeds are acknowledged to be a part of Christianity; they
          stand in a close relation to the words of Christ and his Apostles; nor
          can it be said that any heterodox formula makes a nearer approach to a
          simple and scriptural rule of faith. Neither is anything gained by
          contrasting them with Scripture, in which the germs of the expressions
          used in them are sufficiently apparent. Yet it does not follow that
          they should be pressed into the service of the interpreter. The growth
          of ideas in the interval which separated the first century from the
          fourth or sixth makes it impossible to apply the language of the one
          to the explanation of the other. Between Scripture and the Nicene or
          Athanasian Creed, a world of the understanding comes in -- that world
          of abstractions and second notions; and mankind are no longer at the
          same point as when the whole of Christianity was contained in the
          words, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou mayest be saved,'
          when the Gospel centred in the attachment to a living or recently
          departed friend and Lord. The language of the New Testament is the
          first utterance and consciousness of the mind of Christ; or the
          immediate vision of the Word of life (1 John i.1) as it presented
          itself before the eyes of his first followers, or as the sense of his
          truth and power grew upon them (Romans i.3, 4); the other is the
          result of three or four centuries of reflection and controversy. And
          although this last had a truth suited to its age, and its technical
          expressions have sunk deep into the heart of the human race, it is not
          the less unfitted to be the medium by the help of which Scripture is
          to be explained. If the occurrence of the phraseology of the Nicene
          age in a verse of the Epistles would detect the spuriousness of the
          verse in which it was found, how can the Nicene or Athanasian Creed be
          a suitable instrument for the interpretation of Scripture? That
          advantage which the New Testament has over the teaching of the Church,
          as representing what may be termed the childhood of the Gospel, would
          be lost if its language were required to conform to that of the
          Creeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          To attribute to St. Paul or the Twelve the abstract notion of
          Christian truth which afterwards sprang up in the Catholic Church, is
          the same sort of anachronism as to attribute to them a system of
          philosophy. It is the same error as to attribute to Homer the ideas of
          Thales or Heraclitus, or to Thales the mom developed principles of
          Aristotle and Plato. Many persons who have no difficulty in tracing
          the growth of institutions, yet seem to fail in recognising the more
          subtle progress of an idea. It is hard to imagine the absence of
          conceptions with which we are familiar; to go back to the germ of what
          we know only in maturity; to give up what has grown to us, and become
          a part of one minds. In the present case however the development is
          not difficult to prove. The statements of Scripture are unaccountable
          if we deny it; the silence of Scripture is equally unaccountable.
          Absorbed as St. Paul was in the person of Christ with an intensity of
          faith and love of which in modern days and at this distance of time we
          can scarcely form a conception -- high as he raised the dignity of his
          Lord above all things in heaven and earth -- looking to him as the
          Creator of all things, and the head of quick and dead, he does not
          speak of him as equal to the Father,' or of one substance with the
          Father.' Much of the language of the Epistles (passages for example
          such as Romans i.2; Philippians ii.6) would lose their meaning if
          distributed in alternate clauses between our Lord's humanity and
          divinity. Still greater difficulties would be introduced into the
          Gospels by the attempt to identify them with the Creeds. We should
          have to suppose that He was and was not tempted; that when he prayed
          to his Father he prayed also to Himself; that He knew and did not know
          of that hour' of which He as well as the angels were ignorant. How
          could He have said My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' or
          Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me.' How could He
          have doubted whether when the Son cometh he shall find faith upon the
          earth?' These simple and touching words have to be taken out of their
          natural meaning and connexion to be made the theme of apologetic
          discourses if we insist on reconciling them with the distinctions of
          later ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither, as has been already remarked, would the substitution of any
          other precise or definite rule of faith, as for example the Unitarian,
          be more favourable to the interpretation of Scripture. How could the
          Evangelist St. John have said the Word was God,' or God was the Word'
          (according to either mode of translating), or how would our Lord
          Himself have said, I and the Father are one' if either had meant that
          Christ was a mere man, a prophet or as one of the prophets?' No one
          who takes words in their natural sense can suppose that in the
          beginning' (John i.1) means at the commencement of the ministry of
          Christ?' or that the Word was with God,' only relates to the
          withdrawal of Christ to commune with God,' or that The Word is said to
          be God,' in the ironical sense of John x.35. But while venturing to
          turn one eye on these (perhaps obsolete) perversions of the meanings
          of words in old opponents, we must not forget also to keep the other
          open to our own. The object of the preceding remark is not to enter
          into controversy with them, or to balance the statements of one side
          with those of the other, but only to point out the error of
          introducing into the interpretation of Scripture the notions of a
          later age which is common alike to us and them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other kind of accommodation which was alluded to above arises out
          of the difference between the social and ecclesiastical state of the
          world, as it exists in actual fact, and the ideal which the Gospel
          presents to us. An ideal is, by its very nature, far removed from
          actual life. It is enshrined not in the material things of the
          external world, but in the heart and conscience. Mankind are
          dissatisfied at this separation; they fancy that they can make the
          inward kingdom an outward one also. But this is not possible. The
          frame of civilization, that is to say, institutions and laws, the
          usages of business, the customs of society, these are for the most
          part mechanical, capable only in a certain degree of a higher and
          spiritual life. Christian motives have never existed in such strength,
          as to make it safe or possible to entrust them with the preservation
          of social order. Other interests are therefore provided and other
          principles, often independent of the teaching of the Gospel, or even
          apparently at variance with it. If a man smite thee on the right cheek
          turn to him the other also;' is not a regulation of police but an
          ideal rule of conduct, not to be explained away, but rarely if ever to
          be literally acted upon in a civilized country; or rather to be acted
          upon always in spirit, yet not without a reference to the interests of
          the community. If a missionary were to endanger the public peace and
          come like the Apostles saying, I ought to obey God rather than man,'
          it is obvious that the most Christian of magistrates could not allow
          him (say in India or New Zealand) to shield himself under the
          authority of these words. For in religion as in philosophy there are
          two opposite poles; of truth and action, of doctrine and practice, of
          idea and fact. The image of God in Christ is over against the
          necessities of human nature and the state of man on earth. Our Lord
          himself recognises this distinction, when he says, Of whom do the
          kings of the earth gather tribute?' and then are the children free.'
          (Matth. xvii.26.) And again, Notwithstanding lest we should offend
          them,' &amp;c. Here are contrasted what may be termed the two poles of
          idea and fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          All men appeal to Scripture, and desire to draw the authority of
          Scripture to their side; its voice may be heard in the turmoil of
          political strife; a merely verbal similarity, the echo of a word, has
          weight in the determination of a controversy. Such appeals are not to
          be met always by counter-appeals; they rather lead to the
          consideration of deeper questions as to the manner in which Scripture
          is to be applied. In what relation does it stand to actual life? Is it
          a law, or only a spirit? for nations, or for individuals? to be
          enforced generally, or in details also? Are its maxims to be modified
          by experience, or acted upon in defiance of experience? Are the
          accidental circumstances of the first believers to become a rule for
          us? Is everything, in short, done or said by our Saviour and His
          Apostles, to be regarded as a precept or example which is to be
          followed on all occasions and to last for all time? That can hardly
          be, consistently with the changes of human things. It would be a rigid
          skeleton of Christianity (not the image of Christ), to which society
          and politics, as well as the lives of individuals, would be conformed.
          It would be the oldness of the letter, on which the world would be
          stretched; not the law of the spirit life' which St. Paul teaches. The
          attempt to force politics and law into the framework of religion is
          apt to drive us up into a corner, in which the great principles of
          truth and justice have no longer room to make themselves felt. It is
          better, as well as safer, to take the liberty with which Christ has
          made us free. For our Lord himself has left behind Him words, which
          contain a principle large enough to admit all the forms of society or
          of life; My kingdom is not of this world.' (John xviii.36.) It does
          not come into collision with politics or knowledge; it has nothing to
          do with the Roman government or the Jewish priesthood, or with
          corresponding institutions in the present day; it is a counsel of
          perfection, and has its dwelling-place in the heart of man. That is
          the real solution of questions of Church and State; all else is
          relative to the history or circumstances of particular nations. That
          is the answer to a doubt which is also raised respecting the
          obligation of the letter of the Gospel on individual Christians. But
          this inwardness of the words of Christ is what few are able to
          receive; it is easier to apply them superficially to things without,
          than to be a partaker of them from within. And false and miserable
          applications of them are often made, and the kingdom of God becomes
          the tool of the kingdoms of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The neglect of this necessary contrast between the ideal and the
          actual has had a twofold effect on the Interpretation of Scripture. It
          has led to an unfair appropriation of some portions of Scripture and
          an undue neglect of others. The letter is in many cases really or
          apparently in harmony with existing practices, or opinions, or
          institutions. In other cases it is far removed from them; it often
          seems as if the world would come to an end before the words of
          Scripture could be realized. The twofold effect just now mentioned,
          corresponds to these two classes. Some texts of Scripture have been
          eagerly appealed to and made (in one sense) too much of; they have
          been taken by force into the service of received opinions and beliefs;
          texts of the other class have been either unnoticed or explained away.
          Consider, for example, the extraordinary and unreasonable importance
          attached to single words, sometimes of doubtful meaning, in reference
          to any of following subjects: -- 1, Divorce; 2, Marriage with Wife's
          Sister; 3, Inspiration; 4, the Personality of the Holy Spirit; 5.
          Infant Baptism; 6, Episcopacy; 7, Divine Right of Kings; 8, Original
          Sin. There is, indeed, a kind of mystery in the way in which the
          chance words of a simple narrative, the occurrence of some accidental
          event, the use even of a figure of speech, or a mistranslation of a
          word in Latin or English, have affected the thoughts of future ages
          and distant countries. Nothing so slight that it has not been caught
          at; nothing so plain that it may not be explained away. What men have
          brought to the text they have also found there; what has received no
          interpretation or witness, either in the customs of the Church or in
          the thoughts of many hearts,' is still an unknown tongue' to them. It
          is with Scripture as with oratory, its effect partly depends on the
          preparation in the mind or in circumstances for the reception of it.
          There is no use of Scripture, no quotation or even misquotation of a
          word which is not a power in the world, when it embodies the spirit of
          a great movement or is echoed by the voice of a large party.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the first of the subjects referred to above, it is argued from
          Scripture that adulterers should not be allowed to marry again; and
          the point of the argument turns on the question whether the words
          (ektos logou porneias) saving for the cause of fornication, which I
          occur in the first clause of an important text on marriage, were
          designedly or accidentally omitted in the second (Matth. v.32.)
          Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of
          fornication, causeth her to commit adultery, and whosoever shall marry
          her that is divorced committeth adultery; compare also Mark x.11,
          12).2. The Scripture argument in the second instance is almost
          invisible, being drawn from a passage the meaning of which is
          irrelevant (Lev. xviii.18, Neither shalt thou take a wife to her
          sister to vex her, to uncover her nakedness beside the other in her
          lifetime'); and transferred from the Polygamy which prevailed in
          Eastern countries 3000 years ago to the Monogamy of the nineteenth
          century and the Christian Church, in spite of the custom and tradition
          of the Jews and the analogy of the brother's widow.3. In the third
          case the word (theopneustos) given by inspiration of God' is spoken of
          the Old Testament, and is assumed to apply to the New, including that
          Epistle in which the expression occurs (2 Tim. iii.16.) 4. In the
          fourth example the words used are mysterious (John xiv.26; xvi.15),
          and seem to come out of the depths of a divine consciousness; they
          have sometimes, however, received a more exact meaning than they would
          truly bear; what is spoken in a figure is construed with the severity
          of a logical statement, while passages of an opposite tenour are
          overlooked or set aside.5. In the fifth instance, the mere mention of
          a family of a jailer at Philippi who was baptized (he and all his,'
          Acts xvi.33), has led to the inference that in this family there were
          probably young children, and hence that infant baptism is, first,
          permissive, secondly, obligatory.6. In the sixth case the chief stress
          of the argument from Scripture turns on the occurrence of the word
          (episkopos) bishop in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, which is
          assisted by a supposed analogy between the position of the Apostles
          and of their successors; although the term bishop is clearly used in
          the passages referred to as well as in other parts of the New
          Testament indistinguishably from Presbyter, and the magisterial
          authority of bishops in after ages is unlike rather than like the
          personal authority of the Apostles in the beginning of the Gospel. The
          further development of Episcopacy into Apostolical succession has
          often been rested on the promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even to the
          end of the world.' 7. In the seventh case the precepts of order which
          are addressed in the Epistle to the fifth monarchy men of those days,'
          are transferred to a duty of obedience to hereditary princes; the fact
          of the house of David, the Lord's anointed' sitting on the throne of
          Israel is converted into a principle for all times and countries. And
          the higher lesson which our Saviour teaches: Render unto Cæsar the
          things which are Cæsar's,' that is to say, Render unto all their due,
          and to God above all,' is spoiled by being made into a precept of
          political subjection.8. Lastly, the justice of God who rewardeth every
          man according to his works,' and the Christian scheme of redemption
          has been staked on two figurative expressions of St. Paul to which
          there is no parallel in any other part of Scripture (1 Corinthians
          xv.22. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
          alive,' and the corresponding passage in Romans v.12); notwithstanding
          the declaration of the Old Testament as also of the New, Every soul
          shall bear its own iniquity,' and neither this man sinned nor his
          parents.' It is not necessary for our purpose to engage further in the
          matters of dispute which have arisen by the way in attempting to
          illustrate the general argument. Yet to avoid misconception it may be
          remarked that many of the principles, rules, or truths mentioned, as
          for example, Infant Baptism, or the Episcopal Form of Church
          Government, have sufficient grounds; the weakness is the attempt to
          derive them from Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this minute and rigid enforcement of the words of Scripture in
          passages where the ideas expressed in them either really or apparently
          agree with received opinions or institutions, there remains to be
          contrasted the neglect, or in some instances the misinterpretation of
          other words which are not equally in harmony with the spirit of the
          age. In many of our Lord's discourses he speaks of the blessedness of
          povrty:' of the hardness which they that have riches will experience
          in attaining eternal life.' It is easier for a camel to go through a
          needle's eye,' and Son, thou in they lifetime receivedst thy good
          things,' and again, One thing thou lackest, go sell all that thou
          hast.' Precepts like these do not appeal to our own experience of
          life; they are unlike anything that we see around us at the present
          day, even among good men; to some among us they will recall the
          remarkable saying of Lessing, -- that the Christian religion had tried
          for eighteen centuries; the religion of Christ remained to be tried.'
          To take them literally would be injurious to ourselves and to society
          (at least, so we think). Religious sects or who have seized this
          aspect of Christianity have come to no good, and have often ended in
          extravagance. It will not do to go into the world saying Woe unto you,
          ye rich men,' or on entering a noble mansion to repeat the
          denunciations of the prophet about cedar and vermillion,' or on being
          shown the prospect of a magnificent estate to cry out Woe unto them
          that lay field to field that they may be placed alone in the midst of
          the earth.' Times have altered, we say, since these denunciations were
          uttered; what appeared to the Prophet or Apostle a violation of the
          appointment of Providence has now become a part of it. It will not do
          to make a great supper, and mingle at the same board the two ends of
          society, as modern phraseology calls them, fetching in the poor, the
          maimed, the lame, the blind,' to fill the vacant places of noble
          guests. That would be eccentric in modern times, and even hurtful.
          Neither is it suitable for us to wash one another's feet, or to
          perform any other menial office, because our Lord set us the example.
          The customs of society do not admit it; no good would done by it, and
          singularity is of itself an evil. Well, then, are the precepts of
          Christ not to be obeyed? Perhaps in their fullest sense they cannot be
          obeyed. But at any rate they are not to be explained away; the
          standard of Christ is not to be lowered to ordinary Christian life,
          because ordinary Christian life cannot rise, even in good men, to the
          standard of Christ. And there may be standing aamong us' some one in
          ten thousand whom we know not,' in whom there is such a divine union
          of charity and prudence that he is most blest in the entire fulfilment
          of the precept -- Go sell all that thou hast,' -- which to obey
          literally in other cases would be evil, and not good. Many there have
          been, doubtless (not one or two only), who have given all that they
          had on earth to their family or friends -- the poor servant casting
          her two mites into the treasury,' denying herself the ordinary
          comforts of life for the sake of an erring parent or brother; that is
          not probably an uncommon case, and as near an approach as in this life
          we make to heaven. And there may be some one or two rare natures in
          the world in whom there is such a divine courtesy, such a gentleness
          and dignity of soul, that differences of rank seem to vanish before
          them, and they look upon the face of others, even of their own
          servants and dependents, only as they are in the sight of God and will
          be in His kingdom. And there may be some tender and delicate woman
          among us, who feels that she has a divine vocation to fulfil the most
          repulsive offices towards the dying inmates of a hospital, or the
          soldier perishing in a foreign land. Whether such examples of
          self-sacrifice are good or evil, must depend, not altogether on social
          or economical principles, but on the spirit of those who offer them,
          and the power which they have in themselves of making all things kin.'
          And even if the ideal itself were not carried out by us in practice,
          it has nevertheless what may be termed a truth of feeling. Let them be
          as eh h g. Let them that have riches be as though they had them not.'
          Let the rich man wear the load lightly; he will one day fold them up
          as a vesture.' Let not the refinement of society make us forget that
          it is not the refined only who are received into the kingdom of God;
          nor the daintiness of life hide from us the bodily evils of which the
          rich man and Lazarus are alike heirs. Thoughts such as these have the
          power to reunite us to our fellow-creatures from whom the accidents of
          birth, position, wealth have separated us; they soften our hearts
          towards them, when divided not only by vice and ignorance, but what is
          even a greater barrier, difference of manners and associations. For if
          there be anything in our own fortune superior to that of others,
          instead of idolizing or cherishing it in the blood, the Gospel would
          have us cast it from us; and if there be anything mean or despised in
          those with whom we have to do, the Gospel would have us regard such as
          friends and brethren, yea, even as having the person of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another instance of apparent, if not real neglect of the precepts of
          Scripture, is furnished by the commandment against swearing. No
          precept about divorce is so plain, so universal, so exclusive as this;
          Swear not at all.' Yet we all know how the custom of Christian
          countries has modified this counsel of perfection' which was uttered
          by the Saviour. This is the more remarkable because in this case the
          precept is not, as in the former, practically impossible of fulfilment
          or even difficult. And yet in this instance again, the body who have
          endeavoured to follow more nearly the letter of our Lord's
          commandment, seem to have gone against the common sense of the
          Christian world. Or to add one more example: Who, that hears of the
          Sabbatarianism, as it is called, of some Protestant countries, would
          imagine that the Author of our religion had cautioned his disciples,
          not against the violation of the Sabbath, but only against its formal
          and Pharisaical observance; or that the chiefest of the Apostles had
          warned the Colossians to Let no man judge them in respect of the new
          moon, or of the sabbath-days.' (ii.16.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The neglect of another class of passages is even more surprising, the
          precepts contained in them being quite practicable and in harmony with
          the existing state of the world. In this instance it seems as if
          religious teachers had failed to gather those principles of which they
          stood most in need. Think ye that those eighteen upon whom the tower
          of Siloam fell?' is the characteristic lesson of the Gospel on the
          occasion of any sudden visitation. Yet it is another reading of such
          calamities that is commonly insisted upon. The observation is seldom
          made respecting the parable of the good Samaritan, that the true
          neighbour is also a person of a different religion. The words, Forbid
          him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that
          can lightly speak evil of me,' are often said to have no application
          to sectarian differences in the present day, when the Church is
          established and miracles have ceased. The conduct of our Lord to the
          woman taken in adultery, though not intended for our imitation always,
          yet affords a painful contrast to the excessive severity with which
          even a Christian society punishes the errors of women. The boldness
          with which St. Paul applies the principle of individual judgment, Let
          every man be fully persuaded in his mind,' as exhibited also in the
          words quoted above, Let no man judge you in respect of the new moon,
          or of the sabbath-days,' is far greater than would be allowed in the
          present age. Lastly, that the tenet of the damnation of the heathen
          should ever have prevailed in the Christian world, or that the
          damnation of Catholics should have been a received opinion among
          Protestants, implies a strange forgetfulness of such passages as
          Romans ii.1-16. Who rewardeth every man according to his work; and
          When the Gentiles, which know not the law, do by nature the things
          contained in the law,' &amp;c. What a difference between the simple
          statement which the Apostle makes of the justice of God and of
          uncovenanted mercies' or invincible ignorance' of theologians half
          reluctant to give up, yet afraid to maintain the advantage of denying
          salvation to those are extra palum Ecclesiæ!'
        </p>
        <p>
          The same habit of silence or misinterpretation extends to words or
          statements of Scripture in which doctrines are thought to be
          interested. When maintaining the Athanasian doctrine of the Trinity,
          we do not readily recall the verse, of that hour knoweth no man, no
          not the Angels of God, neither the Son, but the Father.' (Mark
          xiii.30.) The temper or feeling which led St. Ambrose to doubt the
          genuineness of the words marked in italics, leads Christians in our
          own day to pass them over. We are scarcely just to the Millenarians or
          to those who maintain the continuance miracles or spiritual gifts in
          the Christian Church, in not admitting the degree of support which is
          afforded to their views by many passages of Scripture. The same remark
          applies to the Predestinarian controversy; the Calvinist is often
          hardly dealt with, in being deprived of his real standing ground in
          the third and ninth chapters of the Epistle to the Romans. And the
          Protestant who thinks himself bound to prove from Scripture the very
          details of doctrine or discipline which are maintained in his Church,
          is often obliged to have recourse to harsh methods, and sometimes to
          deny appearances which seem to favour some particular tenet of Roman
          Catholicism. (Matthew xvi.18, 19; xviii.18; 1 Cor. iii.15.) The Roman
          Catholic, on the other hand, scarcely observes that nearly all the
          distinctive articles of his creed are wanting in the New Testament;
          the Calvinist in fact ignores almost the whole of the sacred volume
          for the sake of a few verses. The truth is, that in seeking to prove
          our own opinions out of common Scripture, we are constantly falling
          into the common fallacy of opening our eyes to one class of facts and
          closing them to another. The favourite verses shine like stars, while
          the rest of the page is thrown into the shade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor indeed is it easy to say what is the meaning of proving a doctrine
          from Scripture.' For when we demand logical equivalents and similarity
          of circumstances, when we balance adverse statements, St. James and
          St. Paul, the New Testament with the Old, it will be hard to
          demonstrate from Scripture any complex system either of doctrine or
          practice. The Bible is not a book of statutes in which words have been
          chosen to cover the multitude of cases, but in the greater portion of
          it, especially the Gospels and Epistles, like a man talking to his
          friend.' Nay, more, it is a book written in the East, which is in some
          degree liable to be misunderstood, because it speaks the language and
          has the feeling of Eastern lands. Nor can we readily determine in
          explaining the words of our Lord or of St. Paul, how much (even of
          some of the passages just quoted) is to be attributed to Oriental
          modes of speech. Expressions which would be regarded as rhetorical
          exaggerations in the Western world are the natural vehicles of thought
          to an Eastern people. How great then must be the confusion where an
          attempt is made to draw out these Oriental modes with the severity of
          a philosophical or legal argument! Is it not such a use of the words
          of Christ which he himself rebukes when he says, It is the spirit that
          quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.' (John vi.52, 63.)
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a further way in which the language of creeds and liturgies
          as well as the ordinary theological use of terms exercises a
          disturbing influence on the interpretation of Scripture. Words which
          occur in Scripture are singled out and orated in systems like stones
          taken out of an old building and put into a new one. They acquire a
          technical meaning more or less divergent from the original one. It is
          obvious that their use in Scripture, and not their later and technical
          sense, must furnish the rule of interpretation. We should not have
          recourse to the meaning of a word in Polybius, for the explanation of
          its use in Plato, or to the turn of a sentence in Lycophron, to
          illustrate a construction of Æschylus. It is the same kind of
          anachronism which would interpret Scripture by the scholastic or
          theological use of the language of Scripture. It is remarkable that
          this use is indeed partial, that is to say it affects one class of
          words and not another. Love and truth, for example, have never been
          theological terms; grace and faith, on the other hand, always retain
          an association with the Pelagian or Lutheran controversies.
          Justification and inspiration are derived from verbs which occur in
          Scripture, and the later substantive has clearly affected the meaning
          of the original verb or verbal in the places where they occur. The
          remark might be further illustrated by the use of Scriptural language
          respecting the Sacraments, which has also had a reflex influence on
          its interpretation in many passages of Scripture especially in the
          Gospel of St. John. (John iii.5; vi, 56, &amp;c.) Minds which are
          familiar with the mystical doctrine of the Sacraments seem to see a
          reference to them in almost every place in the Old Testament as well
          as in the New, in which the words water,' or bread and wine' may
          happen to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other questions meet us on the threshold of a different kind, which
          also affect therefore the interpretation of Scripture, and demand an
          answer. Is it admitted that the Scripture has one and only one true
          meaning? Or are we to follow the fathers into mystical and allegorical
          explanations? or with the majority of modern interpreters to confine
          ourselves to the double senses of prophecy, and the symbolism of the
          Gospel in the law? In either case, we assume what can never be proved,
          and an instrument is introduced of such subtlety and pliability as to
          make the Scriptures mean anything -- Gallus in campanili,' as the
          Waldenses described it; the weathercock on the church tower,' which is
          turned hither and thither by every wind of doctrine. That the present
          age has grown out of the mystical methods of the early fathers is a
          part of its intellectual state. No one will now seek to find hidden
          meanings in the scarlet thread of Rahab, or the number of Abraham's
          followers, or in the little circumstance mentioned after the
          resurrection of the Saviour that St. Peter was the first to enter the
          sepulchre. To most educated persons in the nineteenth century, these
          applications of Scripture appear foolish. Yet is rather the excess of
          the method which provokes a smile than the method itself. For many
          remains of the mystical interpretation exist among ourselves; it is
          not the early fathers only who have read the Bible crosswise, or
          deciphered it as a book of symbols. And the uncertainty is the same in
          any part of Scripture if there is a departure from the plain and
          obvious meaning. If, for example, we alternate the verses in which our
          Lord speaks of the last things between the day of judgment and the
          destruction of Jerusalem; or, in the elder prophecies, which are the
          counterparts of these, make a corresponding division between the
          temporal and the spiritual Israel; or again if we attribute to the
          details of the Mosaical ritual a reference to the New Testament; or,
          once more, supposing the passage of the Red Sea to be regarded not
          merely as a figure of baptism, but as a pre-ordained type, the
          principle is conceded; there is no good reason why the scarlet thread
          of Rahab should not receive the explanation given to it by Clement. A
          little more or a little less of the method does not make the
          difference between certainty and uncertainty in the interpretation of
          Scripture. In whatever degree it is practised it is equally incapable
          of being reduced to any rule; it is the interpreter's fancy, and is
          likely to be not less but more dangerous and extravagant when it adds
          the charm of authority from its use in past ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question which has been suggested runs up into a more general one,
          the relation between the Old and New Testaments.' For the Old
          Testament will receive a different meaning accordingly as it is
          explained from itself or from the New. In the first case a careful and
          conscientious study of each one for itself is all that is required; in
          the second case the types and ceremonies of the law, perhaps the very
          facts and persons of the history, will be assumed to be predestined or
          made after a pattern corresponding to the things that were to be in
          the latter days. And this question of itself stirs another question
          respecting the interpretation of the Old Testament in the New. Is such
          interpretation to be regarded as the meaning of the original text, or
          an accommodation of it to the thoughts of other times?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our object is not to attempt here the determination of these
          questions, but to point out that they must be determined before any
          real progress can be made or any agreement arrived at in the
          interpretation of Scripture. With one more example of another kind we
          may close this part of the subject. The origin of the three first
          Gospels is an inquiry which has not been much considered by English
          theologians since the days of Bishop Marsh. The difficulty of the
          question has been sometimes misunderstood; the point being how there
          can be so much agreement in words, and so much disagreement both in
          words and facts; the double phenomenon is the real perplexity -- how
          in short there can be all degrees of similarity and dissimilarity, the
          kind and degree of similarity being such as to make it necessary to
          suppose that large portions are copied from each other or from common
          documents; the dissimilarities being of a kind which seem to render
          impossible any knowledge in the authors of one another's writings. The
          most probable solution of this difficulty is that the tradition on
          which the three first Gospels are based was at first preserved orally,
          and slowly put together and written in the three forms which it
          assumed at a very early period, those forms being in some places,
          perhaps, modified by translation. It is not necessary to develope this
          hypothesis farther. The point to be noticed is, that whether this or
          some other theory be the true account (and some such account is
          demonstrably necessary), the assumption of such a theory, or rather
          the observation of the facts on which it rests, cannot but exercise an
          influence on interpretation. We can no longer speak of three
          independent witnesses of the Gospel narrative. Hence there follow some
          other consequences. (1.) There is no longer the same necessity as
          heretofore to reconcile inconsistent narratives; the harmony of the
          Gospels only means the parallelism of similar words. (2.) There is no
          longer any need to enforce everywhere the connexion of successive
          verses, for the same words will be found to occur in different
          connexions in the different Gospels. (3.) Nor can the designs
          attributed to their authors be regarded as the free handling of the
          same subject on different plans; the difference consisting chiefly in
          the occurrence or absence of local or verbal explanations or the
          addition or omission of certain passages. Lastly, it is evident that
          no weight can be given to traditional statements of facts about the
          authorship, as, for example, that respecting St. Mark being the
          interpreter of St. Peter, because the Fathers who have handed down
          these statements were ignorant or unobservant of the great fact, which
          is proved by internal evidence, that they are for the most part of
          common origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until these and the like questions are determined by interpreters, it
          is not possible that there should be agreement in the interpretation
          of Scripture. The Protestant and Catholic, the Unitarian and
          Trinitarian will continue to fight their battle on the ground Of the
          New Testament, The Preterists and Futurists, those who maintain that
          the roll of prophecies is completed in past history, or in the
          apostolical age; those who look forward to a long series of events
          which are yet to come [eis aphanes ton muthon anenenkon ouk echu
          elenchon], may alike claim the authority of the book of Daniel, or the
          Revelation. Apparent coincidences will always he discovered by those
          who want to find them. Where there is no critical interpretation of
          Scripture, there will be a mystical or rhetorical one. If words have
          more than one meaning; may have any meaning. Instead of being a rule
          of life or faith, Scripture becomes the expression of the
          ever-changing aspect of religious opinions. The un-changeable word of
          God, in the name of which we repose, is changed by each age and each
          generation in accordance with its passing fancy. The book in which we
          believe all religious truth to be contained, is the most uncertain of
          all books, because interpreted by arbitrary and uncertain methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is probable that some of the preceding statements may be censured
          as a wanton exposure of the difficulties of Scripture. It will be said
          that such inquiries are for the few, while the printed page lies open
          to the many, and that the obtrusion of them may offend some weaker
          brother, some half-educated or prejudiced soul, for whom,'
          nevertheless, in the touching language of St. Paul, Christ died.' A
          confusion of the heart and head may lead sensitive minds into a
          desertion of the principles of the Christian life, which are their own
          witness, because they are in doubt about facts which are really
          external to them. Great evil to character may sometimes ensue from
          such causes. No man can serve two' opinions without a sensible harm to
          his nature. The consciousness of this responsibility should be always
          present to writers on theology. But the responsibility is really
          two-fold; for there is a duty to speak the truth as well as a duty to
          withhold it. The voice of a majority of the clergy throughout the
          world, the half sceptical, half conservative instincts of many laymen,
          perhaps, also, individual interest, are in favour of the latter
          course; while a higher expediency pleads that honesty is the best
          policy,' and that truth alone makes free.' To this, it may be replied
          that truth is not truth to those who are unable to use it; no
          reasonable man would attempt to lay before the illiterate such a
          question as that concerning the origin of the Gospels. And yet it may
          be rejoined once more, the healthy tone of religion among the poor
          depends upon freedom of thought and inquiry among the educated. In
          this conflict of reasons, individual judgment must at last decide.
          That there has been no rude, or improper unveiling of the difficulties
          of Scripture in the preceding pages, is thought to be shown by the
          following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that the difficulties referred to are very well know; they
          force themselves on the attention, not only of the student, but of
          every intelligent reader of the New Testament, whether in Greek or
          English. The treatment of such difficulties in theological works is no
          measure of public opinion respecting them. Thoughtful persons, whose
          minds have turned towards theology, are continually discovering that
          the critical observations which they make themselves have been made
          also by others apparently without concert. The truth is that they have
          been led to them by the same causes, and these again lie deep in the
          tendencies of education and literature in the present age. But no one
          is willing to break through the reticence which is observed on these
          subjects; hence a sort of smouldering scepticism. It is probable that
          the distrust is greatest at the time when the greatest efforts are
          made to conceal it. Doubt comes in at the window, when inquiry is
          denied at the door. The thoughts of able and highly educated young men
          almost always stray towards the first principles of things; it is a
          great injury to them, and tends to raise in their minds a sort of
          incurable suspicion, to find that there is one book of the fruit of
          the knowledge of which they are forbidden freely to taste, that is,
          the Bible. The same spirit renders the Christian minister almost
          powerless in the hands of his opponents. He can give no true answer to
          the mechanic or artizan who has either discovered by his mother-wit or
          who retails at second-hand the objections of critics; for he is unable
          to look at things as they truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, as the time has come when it is no longer possible to ignore
          the results of criticism, it is of importance that Christianity should
          be seen to be in harmony with them. That objections to some received
          views should be valid, and yet that they should be always held up as
          the objections of infidels, is a mischief to the Christian cause. It
          is a mischief that critical observations which any intelligent man can
          make for himself, should be ascribed to atheism or unbelief. It would
          be a strange and almost incredible thing that the Gospel, which at
          first made war only on the vices of mankind, should now be opposed to
          one of the highest and rarest of human virtues -- the love of truth.
          And that in the present day the great object of Christianity should
          be, not to change the lives of men, but to prevent them from changing
          their opinions; that would be a singular inversion of the purposes for
          which Christ came into the world. The Christian religion is in a false
          position when all the tendencies of knowledge are opposed to it. Such
          a position cannot be long maintained, or can only end in the
          withdrawal of the educated classes from the influences of religion. It
          is a grave consideration whether we ourselves may not be in an earlier
          stage of the same religious dissolution, which seems to have gone
          further in Italy and France. The reason for thinking so is not to be
          sought in the external circumstances of our own or any other religious
          communion, but in the progress of ideas with which Christian teachers
          seem to be ill at ease. Time was when the Gospel was before the age;
          when it breathed a new life into a decaying world -- when the
          difficulties of Christianity were difficulties of the heart only, and
          the highest minds found in its truths not only the rule of their
          lives, but a well-spring of intellectual delight. Is it to be held a
          thing impossible that the Christian religion, instead of shrinking
          into itself, may again embrace the thoughts of men upon the earth? Or
          is it true that since the Reformation all intellect has gone the other
          way?' and that in Protestant countries reconciliation is as hopeless
          as Protestants commonly believe to be the case in Catholic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who hold the possibility of such a reconcilement or restoration
          of belief, are anxious to disengage Christianity from all suspicion of
          disguise or unfairness, They wish to preserve the historical use of
          Scripture as the continuous witness in all ages of the higher things
          in the heart of man, as the inspired source of truth and the way to
          the better life. They are willing to take away some of the external
          supports, because they are not needed and do harm; also, because they
          interfere with the meaning. They have a faith, not that after a period
          of transition all things will remain just as they were before, but
          that they will all come round again to the use of man and to the glory
          of God. When interpreted like any other book, by the same rules of
          evidence and the same canons of criticism, the Bible will still remain
          unlike any other book; its beauty will be freshly seen, as of a
          picture which is restored after many ages to its original state; it
          will create a new interest and make for itself a new kind of authority
          by the life which is in it. It will be a spirit and not a letter; as
          it was in the beginning, having an influence like that of the spoken
          word, or the book newly found. The purer the light in the human heart,
          the more it will have an expression of itself in the mind of Christ;
          the greater the knowledge of the development of man, the truer will be
          the insight gained into the increasing purpose' of revelation. In
          which also the individual soul has a practical part, finding a
          sympathy with its own imperfect feelings, in the broken utterance of
          the Psalmist or the Prophet as well as in the fulness of Christ. The
          harmony between Scripture and the life of man, in all its stages, may
          be far greater than appears at present. No one can form any notion
          from what we see around us, of the power which Christianity might have
          if it were at one with the conscience of man, and not at variance with
          his intellectual convictions. There, a world weary of the heat and
          dust of controversy -- of speculations about God and man -- weary too
          of the rapidity of its own motion, would return home and find rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for the faith that the Gospel might win again the minds of
          intellectual men, it would be better to leave religion to itself,
          instead of attempting to draw them together. Other walks in literature
          have peace and pleasure and profit; the path of the critical
          Interpreter of Scripture is almost always a thorny one in England. It
          is not worth while for any one to enter upon it who is not supported
          by a sense that he has a Christian and moral object. For although an
          Interpreter of Scripture in modern times will hardly say with the
          emphasis of the Apostle, Woe is me, if I speak not the truth without
          regard to consequences,' yet he too may feel it a matter of duty not
          to conceal the things which he knows. He does not hide the
          discrepancies of Scripture, because the acknowledgment of them is the
          first step towards agreement among interpreters. He would restore the
          original meaning, because seven other' meanings take the place of it;
          the book is made the sport of opinion and the instrument of perversion
          of life. He would take the excuses of the head out of the way of the
          heart; there is hope too that by drawing Christians together on the
          ground of Scripture, he may also draw them nearer to one another. He
          is not afraid that inquiries, which have for their object the truth,
          can ever be displeasing to the God of truth; or that the Word of God
          is in any such sense a word as to be hurt by investigations into its
          human origin and conception.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be thought another ungracious aspect of the preceding remarks,
          that they cast a slight upon the interpreters of Scripture in former
          ages. The early Fathers, the Roman Catholic mystical writers, the
          Swiss and German Reformers, the Nonconformist divines, have qualities
          for which we look in vain among ourselves; they throw an intensity of
          light upon the page of Scripture which we nowhere find in modern
          commentaries. But it is not the light of interpretation. They have a
          faith which seems indeed to have grown dim now-a-days, but that faith
          is not drawn from the study of Scripture; it is the element in which
          their own mind moves which overflows on the meaning of the text. The
          words of Scripture suggest to them their own thoughts or feelings.
          They are preachers, or in the New Testament sense of the word,
          prophets rather than interpreters. There is nothing in such a view
          derogatory to the saints and doctors of former ages. That Aquinas or
          Bernard did not shake themselves free from the mystical method of the
          Patristic times, or the Scholastic one which was more peculiarly their
          own; that Luther and Calvin read the Scriptures in connexion with the
          ideas which were kindling in the mind of their age, and the events
          which were passing before their eyes, these and similar remarks are
          not to be construed as depreciatory of the genius or learning of
          famous men of old; they relate only to their interpretation of
          Scripture, in which it is no slight upon them to maintain that they
          were not before their day.
        </p>
        <p>
          What remains may be comprised in a few precepts, or rather is the
          expansion of a single one. Interpret the Scripture like any other
          book. There are many respects in which Scripture is unlike any other
          book; these will appear in the results of such an interpretation. The
          first step is to know the meaning, and this can only be done in the
          same careful and impartial way that we ascertain the meaning of
          Sophocles or of Plato. The subordinate principles which flow out of
          this general one will also be gathered from the observation of
          Scripture. No other science of Hermeneutics is possible but an
          inductive one, that is to say, one based on the language and thoughts
          and narrations of the sacred writers. And it would be well to carry
          the theory of interpretation no further than in the case of other
          works. Excessive system tends to create an impression that the meaning
          of Scripture is out of our reach, or is to be attained in some other
          way than by the exercise of manly sense and industry. Who would write
          a bulky treatise about the method to be pursued in interpreting Plato
          or Sophocles? Let us not set out on our journey so heavily equipped
          that there is little chance of our arriving at the end of it. The
          method creates itself as we go on, beginning only with a few
          reflections directed against plain errors. Such reflections are the
          rules of common sense, which we acknowledge with respect to other
          works written in dead languages: without pretending to novelty they
          may help us to return to nature' in the study of the sacred writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it may be laid down that Scripture has one meaning -- the
          meaning which it had to the mind of the prophet or evangelist who
          first uttered or wrote, to the hearers or readers who first received
          it. Another view may be easier or more familiar to us, seeming to
          receive a light and interest from the circumstances of our own age.
          But such accommodation of the text must be laid aside by the
          interpreter, whose business is to place himself as nearly as possible
          in the position of the sacred writer. That is no easy task -- to call
          up the inner and outer life of the contemporaries of our Saviour; to
          follow the abrupt and involved utterance of St. Paul or one of the old
          Prophets; to trace the meaning of words when language first become
          Christian. He will often have to choose the more difficult
          interpretation (Galatians ii.20; Romans iii.15, &amp;c.), and to
          refuse one more in agreement with received opinions, because the
          latter is less true to the style and time of the author. He may incur
          the charge of singularity, or confusion of ideas, or ignorance of
          Greek, from a misunderstanding of the peculiarity of the subject in
          the person who the charge. For if it be said that the translation of
          some Greek words is contrary to the usages of grammar (Galatians
          iv.3), that is not in every instance to be denied; the point is
          whether the usages of grammar are always observed. Or if it be
          objected to some interpretation of Scripture that it is difficult and
          perplexing, the answer is -- that may very well be -- it is the fact,'
          arising out of differences in the modes of thought of other times, or
          irregularities in the use of language which no art of the interpreter
          can evade. One consideration should be borne in mind, that the Bible
          is the only book in the world written in different styles and at many
          different times, which is in the hands of persons of all degrees of
          knowledge and education. The benefit of this outweighs the evil, yet
          the evil should be admitted -- namely, that it leads to a hasty and
          partial interpretation of Scripture, which often obscures the true
          one. A sort of conflict arises between scientific criticism and
          popular opinion. The indiscriminate use of Scripture has a further
          tendency to maintain erroneous readings or translations; some which
          are allowed to be such by scholars have been stereotyped in the mind
          of the English reader; and it becomes almost a political question how
          far we can venture to disturb them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are difficulties of another kind in many parts of Scripture, the
          depth and inwardness of which require a measure of the same qualities
          in the interpreter himself. There are notes struck in places, which
          like some discoveries of science have sounded before their time; and
          only after many days have been caught up and found a response on the
          earth. There are germs of truth which after thousands of years have
          never yet taken root in the world. There are lessons in the Prophets
          which, however simple, mankind hare not yet learned even in theory;
          and which the complexity of society rather tends to hide; aspects of
          human life in Job and Ecclesiastes which have a truth of desolation
          about them which we faintly realize in ordinary circumstances. It is,
          perhaps, the greatest difficulty of all to enter into the meaning of
          the words of Christ -- so gentle, so human, so divine, neither adding
          to them nor marring their simplicity. The attempt to illustrate or
          draw them out in detail, even to guard against their abuse, is apt to
          disturb the balance of truth. The interpreter needs nothing short of
          fashioning' in himself the image of the mind of Christ. He has to be
          born again into a new spiritual or intellectual world, from which the
          thoughts of this world are shut out. It is one of the highest tasks on
          which the labour of a life can be spent, to bring the words of Christ
          a little nearer the heart of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while acknowledging this inexhaustible or infinite character of
          the sacred writings, it does not, therefore, follow that we are
          willing to admit of hidden or mysterious meanings in them (in the same
          way we recognise the wonders and complexity of the laws of nature to
          be far beyond what eye has seen or knowledge reached, yet it is not
          therefore to be supposed that we acknowledge the existence of some
          other laws different in kind from those we know which are incapable of
          philosophical analysis). In like manner we have no reason to attribute
          to the Prophet or Evangelist any second or hidden sense different from
          that which appears on the surface. All that the Prophet meant may not
          have been consciously present to his mind; there were depths which to
          himself also were but half revealed. He beheld the fortunes of Israel
          passing into the heavens; the temporal kingdom was fading into an
          eternal one. It is not to be supposed that what he saw at a distance
          only was clearly defined to him; or that the universal truth which was
          appearing and reappearing in the history of the surrounding world took
          a purely spiritual or abstract form in his mind, There is a sense in
          which we may still say with Lord Bacon, that the words of prophecy are
          to be interpreted as the words of one with whom a thousand years are
          as one day, and one day as a thousand years.' But that is no reason
          for turning days into years, or for interpreting the things that must
          shortly come to pass' in the book of Revelation, as the events of
          modern history, or for separating the day of judgment from the
          destruction of Jerusalem in the Gospels. The double meaning which is
          given to our Saviour's discourse respecting the last things is not
          that form of eternity' of which Lord Bacon speaks; it resembles rather
          the doubling of an object when seen through glasses placed at
          different angles. It is true also that there are types in Scripture
          which were regarded as such by the Jews themselves, as for example,
          the scapegoat, or the paschal lamb. But that is no proof of all
          outward ceremonies being types when Scripture is silent; -- (if we
          assume the New Testament as a tradition running parallel with the Old,
          may not the Roman Catholic assume with equal reason a tradition
          running parallel with the New?) Prophetic symbols, again, have often
          the same meaning in different places (e g., the four beasts or living
          creatures, the colours white or red); the reason is that this meaning
          is derived from some natural association (as of fruitfulness, purity,
          or the like); or again, they are borrowed in some of the later
          prophecies from earlier ones; we are not, therefore, justified in
          supposing any hidden connexion in the prophecies where they occur.
          Neither is there any ground for assuming design of any other kind in
          Scripture any more than in Plato or Homer. Wherever there is beauty
          and order, there is design; but there is no proof of any artificial
          design, such as is often traced by the Fathers, in the relation of the
          several parts of a book, or of the several books to each other. That
          is one of those mischievous notions which enables us, under the
          disguise of reverence, to make Scripture mean what we please. Nothing
          that can be said of the greatness or sublimity, or truth, or depth, or
          tenderness, of many passages, is too much. But that greatness is of a
          simple kind; it is not increased by double senses, or systems of
          types, or elaborate structure, or design. If every sentence was a
          mystery, every word a riddle every letter a symbol, that would not
          make the Scriptures more worthy of a Divine author; it is a heathenish
          or Rabbinical fancy which reads them in this way. Such complexity
          would not place them above but below human compositions in general;
          for it would deprive them of the ordinary intelligibleness of human
          language. It is not for a Christian theologian to say that words were
          given to mankind to conceal their thoughts, neither was revelation
          given them to conceal the Divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second rule is an application of the general principle; interpret
          Scripture from itself' as in other respects, like any other book
          written in an age and country of which little or no other literature
          survives, and about which we know almost nothing except what is
          derived from its pages. Not that all the parts of Scripture are to be
          regarded as an indistinguishable mass. The Old Testament is not to be
          identified with the New, nor the Law with the Prophets, nor the
          Gospels with the Epistles, nor the Epistles of St. Paul to be
          violently harmonised with the Epistle of St James. Each writer, each
          successive age, has characteristics of its own, as strongly marked, or
          more strongly, than those which are found in the authors or periods of
          classical literature. These differences are not to be lost in the idea
          of a Spirit from whom they proceed or by which they were overruled.
          And therefore, illustration of one part of Scripture by another should
          be confined to writings of the same age and the same authors, except
          where the writings of different ages or persons offer obvious
          similarities. It may be said further that illustration should be
          chiefly derived, not only from the same author, but from the same
          writing, or from one of the same period of his life. For example, the
          comparison of St. John and the synoptic' Gospels, or of the Gospel of
          St. John with the Revelation of St. John, will tend rather to confuse
          than to elucidate the meaning of either; while, on the other hand, the
          comparison of the Prophets with one another, and with the Psalms,
          offers many valuable helps and lights to the interpreter. Again, the
          connexion between the Epistles written by the Apostle St. Paul about
          the same time (e.g. Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, --
          Colossians, Philippians, Ephesians, -- compared with Romans,
          Colossians, -- Ephesians, Galatians, &amp;c.,) is far closer than of
          Epistles which are separated by an interval of only a few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          But supposing all this to be understood, and that by the
          interpretation of Scripture from itself is meant a real interpretation
          of like by like, it may be asked, what is it that we gain from a
          minute comparison of a particular author or writing? The
          indiscriminate use of parallel passages taken from one end of
          Scripture and applied to the other (except so far as earlier
          compositions may have afforded the material or the form of later ones)
          is useless and uncritical. The uneducated, or imperfectly educated
          person who looks out the marginal references of the English Bible,
          imagining himself in this way to gain a clearer insight into the
          Divine meaning, is really following the religious associations of his
          own mind. Even the critical use of parallel passages is not without
          danger. For are we to conclude that an author meant in one place what
          he says in another? Shall we venture to mend a corrupt phrase on the
          model of some other phrase, which memory, prevailing over judgment,
          calls up and thrusts into the text? It is this fallacy which has
          filled the pages of classical writers with useless and unfounded
          emendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meaning of the Canon Non nisi ex Scripturâ Scripturam potes
          interpretari,' is only this, That we cannot understand Scripture
          without becoming familiar with it.' Scripture is a world by itself,
          from which we must exclude foreign influences, whether theological or
          classical. To get inside that world is an effort of thought and
          imagination, requiring the sense of a poet as well as a critic --
          demanding much more than learning a degree of original power and
          intensity of mind. Any one who, instead of burying himself in the
          pages of the commentators, would learn the sacred writings by heart,
          and paraphrase them in English, will probably make a nearer approach
          to their true meaning that he would gather from any commentary. The
          intelligent mind will ask its own questions, and find for the most
          part its own answers. The true use of interpretation is to get rid of
          interpretation, and leave us alone in company with the author. When
          the meaning of Greek words is once known, the young student has almost
          all the real materials which are possessed by the greatest Biblical
          scholar, in the book itself. For almost our whole knowledge of the
          history of the Jews is derived from the Old Testament and the
          Apocryphal books, and almost our whole knowledge of the life of Christ
          and of the Apostolical age is derived from the New; whatever is added
          to them is either conjecture, or very slight topographical or
          chronological illustration. For this reason the rule given above,
          which is applicable to all books, is applicable to the New Testament
          more than any other.

          Yet in this consideration of the separate books of Scripture it is not
          to be forgotten that they have also a sort of continuity. We make a
          separate study of the subject, the mode of thought, in some degree
          also of the language of each book. And at length the idea arises in
          our minds of a common literature, a pervading life, an overruling law.
          It may be compared to the effect of some natural scene in which we
          suddenly perceive a harmony or picture, or to the imperfect appearance
          of design which suggests itself in looking at the surface of the
          globe. That is to say, there is nothing miraculous or artificial in
          the arrangement of the books of Scripture; it is the result, not the
          design, which appears in them when bound in the same volume. Or if we
          like so to say, there is design, but a natural design which is
          revealed to after ages. Such continuity or design is best expressed
          under some notion of progress or growth, not regular, however, but
          with broken and imperfect stages, which the want of knowledge prevents
          our minutely defining. The great truth of the unity of God was there
          from the first; slowly as the morning broke in the heavens, like some
          central light, it filled and afterwards dispersed the mists of human
          passion in which it was itself enveloped. A change passes over the
          Jewish religion from fear to love, from power to wisdom, from the
          justice of God to the mercy of God, from the nation to the individual,
          from this world to another; from the visitation of the sins of the
          fathers upon the children, to every soul shall bear its own iniquity;'
          from the fire, the earthquake, and the storm, to the still small
          voice. There never was a time after the deliverance from Egypt, in
          which the Jewish people did not bear a kind of witness against the
          cruelty and licentiousness of the surrounding tribes. In the decline
          of the monarchy, as the kingdom itself was sinking under foreign
          conquerors, whether springing from contact with the outer world, or
          from some reaction within, the undergrowth of morality gathers
          strength; first, in th anticipation of prophecy, secondly, like a
          green plant in the hollow rind of Pharisaism, -- and individuals pray
          and commune with God each one for himself. At length the tree of life
          blossoms; the faith in immortality which had hitherto slumbered in the
          heart of man, intimated only in doubtful words (2 Sam. xii.23; Psalm
          xvii.15), or beaming for an instant in dark places (Job xix.25), has
          become the prevailing belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an interval in the Jewish annals which we often exclude from
          our thoughts, because it has no record in the canonical writings --
          extending over about four hundred years, from the last of the prophets
          of the Old Testament to the forerunner of Christ in the New. This
          interval, about which we know so little, which is regarded by many as
          a portion of secular rather than of sacred history, was nevertheless
          as fruitful in religious changes as any similar period which preceded.
          The establishment of the Jewish sects, and the wars of the Maccabees,
          probably exercised as great an influence on Judaism as the captivity
          itself. A third influence was that of the Alexandrian literature,
          which was attracting the Jewish intellect, at the same time that the
          Galilæan zealot was tearing the nation in pieces with the doctrine
          that it was lawful to call no man master but God.' In contrast with
          that wild fanaticism as well as with the proud Pharisee, came One most
          unlike all that had been before, as the kings or rulers of mankind. In
          an age which was the victim of its own passions, the creature of its
          own circumstances, the slave of its own degenerate religion, our
          Saviour taught a lesson absolutely free from all the influences of a
          surrounding world. He made the last perfect revelation of God to man;
          a revelation not indeed immediately applicable to the state of society
          or the world, but in its truth and purity inexhaustible by the after
          generations men. And of the first application of the truth which he
          taught as a counsel of perfection to the actual circumstances of
          mankind, we have the example in the Epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a general conception of growth or development in Scripture,
          beginning with the truth of the Unity of God in the earliest books and
          ending with the perfection of Christ, naturally springs up in our
          minds in the perusal of the sacred writings. It is a notion of value
          to the interpreter, for it enables him at the same time to grasp the
          whole and distinguish the parts. It saves him from the necessity of
          maintaining that the Old Testament is one and the same everywhere;
          that the books of Moses contain truths or precepts, such as the duty
          of prayer or the faith in immortality, or the spiritual interpretation
          of sacrifice, which no one has ever seen there. It leaves him room
          enough to admit all the facts of the case. No longer is he required to
          defend or to explain away David's imprecations against his enemies, or
          his injunctions to Solomon, any more than his sin in the matter of
          Uriah. Nor is he hampered with a theory of accommodation. Still the
          sense of the increasing purpose which through the ages ran' is present
          to him, nowhere else continuously discernible or ending in a divine
          perfection. Nowhere else is there found the same interpenetration of
          the political and religious element -- a whole nation, though never
          good for much at any time,' possessed with the conviction that it was
          living in the face of God -- in whom the Sun of righteousness shone
          upon the corruption of an Eastern nature -- the fewest of all people,'
          yet bearing the greatest part in the education of the world. Nowhere
          else among the teachers and benefactors of mankind is there any form
          like His, in whom the desire of the nation is fulfilled, and not of
          that nation only,' but of all mankind, whom He restores to His Father
          and their Father, to His God and their God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a growth or development may be regarded as a kind of progress
          from childhood to manhood. In the child there is an anticipation of
          truth; his reason is latent in the form of feeling; many words are
          used by him which he imperfectly understands; he is led by temporal
          promises, believing that to be good is to be happy always; he is
          pleased by marvels and has vague terrors. He is confined to a spot of
          earth, and lives in a sort of prison of sense, yet is bursting also
          with a fulness of childish life; he imagines God to be like a human
          father, only greater and more awful; he is easily impressed with
          solemn thoughts, but soon rises up to play' with other children. It is
          observable that his ideas of right and wrong are very simple, hardly
          extending to another life; they consist chiefly in obedience to his
          parents, whose word is his law. As he grows older he mixes more and
          more with others; first with one or two who have a great influence in
          the direction of his mind. At length the world opens upon him; another
          work of education begins; and he learns to discern more truly the
          meaning of things and his relation to men in general. (You may
          complete the image, by supposing that there was a time in his early
          days when he was a helpless outcast in the land of Egypt and the house
          of bondage). And as he arrives at manhood he reflects on his former
          years, the progress of his education, the hardships of his infancy,
          the home of his youth (the thought of which is ineffaceable in after
          life), and he now understands that all this was but a preparation for
          another state of being, in which he is to play a part for himself. And
          once more in age you may imagine him like the patriarch looking back
          on the entire past, which he reads anew, perceiving that the events of
          life had a purpose or result which was not seen at the time; they seem
          to him bound each to each by natural piety.'

          Which things are an allegory,' the particulars of which any one may
          interpret for himself. For the child born after the flesh is the
          symbol of the child born after the Spirit. The law was a schoolmaster
          to bring men to Christ,' and now we are under a schoolmaster' no
          longer. The anticipation of truth which came from without to the
          childhood or youth of the human race is witnessed to within; the
          revelation of God is not lost but renewed in the heart and
          understanding of the man. Experience has taught us the application of
          the lesson in a wider sphere. And many influences have combined to
          form the after life' of the world. When at the close (shall we say) of
          a great period in the history of man, we cast our eyes back on the
          course of events, from the angel of his presence in the wilderness' to
          the multitude of peoples, nations, languages, who are being drawn
          together by His Providence -- from the simplicity of the pastoral
          state in the dawn of the world's day, to all the elements of
          civilization and knowledge which are beginning to meet and mingle in a
          common life, we also understand that we are no longer in our early
          home, to which, nevertheless, we fondly look; and that the end is yet
          unseen, and the purposes of God towards the human race only half
          revealed. And to turn once more to the Interpreter of Scripture, he
          too feels that the continuous growth of revelation which he traces in
          the Old and New Testament, is a part of a larger whole extending over
          the earth and reaching to another world.
        </p>
        <p>§ 3.</p>
        <p>
          Scripture has an inner life or soul; it has also an outward body or
          form. That form is language, which imperfectly expresses our common
          notions, much more those higher truths which religion teaches. At the
          time when our Saviour came into the world the Greek language was
          itself in a state of degeneracy and decay. It had lost its poetic
          force, and was ceasing to have the sway over the mind which classical
          Greek once held. That is a more important revolution in the mental
          history of mankind, than we easily conceive in modern times, when all
          languages sit loosely on thought, and the peculiarities, or
          idiosyncrasies of one are corrected by our knowledge of another. It
          may be numbered among the causes which favoured the growth of
          Christianity. That degeneracy was a preparation for the Gospel -- the
          decaying soil in which the new elements of life were to come forth --
          the beginning of another state of man, in which language and mythology
          and philosophy were no longer to exert the same constraining power as
          in the ancient world. The civilised portion of mankind were becoming
          of one speech, the diffusion of which along the shores of the
          Mediterranean sea made a way for the entrance of Christianity into the
          human understanding, just as the Roman empire prepared the framework
          of its outward history. The first of all languages, for glory and for
          beauty,' had become the common' dialect of the Macedonian kingdoms; it
          had been moulded in the schools of Alexandria to the ideas of the East
          and the religious wants of Jews. Neither was it any violence to its
          nature to be made the vehicle of the new truths which were springing
          up in the heart of man. The definiteness and absence of reflectiveness
          in the earlier forms of human speech, would have imposed a sort of
          limit on the freedom and spirituality of the Gospel; even the Greek of
          Plato would have coldly furnished forth' the words of eternal life.' A
          religion which was to be universal required the divisions of
          languages, as of nations, to be in some degree broken down. [Poena
          linguarum dispersit homines, donum linguarum in unum collegit.'] But
          this community or freedom of language was accompanied by corresponding
          defects; it had lost its logical precision; it was less coherent; and
          more under the influence of association. It might be compared to a
          garment which allowed and yet impeded the exercise of the mind by
          being too large and loose for et
        </p>
        <p>
          From the inner life of Scripture it is time to pass on to the
          consideration of this outward form, including that other framework of
          modes of thought and figures of speech which is between the two. A
          knowledge of the original language is a necessary qualification of the
          Interpreter of Scripture. It takes away at least one chance of error
          in the explanation of a passage; it removes one of the films which
          have gathered over the page; it brings the meaning home in a more
          intimate and subtle way than a translation could do. To this, however,
          another qualification should be added, which is, the logical power to
          perceive the meaning of words in reference to their context. And there
          is a worse fault than ignorance of Greek in the interpretation of the
          New Testament, that is, ignorance of any language. The Greek Fathers,
          for example, are far from being the best verbal commentators, because
          their knowledge of Greek often leads them away from the drift of the
          passage. The minuteness of the study in our own day has also a
          tendency to introduce into the text associations which are not really
          found there. There is a danger of making words mean too much;
          refinements of signification are drawn out of them, perhaps contained
          in their etymology, which are lost in common use and parlance. There
          is the error of interpreting every particle, as though it were a link
          in the argument, instead of being, as is often the case, an
          excrescence of style. The verbal critic magnifies his art, which is
          really great in Æschylus or Pindar, but not of equal importance in the
          interpretation of the simpler language of the New Testament. His love
          of scholarship will sometimes lead him to impress a false system on
          words and constructions. A great critic who has commented on the three
          first chapters of the Epistle to the Galatians, has certainly afforded
          a proof that it is possible to read the New Testament under a
          distorting influence from classical Greek. The tendency gains support
          from the undefined feeling that Scripture does not come behind in
          excellence of language any more than of thought. And if not as in
          former days, the classic purity of the Greek of the New Testament, yet
          its certainty and accuracy, the assumption of which, as any other
          assumption, is only the parent of inaccuracy, is still maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study of the language of the New Testament has suffered in another
          way by following too much the track of classical scholarship. All dead
          languages which have passed into the hands of grammarians, have given
          rise to questions which have either no result or in which the
          certainty, or if certain, the importance of the result, is out of
          proportion to the labour spent in attaining it. The field is exhausted
          by great critics, and then subdivided among lesser ones. The subject,
          unlike that of physical science, has a limit, and unless new ground is
          broken up, as for example in mythology, or comparative philology, is
          apt to grow barren. Though it is not true to say that we know as much
          about the Greeks and Romans as we ever shall,' it is certain that we
          run a danger from the deficiency of material, of wasting time in
          questions which do not add anything to real knowledge, or in
          conjectures which must always remain uncertain, and may in turn give
          way to other conjectures in the next generation. Little points may be
          of great importance when rightly determined, because the observation
          of them tends to quicken the instinct of language; but conjectures
          about little things or rules respecting them which were not in the
          mind of Greek authors themselves, are not of equal value. There is the
          scholasticism of philology, not only in the Alexandrian, but in our
          own times; as in the middle ages, there was the scholasticism of
          philosophy. Questions of more orthography, about which there cannot be
          said to have been a right or wrong, have been pursued almost with a
          Rabbinical minuteness. The story of the scholar who regretted that he
          had not concentrated his life on the dative case,' is hardly a
          caricature of the spirit of such inquiries. The form of notes to the
          classics often seems to arise out of a necessity for observing a
          certain proportion between the commentary and the text. And the same
          tendency is noticeable in many of the critical and philological
          observations which are made on the New Testament. The field of
          Biblical criticism is narrower, and its materials more fragmentary; so
          too the minuteness and uncertainty of the questions raised has been
          greater. For example, the discussions respecting the chronology of St.
          Paul's life and his second imprisonment: or about the identity of
          James, the brother of the Lord, or in another department, respecting
          the use of the Greek article, have gone far beyond the line of
          utility.
        </p>
        <p>
          There seem to be reasons for doubting whether any considerable light
          can be thrown on the New Testament from inquiry into the language.
          Such inquiries are popular, because they are safe; but their
          popularity is not the measure of their use. It has not been
          sufficiently considered that the difficulties of the New Testament are
          for the most part common to the Greek and the English. The noblest
          translation in the world has a few great errors, more than half of
          them in the text; but we do it violence' to haggle over the words.
          Minute corrections of tenses or particles are no good; they spoil the
          English without being nearer the Greek. Apparent mistranslations are
          often due to a better knowledge of English rather than a worse
          knowledge of Greek. It is true that the signification of a few
          uncommon expressions, e.g., exousia, epibalon, sunapagomenoi, k.t.l.
          is yet uncertain. But no result of consequence would follow from the
          attainment of absolute certainty respecting the meaning of any of
          these. A more promising field opens to the interpreter in the
          examination of theological terms, such as faith (pistis,), grace
          (charis), righteousness (dikaiosune), sanctification (hagiasmos), the
          law (nomos), the spirit (pneuma), the comforter (parakletos), &amp;c.,
          provided always that the use of such terms in the New Testament is
          clearly separated (1) from their derivation or previous use in
          Classical or Alexandrian Greek, (2) from their after use in the
          Fathers and in systems of theology. To which may be added another
          select class of words descriptive of the offices or customs of the
          Apostolic Church, such as Apostle (apostolos), Bishop (episkopos),
          Elder (presbuteros), Deacon and Deaconess (ho kai he diakonos),
          love-feast (agapai), the Lord's day (he kuriake hemera), &amp;c. It is
          a lexilogus of these and similar terms, rather than a lexicon of the
          entire Greek Testament that is required. Interesting subjects of real
          inquiry are also the comparison of the Greek of the New Testament with
          modern Greek on the one hand, and the Greek of the LXX. on the other.
          It is not likely, however, that they will afford much more help than
          they have already done in the elucidation of the Greek of the New
          Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is for others to investigate the language of the Old Testament, to
          which the preceding remarks are only in part applicable. [It may be
          observed in passing of this, as of any other old language, that not
          the later form of the language, but the cognate dialects, must ever be
          the chief source of its illustration. For in every ancient language,
          antecedent or contemporary forms, not the subsequent ones, afford the
          real insight into its nature and structure. It must also be admitted
          that very great and real obscurities exist in the English translation
          of the Old Testament, which even a superficial acquaintance with the
          original has a tendency to remove.] Leaving, however, to others the
          consideration of the Semitic languages which raise questions of a
          different kind from the Hellenistic Greek, we will offer a few remarks
          on the latter. Much has been said of the increasing accuracy of our
          knowledge of the language of the New Testament the old Hebraistic
          method of explaining difficulties of language or construction, has
          retired within very narrow limits; it might probably with advantage be
          confined to still narrower ones -- [if it have any place at all except
          in the Apocalypse or the Gospel St. Matthew]. There is, perhaps, some
          confusion between accuracy of our knowledge of language, and the
          accuracy of language itself; which is also strongly maintained. It is
          observed that the usages of barbarous as well as civilized nations
          conform perfectly to grammatical rules; that the uneducated in all
          countries have certain laws of speech as much as Shakespear or Bacon;
          the usages of Lucian, it may be said, are as regular as those of
          Plato, even when they are different. The decay of language seems
          rather to witness to the permanence than to the changeableness of its
          structure; it is the flesh, not the bones, that begins to drop off.
          But such general remarks, although just, afford but little help in
          determining the character of the Greek of the New Testament, which has
          of course a certain system, failing in which it would cease to be a
          language. Some further illustration is needed of the change which has
          passed upon it. All languages do not decay in the same manner; and the
          influence of decay in the same language may be different in different
          countries; when used in writing and in speaking -- when applied to the
          matters of ordinary life and to the higher truths of philosophy or
          religion. And the degeneracy of language itself is not a mere
          principle of dissolution, but creative also; while dead and rigid in
          some of its uses, it is elastic and expansive in others. The decay of
          an ancient language is the beginning of the construction of a modern
          one. The loss of some usages gives a greater precision and freedom to
          others. The logical element, as for example in the Mediæval Latin,
          will probably be strongest when the poetical has vanished. A great
          movement, like the Reformation in Germany, passing over a nation, may
          give a new birth also to its language.
        </p>
        <p>
          These remarks may be applied to the Greek of the New Testament, which
          although classed vaguely under the common dialect,' has, nevertheless,
          many features which are altogether peculiar to itself, and such as are
          found in no other remains of ancient literature.1. It is more unequal
          in style even in the same books, that is to say, more original and
          plastic in one part, more rigid and unpliable in another. There is a
          want of the continuous power to frame a paragraph or to arrange
          clauses in subordination to each other, even to the extent to which it
          was possessed by a Greek scholiast or rhetorician. On the other hand
          there is a fulness of life, a new birth,' in the use of abstract terms
          which is not found elsewhere, after the golden age of Greek
          philosophy. Almost the only passage in the New Testament which reads
          like a Greek period of the time, is the first paragraph of the Gospel
          according to St. Luke, and the corresponding words of the Acts. But
          the power and meaning of the characteristic words of the New Testament
          is in remarkable contrast with the vapid and general use of the same
          words in Philo about the same time. There is also a sort of lyrical
          passion in some passages (1 Cor. xiii.; 2 Cor. vi.6-10; xi.21-33)
          which is is new thing in the literature of the world; to which, at any
          rate, no Greek author of a later age furnishes any parallel.2. Though
          written, the Greek of the New Testament partakes of the character of a
          spoken language; it is more lively and simple, and. less structural
          than ordinary writing -- a peculiarity of style which further agrees
          with the circumstance that the Epistles of St. Paul were not written
          with his own hand, but probably dictated to an amanuensis, and that
          the Gospels also probably originate in an oral narrative.3. The ground
          colours of the language may be said to be two; first, the LXX. which
          is modified, secondly, by the spoken Greek of eastern countries, and a
          differences which might be expected to arise between a translation and
          an original; many Hebraisms would occur in the Greek of a translator,
          which would never have come to his pen but for the influence of the
          work which he was translating.4. To which may be added a few Latin and
          Chaldee words, and a few Rabbinical formulæ. The influence of Hebrew
          or Chaldee in the New Testament is for the most part at a distance, in
          the background, acting not directly, but mediately, through the LXX.
          It has much to do with the clausular structure and general form, but
          hardly anything with the grammatical usage. Philo too, did not know
          Hebrew, or at least the Hebrew Scriptures, yet there is also a
          mediate' influence of Hebrew traceable in his writings.5. There is an
          element of constraint in the style of the New Testament, arising from
          the circumstance of its authors writing in a language which was not
          their own. This constraint shows itself in the repetition of words and
          phrases; in the verbal oppositions and anacolutha of St. Paul; in the
          short sentences of St. John. This is further increased by the fact
          that the writers of the New Testament were unlearned men,' who had not
          the same power of writing as of speech. Moreover, as has been often
          remarked, the difficulty of composition increases in proportion to the
          greatness of the subject; e.g., the narrative of Thucydides is easy
          and intelligible, while his reflections and speeches are full of
          confusion; the effort to concentrate seems to interfere with the
          consecutiveness and fluency of ideas. Something of this kind is
          discernible in those passages of the Epistles in which the Apostle St.
          Paul is seeking to set forth the opposite sides of God's dealing with
          man, e.g., Romans iii.5-9; ix., x.; or in which the sequence of the
          thought is interrupted by the conflict of emotions, 1 Cor. ix.20; Gal.
          iv.11-20.6. The power of the Gospel over language must be recognised,
          showing itself, first of all, in the original and consequently
          variable signification of words (pistis, charis, soteria), which is
          also more comprehensive and human than the heretical usage of many of
          the same terms, e.g., gnosis (knowledge), sophia (wisdom), ktisis
          (creature, creation); secondly, in a peculiar use of some
          constructions, such as -- dikaiosune Theou(righteousness of God),
          pistis Iesou Christou (faith of Jesus Christ), en Christo (in Christ),
          en Theo (in God), huper hemon (for us), in which the meaning of the
          genitive case or of the preposition almost escapes our notice, from
          familiarity with the sound of it. Lastly, the degeneracy of the Greek
          language is traceable in the failure of syntactical power; in the
          insertion of propositions to denote relations of thought, which
          classical Greek would have expressed by the case only; in the omission
          of them when classical Greek would have required them; in the
          incipient use of hina with the subjunctive for the infinitive; in the
          confusion of ideas of cause and effect; in the absence of the article
          in the case of an increasing number of words which are passing into
          proper names; in the loss of the finer shades of difference in the
          negative particles; in the occasional confusion of the aorist and
          perfect; in excessive fondness for particles of reasoning or
          inference; in various forms of apposition, especially that of the word
          to the sentence; in the use, sometimes emphatic, sometimes only
          pleonastic, of the personal and demonstrative pronouns. These are some
          of the signs that the language is breaking-up and losing its
          structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our knowledge of the New Testament is derived almost exclusively from
          itself. Of the language, as well as of the subject, it may be truly
          said that what other writers contribute is nothing in comparison of
          that which is gained from observation of the text. Some inferences
          which may be gathered from this general fact, are the following: --
          First, that less weight should be given to lexicons, that is, to the
          authority of other Greek writers, and more to the context. The use of
          a word in a new sense, the attribution of a neuter meaning to a verb
          elsewhere passive, (Romans iii.9, proechometha), the resolution of the
          compound into two simple notions, (Galatians iii.1, proegraphe);
          these, when the context requires it, are not to be set aside by the
          scholar because sanctioned by no known examples. The same remark
          applies to grammars as well as lexicons. We cannot be certain that dia
          with the accusative never has the same meaning as dia with the
          genitive, (Gal. iv.13; Phil. i.15), or that the article always retains
          its defining power (1 Cor. i.17; Acts xvii.1), or that the perfect is
          never used in place of the aorist (1 Cor. xv.4; Rev. v.7, &amp;c.);
          still less can we affirm that the latter end of a sentence never
          forgets the beginning (Rom. ii.17-21; v.12-18; ix.22; xvi.25-27;
          &amp;c. &amp;c.). Foreign influences tend to derange the strong
          natural perception or remembrance of the analogy of our own language.
          That is very likely to have occurred in the case of some of the
          writers of the New Testament; that there is such a derangement, is a
          fact. There is no probability in favour of St. Paul writing in broken
          sentences, but there is no improbability which should lead us to
          assume in such sentences, continuous grammar and thought, as appears
          to have been the feeling of the copyists who have corrected the
          anacolutha. The occurrence of them further justifies the interpreter
          in using some freedom with other passages in which the syntax does not
          absolutely break down. When confusion of two constructions,' meaning
          to say one thing and finishing with another;' saying two things in one
          instead of disposing them in their logical sequence,' are attributed
          to the Apostle; the use of these and similar expressions is defended
          by the fact that more numerous anacolutha occur in St. Paul's writings
          than in any equal portion of the New Testament, and far more than in
          the writings of any other Greek author of equal length.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passing from the grammatical structure, we may briefly consider the
          logical character of the language of the New Testament. Two things
          should be here distinguished, the logical form and the logical
          sequence of thought. Some ages have been remarkable for the former of
          these two characteristics; they have dealt in opposition,
          contradiction, climax, pleonasm, reason within reason, and the like;
          mere statements taking the form of arguments -- each sentence seeming
          to be a link in a chain. In such periods of literature, the appearance
          of logic is rhetorical, and is to be set down to the style. That is
          the case with many passages in the New Testament which are studded
          with logical or rhetorical formulæ, especially in the Epistles of St
          Paul. Nothing can be more simple or natural than the object of the
          writer. Yet forms of the schools' appear (whether learnt at the feet
          of Gamaliel, that reputed master of Greek learning, or not,) which
          imply a degree of logical or rhetorical training.
        </p>
        <p>
          The observation of this rhetorical or logical element has a bearing on
          the Interpretation of Scripture. For it leads us to distinguish
          between the superficial connexion of words and the real connexion of
          thoughts. Otherwise injustice is done to the argument of the sacred
          writer, who may be supposed to violate logical rules, of which he is
          unconscious. For example, the argument of Rom. iii.19, may be classed
          by the logicians under some head of fallacy (Ex aliquo non sequitur
          omnis'); the series of inferences which follow one another in Rom.
          i.16-18, are for the most part different aspects or statements of the
          same truth. So in Rom. i.32 the climax rather appears to be an
          anticlimax. But to dwell on these things interferes with the true
          perception of the Apostle's meaning which is not contained in the
          repetitions of gar by which it is hooked together; nor are we
          accurately to weigh the proportions expressed by his ou monon -- alla
          kai; or pollo mallon; need we suppose that where men is found alone,
          there was a reason for the omission of de, (Rom. i.8; iii.2); or that
          the opposition of words and sentences is always the opposition of
          ideas (Rom. v.7; x.10). It is true that these and similar forms or
          distinctions of language, admit of translation into English; and in
          every ease the interpreter may find a some point of view in which the
          simplest truth of feeling may be drawn out in an antithetical or
          argumentative form. But whether these points of view were in the
          Apostle's mind at the time of writing may be doubted; the real
          meaning, or kernel, seems to lie deeper and to be more within. When we
          pass from the study of each verse to survey the whole at a greater
          distance, the form of thought is again seen to be unimportant in
          comparison of the truth which is contained in it. The same remark may
          be extended to the opposition, not only of words, but of ideas, which
          is found in the Scriptures generally, and almost seems to be inherent
          in human language itself. The law is opposed to faith, good to evil,
          the spirit to the flesh, light to darkness, the world to the believer,
          the sheep are set on his right hand, but the goats on the left. The
          influence of this logical opposition been great and not always without
          abuse in practice. For the opposition is one of ideas only which is
          not realized in fact. Experience shows us not that there are two
          classes of men animated by two opposing principles, but an infinite
          number of classes or individuals from the lowest depth of misery and
          sin to the highest perfection of which human nature is capable, the
          best not wholly good, the worst not entirely evil. But the figure or
          mode of representation changes these differences of degree into
          differences of kind. And we often think and speak and act in reference
          both to ourselves and others, as though the figure were altogether a
          reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other questions arise out of the analysis of the modes of thought of
          Scripture. Unless we are willing to use words without inquiring into
          their meaning, it is necessary for us to arrange them in some relation
          to our own minds. The modes of thought of the Old Testament are not
          the same with those of the New, and those of the New are only
          partially the same with those in use among ourselves at the present
          day. The education of the human mind may be traced as clearly from the
          Book of Genesis to the Epistles of St. Paul, as from Homer to Plato
          and Aristotle. When we hear St. Paul speaking of body and soul and
          spirit,' we know that such language as this would not occur in the
          Books of Moses or in the Prophet Isaiah. It has the colour of a later
          age, in which abstract terms have taken the place of expressions
          derived from material objects. When we proceed further to compare
          these or other words or expressions of St. Paul with the body and
          mind,' or mind' and matter,' which is a distinction, not only of
          philosophy, but of common language among ourselves, it is not easy at
          once to determine the relation between them. Familiar as is the sound
          of both expressions, many questions arise when we begin to compare
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the metaphysical difficulty in the Interpretation of
          Scripture, which it is better not to ignore, bemuse the consideration
          of it is necessary to the understanding of many passages, and also
          because it may return upon us in the form of materialism or
          scepticism. To some who are not aware how little words affect the
          nature of things it may seem to raise speculations of a very serious
          kind. Their doubts would, perhaps, find expression in some such
          exclamations as the following: -- How is religion possible when modes
          of thought are shifting? and words changing their meaning, and
          statements of doctrine though starched' with philosophy, are in
          perpetual danger of dissolution from metaphysical analysis?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer seems to be, that Christian truth is not dependent on the
          fixedness of modes of thought. The metaphysician may analyse the ideas
          of the mind just as the physiologist may analyse the powers or parts
          of the bodily frame, yet morality and social life still go on, as in
          the body digestion is uninterrupted. That is not an illustration only;
          it represents the fact. Though we had no words for mind, matter, soul,
          and the like, Christianity would remain the same. This is obvious,
          whether we think of the case of the poor, who understand such
          distinctions very imperfectly, or of those nations of the earth, who
          have no precisely corresponding division of ideas. It is not of that
          subtle or evanescent character which is liable to be lost in shifting
          the use of terms. Indeed, it is an advantage at times to discard these
          terms with the view of getting rid of the oppositions to which they
          give rise. No metaphysical analysis can prevent our taking up the
          cross and following Christ,' or receiving the kingdom of heaven as
          little children. To analyse the trichotomy' of St. Paul is interesting
          as a chapter in the history of the human mind and necessary as a part
          of Biblical exegesis, but it has nothing to do with the religion of
          Christ. Christian duties may be enforced, and the life of Christ may
          be the centre of our thoughts, whether we speak of reason and faith,
          of soul and body, or of mind and matter, or adopt a mode of speech
          which dispenses with any of these divisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connected with the modes of thought or representation in Scripture,
          are the figures of speech of Scripture, about which the same question
          may be asked: What division can we make between the figure and the
          reality?' And the answer seems to be of the same kind, that We cannot
          precisely draw the line between them.' Language, and especially the
          language of Scripture, does not admit of any sharp distinction. The
          simple expressions of one age become the allegories or figures of
          another; many of those in the New Testament are taken from the Old.
          But neither is there anything really essential in the form of these
          figures; nay, the literal application of many of them has a great
          stumblingblock to the reception of Christianity. A recent commentator
          on Scripture appears willing to peril religion on the literal truth of
          such an expression as We shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the
          air.' Would he be equally ready to stake Christianity on the literal
          meaning of the words, Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
          quenched?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Of what has been said, this is the sum; -- That Scripture, like other
          books, has one meaning, which is to be gathered from itself without
          reference to the adaptations of Fathers or Divines; and without regard
          to a priori notions about its nature and origin. It to be interpreted
          like other books, with attention to the character of its authors, and
          the prevailing state of civilization and knowledge, with allowance for
          peculiarities of style and language, and modes of thought and figures
          of speech. Yet not without a sense that as we read there grows upon us
          the witness of God in the world, anticipating in a rude and primitive
          age the truth that was to be, shining more and more unto the perfect
          day in the life of Christ, which again is reflected from different
          points of view in the teaching of His Apostles.'
        </p>
        <p>§ 4.</p>
        <p>
          It has been a principal aim of the preceding pages to distinguish the
          interpretation from the application of Scripture. Many of the errors
          alluded to, arise out of a confusion of the two. The present is nearer
          to us than the past, the circumstances which surround us pre-occupy
          our thoughts; it is only by an effort that we reproduce the ideas, or
          events, or persons of other ages. And thus, quite naturally, almost by
          a law of the human mind, the application of Scripture takes the place
          of its original meaning. And the question is, not how to get rid of
          this natural tendency, but how we may have the true use of it. For it
          cannot be got rid of, or rather is one of the chief instruments of
          religious usefulness in the world: Ideas must be given through
          something;' those of religion find their natural expression in the
          words of Scripture, in the adaptation of which to another state or
          life it is hardly possible that the first intention of the writers
          should be always preserved. Interpretation is the province of few; it
          requires a finer perception of language, and a higher degree of
          cultivation than is attained by the majority of mankind. But
          applications are made by all, from the philosopher reading God in
          History,' to the poor woman who finds in them a response to her
          prayers, and the solace of her daily life. In the hour of death we do
          not want critical explanations; in most cases, those to whom they
          would be offered are incapable of understanding them. A few words,
          breathing the sense of the whole Christian world, such as I know that
          my Redeemer liveth' (though the exact meaning of them may be doubtful
          to the Hebrew scholar); I shall go to him, but he shall not return to
          me;' touch a chord which would never be reached by the most skilful
          exposition of the argument of one of St. Paul's Epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a use of Scripture in education and literature. This
          literary use, though secondary to the religious one, is not
          unimportant. It supplies a common language to the educated and
          uneducated, in which the best and highest thoughts of both are
          expressed; it is a medium between the abstract notions of the one and
          the simple feelings of the other. To the poor especially, it conveys
          in the form which they are most capable of receiving, the lesson of
          history and life. The beauty and power of speech and writing would be
          greatly impaired, if the Scriptures ceased to be known or used among
          us. The orator seems to catch from them a sort of inspiration; in the
          simple words of Scripture which he stamps anew, the philosopher often
          finds his most, pregnant expressions. If modern times have been richer
          in the wealth of abstract thought, the contribution of earlier ages to
          the mind of the world has not been less, but, perhaps greater, in
          supplying the poetry of language. There is no such treasury of
          instruments and materials as Scripture. The loss of Homer, or the loss
          of Shakespear, would have affected the whole series of Greek or
          English authors who follow. Bat the disappearance of the Bible from
          the books which the world contains, would produce results far greater;
          we can scarcely conceive the degree in which it would alter literature
          and language -- the ideas of the educated and philosophical, as well
          as the feelings and habits of mind of the poor. If it has been said,
          with an allowable hyperbole, that Homer is Greece' with much more
          truth may it be said, that the Bible is Christendom.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Many by whom considerations of this sort will be little understood,
          may, nevertheless, recognise the use made of the Old Testament in the
          New. The religion of Christ was first taught by an application of the
          words of the Psalms and the Prophets. Our Lord Himself sanctions this
          application. Can there be a better use of Scripture than that which is
          made by Scripture?' Or any more likely method of teaching the truths
          of Christianity than that by which they were first taught?' For it may
          be argued that the critical interpretation of Scripture is a device
          almost of yesterday; it is the vocation of the scholar or philosopher,
          not of the Apostle or Prophet. The new truth which was introduced into
          the Old Testament, rather than the old truth which was found there,
          was the salvation and the conversion of the world. There are many
          quotations from the Psalms and the Prophets in the Epistles, in which
          the meaning is quickened or spiritualized, but hardly any, probably
          none, which is based on the original sense or context. That is not so
          singular a phenomenon as may at first sight be imagined. It may appear
          strange to us that Scripture should be interpreted in Scripture, in a
          manner not altogether in agreement with modern criticism; but would it
          not be more strange that it should be interpreted otherwise, than in
          agreement with the ideas of the age or country in which it was
          written? The observation that there is such an agreement, leads to two
          conclusions which have a bearing on our present object. First, it is a
          reason for not insisting on the applications which the New Testament
          makes of passages in the Old, as their original meaning. Secondly, it
          gives authority and precedent for the use of similar applications in
          our own day.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, on the other hand, though interwoven with literature, though
          common to all ages of the Church, though sanctioned by our Lord and
          His Apostles, it is easy to see that such an employment of Scripture
          is liable to error and perversion. For it may not only receive a new
          meaning; it may be applied in a spirit alien to itself. It may become
          the symbol of fanaticism, the cloke of malice, the disguise of policy.
          Cromwell at Drogheda, quoting Scripture to his soldiers; the
          well-known attack on the Puritans in the State Service for the
          Restoration, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord;' the reply
          of the Venetian Ambassador to the suggestion of Wolsey, that Venice
          should take a lead in Italy, which was only the Earth is the Lord's
          and the fulness thereof,' are examples of such uses. In former times,
          it was a real and not an imaginary fear, that the wars of the Lord in
          the Old Testament might arouse a fire in the bosom of Franks and Huns.
          In our own day such dangers have passed away; it is only a figure of
          speech when the preacher says, Gird on thy sword, O thou most mighty.'
          The warlike passions of men are not roused by quotations from
          Scripture, nor can states of life such as slavery or polygamy which
          belong to a past age, be defended, at least in England, by the example
          of the Old Testament. The danger or error is of another kind; more
          subtle, but hardly less real. For if we are permitted to apply
          Scripture under the pretence of interpreting it, the language of
          Scripture becomes only a mode of expressing the public feeling or
          opinion of our own day. Any passing phase of politics or art, or
          spurious philanthropy, may have a kind of Scriptural authority. The
          words that are used are the words of the Prophet or Evangelist, but we
          stand behind and adapt them to our purpose. Hence it is necessary to
          consider the limits and manner of a just adaptation; how much may be
          allowed for the sake of ornament; how far the Scripture, in all its
          details, may be regarded as an allegory of human life -- where the
          true analogy begins -- how far the interpretation of Scripture will
          serve as a corrective to its practical abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth seems to require that we should separate mere adaptations, from
          the original meaning of Scripture. It is not honest or reasonable to
          confound illustration with argument, in theology, any more than in
          other subjects. For example, if a preacher chooses to represent the
          condition of a church or of an individual in the present day, under
          the figure of Elijah left alone among the idolatrous tribes of Israel,
          such an allusion is natural enough; but if he goes on to argue that
          individuals are therefore justified in remaining in what they believe
          to be an erroneous communion -- that is a mere appearance of argument
          which ought not to have the slightest weight with a man of sense. Such
          a course may indeed be perfectly justifiable, but not on the ground
          that a prophet of the Lord once did so, two thousand five hundred
          years ago. Not in this sense were the lives of the Prophets written
          for our instruction. There are many important morals conveyed by them,
          but only so far as they themselves represent universal principles of
          justice and love. These universal principles they clothe with flesh
          and blood; they show them to us written on the hearts of men of like
          passions with ourselves. The prophecies, again, admit of many
          applications to the Christian Church or to the Christian life. There
          is no harm in speaking of the Church as the Spiritual Israel, or in
          using the imagery of Isaiah respecting Messiah's kingdom, as the type
          of good things to come. But when it is gravely urged, that from such
          passages as Kings shall be thy nursing fathers,' we are to collect the
          relations of Church and State, or from the pictorial description of
          Isaiah, that it is to be inferred there will be a reign of Christ on
          earth -- that is a mere assumption of the forms of reasoning by the
          imagination. Nor is it a healthful or manly tone of feeling which
          depicts the political opposition to the Church in our own day, under
          imagery which is borrowed from the desolate Sion of the captivity.
          Scripture is apt to come too readily to the lips, when we are pouring
          out our own weaknesses, or enlarging on some favourite theme --
          perhaps idealizing in the language of prophecy the feebleness of
          preaching or missions in the present day, or from the want of
          something else to say. In many discussions on these and similar
          subjects, the position of the Jewish King, Church, Priest, has led to
          a confusion, partly caused by the use of similar words in modern
          senses among ourselves. The King or Queen of England may be called the
          Anointed of the Lord, but we should not therefore imply that the
          attributes of sovereignty are the same as those which belonged to King
          David. All these are figures of speech, the employment of which is too
          common, and has been injurious to religion, because it prevents our
          looking at the facts of history or life as they truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first step towards a more truthful use of Scripture in
          practice -- the separation of adaptation from interpretation. No one
          who is engaged in preaching or in religious instruction can be
          required to give up Scripture language; it is the common element in
          which his thoughts and those of his hearers move. But he may be asked
          to distinguish the words of Scripture from the truths of Scripture --
          the means from the end. The least expression of Scripture is weighty;
          it affects the minds of the hearers in a way that no other language
          can. Whatever responsibility attaches to idle words, attaches in still
          greater degree to the idle or fallacious use of Scripture terms. And
          there is surely a want of proper reverence for Scripture, when we
          confound the weakest and feeblest applications of its words with their
          true meaning -- when we avail ourselves of their natural power to
          point them against some enemy -- when we divert the eternal words of
          charity and truth into a defence of some passing opinion. For not only
          in the days of the Pharisees, but in our own, the letter has been
          taking the place of the spirit; the least matters, of the greatest,
          and the primary meaning has been lost in the secondary use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other simple cautions may also be added. The applications of Scripture
          should be harmonized and, as it were, interpenetrated with the spirit
          of the Gospel, the whole of which should be in every part; though the
          words may receive a new sense, the new sense ought to be in agreement
          with the general truth. They should be used to bring home practical
          precepts, not to send the imagination on a voyage of discovery; they
          are not the real foundation of our faith in another world, nor can
          they, by pleasant pictures, add to our knowledge of it. They should
          not confound the accidents with the essence of religion -- the
          restrictions and burdens of the Jewish law with the freedom of the
          Gospel -- the things which Moses allowed for the hardness of the
          heart, with the perfection of the teaching of Christ. They should
          avoid the form of arguments, or they will insensibly be used, or
          understood to mean more than they really do. They should be subjected
          to an overruling principle, which is the heart and conscience of the
          Christian teacher, who indeed stands behind them,' not to make them
          the vehicles of his own opinions, but as the expressions of justice,
          and truth, and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here the critical interpretation of Scripture comes in and
          exercises a corrective influence on its popular use. We have already
          admitted that criticism is not for the multitude; it is not what the
          Scripture terms the Gospel preached for the poor. Yet, indirectly
          passing from the few to the many, it has borne a great part in the
          Reformation of religion. It has cleared the eye of the mind to
          understand the original meaning. It was a sort of criticism which
          supported the struggle of the sixteenth century against the Roman
          Catholic Church; it is criticism that is leading Protestants to doubt
          whether the doctrine that the Pope is Antichrist, which has descended
          from the same period, is really discoverable in Scripture. Even the
          isolated thinker, against whom the religious world is taking up arms,
          has an influence on his opponents. The force of observations, which
          are based on reason and fact, remains when the tide of religious or
          party feeling is gone down. Criticism has also a healing influence in
          clearing away what may be termed the Sectarianism of knowledge.
          Without criticism it would be impossible to reconcile History and
          Science with Revealed Religion; they must remain for ever in a hostile
          and defiant attitude. Instead of being like other records, subject to
          the conditions of knowledge which existed in an early stage of the
          world, Scripture would be regarded on the one side as the work of
          organic Inspiration, and as a lying imposition on the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real unity of Scripture, as of man, has also a relation to our
          present subject. Amid all the differences of modes of thought and
          speech which have existed in different ages, of which much is said in
          our own day, there is a common element in human nature which bursts
          through these differences and remains unchanged, because akin to the
          first instincts of our being. The simple feeling of truth and right is
          the same to the Greek or Hindoo as to ourselves. However great may be
          the diversities of human character, there is a point at which these
          diversities end, and unity begins to appear. Now, this admits of an
          application to the books of Scripture, as well as to the world
          generally. Written at many different times, in more than one language,
          some of them in fragments, they, too, have a common element of which
          the preacher may avail himself. This element is twofold, partly divine
          and partly human; the revelation of the truth and righteousness of
          God, and the cry of the human heart towards Him. Every part of
          Scripture tends to raise us above ourselves -- to give us a deeper
          sense of the feebleness of man, and of the wisdom and power of God. It
          has a sort of kindred, as Plato would say, with religious truth
          everywhere in the world. It agrees also with the imperfect stages of
          knowledge and faith in human nature, and answers to its inarticulate
          cries. The universal truth easily breaks through the accidents of time
          and place in which it is involved. Although we cannot apply Jewish
          institutions to the Christian world, or venture in reliance on some
          text to resist the tide of civilization on which we are borne, yet it
          remains, nevertheless, to us, as well as to the Jews and first
          Christians, that Righteousness exalteth a nation,' and that love is
          the fulfilling not of the Jewish law only, but of all law.'
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, we have only to enlarge the meaning of Scripture to
          apply it even to the novelties and peculiarities of our own times. The
          world changes, but the human heart remains the same; events and
          details are different, but the principle by which they are governed,
          or the rule by which we are to act, is not different. When, for
          example, our Saviour says, Ye shall know the truth, and the truth
          shall make you free,' it is not likely that these words would have
          conveyed to the minds of the Jews who heard Him any notion of the
          perplexities of doubt or inquiry. Yet we cannot suppose that our
          Saviour, were He to come again upon earth, would refuse thus to extend
          them. The Apostle St. Paul, when describing the Gospel, which is to
          the Greek foolishness, speaks also of a higher wisdom which is known
          to those who are perfect. Neither is it unfair for us to apply this
          passage to that reconcilement of faith and knowledge, which may be
          termed Christian philosophy, as the nearest equivalent to its language
          in our own day. Such words, again, as Why seek ye the living among the
          dead?' admit of a great variety of adaptations to the circumstances of
          our own time. Many of these adaptations have a real germ in the
          meaning of the words. The precept, Render unto Cæsar the things that
          are Cæsar's, and to God the things that a4e God's,' may be taken
          generally as expressing the necessity of distinguishing the divine and
          human -- the things that belong to faith and the things that belong to
          experience. It is worth remarking in the application made of these
          words by Lord Bacon, Da fidei quæ fidei sunt;' that, although the
          terms are altered, yet the circumstance that the form of the sentence
          is borrowed from Scripture gives them point and weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The portion of Scripture which more than any other is immediately and
          universally applicable to our own times is, doubtless, that which is
          contained in the words of Christ Himself. The reason is that they are
          words of the most universal import. They do not relate to the
          circumstances of the time, but to the common life of all mankind. You
          cannot extract from them a political creed; only, Render unto Cæsar
          the things that are Cæsar's,' and The Scribes and Pharisees sit in
          Moses' seat; whatsoever, therefore, they say unto you do, but after
          their works do not.' They present to us a standard of truth and duty,
          such as no one can at once and immediately practise -- such as, in its
          perfection, no one has fulfilled in this world. But this idealism does
          not interfere with their influence as a religious lesson. Ideals, even
          though unrealized, have effect on our daily life. The preacher of the
          Gospel is, or ought to be, aware that his calls to repentance, his
          standard of obligations, his lamentations over his own shortcomings or
          those of others, do not at once convert hundreds or thousands, as on
          the day of Pentecost. Yet it does not follow that they are thrown
          away, or that it would be well to substitute for them mere prudential
          or economical lessons, lectures on health or sanitary improvement. For
          they tend to raise men above themselves, providing them with Sabbaths
          as well as working days, giving them a taste of the good word of God'
          and of the powers of the world to come.' Human nature needs to be
          idealized; it seems as if it took a dislike to itself when presented
          always in its ordinary attire; it lives on in the hope of becoming
          better. And the image or hope of a better life -- the vision of Christ
          crucified -- which is held up to it, doubtless has an influence; not
          like the rushing mighty wind of the day of Pentecost; it may rather be
          compared to the leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of
          meal, till the whole was leavened.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The Parables of our Lord are a portion of the New Testament, which we
          may apply in the most easy and literal manner. The persons in them are
          the persons among whom we live and move; there are times and occasions
          at which the truths symbolized by them come home to the hearts of all
          who have ever been impressed by religion. We have been prodigal sons
          returning to our Father; servants to whom talents have been entrusted;
          labourers in the vineyard inclined to murmur at our lot, when compared
          with that of others, yet receiving every man his due; well-satisfied
          Pharisees; repentant Publicans: -- we have received the seed, and the
          cares of the world have choked it -- we hope also at times that we
          have found the pearl of great price after sweeping the house -- we are
          ready like the Good Samaritan to show kindness to all mankind. Of
          these circumstances of life or phases of mind, which are typified by
          the parables, most Christians have experience. We may go on to .apply
          many of them further to the condition of nations and churches. Such a
          treasury has Christ provided us of things new and old, which refer to
          all time and all mankind -- may we not say in His own words -- Because
          He is the Son of Man?'
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no language of Scripture which penetrates the individual
          soul, and embraces all the world in the arms of its love, in the same
          manner as that of Christ Himself. Yet the Epistles contain lessons
          which are not found in the Gospels, or, at least, not expressed with
          the same degree of clearness. For the Epistles are nearer to actual
          life -- they relate to the circumstances of the first believers, to
          their struggles with the world without, to their temptations and
          divisions from within -- their subject is not only the doctrine of the
          Christian religion, but the business of the early Church. And although
          their circumstances are not our circumstances -- we are not afflicted
          or persecuted, or driven out of the world, but in possession of the
          blessings, and security, and property of an established religion --
          yet there is a Christian spirit which infuses itself into all
          circumstances, of which they are a pure and living source. It is
          impossible to gather from a few fragmentary and apparently not always
          consistent expressions, how the Communion was celebrated, or the
          Church ordered, what was the relative position of Presbyters and
          Deacons, or the nature of the gift of tongues, as a rule for the
          Church in after ages; -- such inquiries have no certain answer, and at
          the best, are only the subject of honest curiosity. But the words,
          Charity never faileth,' and Though I speak with the tongues of men and
          of angels, and have not charity, I am nothing' -- these have a voice
          which reaches to the end of time. There are no questions of meats and
          drinks now-a-days, yet the noble words of the Apostle remain: If meat
          make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world
          standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.' Moderation in
          controversy, toleration towards opponents, or erring members, is a
          virtue which has been thought by many to belong to the development and
          not to the origin of Christianity, and which is rarely found in the
          commencement of a religion. But lessons of toleration may be gathered
          from the Apostle, which have not yet been learned either by
          theologians or by mankind in general. The persecutions and troubles
          which awaited the Apostle, no longer await us; we cannot, therefore,
          without unreality, except, perhaps, in a very few cases, appropriate
          his words, I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I
          have kept the faith.' But that other text still sounds gently in our
          ears: My strength is perfected in weakness,' and when I am weak, then
          am I strong.' We cannot apply to ourselves the language of authority
          in which the Apostle speaks of himself as an ambassador for Christ,
          without something like bad taste. But it is not altogether an
          imaginary hope that those of us who are ministers of Christ, may
          attain to a real imitation of his great diligence, of his sympathy
          with others, and consideration for them -- of his willingness to spend
          and be spent in his Master's service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are a few instances of the manner in which the analogy of faith
          enables us to apply the words of Christ and His Apostles, with a
          strict regard to their original meaning. But the Old Testament has
          also its peculiar lessons which are not conveyed with equal point or
          force in the New. The beginnings of human history are themselves a
          lesson having a freshness as of the early dawn. There are forms of
          evil against which the Prophets and the prophetical spirit of the Law
          carry on a warfare, in terms almost too bold for the way of life of
          modern times. There, more plainly than in any other portion of
          Scripture, is expressed the antagonism of outward and inward, of
          ceremonial and moral, of mercy and sacrifice. There all the masks of
          hypocrisy are rudely torn asunder, in which an unthinking world allows
          itself to be disguised. There the relations of rich and poor in the
          sight of God, and their duties towards one another, are most clearly
          enunciated. There the religion of suffering first appears --
          adversity, the blessing' of the Old Testament, as well as of the New.
          There the sorrows and aspirations of the soul find their deepest
          expression, and also their consolation. The feeble person has an image
          of himself in the bruised reed;' the suffering servant of God passes
          into the beloved one, in whom my soul delighteth.' Even the latest and
          most desolate phases of the human mind are reflected in Job and
          Ecclesiastes; yet not without the solemn assertion that to fear God
          and keep his commandments' is the beginning and end of all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that there are examples in the Old Testament which were not
          written for our instruction, and that, in some instances, precepts or
          commands are attributed to God Himself, which must be regarded as
          relative to the state of knowledge which then existed of the Divine
          nature, or given for the hardness of men's hearts,' It cannot be
          denied that such passages of Scripture are liable to misunderstanding;
          the spirit of the Old Covenanters, although no longer appealing to the
          action of Samuel, hewing Agag in Pieces before the Lord in Gilgal,' is
          not altogether extinguished. And a community of recent origin in
          America found their doctrine of polygamy on the Old Testament. But the
          poor generally read the Bible unconsciously; they take the good, and
          catch the prevailing spirit, without stopping to reason whether this
          or that practice is sanctioned by the custom or example of Scripture.
          The child is only struck by the impiety of the children who mocked the
          prophet; he does not think of the severity of the punishment which is
          inflicted on them. And poor, in this respect, are much like children;
          their reflection on the morality or immorality of characters or events
          is suppressed by reverence for Scripture. The Christian teacher has a
          sort of tact by which he guides them to perceive only the spirit of
          the Gospel everywhere; they read in the Psalms, of David's sin and
          repentance; of the never-failing goodness of God to him, and his
          never-failing trust in Him, not of his imprecations against his
          enemies. Such difficulties are greater in theory and on paper, than in
          the management of a school or parish. They are found to affect the
          half-educated, rather than either the poor, or those who are educated
          in a higher sense. To be above such difficulties is the happiest
          condition of human life and knowledge, or to be below them; to see, or
          think we see, how they may be reconciled with Divine power and wisdom,
          or not to see how they are apparently at variance with them.

        <p>§ 5.</p>
        <p>
          Some application of the preceding subject may be further made to
          theology and life.
        </p>
        <p>Let us introduce this concluding inquiry with two remarks.</p>
        <p>
          First, it may be observed, that a change in some of the prevailing
          modes of interpretation is not so much a matter of expediency as of
          necessity. The original meaning of Scripture is beginning to be
          clearly understood. But the apprehension of the original meaning is
          inconsistent with the reception of a typical or conventional one. The
          time will come when educated men will be no more able to believe that
          the words, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Matth. ii.15; Hosea
          xi.1), were intended by the prophet to refer to the return of Joseph
          and Mary from Egypt, than they are now able to believe the Roman
          Catholic explanation of Gen. iii.15, Ipsa conteret caput tuum,' They
          will no more think that the first chapters of Genesis relate the same
          tale which Geology and Ethnology unfold than they now think the
          meaning of Joshua x.12, 13, to be in accordance with Galileo's
          discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the circumstance that in former ages there has been a four-fold
          or a seven-fold Interpretation of Scripture, we cannot argue to the
          possibility of upholding any other than the original one in our own.
          The mystical explanations of Origen or Philo were not seen to be
          mystical; the reasonings of Aquinas and Calvin were not supposed to go
          beyond the letter of the text. They have now become the subject of
          apology; it is justly said that we should not judge the greatness of
          the Fathers or Reformers by their suitableness to our own day. But
          this defence of them shows that their explanations of Scripture are no
          longer tenable; they belong to a way of thinking and speaking which
          was once diffused over the world, but has now passed away. And what we
          give up as a general principle we shall find it impossible to maintain
          partially, e.g., in the types of the Mosaic Law and the double
          meanings of prophecy, at least, in any sense in which it is not
          equally applicable to all deep and suggestive writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same observation may be applied to the historical criticism of
          Scripture. From the fact that Paley or Butler were regarded in their
          generation as supplying a triumphant answer to the enemies of
          Scripture, we cannot argue that their answer will be satisfactory to
          those who inquire into such subjects in our own. Criticism has far
          more power than it formerly had; it has spread itself over ancient,
          and even modern, history; it extends to the thoughts and ideas of men
          as well as to words and facts; it has also a great place in education.
          Whether the habit of mind which has been formed in classical studies
          will not go on to Scripture; whether Scripture can be made an
          exception to other ancient writings, now that the nature of both is
          more understood; whether in the fuller light of history and science
          the views of the last century will hold out -- these are questions
          respecting which the course of religious opinion in the past does not
          afford the means of truly judging.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It has to be considered whether the intellectual forms under which
          Christianity has been described may not also be in a state of
          transition and resolution in this respect contrasting with the
          never-clanging truth of the Christian life. (1 Cor. xiii.8.) Looking
          backwards at past ages, we experience a kind of amazement at the
          minuteness of theological distinctions, and also at their permanence.
          They seem to have borne a part in the education of the Christian
          world, in an age when language itself had also a greater influence
          than now-a-days. It is admitted that these distinctions are not
          observed in the New Testament, and are for the most part of a later
          growth. But little is gained by setting up theology against Scripture,
          or Scripture against theology; the Bible against the Church, or the
          Church against the Bible. At different periods either has been a
          bulwark against some form of error: either has tended to correct the
          abuse of the other. A true inspiration guarded the writers of the New
          Testament from Gnostic or Manichean tenets; at a later stage, a sound
          instinct prevented the Church from dividing the humanity and Divinity
          of Christ. It may be said that the spirit of Christ forbids us to
          determine beyond what is written; and the decision of the council of
          Nicæa has been described by an eminent English prelate as the greatest
          misfortune that ever befel the Christian world.' That is, perhaps,
          true; yet a different decision would have been a greater misfortune.
          Nor does there seem any reason to suppose that the human mind could
          have been arrested in its theological course. It is a mistake to
          imagine that the dividing and splitting of words is owing to the
          depravity of the human heart; was it not rather an intellectual
          movement (the only phenomenon of progress then going on among men)
          which led, by a sort of necessity, some to go forward to the
          completion of the system, while it left others to stand aside? A veil
          was on the human understanding in the great controversies which
          absorbed the Church in earlier ages; the cloud which the combatants
          themselves raised intercepted the view. They did not see -- they could
          not have imagined -- that there was a world which lay beyond the range
          of the controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, as the Interpretation of Scripture is receiving another
          character, it seems that distinctions of theology, which were in great
          measure based on old Interpretations, are beginning to fade away. A
          change is observable in the manner in which doctrines are stated and
          defended; it is no longer held sufficient to rest them on texts of
          Scripture, one, two, or more, which contain, or appear to contain,
          similar words or ideas. They are connected more closely with our moral
          nature; extreme consequences are shunned; large allowances are made
          for the ignorance of mankind. It is held that them is truth on both
          sides; about many questions there is a kind of union of opposites;
          others are admitted to have been verbal only; all are regarded in the
          light which is thrown aims them by church history and religious
          experience. A theory has lately been put forward, apparently as a
          defence of the Christian faith, which denies the objective character
          of any of them. And there are other signs that times are changing, and
          we are changing too. It would be scarcely possible at present to
          revive the interest which was felt less than twenty years ago in the
          doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration; nor would the arguments by which
          it was supported or impugned have the meaning which they once had. The
          communion of the Lord's Supper is also ceasing, at least in the Church
          of England, to be a focus or centre of disunion --
        </p>
        <p>Our greatest love turned to our greatest hate.'</p>
        <p>
          A silence is observable on some other points of doctrine around which
          controversies swarmed a generation ago. Persons begin to ask what was
          the real difference which divided the two parties. They are no longer
          within the magic circle, but are taking up a position external to it.
          They have arrived at an age of reflection, and begin to speculate on
          the action and reaction, the irritation and counter-irritation, of
          religious forces; it is a common observation that revivals are not
          permanent;' the movement is criticised even by those who are subject
          to its influence. In the present state of the human mind, any
          consideration of these subjects, whether from the highest or lowest or
          most moderate point of view, is unfavourable to the stability of
          dogmatical systems, because it rouses inquiry into the meaning of
          words. To the sense of this is probably to be attributed the reserve
          on matters of doctrine and controversy which characterizes the present
          day, compared with the theological activity of twenty years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          These reflections bring us back to the question with which we began --
          What effect will the critical interpretation of Scripture have on
          theology and on life? Their tendency is to show that the result is
          beyond our control, and that the world is not unprepared for it. More
          things than at first sight appear are moving towards the same end.
          Religion often bids us think of ourselves, especially in later life,
          as each one in his appointed place, carrying on a work which is
          fashioned within by unseen hands. The theologian, too, may have peace
          in the thought that he is subject to the conditions of his age rather
          than one of its moving powers. When he hears theological inquiry
          censured as tending to create doubt and confusion, he knows very well
          that the cause of this is not to be sought in the writings of
          so-called rationalists or critics who are disliked partly because they
          unveil the age to itself; but in the opposition of reason and feeling,
          of the past and the present, in the conflict between the Calvinistic
          tendencies of an elder generation, and the influences which even in
          the same family naturally affect the young.
        </p>
        <p>
          This distraction of the human mind between adverse influences and
          associations, is a fact which we should have to accept and make the
          best of, whatever consequences might seem to follow to individuals or
          Churches. It is not to be regarded as a merely heathen notion that
          truth is to be desired for its own sake even though no good' result
          from it.' As a Christian paradox it may be said, What hest thou to do
          with good;' follow thou Me.' But the Christian revelation does not
          require of us this Stoicism in most cases; it rather shows how good
          and truth are generally coincident. Even in this life, there are
          numberless links which unite moral good with intellectual truth. It is
          hardly too much to say that the one is but a narrower form of the
          other. Truth is to the world what holiness of life is to the
          individual -- to man collectively the source of justice and peace and
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways in which the connexion between truth and good may
          be traced in the interpretation of Scripture. Is it a mere chimera
          that the different sections of Christendom may meet on the common
          ground of the New Testament? Or that the individual may be urged by
          the vacancy and unprofitableness of old traditions to make the Gospel
          his own -- a life of Christ in the soul, instead of a theory of Christ
          which is in a book or written down? Or that in missions to the heathen
          Scripture may become the expression of universal truths rather than of
          the tenets of particular men or churches? That would remove many
          obstacles to the reception of Christianity. Or that the study of
          Scripture may have a more important place in a liberal education than
          hitherto? Or that the rational service' of interpreting Scripture may
          dry up the crude and dreamy vapours of religious excitement? Or, that
          in preaching, new sources of spiritual health may flow from a more
          natural use of Scripture? Or that the lessons of Scripture may have a
          nearer way to the hearts of the poor when disengaged from theological
          formulas? Let us consider more at length some of these topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. No one casting his eye over the map of the Christian world can
          desire that the present lines of demarcation should always remain, any
          more than he will be inclined to regard the division of Christians to
          which he belongs himself, as in a pre-eminent or exclusive sense the
          Church of Christ. Those lines of demarcation seem to be political
          rather than religious; they are differences of nations, or
          governments, or ranks of society, more than of creeds or forms of
          faith. The feeling which gave rise to them has, in a great measure,
          passed away; no intelligent man seriously inclines to believe that
          salvation is to be found only in his own denomination. Examples of
          this sturdy orthodoxy,' in our own generation, rather provoke a smile
          than arouse serious disapproval. Yet many experiments show that these
          differences cannot be made up by any formal concordat or scheme of
          union; the parties cannot be brought to terms, and if they could,
          would cease to take an interest in the question at issue. The friction
          is too great when persons are invited to meet for a discussion of
          differences; such a process is like opening the doors and windows to
          put out a slumbering flame. But that is no reason for doubting that
          the divisions of the Christian world are beginning to pass away. The
          progress of politics, acquaintance with other countries, the growth of
          knowledge and of material greatness, changes of opinion in the Church
          of England, the present position of the Roman Communion -- all these
          phenomena show that the ecclesiastical state of the world is not
          destined to be perpetual. Within the envious barriers which divide
          human nature into very little pieces' (Plato, Rep. iii.395), a common
          sentiment is springing up of religious truth; the essentials of
          Christianity are contrasted with the details and definitions of it;
          good men of all religions find that they are more nearly agreed than
          heretofore. Neither is it impossible that this common feeling may so
          prevail over the accidental circumstances of Christian communities,
          that their political or ecclesiastical separation may be little felt.
          The walls which no adversary has scaled may fall down of themselves.
          We may perhaps figure to ourselves the battle against error and moral
          evil taking the place of one of sects and parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this movement, which we should see more clearly but for the
          divisions of the Christian world which partly conceal it, the critical
          interpretation of Scripture will have a great influence. The Bible
          will be no longer appealed to as the witness of the opinions of
          particular sects, or of our own age; it will cease to be the battle
          field of controversies. But as its true meaning is more clearly seen,
          its moral power will also be greater. If the outward and inward
          witness, instead of parting into two, as they once did, seem rather to
          blend and coincide in the Christian consciousness, that is not a
          source of weakness but of strength. The Book itself, which links
          together the beginning and end of the human race, will not have a less
          inestimable value because the Spirit has taken the place of the
          letter. Its discrepancies of fact, when we become familiar with them,
          will seem of little consequence in comparison with the truths which it
          unfolds. That these truths, instead of floating down the stream of
          tradition, or being lost in ritual observances, have been preserved
          for ever in a book, is one of the many blessings which the Jewish and
          Christian revelations have conferred on the world -- a blessing not
          the less real, because it is not necessary to attribute it to
          miraculous causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Scriptures are a bond of union to the whole Christian
          world. No one denies their authority, and could all be brought to an
          intelligence of their true meaning, all might come to agree in matters
          of religion. That may seem to be a hope deferred, yet not altogether
          chimerical. If it is not held to be a thing impossible, that there
          should be agreement in the meaning of Plato or Sophocles, neither is
          it to be regarded as absurd, that there should be a like agreement in
          the interpretation of Scripture. The disappearance of artificial
          notions and systems will pave the way to such an agreement. The
          recognition of the fact, that many aspects and stages of religion are
          found in Scripture; that different, or even opposite parties existed
          in the Apostolic Church; that the first teachers of Christianity had a
          separate and individual mode of regarding the Gospel of Christ; that
          any existing communion is necessarily much more unlike the brotherhood
          of love in the New Testament than we are willing to suppose --
          Protestants in some respects, as much so as Catholics -- that rival
          sects in our own day -- Calvinists and Arminians -- those who maintain
          and those who deny the final restoration of man -- may equally find
          texts which seem to favour their respective tenets (Mark ix.44-48;
          Romans xi.32) -- the recognition of these and similar facts will make
          us unwilling to impose any narrow rule of religious opinion on the
          ever-varying, conditions of the human mind and Christian society.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Christian missions suggest another sphere in which a more
          enlightened use of Scripture might offer a great advantage to the
          teacher. The more he is himself penetrated with the universal spirit
          of Scripture, the more he will he able to resist the literal and
          servile habits of mind of Oriental nations. You cannot transfer
          English ways of belief, and almost the history of the Church of
          England itself, as the attempt is sometimes made -- not to an
          uncivilized people, ready like children to receive new impressions,
          but to an ancient and decaying one, furrowed with the lines of
          thought, incapable of the principle of growth. But you may take the
          purer light or element of religion, of which Christianity is the
          expression, and make it shine on some principle in human nature which
          is the fallen image of it. You cannot give a people who have no
          history of their own, a sense of the importance of Christianity, as an
          historical fact: but, perhaps, that very peculiarity of their
          character may make them more impressible by the truths or ideas of
          Christianity. Neither is it easy to make them understand the growth of
          Revelation in successive ages -- that there are precepts of the Old
          Testament which are reversed in the New -- or that Moses allowed many
          things for the hardness of men's hearts. They are in one state of the
          world, and the missionary who teaches them is in another, and the Book
          through which they are taught, does not altogether coincide with
          either. Many difficulties thus arise which we are most likely to be
          successful in meeting, when we look them in the face. To one inference
          they clearly point, which is this: that it is not the Book of
          Scripture which we should seek to give them, to be reverenced like the
          Vedas or the Koran, and consecrated in its words and letters, but the
          truth of the Book, the mind of Christ and His Apostles, in which all
          lesser details and differences should be lost and absorbed. We want to
          awaken in them the sense that God is their Father, and they His
          children; -- that is of more importance than any theory about the
          Inspiration of Scripture. But to teach in this spirit, the missionary
          should himself be able to separate the accidents from the essence of
          religion; he should be conscious that the power of the Gospel resides
          not in the particulars of theology, but in the Christian life.
        </p>

          III. It may be doubted whether Scripture has ever been sufficiently
          regarded as an element of liberal education. Few deem it worth while
          to spend in the study of it the same honest thought or pains which are
          bestowed on a classical author. Nor as at present studied, can it be
          said always to have an elevating effect. It is not a useful lesson for
          the young student to apply to Scripture, principles which he would
          hesitate to apply to other books; to make formal reconcilements of
          discrepancies which he would not think of reconciling in ordinary
          history; to divide simple words into double meanings; to adopt the
          fancies or conjectures of Fathers and Commentators as real knowledge.
          This laxity of knowledge is apt to infect the judgment when
          transferred to other subjects. It is not easy to say how much of the
          unsettlement of mind which prevails among intellectual young men is
          attributable to these causes; the mixture of truth and falsehood in
          religious education, certainly tends to impair, at the age when it is
          most needed, the early influence of a religious home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet Scripture studied in a more liberal spirit might supply a part of
          education which classical literature fails to provide. The best book
          for the heart might also be made the best book for the intellect.' The
          noblest study of history and antiquity is contained in it; a poetry
          which is also the highest form of moral teaching; there, too, are
          lives of heroes and prophets, and especially of One whom we do not
          name with them, because He is above them. This history, or poetry, or
          biography is distinguished from all classical or secular writings by
          the contemplation of man as he appears in the sight of God. That is a
          sense of things into which we must grow as well as reason ourselves,
          without which human nature is but a truncated, half-educated sort of
          being. But this sense or consciousness of a Divine presence in the
          world, which seems to be natural to the beginnings of the human race,
          but fades away and requires to be renewed in its after history, is not
          to be gathered from Greek or Roman literature, but from the Old and
          New Testament. And before we can make the Old and New Testament a real
          part of education, we must read them not by the help of custom or
          tradition, in the spirit of apology or controversy, but in accordance
          with the ordinary laws of human knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Another use of Scripture is that in sermons, which seems to be
          among the tritest, and yet is far from being exhausted. If we could
          only be natural and speak of things as they truly are with a real
          interest and not merely a conventional one! The words of Scripture
          come readily to hand, and the repetition of them requires no effort of
          thought in the writer or speaker. But, neither does it produce any
          effect on the hearer, which will always be in proportion to the degree
          of feeling or consciousness in ourselves. It may be said that
          originality is the gift of few; no Church can expect to have, not a
          hundred, but ten such preachers as Robertson or Newman. But, without
          originality, it seems possible to make use of Scripture in sermons in
          a much more living way than at present. Let the preacher make it a
          sort of religion, and proof of his reverence for Scripture, that he
          never uses its words without a distinct meaning; let him avoid the
          form of argument from Scripture, and catch the feeling and spirit.
          Scripture is itself a kind of poetry, when not overlaid with rhetoric.
          The scene and country has a freshness which may always be renewed;
          there is the interest of antiquity and the interest of home or common
          life as well. The facts and characters of Scripture might receive a
          new reading by being described simply as they are. The truths of
          Scripture again would have greater reality if divested of the
          scholastic form in which theology has cast them. The universal and
          spiritual aspects of Scripture might be more brought forward to the
          exclusion of questions of the Jewish law, or controversies about the
          sacraments, or exaggerated statements of doctrines which seem to be at
          variance with morality. The life of Christ, regarded quite naturally
          as of one who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
          sin,' is also the life and centre of Christian teaching. There is no
          higher aim which the preacher can propose to himself than to awaken
          what may be termed the feeling of the presence of God and the mind of
          Christ in Scripture; not to collect evidences about dates and books,
          or to familiarize metaphysical distinctions; but to make the heart and
          conscience of his hearers bear him witness that the lessons which are
          contained in Scripture -- lessons of justice and truth -- lessons of
          mercy and peace -- of the need of man and the goodness of God to him,
          are indeed not human but divine.

        <p>
          V. It is time to make an end of this long disquisition -- let the end
          be a few more words of application to the circumstances of a
          particular class in the present age. If any one who is about to become
          a clergyman feels or thinks that he feels that some of the preceding
          statements cast a shade of trouble or suspicion on his future walk of
          life, who, either from the influence of a stronger mind than his own,
          or from some natural tendency in himself, has been led to examine
          those great questions which lie on the threshold of the higher study
          of theology, and experiences a sort of shrinking or dizziness at the
          prospect which is opening upon him; let him lay to heart the following
          considerations: -- First, that he may possibly not be the person who
          is called upon to pursue such inquiries. No man should busy himself
          with them who has not clearness of mind enough to see things as they
          are, and a faith strong enough to rest in that degree of knowledge
          which God has really given; or who is unable to separate the truth
          from his own religious wants and experiences. For the theologian as
          well as the philosopher has need of dry light,' unmingled with any
          tincture of the affections,' the more so as his conclusions are
          oftener liable to be disordered by them. He who is of another
          temperament may find another work to do, which is in some respects a
          higher one. Unlike philosophy, the Gospel has an ideal life to offer,
          not to a few only, but to all. There is one word of caution, however,
          to be given to those who renounce inquiry; it is that they cannot
          retain the right to condemn inquirers. Their duty is to say with
          Nicodemus, Doth the Gospel condemn any man before it hear him?'
          although the answer may be only Art thou also of Galilee?' They have
          chosen the path of practical usefulness, and they should acknowledge
          that it is a narrow path. For any but a strong swimmer' will be
          insensibly drawn out of it by the tide of public opinion or the
          current of party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, let him consider that the difficulty is not so great as
          imagination sometimes paints it. It is a difficulty which arises
          chiefly out of differences of education in different classes of
          society. It is a difficulty which tact, and prudence, and, much more,
          the power of a Christian life may hope to surmount. Much depends on
          the manner in which things are said; on the evidence in the writer or
          preacher of a real good will to his opponents, and a desire for the
          moral improvement of men. There is an aspect of truth which may always
          be put forward so as to find a way to the hearts of men. If there is
          danger and shrinking from one point of view, from another, there is
          freedom and sense of relief. The wider contemplation of the religious
          world may enable us to adjust our own place in it. The acknowledgment
          of churches as political and national institutions is the basis of a
          sound government of them. Criticism itself is not only negative; if it
          creates some difficulties, it does away others. It may put us at
          variance with a party or section of Christians in our own
          neighbourhood. But on the other hand, it enables us to look at all men
          as they are in the sight of God, not as they appear to human eye,
          separated and often interdicted from each other by lines of religious
          demarcation, it divides us from the parts to unite us to the whole.
          That is a great help to religious communion. It does away with the
          supposed opposition of reason and faith. It throws us back on the
          conviction that religion is a personal thing, in which certainty is to
          be slowly won and not assumed as the result of evidence or testimony.
          It places us, in some respects (though it be deemed a paradox to say
          so), more nearly in the position of the first Christians to whom the
          New Testament was not yet given, in whom the Gospel was a living word,
          not yet embodied in forms or supported by ancient institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, the suspicion or difficulty which attends critical inquiries
          is no reason for doubting their value. The Scripture nowhere leads us
          to suppose that the circumstance of all men speaking well of us is any
          ground for supposing that we are acceptable in the sight of God. And
          there is no reason why the condemnation of others should be witnessed
          to by our own conscience. Perhaps it may be true that, owing to the
          jealousy or fear of some, the reticence of others, the terrorism of a
          few, we may not always find it easy to regard these subjects with
          calmness and judgment. But, on the other hand, these accidental
          circumstances have nothing to do with the question at issue; they
          cannot have the slightest influence on the meaning of words, or on the
          truth of facts. No one can carry out the principle that public opinion
          or church authority is the guide to truth, when he goes beyond the
          limits of his own church or country. That is a consideration which may
          well make him pause before he accepts of such a guide in the journey
          to another world. All the arguments for repressing inquiries into
          Scripture in Protestant countries hold equally in Italy and Spain for
          repressing inquiries into matters of fact or doctrine, and so for
          denying the Scriptures to the common people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, let him be assured that there is some nobler idea of truth
          than is supplied by the opinion of mankind in general, or the voice of
          parties in a church. Every one, whether a student of theology or not,
          has need to make war against his prejudices no less than against his
          passions; and, in the religious teacher, the first is even more
          necessary than the last. For, while the vices of mankind are in a
          great degree isolated, and are, at any rate, reprobated by public
          opinion, their prejudices have a sort of communion or kindred with the
          world without. They are a collective evil, and have their being in the
          interest, classes, states of society, and other influences amid which
          we live. He who takes the prevailing opinions of Christians and decks
          them out in their gayest colours -- who reflects the better mind of
          the world to itself -- is likely to be its favourite teacher. In that
          ministry of the Gospel, even when assuming forms repulsive to persons
          of education, no doubt the good is far greater than the error or harm.
          But there is also a deeper work which is not dependent on the opinions
          of men in which many elements combine, some alien to religion, or
          accidentally at variance with it. That work can hardly expect to win
          much popular favour, so far as it runs counter to the feelings of
          religious parties. But he who bears a part in it may feel a
          confidence, which no popular caresses or religious sympathy could
          inspire, that he has by a Divine help been enabled to plant his foot
          somewhere beyond the waves of time. He may depart hence before the
          natural term, worn out with intellectual toil; regarded with suspicion
          by many of his contemporaries; yet not without a sure hope that the
          love of truth, which men of saintly lives often seem to slight, is,
          nevertheless, accepted before God.<br />
