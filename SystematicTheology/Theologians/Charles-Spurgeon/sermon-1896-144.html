          73. Thy hands have made and fashioned me. The avowal of the prophet,
          that he had been created by the hand of God, greatly contributed to
          inspire him with the hope of obtaining the favor which he supplicates.
          As we are the creatures and the workmanship of God, and as he has not
          only bestowed upon us vital motion, in common with the lower animals,
          but has, in addition thereto, given us the light of understanding and
          reasons -- this encourages us to pray that he would direct us to the
          obedience of his law. And yet the prophet does not call upon God, as
          if He were under any obligations to him; but, knowing that God never
          forsakes the work which he has begun, he simply asks for new grace, by
          which God may carry on to perfection what he has commenced. We have
          need of the assistance of the law, since all that is sound in our
          understandings is corrupted; so that we cannot perceive what is right,
          unless we are taught from some other source. But our blindness and
          stupidity are still more strikingly manifest, from the fact that
          teaching will avail us nothing, until our souls are renewed by Divine
          grace. What I have previously said must be borne in mind.. That
          whenever the prophet prays for understanding being imparted to him, in
          order to his learning the Divine commandments, he condemns both
          himself and all mankind as in a state of blindness; for which the only
          remedy is the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          74. They who fear thee shall see me and be glad. This verse is either
          connected with the preceding, or it includes other benefits of God,
          besides the blessing mentioned in that verse. Whether the Psalmist
          adverts only to one particular species of blessing, or speaks
          generally, he by these words highly extols the benefits with which God
          had honored him, that all genuine saints in common might experience
          joy on that account. He does not mean to say that this joy proceeds
          solely from the trust which he reposed in God, but that it also
          proceeds from this, -- that, having been preserved by him in a
          remarkable way, and loaded with many benefits, his hope had received
          an ample reward. As God invites all his servants in common to trust in
          him, it follows, that, whenever he exhibits a token of his grace
          towards any one of them, he testifies to all that he is faithful to
          his promises, and that they have no reason to be afraid of his
          disappointing those who trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          75 I have known, O Jehovah / that thy judgments are justice. By
          judgments, in this psalm, we are to understand the precepts of the
          law; but as the prophet immediately adds, that he was justly
          chastised, he seems to use the word in this verse, for the punishments
          by which God stirs up men to repentance. These two words, tsdq,
          tsedek, justice, in the first clause, and 'mvnh emunah truth, in the
          last, have here nearly the same signification. In the first clause,
          the prophet confesses in general that God so regulates his judgments,
          as to shut the mouths of the ungodly, should any of them complain of
          his cruelty or rigor; and that such equity shines forth in them, as to
          extort from us the confession that nothing is better for men than in
          this way to be called back to the consideration of themselves. He next
          exhibits an example of this in his own person. Even hypocrites
          sometimes yield God the praise of justice when he chastises others,
          and they never condemn his severity, so long as they themselves are
          spared. But it is the property of true piety to be less austere and
          rigid censors of the faults of others than of our own. The knowledge
          of which the prophet speaks, is a sure evidence of his having made a
          strict and earnest examination of himself; for, had he not well
          weighed his own guilt, he could not by assured experience have learned
          the righteousness of God in his afflictions. If it is considered
          preferable to take the word judgments in its usual acceptation, the
          meaning of the text will be: Lord, I know that thy law is holy and
          just, and severely as thou hast afflicted me, I still retain the
          persuasion of this truth; for even in my afflictions I discern the
          righteousness, which corresponds with the character of thy word.
        </p>
        <p>
          76 I beseech thee let thy goodness be for my consolation. Although he
          has acknowledged that he had been justly humbled, yet he desires that
          his sorrow may be alleviated by some consolation. He implores God's
          mercy, as what was essentially necessary to relieve and cure his
          miseries. He thus shows that nothing can remove sorrow from the
          faithful, until they feel that God is reconciled to them. In the Word
          in which God offers his mercy, there is to be found no small comfort
          for healing all the grief to which men are liable. But the Psalmist is
          now speaking of actual mercy, if I may use that term, when God by the
          very deed declares the favor which he has promised. Confiding in the
          Divine promise, he already cherished in his heart a joy, proceeding
          from the hope of receiving the communications of Divine grace. But as
          all our hope would end in mere disappointment, did not God at length
          appear as our deliverer, he requests the performance of that which God
          had promised him. Lord, as if he had said, since thou hast graciously
          promised to be ready to succor me, be pleased to make good thy word in
          effect. The observation which I have previously made ought to be
          remembered, That it is not in vain to remind God of his promise. It
          would be presumption for men to come into His presence, did he not, of
          his own mere good pleasure, open up the way for them. When the
          Psalmist says, to thy servant, he does not claim God's mercy
          exclusively to himself, as if it had. been promised to him alone by
          some special oracle; but he applies to himself what God has promised
          to the whole Church, which it is the peculiar province of faith to do;
          for unless I believe that I am one of those to whom God addresses
          himself in his word, so that his promises belong to me in common with
          others, I will never have the confidence to call upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          77. Let thy companions come unto me. In this verse, the Psalmist
          repeats and confirms almost the same request as in the preceding
          verse, although in phraseology somewhat different. As he had just now
          said, that his sorrow could not be removed, nor his joy restored, in
          any other way than by God's mercy being exercised towards him; so now
          he affirms that he cannot have without being reconciled to God. He
          thus distinguishes himself from worldly men, who are very little
          affected with a concern about having God reconciled to them; or,
          rather, who do not cease securely to enjoy themselves, although God is
          angry with them. He distinctly affirms, that, until he know that God
          is reconciled to him, he is a dead man even while living; but that, on
          the other hand, whenever God shall cause his mercy to shine upon him,
          he will be restored from death to life. By the way, he intimates that
          he was deprived for a time of the tokens of God's fatherly favor; for
          it would have been needless for him to have wished that it might come
          to him, had it not been removed from him. As an argument for obtaining
          what he supplicates, he asserts that the law of God was his delight;
          nor could he otherwise hope that God would be merciful to him.
          Besides, no man truly feels what virtue is in the Divine favor, but he
          who, placing his chief happiness in that alone, is convinced that all
          who dissever themselves from God are miserable and accursed; a truth
          which the prophet had learned from the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          78. Let the proud be put to shame. We have already often had occasion
          to remark, that, in the Hebrew language, the future tense is
          frequently used in the sense of the optative mood, as here, -- They
          shall be put to shame, for, Let them be put to shame. Still it would
          not be unsuitable to explain the meaning thus' As the proud have dealt
          mischievously with me, and molested me without a cause, the Lord will
          give them their reward. But as almost all interpreters are agreed that
          this is a prayer, in the translation of the verse I am unwilling to
          depart from the generally received explanation, especially as the
          language is expressly addressed to God himself. It is important to
          attend to the reason why the Psalmist hopes that God will be an enemy
          to his enemies; namely, because they wickedly and maliciously
          assaulted him. The word sqr, sheker, which I have rendered falsely, is
          by some translated, without a cause; but they seem only to hit upon
          the one half of the prophet's meaning; for this word, in my opinion,
          is to be referred to the stratagems and artifices by which the wicked
          endeavored to destroy David. Whence we gather, that whenever we are
          wrongfully persecuted by wicked men, we are invited to have recourse
          directly to God for protection. At the same time, we are taught that
          we have no reason to be abashed at their insolence; for, whatever
          power they may arrogate to themselves, He will beat down their
          loftiness, and lay it low, to their shame; so that, being confounded,
          they will serve as an example, to teach others that nothing is more
          ridiculous than to sing the song of triumph before the victory is
          gained. The verb 'sych, asiach, in the second clause of the verse, may
          be rendered, I will speak of, as well as I will meditate upon;
          implying, that, when he had obtained the victory, he would proclaim
          the goodness of God, which he had experienced. To speak of God's
          statutes, is equivalent to declaring out of the law, how faithfully he
          guards his saints, how securely he delivers them, and how righteously
          he avenges their wrongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          79. Let such as fear thee turn unto me. In this verse, which is
          connected with the preceding, the Psalmist affirms, that the
          deliverance which he obtained would afford common instruction to all
          the godly. My condition, as if he had said, may, for a time, have
          disheartened the righteous, as well as increased the insolence of my
          enemies; but now, taking courage, they will turn their eyes to this
          joyful spectacle. Moreover, let us learn from the two marks, by which
          he distinguishes true believers, what is the nature of genuine
          godliness. He puts the fear, or the reverence of God, in the first,
          place; but he immediately joins to it the knowledge of Divine truth,
          to teach us that these two things are inseparably connected. The
          superstitious, indeed, exhibit a fear of God of a certain kind, but it
          is a mere show, which quickly vanishes. Besides, they weary themselves
          in their own inventions to no purpose; for God will take no account of
          any other services, but those which are performed in obedience to his
          commandments. True religion, then, and the worship of God, have their
          origin in faith -- in the faith of what he has enjoined; so that no
          person can serve God aright, but he who has been taught in His school.
        </p>
        <p>
          80. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes Having, a little before,
          desired to be endued with a sound understanding, he now prays, in a
          similar manner, for sincere affection of heart. The understanding and
          affections, as is well known, are the two principal faculties of the
          human soul, both of which he clearly shows to be depraved and
          perverse, when he requests that his understanding may be illuminated,
          and, at the same time, that his heart may be framed to the obedience
          of the law. This plainly refutes all that the Papists babble about
          free will. The prophet not only here prays that God would help him,
          because his will was weak; but he testifies, without qualification,
          that uprightness of heart is. the gift of the Holy Spirit. We are,
          moreover, taught by these words, in what the true keeping of the law
          consists. A great part of mankind, after having carelessly framed
          their life according to the Divine law, by outward obedience, think
          that they want nothing. But the Holy Spirit here declares that no
          service is acceptable to God, except that which proceeds from
          integrity of heart. As to the word, tmym, thamim, rendered sound, we
          have elsewhere said, that a sound heart is set in opposition to a
          double or deceitful heart. It is as if the prophet had said, that
          those who are without dissimulation, and who offer to God a pure
          heart, yield themselves truly to Him. When it is added, that I may not
          be put to shame, it is intimated, that such shall be the undoubted
          issue as to all the proud, who, disdaining the grace of God, lean upon
          their own strength; and as to all hypocrites, who, for a time, parade
          themselves in gay colors. The amount, then, is, that unless God govern
          us by his Spirit, and keep us in the performance of our duty, so that
          our hearts may be sound in his statutes, although our shame may be
          hidden for a time, yea, although all men should praise us, and hold us
          in admiration, yet we cannot avoid falling, at length, into dishonor
          and ignominy.<br />
