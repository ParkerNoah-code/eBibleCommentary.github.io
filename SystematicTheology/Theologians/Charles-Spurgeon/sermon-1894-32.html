          Let the day perish wherein I was born; And the night which said, There
          is a man child conceived!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let that day be darkness; Let not God regard it from above, Neither
          let the light shine upon it! Let darkness and the shadow of death
          claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh
          black the day terrify it!
        </p>
        <p>
          As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it; Let it not
          rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of
          the months! Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come
          therein! Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse
          up leviathan! Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark! Let it
          look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of
          the morning:
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, Nor hid trouble
          from mine eyes!
        </p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>
          Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I
          came out of the belly? Why did the knees receive me? Or why the
          breasts, that I should suck?
        </p>
        <p>
          For now should I have lien down and been quiet; I should have slept;
          then had I been at rest, With kings and counsellors of the earth,
          Which built solitary piles for themselves; Or with princes that had
          gold, Who filled their houses with silver; Or as an hidden untimely
          birth I had not been; As infants which never saw light. There the
          wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary be at rest. There the
          prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the
          taskmaster. The small and great are there; And the servant is free
          from his master. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
          And life unto the bitter in soul? Which long for death, but it cometh
          not; And dig for it more than for hid treasures; Which rejoice
          exceedingly, And are glad when they can find the grave. Why is light
          given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in? For my
          sighing cometh before I eat, And my roarings are poured out like
          water. For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am
          afraid of cometh unto me. I am not at ease, neither am I quiet,
          Neither have I rest: but trouble cometh!
