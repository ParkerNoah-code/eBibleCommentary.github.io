        <p>A Sermon</p>

          "And she said, the Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out
          of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and
          shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him. But
          the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down
          to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the
          prison house." -- Judges 16:20-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          SAMSON IS, IN MANY RESPECTS, one of the most remarkable men whose
          history is recorded in the pages of inspiration. He enjoyed a singular
          privilege only accorded to one other person in the Old Testament. His
          birth was foretold to his parents by an angel. Isaac was promised to
          Abraham and Sarah by angels whom they entertained unawares; but save
          Isaac, Samson was the only one whose birth was foretold by an angelic
          messenger before the opening of the gospel dispensation. Before his
          birth he was dedicated to God, and set apart as a Nazarite. Now, a
          Nazarite was a person who was entirely consecrated to God, and in
          token of his consecration he drank no wine; and allowed his hair to
          grow, untouched by the razor. Samson, you may therefore understand,
          was entirely consecrated to God, and when any saw him, they would say,
          "That man is God's man, a Nazarite, set apart." God endowed Samson
          with supernatural strength, a strength which never could have been the
          result of mere thews and sinews. It was not the fashioning of Samson's
          body that made him strong; it was not the arm, or the fist with which
          he smote the Philistines; it was a miracle that dwelt within him, a
          continued going forth of the omnipotence of God, which made him
          mightier than thousands of his enemies. Samson appears very early to
          have discovered in himself this great strength, for "the Spirit of the
          Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan." He judged Israel
          for thirty years, and gloriously did he deliver them. What a noble
          being he must have been! See him, when he steps into the vineyard for
          a moment from his parents. A lion that has been crouching there
          springs upon him, but he meets him all unarmed, receives him upon his
          brawny arms and rends him like a kid. See him afterwards, when his
          countrymen have bound him and taken him down from the top of the rock,
          and delivered him up to the thousands of the Philistines. He has
          scarcely come near them, when, without a weapon, with his own foot, he
          begins to spurn them; and seeing there the jaw-bone of an ass, he
          takes that ignoble weapon, and sweeps away the men that had helmets
          about their heads and were girded with greaves of brass. Nor did his
          vigour fail him in his later life, for he died in the very prime of
          his days. One of his greatest exploits was performed at this very
          season. He is entrapped in the city of Gaza. He remains there till
          midnight; so confident is he in his strength that he is in no hurry to
          depart, and instead of assailing the guard, and making them draw the
          bolts, he wrenches up the two posts, and takes away the gate, bar and
          all, and, carries his mighty burden for miles to the top of a hill
          that is before Hebron. Every way it must have been a great thing to
          see this man, especially if one had him for a friend. Had one been his
          foe, the more distant the sight the better, for none could escape from
          him but those who fled; but to have him for a friend and to stand with
          him in the day of battle, was to feel that you had an army in a single
          man, and had in one frame that which would strike thousands with
          terror. Samson, however, though he had great physical strength, had
          but little mental force, and even less spiritual power. His whole life
          is a scene of miracles and follies. He had but little grace, and was
          easily overcome by temptation. He is enticed and led astray. Often
          corrected; still he sins again. At last he falls into the hands of
          Delilah. She is bribed with an enormous sum, and she endeavours to get
          from him the secret of his strength. He foolishly toys with the
          danger, and plays with his own destruction. At last goaded by her
          importunity, he lets out the secret which he ought to have confided to
          no one but himself. The secret of his strength lay in his locks. Not
          that his hair made him strong; but that his hair was the symbol of his
          consecration, and was the pledge of God's favour to him. While his
          hair was untouched he was a consecrated man; as soon as that was cut
          away, he was no longer perfectly consecrated, and then his strength
          departed from him. His hair is cut away; the locks that covered him
          once are taken from him, and there he stands a shaveling, weak as
          other men. Now the Philistines begin to oppress him, and his eyes are
          burned out with hot iron. How are the mighty fallen! How are the great
          ones taken in the net! Samson, the great hero of Israel, is seen with
          a shuffling gait walking towards Gaza. A shuffling gait, I said,
          because he had just received blindness, which was a new thing to him,
          therefore, he had not as yet learned to walk as well as those who,
          having been blind for years, at last learn to set their feet firmly
          upon the earth. With his feet bound together with brazen fetters -- an
          unusual mode of binding a prisoner, but adopted in this case because
          Samson was supposed to be still so strong, that any other kind of
          fetter would have been insufficient -- you see him walking along in
          the midst of a small escort towards Gaza. And now he comes to the very
          city out of which he had walked in all his pride with the gates and
          bolts upon his shoulders; and the little children come out, the lower
          orders of the people come round about him, and point at him --
          "Samson, the great hero, hath fallen! let us make sport of him!" What
          a spectacle! The hot sun is beating upon his bare head, which had once
          been protected by those luxuriant locks. Look at the escort who guard
          him, a mere handful of men, how they would have fled before him in his
          brighter days; but now a child might overcome him. They take him to a
          place where an ass is grinding at the mill, and Samson must do the
          same ignoble work. Why, he must be the sport and jest of every passer
          by, and of every fool who shall step in to see this great wonder --
          the destroyer of the Philistines made to toil at the mill. Ah, what a
          fall was there, my brethren! We might indeed stand and weep over poor
          blind Samson. That he should have lost his eyes was terrible; that he
          should have lost his strength was worse; but that he should have lost
          the favour of God for awhile; that he should become the sport of God's
          enemies, was the worst of all. Over this indeed we might weep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, why have I narrated this story? Why should I direct your
          attention to Samson? For this reason. Every child of God is a
          consecrated man. His consecration is not typified by any outward
          symbol; we are not commanded to let our hair grow for ever, nor to
          abstain from meats or drinks. The Christian is a consecrated man, but
          his consecration is unseen by his fellows, except in the outward deeds
          which are the result thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I want to speak to you, my dear friends, as consecrated men,
          as Nazarites, and I think I shall find a lesson for you in the history
          of Samson. My first point shall be the strength of the consecrated,
          for they are strong men; secondly, the secret of their strength;
          thirdly, the danger to which they are exposed; and fourthly, the
          disgrace which will come upon them if they fall into this danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSECRATED MAN. Do you know that the
          strongest man in all the world is a consecrated man? Even though he
          may consecrate himself to a wrong object, yet if it be a thorough
          consecration, he will have strength -- strength for evil, it may be,
          but still strength. In the old Roman wars with Pyrrhus, you remember
          an ancient story of self-devotion. There was an oracle which said that
          victory would attend that army whose leader should give himself up to
          death. Decius the Roman Consul, knowing this, rushed into the thickest
          of the battle, that his army might overcome by his dying. The
          prodigies of valour which he performed are proofs of the power of
          consecration. The Romans at that time seemed to be every man a hero,
          because every man was a consecrated man. They went to battle with this
          thought -- "I will conquer or die; the name of Rome is written on my
          heart; for my country I am prepared to live, or for that to shed my
          blood." And no enemies could ever stand against them. If a Roman fell
          there were no wounds in his back, but all in his breast. His face,
          even in cold death, was like the face of a lion, and when looked upon
          it was of terrible aspect. They were men consecrated to their country;
          they were ambitious to make the name of Rome the noblest word in human
          language; and consequently the Roman became a giant. And to this day
          let a man get a purpose within him, I care not what his purpose is,
          and let his whole soul be absorbed by it, and what will he not do? You
          that are "everything by turns and nothing long," that have nothing to
          live for, soulless carcases that walk this earth and waste its air,
          what can you do? Why nothing. But the man who knows what he is at, and
          has his mark, speeds to it "Like an arrow from a bow shot by an archer
          strong." Nought can turn him aside from his design. How much more is
          this true if I limit the description to that which is peculiar to the
          Christian -- consecration to God! Oh! what strength that man has who
          is dedicated to God! Is there such an one here? I know there is. I
          know that there be many who have consecrated themselves to the Lord
          God of Israel in the secret of their chamber; and who can say in their
          hearts,
        </p>
        <p>"Tis done; the great transaction's done</p>
        <p>I am my Lord's, and he is mine.</p>
        <p>He drew me, and I followed on,</p>
        <p>Glad to obey the voice divine."</p>
        <p>
          Now, the man that can say that, and is thoroughly consecrated to God;
          be he who he may or what he may, he is a strong man, and will work
          marvels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need I tell you of the wonders that have been done by consecrated men?
          You have read the stories of olden times, when our religion was hunted
          like a partridge on the mountains. Did you never hear how consecrated
          men and women endured unheard-of pangs and agonies? Have you not read
          how they were cast to the lions, how they were sawn in sunder, how
          they languished in prisons, or met with the swifter death of the
          sword? Have you not heard how they wandered about in sheeps' skins and
          goats' skins, destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was
          not worthy? Have you not heard how they defied tyrants to their face,
          how, when they were threatened, they dared most boldly to laugh at all
          the threats of the foe -- how at the stake they clapped their hands in
          the fire, and sang psalms of triumph when men, worse than fiends, were
          jeering at their miseries? How was this? What made women stronger than
          men, and men stronger than angels? Why this, -- they were consecrated
          to God. They felt that every pang which rent their heart was giving
          glory to God, that all the pains they endured in their bodies were but
          the marks of the Lord Jesus, whereby they were proven to be wholly
          dedicated unto him. Nor in this alone has the power of the consecrated
          ones been proved. Have you never heard how the sanctified ones have
          done wonders? Read the stories of those who counted not their lives
          dear unto them, that they might honour their Lord and Master by
          preaching his Word, by telling forth the gospel in foreign lands. Have
          you not heard how men have left their kindred and their friends, and
          all that life held dear -- have crossed the stormy sea, and have gone
          into the lands of the heathen, where men were devouring one another?
          Have you not known how they have put their foot upon that country, and
          have seen the ship that conveyed them there fading away in the
          distance, and yet without a fear have dwelt amongst the wild savages
          of the woods, have walked into the midst of them, and told them the
          simple story of the God that loved and died for man? You must know how
          those men have conquered, how those, who seemed to be fiercer than
          lions, have crouched before them, have listened to their words, and
          have been converted by the majesty of the gospel which they preached.
          What made these men heroes? What enabled them to rend themselves away
          from all their kith and kin, and banish themselves into the land of
          the stranger? It was because they were consecrated, thoroughly
          consecrated to the Lord Jesus Christ. What is there in the world which
          the consecrated man cannot do? Tempt him; offer him gold and silver;
          carry him to the mountain top, and show him all the kingdoms of the
          world, and tell him he shall have all these if he will bow down and
          worship the god of this world. What saith the consecrated man? "Get
          thee behind me, Satan; I have more than all this which thou dost offer
          me; this world is mine, and worlds to come; I despise the temptation;
          I will not bow before thee." Let men threaten a consecrated man, what
          does he say? "I fear God, and, therefore, I cannot fear you; if it be
          right in your sight to obey man rather than God, judge ye; but, as for
          me, I will serve none but God." You may, perhaps, have seen in your
          life a consecrated man. Is he a public character? What cannot he do?
          He preaches the gospel, and at once a thousand enemies assail him;
          they attack him on every side; some for this thing, and some for that;
          his very virtues are distorted into vices, and his slightest faults
          are magnified into the greatest crimes. He has scarce a friend; the
          very ministers of the gospel shun him; he is reckoned to be so strange
          that every one must avoid him. What does he do? Within the chamber of
          his own heart he holds conference with his God, and asks himself this
          question -- am I right? Conscience gives the verdict, -- yes, and the
          Spirit bears witness with his spirit that conscience is impartial.
          "Then," says he, "come fair, come foul, if I am right, -- neither to
          the right hand nor to the left will I turn." Perhaps he feels in
          secret what he will not express in public. He feels the pang of
          desertion, obloquy, and rebuke; he cries --
        </p>
        <p>"If on my face, for thy dear name,</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach shall be,</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach, and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>If thou'lt remember me."</p>
        <p>
          As for himself in public, none can tell that he careth for any of
          these things; for he can say with Paul -- "None of these things move
          me, neither count I my life dear unto me that I may win Christ and
          finish my course with joy." What cannot a consecrated man do? I do
          believe if he had the whole world against him, he would prove more
          than a match for them all. He would say -- "Heaps upon heaps, with the
          jaw-bone of an ass, have I slain my thousand men." I care not how
          violent may be his foe; nor how great may be the advantage which that
          foe may get on him: though the lion may have crouched for the spring,
          and may be leaping upon him, yet will he rend him as a kid, for he is
          more than a conqueror through him that loved him. He is alone such,
          who is wholly consecrated unto the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," says some one, "can we be consecrated to Christ? I thought that
          was for ministers only." Oh, no, my brethren; all God's children must
          be consecrated men. What are you? Are you engaged in business? If you
          are what you profess to be, your business must be consecrated to God.
          Perhaps you have no family whatever, and you are engaged in trade, and
          are saving some considerable sum a-year; let me tell you the example
          of a man thoroughly consecrated to God. There lives in Bristol, (name
          unknown), a man whose income is large; and what does he do with it? He
          labours in business continually that this income may come to him, but
          of it, every farthing every year is expended in the Lord's cause
          except that which he requires for the necessaries of life. He makes
          his necessities as few as possible, that he may have the more to give
          away. He is God's man in his business. I do not exhort you to do the
          same. You may be in a different position; but a man who has a family,
          and is in business, should be able to say -- "Now, I make so much from
          my business; my family must be provided for -- but I seek not to amass
          riches. I will make money for God and I will spend it in his cause.
          Did I not say, when I joined the church --
        </p>
        <p>"All that I am, and all I have,</p>
        <p>Shall be for ever thine;</p>
        <p>Whate'er my duty bids me give,</p>
        <p>My cheerful hands resign."</p>
        <p>
          And if I said it, I meant it." I do not understand some Christian
          people who sing that hymn, and then pinch, screw, and nip anything
          when it comes to God's cause. If I sing that, I mean it. I would not
          sing it unless I did. If I join the church, I understand that I give
          myself and all that I have up to that church; I would not make a lying
          profession; I would not make an avowal of a consecration which I did
          not mean. If I have said, "I am Christ's;" by his grace I will be
          Christ's. Brethren, you in business may be as much consecrated to
          Christ as the minister in his pulpit; you may make your ordinary
          transactions in life a solemn service of God. Many a man has disgraced
          a cassock, and many another has consecrated a smockfrock: many a man
          has defiled his pulpit cushions, and many another has made a cobbler's
          lapstone holiness unto the Lord. Happy the man who is consecrated unto
          the Lord; where'er he is, he is a consecrated man, and he shall do
          wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has often been remarked that in this age we are all little men. A
          hundred years ago, or more, if we had gone through the churches, we
          might have readily found a number of ministers of great note. But now
          we are all little men, the drivelling sons of nobodies; our names
          shall never be remembered, for we do nothing to deserve it. There is
          scarce a man alive now upon this earth; there are plenty to be found
          who call themselves men, but they are the husks of men, the life has
          gone from them, the precious kernel seems to have departed. The
          littleness of Christians of this age results from the littleness of
          their consecration to Christ. The age of John Owen was the day of
          great preachers; but let me tell you, that that was the age of great
          consecration. Those great preachers whose names we remember, were men
          who counted nothing their own: they were driven out from their
          benefices, because they could not conform to the Established Church,
          and they gave up all they had willingly to the Lord. They were hunted
          from place to place; the disgraceful five-mile act would not permit
          them to come within five miles of any market town; they wandered here
          and there to preach the gospel to a few poor sheep, being fully given
          up to their Lord. Those were foul times; but they promised they would
          walk the road fair or foul, and they did walk it knee deep in mud; and
          they would have walked it if it had been knee deep in blood too. They
          became great men; and if we were, as they were, wholly given up to God
          -- if we could say of ourselves, "From the crown of my head to the
          sole of my foot, there is not a drop of blood that is not wholly
          God's; all my time, all my talents, everything I have is God's" -- if
          we could say that, we should be strong like Samson, for the
          consecrated must be strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, in the second place, THE SECRET OF THEIR STRENGTH. What makes
          the consecrated man strong? Ah! beloved; there is no strength in man
          of himself. Samson without his God was but a poor fool indeed. The
          secret of Samson's strength was this -- as long as he was consecrated
          he should be strong; so long as he was thoroughly devoted to his God,
          and had no object but to serve God, (and that was to be indicated by
          the growing of his hair) so long, and no longer, would God be with him
          to help him. And now you see, dear friends, that if you have any
          strength to serve God, the secret of your strength lies in the same
          place. What strength have you save in God? Ah! I have heard some men
          talk as if the strength of free will, of human nature, was sufficient
          to carry men to heaven. Free will has carried many souls to hell, but
          never a soul to heaven yet. No strength of nature can suffice to serve
          the Lord aright. No man can say that Jesus is the Christ but by the
          Holy Ghost. No man can come to Christ except the Father that hath sent
          Christ doth draw him. If, then, the first act of Christian life is
          beyond all human strength, how much more are those higher steps far
          beyond any one of us? Do we not utter a certain truth when we say in
          the words of Scripture, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to
          think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God." I
          think every one who has a really quickened soul will sooner or later
          be made to feel this. Ay! I question whether a man can be converted a
          day without finding out his own weakness. It is but a little space
          before the child finds that he can stand alone so long as God his
          Father takes him by the arms and teaches him to go, but that if his
          Father's hand be taken away he has no power to stand, but down he
          falls at once. See Samson without his God, going out against a
          thousand men. Would they not laugh at him? and with scarcely time to
          express his terror, he would flee, or be rent in pieces. Imagine him
          without his God, locked up in Gaza, the gates fast closed. He goes out
          into the streets to escape; but how can he clear a passage? He is
          caught like a wild bull in a net; he may go round and round the walls,
          but where shall be his deliverance? Without his God he is but as other
          men. The secret of his strength lies in his consecration, and in the
          strength which is its result. Remember, then, the secret of your
          strength. Never think that you have any power of your own; rely wholly
          upon the God of Israel; and remember that the channel through which
          that strength must come to you must be your entire consecration to
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, What is THE PECULIAR DANGER OF A CONSECRATED
          MAN? His danger is that his locks may be shorn, that is to say, that
          his consecration may be broken. As long as he is consecrated he is
          strong; break that, he is weak as water. Now there are a thousand
          razors with which the devil can shave off the locks of a consecrated
          man without his knowing it. Samson is sound asleep; so clever is the
          barber that he even lulls him to sleep as his fingers move across the
          pate, the fool's pate, which he is making bare. The devil is cleverer
          far than even the skilful barber; he can shave the believer's locks
          while he scarcely knows it. Shall I tell you with what razors he can
          accomplish this work? Sometimes he takes the sharp razor of pride, and
          when the Christian falls asleep and is not vigilant, he comes with it
          and begins to run his fingers upon the Christian's locks, and says,
          "What a fine fellow you are! What wonders you have done! Didn't you
          rend that lion finely? Wasn't it a great feat to smite those
          Philistines hip and thigh? Ah you will be talked-of as long as time
          endures for carrying those gates of Gaza away. You need not be afraid
          of anybody." And so on goes the razor, lock after lock falling off,
          and Samson knows it not. He is just thinking within himself, "How
          brave am I! How great am I!" Thus works the razor of pride -- cut,
          cut, cut away -- and he wakes up to find himself bald, and all his
          strength gone. Have you never had that razor upon your head? I confess
          I have on mine. Have you never, after you have been able to endure
          afflictions, heard a voice saying to you, "How patient you were!"
          After you have cast aside some temptation, and have been able to keep
          to the unswerving course of integrity, has not Satan said to you,
          "That is a fine thing you have done; that was bravely done." And all
          the while you little knew that it was the cunning hand of the evil one
          taking away your locks with the sharp razor of pride. For mark, pride
          is a breach of our consecration. As soon as I begin to get proud of
          what I do, or what I am, what am I proud of? Why, there is in that
          pride the act of taking away from God his glory. For I promised that
          God should have all the glory, and is not that part of my
          consecration? and I am taking it to myself. I have broken my
          consecration; my locks are gone, and I become weak. Mark this,
          Christian -- God will never give thee strength to glorify thyself
          with. God will give thee a crown, but not to put on thine own head. As
          sure as ever a Christian begins to write his feats, and his triumphs
          upon his own escutcheon, and take to himself the glory, God will lay
          him level with the dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another razor he also uses is self-sufficiency. "Ah," saith the devil
          as he is shaving away your locks, "You have done a very great deal.
          You see they bound you with green withes, and you snapped them in
          sunder, they merely smelt the fire and they burst. Then they took new
          ropes to bind you; ah! you overcame even them; for you snapped the
          ropes in sunder as if they had been a thread. Then they weaved the
          seven locks of your head, but you walked away with loon, and web too,
          beam and all. You can do anything, don't be afraid: you have strength
          enough to do anything; you can accomplish any feat you set your will
          upon." How softly the devil will do all that; how will he be rubbing
          the poll while the razor is moving softly along and the locks are
          dropping off, and he is treading them in the dust. "You have done all
          this, and you can do anything else." Every drop of grace distils from
          heaven. O my brethren, what have we that we have not received? Let us
          not imagine that we can create might wherewith to gird ourselves. "All
          my springs are in thee." The moment we begin to think that it is our
          own arm that has gotten us the victory, it will be all over with us --
          our locks of strength shall be taken away, and the glory shall depart
          from us. So, you see, self-sufficiency, as well as pride, may be the
          razor with which the enemy may shave away our strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another, and a more palpable danger still. When a
          consecrated man begins to change his purpose in life and live for
          himself -- that razor shaves clean indeed. There is a minister; when
          he first began his ministry he could say, "God is my witness I have
          but one object, that I may free my skirts from the blood of every one
          of my hearers, that I may preach the gospel faithfully and honour my
          Master." In a little time, tempted by Satan, he changes his tone and
          talks like this, "I must keep my congregation up. If I preach such
          hard doctrine, they won't come. Did not one of the newspapers
          criticise me, and did not some of my people go away from me because of
          it? I must mind what I am at. I must keep this thing going. I must
          look out a little sharper, and prone my speech down. I must adopt a
          little gentler style, or preach a new-fashioned doctrine; for I must
          keep my popularity up. What is to become of me if I go down? People
          will say, Up like a rocket, down like the stick;' and then shall all
          my enemies laugh." Ah, when once a man begins to care so much as a
          snap of the finger about the world, it is all over with him. If he can
          go to his pulpit, and say, "I have got a message to deliver; and
          whether they will hear or whether they will not hear, I will deliver
          it as God puts it into my mouth; I will not change the dot of an i, or
          the cross of a t for the biggest man that lives, or to bring in the
          mightiest congregation that ever sat at minister's feet" -- that man
          is mighty. He does not let human judgments move him, and he will move
          the world. But let him turn aside, and think about his congregation,
          and how that shall be kept up; ah Samson! how are thy locks shorn?
          What canst thou do now? That false Delilah has destroyed thee -- thine
          eyes are put out, thy comfort is taken away, and thy future ministry
          shall be like the grinding of an ass around the continually revolving
          mill; thou shalt have no rest or peace ever afterwards. Or let him
          turn aside another way. Suppose he should say, "I must get preferment,
          or wealth, I must look well to myself, I must see my nest feathered,
          that must he the object of my life." I am not now speaking of the
          ministry merely, but of all the consecrated; and as sure as ever we
          begin to make self the primary object of our existence our locks are
          shorn. "Now," says the Lord, "I gave that man strength, but not to use
          it for himself. Then I put him into a high position, but not that he
          might clothe himself about with glory; I put him there that he might
          look to my cause, to my interests; and if he does not do that first,
          down he shall go." You remember Queen Esther: she is exalted from
          being a simple humble maiden, to become the wife of the great monarch
          -- Ahasuerus. Well, Haman gets a decree against her nation, that it
          shall be destroyed. Poor Mordecai comes to Esther, and says, "You must
          go in to the king and speak to him." "Well," says she, "but if I do I
          shall die." "Ah," says he, "If thou altogether holdest thy peace at
          this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the
          Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
          destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for
          such a time as this?" Esther was not made Queen Esther that she might
          make herself glorious, but that she might be in a position to save the
          Jews; and now if she prefers herself before her country then it is all
          over with her -- Vashti's fate shall be as nothing compared with her
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, if you live in this world, and God prospers you, you get
          perhaps into some position, and you say, "Here I am; I will look out
          for myself; I have been serving the church before, but now I will look
          to myself a little." "Come, come," says human nature; "you must look
          after your family," (which means, you must look after yourself). Very
          well, do it sir, as your main object, and you are a ruined man. "Seek
          first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these shall be
          added to you." If you keep your eye single, your whole body shall be
          full of light. Though you seemed as if you had shut out half the light
          by having that single eye, yet your body shall be full of light. But
          begin to have two masters, and two objects to serve, and you shall
          serve neither; you shall neither prosper for this world, nor for that
          which is to come. Oh, Christian, above all things take care of thy
          consecration. Ever feel that thou art wholly given up to God, and to
          God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, lastly, there is THE CHRISTIAN'S DISGRACE. His locks are
          cut off. I have seen him, young as I am, and you with grey hairs upon
          your brows have seen him oftener than I; I have seen him in the
          ministry. He spake like an angel of God; many there were that regarded
          him, and did hang upon his lips; he seemed to be sound in doctrine and
          earnest in manner. I have seen him turn aside; it was but a little
          thing, -- some slight deviation from the ancient orthodoxy of his
          fathers, some slight violation of the law of his church. I have seen
          him, till he has given up doctrine after doctrine, until, at last, the
          very place wherein he preached has become a bye-word and a proverb;
          and the man is pointed out by the grey-headed sire to his child as a
          man who is to be looked upon with suspicion; who, if he lectures, is
          to be heard with caution; and if he preaches, is not to be listened to
          at all. Have you not seen him? What disgrace was there! What a fall!
          The man who came out in the camps of Dan, and seemed to be moved by
          the Spirit of the Lord, has become the slave of error. He has gone
          into the very camps of the enemy, and there he is now, grinding in the
          mill for the Philistine, whom he ought to have been striking with his
          arm. Now there are two ways of accounting for this. Such a man is
          either a thorough hypocrite or a fallen believer. Sometimes, people
          say of persons who turn aside to sin, "There now; look, there is a
          Christian fallen, -- a child of God fallen." It is something like the
          vulgar, when at night they see a bright light in the sky, and say,
          "Ah, there is a star fallen." It was not a star; the stars are all
          right. Take a telescope; they are every one there. The Great Bear has
          not lost a star out of it's tail; and if you look, there is the belt
          of Orion all safe, and the dagger has not dropped out of it. What is
          it, then? We do not know exactly what it is. Perhaps it may be a few
          gases up there for a little while, that have burst, and that is all;
          or some wandering substance cast down, -- and quite time that it
          should be. But the stars are all right. So, depend upon it, the
          children of God are always safe. Now these men who have turned aside
          and broken their consecration vow, are pointed at as a disgrace to
          themselves and dishonour to the church. And you who are members of
          Christ's church, you have seen men who stood in your ranks as firm
          soldiers of the cross, and you have noticed them go out, from us,
          "because they were not of us," or like poor Samson, you have seen them
          go to their graves with the eyes of their comfort put out, with the
          feet of their usefulness bound with brazen fetters, and with the
          strength of their arms entirely departed from them. Now, do any of you
          wish to be backsliders? Do you wish to betray the holy profession of
          your religion? My brethren, is there one among you who this day makes
          a profession of love to Christ, who desires to be an apostate? Is
          there one of you who desires like Samson to have his eyes put out, and
          to be made to grind in the mill? Would you, like David, commit a great
          sin, and go with broken bones to the grave? would you, like Lot, be
          drunken, and fall into lust? No, I know what you say, "Lord, let my
          path be like the eagle's flight; let me fly upwards to the sun, and
          never stay and never turn aside. Oh, give me grace that I may serve
          thee, like Caleb, with a perfect heart, and that from the beginning
          even to the end of my days, my course may be as the shining light,
          which shineth more and more unto the perfect day." Ay, I know what is
          your desire. How, then, shall it be accomplished? Look well to your
          consecration; see that it is sincere; see that you mean it, and then
          look up to the Holy Spirit, after you have looked to your
          consecration, and beg of him to give you daily grace; for as
          day-by-day the manna fell, so must you receive daily food from on
          high. And, remember, it is not by any grace you have in you, but by
          the grace that is in Christ, and that must be given to you hour by
          hour, that you are to stand, and having done all, to be crowned at
          last as a faithful one, who has endured unto the end. I ask your
          prayers that I may be kept faithful to my Lord; and on the other hand,
          I will offer my earnest prayers, that you may serve him while he lends
          you breath, that when your voice is lost in death, you may throughout
          a never ending immortality, praise him in louder and sweeter strains.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for you that have not given yourselves to God, and are not
          consecrated to him, I can only speak to you as to Philistines, and
          warn you, that the day shall come when Israel shall be avenged upon
          the Philistines. You may be one day assembled upon the roof of your
          pleasures, enjoying yourselves in health and strength; but there is a
          Samson -- called Death, who shall pull down the pillars of your
          tabernacle, and you must fall and be destroyed -- and great shall be
          the ruin. May God give you grace that you may be consecrated to
          Christ; so that living or dying, you may rejoice in him, and may share
          with him the glory of his Father.<br />
