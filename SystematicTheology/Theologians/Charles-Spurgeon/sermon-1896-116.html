          4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.5. They
          have a mouth, but they do not speak: they have eyes and see not: 6.
          They have ears, and do not hear: they have noses, and smell not: 7.
          They have hands, and feel not: they have feet, and walk not: they do
          not speak through their throat. 8. Those that make them shall be like
          unto them; and all those who trust to them.

          4 Their idols This contrast is introduced for the purpose of
          confirming the faith of the godly, by which they repose upon God
          alone; because, excepting him, all that the minds of men imagine of
          divinity is the invention of folly and delusion. To know the error and
          the madness of the world certainly contributes in no small degree to
          the confirmation of true godliness; while, on the other hand, a God is
          presented to us, whom we know assuredly to be the maker of heaven and
          earth, and whom we are to worship, not without reason or at random.
          The more effectually to silence the arrogance of the ungodly, who
          proudly presume to set at nought God and his chosen people, he
          contemptuously ridicules their false gods, first calling them idols,
          that is to say, things of nought, and, next, showing from their being
          formed of inanimate materials, that they are destitute of life and
          feeling. For can there be anything more absurd than to expect
          assistance from them, since neither the materials of which they are
          formed, nor the form which is given to them by the hand of men,
          possess the smallest portion of divinity so as to command respect for
          them? At the same time, the prophet tacitly indicates that the value
          of the material does not invest the idols with more excellence so that
          they deserve to be more highly esteemed. Hence the passage may be
          translated adversatively, thus, Though they are of gold and silver,
          yet they are not gods, because they are the work of men's hands. Had
          it been his intention merely to depreciate the substance of which they
          were composed, he would rather have called them wood and stone, but at
          present he speaks only of gold and silver. In the meantime, the
          prophet reminds us that nothing is more unbecoming than for men to say
          that they can impart either essence, or form, or honor to a god, since
          they themselves are dependent upon another for that life which will
          soon disappear. From this it follows, that the heathen vainly boast of
          receiving help from gods of their own devising. Whence does idolatry
          take its origin but from the imaginations of men? Having abundance of
          materials supplied to their hand, they can make of their gold or
          silver, not only a goblet or some other kind of vessel, but also
          vessels for meaner purposes, but they prefer making a god. And what
          can be more absurd than to convert a lifeless mass into some new
          deity? Besides, the prophet satirically adds, that while the heathen
          fashion members for their idols, they cannot enable them to move or
          use them. It is on this account that the faithful experience their
          privilege to be the more valuable, in that the only true God is on
          their side, and because they are well assured that all the heathen
          vainly boast of the aid which they expect from their idols, which are
          nothing but shadows.

          This is a doctrine, however, which ought to receive a greater latitude
          of meaning; for from it we learn, generally, that it is foolish to
          seek God under outward images, which have no resemblance or relation
          to his celestial glory. To this principle we must still adhere,
          otherwise it would be easy for the heathen to complain that they were
          unjustly condemned, because, though they make for themselves idols
          upon earth, they yet were persuaded that God is in heaven. They did
          not imagine that Jupiter was either composed of stone, or of gold, or
          of earth, but that he was merely represented under these similitudes.
          Whence originated this form of address common among the ancient
          Romans, "To make supplication before the gods," but because they
          believed the images to be, as it were, the representations of the
          gods? The Sicilians, says Cicero, have no gods before whom they can
          present their supplications. He would not have spoken in this
          barbarous style, had the notion not been prevalent, that the figures
          of the heavenly deities were represented to them in brass, or silver,
          or in marble; and cherishing the notion, that in approaching these
          images the gods were nearer to them, the prophet justly exposes this
          ridiculous fancy, that they would enclose the Deity within corruptible
          representations, since nothing is more foreign to the nature of God
          than to dwell under stone, or a piece of marble, or wood, and stock of
          a tree, or brass, or silver. For this reason, the prophet Habakkuk
          designates that gross mode of worshipping God, the school of
          falsehood. (Habakkuk 2:18.) Moreover, the scornful manner in which he
          speaks of their gods deserves to be noticed, they have a mouth, but
          they do not speak; for why do we betake ourselves to God, but from the
          conviction that we are dependent upon him for life; that our safety is
          in him, and that the abundance of good, and the power to help us, are
          with him? As these images are senseless and motionless, what can be
          more absurd than to ask from them that of which they themselves are
          destitute?

          8 They who make them shall be like unto them. Many are of opinion that
          this is an imprecation, and hence translate the future tense in the
          optative mood, may they become like unto them But it will be equally
          appropriate to regard it as the language of ridicule, as if the
          prophet should affirm that the idolaters are equally stupid with the
          stocks and stones themselves. And he deservedly severely reprehends
          men naturally endued with understanding, because they divest
          themselves of reason and judgment, and even of common sense. For those
          who ask life from things which are lifeless, do they not endeavor to
          the utmost of their power to extinguish all the light of reason? In a
          word, were they possessed of a particle of common sense, they would
          not attribute the properties of deity to the works of their own hands,
          to which they could impart no sensation or motion. And surely this
          consideration alone should suffice to remove the plea of ignorance,
          their making false gods for themselves in opposition to the plain
          dictates of natural reason. As the legitimate effect of this, they are
          willfully blind, envelop themselves in darkness, and become stupid;
          and this renders them altogether inexcusable, so that they cannot
          pretend that their error is the result of pious zeal. And I have no
          doubt that it was the prophet's intention to remove every cause and
          color of ignorance, inasmuch as mankind spontaneously become stupid.

          Whosoever trusteth in them. The reason why God holds images so much in
          abhorrence appears very plainly from this, that he cannot endure that
          the worship due to himself should be taken from him and given to them.
          That the world should acknowledge him to be the sole author of
          salvation, and should ask for and expect from him alone all that is
          needed, is an honor which peculiarly belongs to him. And, therefore,
          as often as confidence is reposed in any other than in himself, he is
          deprived of the worship which is due to him, and his majesty is, as it
          were, annihilated. The prophet inveighs against this profanity, even
          as in many passages the indignation of God is compared to jealousy,
          when he beholds idols and false gods receiving the homage of which he
          has been deprived, (Exodus 34:14; Deuteronomy 5:9) If a man carve an
          image of marble, wood, or brass, or if he cast one of gold or silver,
          this of itself would not be so detestable a thing; but when men
          attempt to attach God to their inventions, and to make him, as it
          were, descend from heaven, then a pure fiction is substituted in his
          place. It is very true that God's glory is instantly counterfeited
          when it is invested with a corruptible form; ("To whom hast thou
          likened me?" he exclaims by Isaiah 40:25, and 46:5, and the Scripture
          abounds with such texts;) nevertheless, he is doubly injured when his
          truth, and grace, and power, are imagined to be concentrated in idols.
          To make idols, and then to confide in them, are things which are
          almost inseparable. Else whence is it that the world so strongly
          desires gods of stone, or of wood, or of clay, or of any earthly
          material, were it not that they believe that God is far from them,
          until they hold him fixed to them by some bond? Averse to seek God in
          a spiritual manner, they therefore pull him down from his throne, and
          place him under inanimate things. Thus it comes to pass, that they
          address their supplications to images, because they imagine that in
          them God's ears, and also his eyes and hands, are near to them. I have
          observed that these two vices can hardly be severed, namely, that
          those who, in forging idols, change the truth of God into a lie, must
          also ascribe something of divinity to them. When the prophet says that
          unbelievers put their trust in idols, his design, as I formerly
          noticed, was to condemn this as the chief and most detestable piece of
          profanity.<br />
