          1. Inasmuch, therefore, as the opinions of certain [orthodox persons]
          are derived from heretical discourses, they are both ignorant of God's
          dispensations, and of the mystery of the resurrection of the just, and
          of the [earthly] kingdom which is the commencement of incorruption, by
          means of which kingdom those who shall be worthy are accustomed
          gradually to partake of the divine nature (capere Deum ); and it is
          necessary to tell them respecting those things, that it behoves the
          righteous first to receive the promise of the inheritance which God
          promised to the fathers, and to reign in it, when they rise again to
          behold God in this creation which is renovated, and that the judgment
          should take place afterwards. For it is just that in that very
          creation in which they toiled or were afflicted, being proved in every
          way by suffering, they should receive the reward of their suffering;
          and that in the creation in which they were slain because of their
          love to God, in that they should be revived again; and that in the
          creation in which they endured servitude, in that they should reign.
          For God is rich in all things, and all things are His. It is fitting,
          therefore, that the creation itself, being restored to its primeval
          condition, should without restraint be under the dominion of the
          righteous; and the apostle has made this plain in the Epistle to the
          Romans, when he thus speaks: "For the expectation of the creature
          waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature has
          been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
          subjected the same in hope; since the creature itself shall also be
          delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of
          the sons of God."

          2. Thus, then, the promise of God, which He gave to Abraham, remains
          stedfast. For thus He said: "Lift up thine eyes, and look from this
          place where now thou art, towards the north and south, and east and
          west. For all the earth which thou seest, I will give to thee and to
          thy seed, even for ever." And again He says, "Arise, and go through
          the length and breadth of the land, since I will give it unto thee;"
          and [yet] he did not receive an inheritance in it, not even a
          footstep, but was always a stranger and a pilgrim therein. And upon
          the death of Sarah his wife, when the Hittites were willing to bestow
          upon him a place where he might bury her, he declined it as a gift,
          but bought the burying-place (giving for it four hundred talents of
          silver) from Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite. Thus did he await
          patiently the promise of God, and was unwilling to appear to receive
          from men, what God had promised to give him, when He said again to him
          as follows: "I will give this land to thy seed, from the river of
          Egypt even unto the great river Euphrates." If, then, God promised him
          the inheritance of the land, yet he did not receive it during all the
          time of his sojourn there, it must be, that together with his seed,
          that is, those who fear God and believe in Him, he shall receive it at
          the resurrection of the just. For his seed is the Church, which
          receives the adoption to God through the Lord, as John the Baptist
          said: "For God is able from the stones to raise up children to
          Abraham." Thus also the apostle says in the Epistle to the Galatians:
          "But ye, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of the promise." And
          again, in the same Epistle, he plainly declares that they who have
          believed in Christ do receive Christ, the promise to Abraham thus
          saying, "The promises were spoken to Abraham, and to his seed. Now He
          does not say, And of seeds, as if [He spake] of many, but as of one,
          And to thy seed, which is Christ." And again, confirming his former
          words, he says, "Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to
          him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith
          are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God
          would justify the heathen through faith, declared to Abraham
          beforehand, That in thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they
          which are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham." Thus,
          then, they who are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham,
          and these are the children of Abraham. Now God made promise of the
          earth to Abraham and his seed; yet neither Abraham nor his seed, that
          is, those who are justified by faith, do now receive any inheritance
          in it; but they shall receive it at the resurrection of the just. For
          God is true and faithful; and on this account He said, "Blessed are
          the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
