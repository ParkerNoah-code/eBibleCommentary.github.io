          1. All things therefore are of one and the same substance, that is,
          from one and the same God; as also the Lord says to the disciples
          |Therefore every scribe, which is instructed unto the kingdom of
          heaven, is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth
          forth out of his treasure things new and old.| He did not teach that
          he who brought forth the old was one, and he that brought forth the
          new, another; but that they were one and the same. For the Lord is the
          good man of the house, who rules the entire house of His Father; and
          who delivers a law suited both for slaves and those who are as yet
          undisciplined; and gives fitting precepts to those that are free, and
          have been justified by faith, as well as throws His own inheritance
          open to those that are sons. And He called His disciples |scribes| and
          |teachers of the kingdom of heaven;| of whom also He elsewhere says to
          the Jews: |Behold, I send unto you wise men, and scribes, and
          teachers; and some of them ye shall kill, and persecute from city to
          city.| Now, without contradiction, He means by those things which are
          brought forth from the treasure new and old, the two covenants; the
          old, that giving of the law which took place formerly; and He points
          out as the new, that manner of life required by the Gospel, of which
          David says, |Sing unto the Lord a new song;| and Esaias, |Sing unto
          the Lord a new hymn. His beginning (initium), His name is glorified
          from the height of the earth: they declare His powers in the isles.|
          And Jeremiah says: |Behold, I will make a new covenant, not as I made
          with your fathers| in Mount Horeb. But one and the same householder
          produced both covenants, the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who
          spake with both Abraham and Moses, and who has restored us anew to
          liberty, and has multiplied that grace which is from Himself.
        </p>

          2. He declares: |For in this place is One greater than the temple.|
          But [the words] greater and less are not applied to those things which
          have nothing in common between themselves, and are of an opposite
          nature, and mutually repugnant; but are used in the case of those of
          the same substance, and which possess properties in common, but merely
          differ in number and size; such as water from water, and light from
          light, and grace from grace. Greater, therefore, is that legislation
          which has been given in order to liberty than that given in order to
          bondage; and therefore it has also been diffused, not throughout one
          nation [only], but over the whole world. For one and the same Lord,
          who is greater than the temple, greater than Solomon, and greater than
          Jonah, confers gifts upon men, that is, His own presence, and the
          resurrection from the dead; but He does not change God, nor proclaim
          another Father, but that very same one, who always has more to measure
          out to those of His household. And as their love towards God
          increases, He bestows more and greater [gifts]; as also the Lord said
          to His disciples: |Ye shall see greater things than these.| And Paul
          declares: |Not that I have already attained, or that I am justified,
          or already have been made perfect. For we know in part, and we
          prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect has come, the things
          which are in part shall be done away.| As, therefore, when that which
          is perfect is come, we shall not see another Father, but Him whom we
          now desire to see (for |blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall
          see God| ); neither shall we look for another Christ and Son of God,
          but Him who [was born] of the Virgin Mary, who also suffered, in whom
          too we trust, and whom we love; as Esaias says: |And they shall say in
          that day, Behold our Lord God, in whom we have trusted, and we have
          rejoiced in our salvation;| and Peter says in his Epistle: |Whom, not
          seeing, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, ye have believed,
          ye shall rejoice with joy unspeakable;| neither do we receive another
          Holy Spirit, besides Him who is with us, and who cries, |Abba,
          Father;| and we shall make increase in the very same things [as now],
          and shall make progress, so that no longer through a glass, or by
          means of enigmas, but face to face, we shall enjoy the gifts of God;
          -- so also now, receiving more than the temple, and more than Solomon,
          that is, the advent of the Son of God, we have not been taught another
          God besides the Framer and the Maker of all, who has been pointed out
          to us from the beginning; nor another Christ, the Son of God, besides
          Him who was foretold by the prophets.

          3. For the new covenant having been known and preached by the
          prophets, He who was to carry it out according to the good pleasure of
          the Father was also preached, having been revealed to men as God
          pleased; that they might always make progress through believing in
          Him, and by means of the [successive] covenants, should gradually
          attain to perfect salvation. For there is one salvation and one God;
          but the precepts which form the man are numerous, and the steps which
          lead man to God are not a few. It is allowable for an earthly and
          temporal king, though he is [but] a man, to grant to his subjects
          greater advantages at times: shall not this then be lawful for God,
          since He is [ever] the same, and is always willing to confer a greater
          [degree of] grace upon the human race, and to honour continually with
          many gifts those who please Him? But if this be to make progress,
          [namely,] to find out another Father besides Him who was preached from
          the beginning; and again, besides him who is imagined to have been
          discovered in the second place, to find out a third other, -- then the
          progress of this man will consist in his also proceeding from a third
          to a fourth; and from this, again, to another and another: and thus he
          who thinks that he is always making progress of such a kind, will
          never rest in one God. For, being driven away from Him who truly is
          [God], and being turned backwards, he shall be for ever seeking, yet
          shall never find out God; but shall continually swim in an abyss
          without limits, unless, being converted by repentance, he return to
          the place from which he had been cast out, confessing one God, the
          Father, the Creator, and believing [in Him] who was declared by the
          law and the prophets, who was borne witness to by Christ, as He did
          Himself declare to those who were accusing His disciples of not
          observing the tradition of the elders: |Why do ye make void the law of
          God by reason of your tradition? For God said, Honour thy father and
          mother; and, Whosoever curseth father or mother, let him die the
          death.| And again, He says to them a second time: |And ye have made
          void the word of God by reason of your tradition;| Christ confessing
          in the plainest manner Him to be Father and God, who said in the law,
          |Honour thy father and mother; that it may be well with thee.| For the
          true God did confess the commandment of the law as the word of God,
          and called no one else God besides His own Father.<br />
