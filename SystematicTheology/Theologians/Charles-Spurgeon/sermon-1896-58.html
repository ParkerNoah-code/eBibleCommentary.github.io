          27. All things wait upon thee, that thou mayest give them food in
          their season.28. Thou shalt give it to them, and they shall gather it:
          thou shalt open thy hand, and they shall be filled [or satiated] with
          good.29. Thou shalt hide thy face, and they shall be afraid: thou
          shalt take away their spirit, and they shall die, and return to their
          dust.30. Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created:
          and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
        </p>

          27. All these wait upon thee The prophet here again describes God as
          acting the part of the master of a household, and a foster-father
          towards all sorts of living creatures, by providing liberally for
          them. He had said before, that God made food to grow on the mountains
          for the support of cattle, and that sustenance is ministered to the
          very lions by the hand of the same God, although they live upon prey.
          Now he amplifies this wonder of the divine beneficence by an
          additional circumstance. While the different species of living
          creatures are almost innumerable, and the number in each species is so
          great, there is yet not one of them which does not stand in need of
          daily food. The meaning then of the expression, All things wait upon
          thee, is, that they could not continue in existence even for a few
          days, unless God were to supply their daily need, and to nourish each
          of them in particular. We thus see why there is so great a diversity
          of fruits; for God assigns and appoints to each species of living
          creatures the food suitable and proper for them. The brute beasts are
          not indeed endued with reason and judgment to seek the supply of their
          wants from God, but stooping towards the earth, they seek to fill
          themselves with food; still the prophet speaks with propriety, when he
          represents them as waiting upon God; for their hunger must be relieved
          by his bounty, else they would soon die. Nor is the specification of
          the season when God furnishes them with food superfluous, since God
          lays up in store for them, that they may have the means of sustenance
          during the whole course of the year. As the earth in winter shuts up
          her bowels, what would become of them if he did not provide them with
          food for a long time? The miracle, then, is the greater from the
          circumstance, that God, by making the earth fruitful at stated
          seasons, extends in this way his blessing to the rest of the year
          which threatens us with hunger and famine. How wretched would we be
          when the earth in winter shuts up her riches, were not our hearts
          cheered with the hope of a new increase? In this sense, the Psalmist
          appropriately affirms, that God opens his hand If wheat should grow up
          daily, God's providence would not be so manifest. But when the earth
          becomes barren, it is as if God shut his hand. Whence it follows, that
          when he makes it fruitful, he, so to speak, stretches out his hand
          from heaven to give us food. Now if he supply wild and brute beasts
          with sustenance in due season, by which they are fed to the full, his
          blessing will doubtless be to us as an inexhaustible source of plenty,
          provided we ourselves do not hinder it from flowing to us by our
          unbelief.

          29 Thou shalt hide thy face, and they shall be afraid In these words,
          the Psalmist declares, that we stand or fall according to the will of
          God. We continue to live, so long as he sustains us by his power; but
          no sooner does he withdraw his life-giving spirit than we die. Even
          Plato knew this, who so often teaches that, properly speaking, there
          is but one God, and that all things subsist, or have their being only
          in him. Nor do I doubt, that it was the will of God, by means of that
          heathen writer, to awaken all men to the knowledge, that they derive
          their life from another source than from themselves. In the first
          place, the Psalmist asserts, that if God hide his face they are
          afraid; and, secondly, that if he take away their spirit they die, and
          return to their dust; by which words he points out, that when God
          vouchsafes to look upon us, that look gives us life, and that as long
          as his serene countenance shines, it inspires all the creatures with
          life. Our blindness then is doubly inexcusable, if we do not on our
          part cast our eyes upon that goodness which gives life to the whole
          world. The prophet describes step by step the destruction of living
          creatures, upon God's withdrawing from them his secret energy, that
          from the contrast he may the better commend that continued
          inspiration, by which all things are maintained in life and rigor. He
          could have gone farther, and have asserted, that all things, unless
          upheld in being by God, would return to nothing; but he was content
          with affirming in general and popular language, that whatever is not
          cherished by Him falls into corruption. He again declares, that the
          world is daily renewed, because God sends forth his spirit In the
          propagation of living creatures, we doubtless see continually a new
          creation of the world. In now calling that God's spirit, which he
          before represented as the spirit of living creatures, there is no
          contradiction. God sendeth forth that spirit which remains with him
          whither he pleases; and as soon as he has sent it forth, all things
          are created. In this way, what was his own he makes to be ours. But
          this gives no countenance to the old dream of the Manicheeans, which
          that filthy dog Servetus has made still worse in our own day. The
          Manicheeans said that the soul of man is a particle of the Divine
          Spirit, and is propagated from it as the shoot of a tree; but this
          base man has had the audacity to assert, that oxen, asses, and dogs,
          are parts of the divine essence. The Manichees at least had this
          pretext for their error, that the soul was created after the image of
          God; but to maintain this with respect to swine and cattle, is in the
          highest degree monstrous and detestable. Nothing was farther from the
          prophet's intention, than to divide the spirit of God into parts, so
          that a portion of it should dwell essentially in every living
          creature. But he termed that the spirit of God which proceeds from
          him. By the way, he instructs us, that it is ours, because it is given
          us, that it may quicken us. The amount of what is stated is, that when
          we see the world daily decaying, and daily renewed, the life-giving
          power of God is reflected to us herein as in a mirror. All the deaths
          which take place among living creatures, are just so many examples of
          our nothingness, so to speak; and when others are produced and grow up
          in their room, we have in that presented to us a renewal of the world.
          Since then the world daily dies, and is daily renewed in its various
          parts, the manifest conclusion is, that it subsists only by a secret
          virtue derived from God.<br />
