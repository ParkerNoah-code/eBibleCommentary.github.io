 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p>SUBJECT AND DIVISION.</p>
<p>Moses sings of the frailty of man, and the shortness of life, contrasting 
    therewith the eternity of God, and founding thereon earnest appeals for 
    compassion. The only division which will be useful separates the 
    contemplation Ps 90:1-11 from the Ps 90:12-17 there is indeed no need to 
    make even this break, for the unity is well preserved throughout.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all 
    generations. </p></b>We must consider the whole Psalm as written for the tribes 
    in the desert, and then we shall see the primary meaning of each verse. 
    Moses, in effect, says: <i>wanderers though we be in the howling 
    wilderness—yet we find a home in you</i>, even as our forefathers did when 
    they came out of Ur of the Chaldees and dwelt in tents among the Canaanites. 
    To the saints the Lord Jehovah, the self existent God, stands instead of 
    mansion and rooftree; he shelters, comforts, protects, preserves, and 
    cherishes all his own. Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have 
    nests—but the saints dwell in their God, and have always done so in all 
    ages. Not in the tabernacle or the temple do we dwell—but <i>in God himself</i>; 
    and this we have always done since there was a church in the world. We have 
    not shifted our abode. 
<p align="justify">Kings' palaces have vanished beneath the crumbling hand 
    of time—they have been burned with fire and buried beneath mountains of 
    ruins—but the imperial race of Heaven has never lost its regal habitation. 
    Go to the Palatine and see how the Caesars are forgotten of the halls which 
    echoed to their despotic mandates, and resounded with the plaudits of the 
    nations over which they ruled, and then look upward and see in the ever 
    living Jehovah the divine home of the faithful, untouched by so much as the 
    finger of decay. Where dwelt our fathers a hundred generations since, there 
    dwell we still. </p>
<p align="justify">It is of New Testament saints that the Holy Spirit has 
    said, "He who keeps his commandments dwells in God and God in him!" It was a 
    divine mouth which said, "Abide in me", and then added, "he who abides in me 
    and I in him the same brings forth much fruit." It is most sweet to speak 
    with the Lord as Moses did, saying, "Lord, you are our dwelling place", and 
    it is wise to draw from the Lord's eternal condescension reasons for 
    expecting present and future mercies, as the Psalmist did in the next Psalm 
    wherein he describes the safety of those who dwell in God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Before the mountains were brought forth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Before those elder giants had struggled forth from 
    nature's womb, as her dread firstborn, the Lord was glorious and self 
    sufficient. Mountains to him, though hoar with the snows of ages, are but 
    new born babes, young things whose birth was but yesterday, mere novelties 
    of an hour. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Or before you had formed the earth and the world. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here too the allusion is to a birth. Earth was born but 
    the other day, and her solid land was delivered from the flood but a short 
    while ago. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or, "you are, O God." God was, when nothing else was. He 
    was God when the earth was not a world but a chaos, when mountains were not 
    upheaved, and the generation of the heavens and the earth had not commenced. 
    In this Eternal One there is a safe abode for the successive generations of 
    men. If God himself were of yesterday, he would not be a suitable refuge for 
    mortal men; if he could change and cease to be God he would be but an 
    uncertain dwelling place for his people.<i> The eternal existence of God is 
    here mentioned to set forth, by contrast, the brevity of human life.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. You turn man back to dust. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Man's body is resolved into its elements, and is as 
    though it had been crushed and ground to powder. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And say, Return, you children of men.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">That is, return even to the dust out of which you were 
    taken<i>. The frailty of man is thus forcibly set forth; God creates him out 
    of the dust, and back to dust he goes at the word of his Creator. God 
    resolves and man dissolves. A word created and a word destroys</i>. Observe 
    how the action of God is recognized; man is not said to die because of the 
    decree of fate, or the action of inevitable law—but the Lord is made the 
    agent of all, his hand turns and his voice speaks; without these we would 
    not die, no power on earth or Hell could kill us.</p>
<p align="justify">"An angel's arm cannot save me from the grave,<br/>
 Myriads of angels cannot confine me there."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. For a thousand years in your sight are but as 
    yesterday when it is past.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">A thousand years! This is a long stretch of time. How 
    much may be crowded into it—the rise and fall of empires, the glory and 
    obliteration of dynasties, the beginning and the end of elaborate systems of 
    human philosophy, and countless events, all important to household and 
    individual, which elude the pens of historians. Yet this period, which might 
    even be called the limit of modern history, and is in human language almost 
    identical with an indefinite length of time, is to the Lord as nothing, even 
    as time already gone. A moment yet to come is longer than "yesterday when it 
    is past", for that no longer exists at all—yet such is a chiliad to the 
    eternal. In comparison with eternity, the most lengthened reaches of time 
    are mere points, there is in fact, no possible comparison between them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And as a watch in the night.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A time which is no sooner come than gone. There is scarce 
    time enough in a thousand years for the angels to change watches; when their 
    millennium of service is almost over it seems as though the watch were newly 
    set. <i>We are dreaming through the long night of time—but God is ever 
    keeping watch, and a thousand years are as nothing to him. </i>A host of 
    days and nights must be combined to make up a thousand years to us—but to 
    God, that space of time does not make up a whole night—but only a brief 
    portion of it. <i>If a thousand years be to God as a single night watch, 
    what must be the life time of the Eternal!</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. You carry them away as with a flood. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As when a torrent rushes down the river bed and bears all 
    before it, so does the Lord bear away by death the following generations of 
    men. As the hurricane sweeps the clouds from the sky, so time removes the 
    children of men. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They are as a sleep. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Before God men must appear as unreal as the dreams of the 
    night, the phantoms of sleep. Not only are our plans and devices like a 
    sleep—but we ourselves are such. "We are such stuff as dreams are made of."
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In the morning they are like grass which grows up. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As grass is green in the morning and hay at night, so men 
    are changed from health to corruption in a few hours. We are not cedars, or 
    oaks—but only poor grass, which is vigorous in the spring—but lasts not a 
    summer through. <i>What is there upon earth more frail than we!</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Blooming with abounding beauty until the meadows are all 
    besprent with gems, the grass has a golden hour, even as man in his youth 
    has a heyday of flowery glory. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In the evening it is cut down, and withers. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The scythe ends the blossoming of the field flowers, and 
    the dews at flight weep their fall. Here is the history of the grass—sown, 
    grown, blown, mown, gone; and the history of man is not much more. Natural 
    decay would put an end both to us and the grass in due time; few, however, 
    are left to experience the full result of old age, for death comes with his 
    scythe, and removes our life in the midst of its verdure. How great a change 
    in how short a time! <i>The morning saw the blooming, and the evening sees 
    the withering.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. For we are consumed by your anger. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This mortality is not accidental, neither was it 
    inevitable in the original of our nature—but sin has provoked the Lord to 
    anger, and therefore thus we die. </p>
<p align="justify">This is the scythe which mows and the scorching heat 
    which withers. This was specially the case in reference to the people in the 
    wilderness, whose lives were cut short by justice on account of their 
    waywardness; <i>they failed, not by a natural decline—but through the blast 
    of the well deserved judgments of God. </i>It must have been a very mournful 
    sight to Moses to see the whole nation melt away during the forty years of 
    their pilgrimage, until none remained of all that came out of Egypt. </p>
<p align="justify">As God's favor is life, so his anger is death; <i>as well 
    might grass grow in an oven as men flourish when the Lord is angry with 
    them. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And by your wrath are we troubled.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or terror stricken. A sense of divine anger confounded 
    them, so that they lived as men who knew that they were doomed. This is true 
    of us in a measure—but not altogether, for now that immortality and life are 
    brought to light by the gospel, death has changed its aspect, and, to 
    believers in Jesus, it is no more a judicial execution. Anger and wrath are 
    the sting of death, and in these believers have no share; love and mercy now 
    conduct us to glory by the way of the tomb. </p>
<p align="justify">It is not fitting to read these words at a Christian's 
    funeral without words of explanation, and a distinct endeavor to show how 
    little they belong to believers in Jesus, and how far we are privileged 
    beyond those with whom he was not well pleased.</p>
<p align="justify">Whose carcasses fell in the wilderness. To apply an ode, 
    written by the leader of the legal dispensation under circumstances of 
    peculiar judgment, in reference to a people under penal censure, to those 
    who fall asleep in Jesus, seems to be the height of blundering. We may learn 
    much from it—but we ought not to misapply it by taking to ourselves, as the 
    beloved of the Lord, that which was chiefly true of those to whom God had 
    sworn in his wrath that they would not enter into his rest. </p>
<p align="justify">When, however, a soul is under conviction of sin, the 
    language of this Psalm is highly appropriate to his case, and will naturally 
    suggest itself to the distracted mind. <i>No fire consumes like God's anger, 
    and no anguish so troubles the heart as his wrath. </i>Blessed be that dear 
    substitute,</p>
<p align="justify">"Who bore that we might never bear<br/>
 His Father's righteous ire."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. You have set our iniquities before you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Hence these tears! Sin seen by God must work death; it is 
    only by the covering blood of atonement that life comes to any of us. When 
    God was overthrowing the tribes in the wilderness he had their iniquities 
    before him, and therefore dealt with them in severity. He could not have 
    their iniquities before him, and not smite them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Our secret sins in the fight of your countenance. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There are no secrets before God; he unearths man's hidden 
    things, and exposes them to the light. There can be no more powerful 
    luminary than the face of God, yet, in that strong light, the Lord set the 
    hidden sins of Israel. Sunlight can never be compared with the light of him 
    who made the sun, of whom it is written, "God is light, and in him is no 
    darkness at all."</p>
<p align="justify">If by his countenance is here meant his love and favor, 
    it is not possible for the heinousness of sin to be more clearly manifested 
    than when it is seen to involve ingratitude to one so infinitely good and 
    kind. Rebellion in the light of justice is black—but in the light of love it 
    is devilish. How can we grieve so good a God? </p>
<p align="justify">The children of Israel had been brought out of Egypt with 
    a high hand, fed in the wilderness with a liberal hand, and guided with a 
    tender hand, and their sins were peculiarly atrocious. </p>
<p align="justify">We, too, having been redeemed by the blood of Jesus, and 
    saved by abounding grace, will be truly guilty if we forsake the Lord. What 
    manner of persons ought we to be? How ought we to pray for cleansing from 
    secret faults? <i>It is to us a wellspring of delights to remember that our 
    sins, as believers are now cast behind the Lord's back, and shall never be 
    brought to light again: </i>therefore we live, because, the guilt being 
    removed, the death penalty is removed also.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. For all our days are passed away in your wrath.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Justice shortened the days of rebellious Israel; each 
    halting place became a graveyard; they marked their march by the tombs they 
    left behind them. Because of the penal sentence their days were dried up, 
    and their lives wasted away. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">We spend our years as a tale that is told. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Yes, not their days only—but their years flew by them 
    like a thought, swift as a meditation, rapid and idle as a gossip's story. 
    Sin had cast a shadow over all things, and made the lives of the dying 
    wanderers to be both vain and brief. </p>
<p align="justify">The first sentence is not intended for believers to 
    quote, as though it applied to themselves, for our days are all passed amid 
    the loving-kindness of the Lord, even as David says in the Psalm 23:6 
    "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life." </p>
<p align="justify">Neither is the life of the gracious man unsubstantial as 
    a story teller's tale; he lives in Jesus, he has the divine Spirit within 
    him, and to him "life is real, life is earnest"—the simile only holds good 
    if we consider that a holy life is rich in interest, full of wonders, 
    chequered with many changes—yet as easily ordered by providence as an author 
    arranges the details of the story with which he beguiles the hour. <i>Our 
    lives are illustrations of heavenly goodness, parables of divine wisdom, 
    poems of sacred thought, and records of infinite love</i>; happy are we 
    whose lives are such tales.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. The days of our years are threescore years and 
    ten. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Moses himself lived longer than this—but his was the 
    exception not the rule: in his day life had come to be very much the same in 
    duration as it is with us. This is brevity itself compared with the men of 
    the elder time; it is nothing when contrasted with eternity.<i> Yet is life 
    long enough for virtue and piety, and all too long for vice and blasphemy.
    </i>Moses here in the original writes in a disconnected manner, as if he 
    would set forth the utter insignificance of man's hurried existence. His 
    words may be rendered, "The days of our years! In them seventy years"—as 
    much as to say, "The days of our years? What about them? Are they worth 
    mentioning? The account is utterly insignificant, their full tally is but 
    seventy."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years—yet 
    is their strength labor and sorrow. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The unusual strength which overleaps the bound of 
    threescore and ten, only lands the aged man in a region where life is a 
    weariness and a woe. <i>The strength of old age, its very prime and pride, 
    are but labor and sorrow; what must its weakness be? </i>What panting for 
    breath! What toiling to move! What a failing of the senses! What a crushing 
    sense of weakness! The evil days are come and the years wherein a man cries, 
    "I have no pleasure in them." The grasshopper has become a burden and desire 
    fails. Such is old age. </p>
<p align="justify">Yet mellowed by hallowed experience, and solaced by 
    immortal hopes, the latter days of aged Christians are not so much to be 
    pitied as envied. The sun is setting and the heat of the day is over—but 
    sweet is the calm and cool of the eventide: and the fair day melts away, not 
    into a dark and dreary night—but into a glorious, unclouded, eternal day!</p>
<p align="justify">The mortal fades to make room for the immortal; the old 
    man falls asleep to wake up in the region of perennial youth. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The cable is broken and the vessel sails upon the sea of 
    eternity. The chain is snapped and the eagle mounts to its native air above 
    the clouds. Moses mourned for men as he thus sung: and well he might, as all 
    his comrades fell at his side. His words are more nearly rendered, "He 
    drives us fast and we fly away;" as the quail were blown along by the strong 
    west wind, so are men hurried before the tempests of death. To us, however, 
    as believers, the winds are favorable; they bear us as the gales bear the 
    swallows away from the wintry realms, to lands</p>
<p align="justify">"Where everlasting spring abides<br/>
 And never withering flowers."</p>
<p align="justify">Who wishes it to be otherwise? Why should we linger here?<i> 
    What has this poor world to offer us that we should tarry on its shores? 
    Away, away! This is not our rest. Heavenward, He! </i>Let the Lord's winds 
    drive fast if so he ordains, for they waft us the more swiftly to himself, 
    and our own dear country.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Who knows the power of your anger?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Moses saw men dying all around him: he lived among 
    funerals, and was overwhelmed at the terrible results of the divine 
    displeasure. He felt that none could measure the might of the Lord's wrath.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Even according to your fear, so is your wrath.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Godly men dread that wrath beyond conception—but they 
    never ascribe too much terror to it: bad men are dreadfully convulsed when 
    they awake to a sense of it—but their horror is not greater than it had need 
    be, for it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an angry God. </p>
<p align="justify">Holy Scripture when it depicts God's wrath against sin 
    never uses a hyperbole; it would be impossible to exaggerate it. Whatever 
    feelings of pious awe and holy trembling may move the tender heart, it is 
    never too much moved; apart from other considerations the great truth of the 
    divine anger, when most powerfully felt, never impresses the mind with a 
    solemnity in excess of the legitimate result of such a contemplation. </p>
<p align="justify">What the power of God's anger is in Hell, and what it 
    would be on earth, were it not in mercy restrained, no man living can 
    rightly conceive. Modern thinkers rail at Milton and Dante, Bunyan and 
    Baxter, for their terrible imagery; but the truth is that no vision of poet, 
    or denunciation of holy seer, can ever reach to the dread height of this 
    great argument, much less go beyond it. </p>
<p align="justify">The wrath to come has its horrors rather diminished than 
    enhanced in description by the dark lines of human imagination; it baffles 
    words, it leaves imagination far behind. </p>
<p align="justify">Beware you who forget God lest he tear you in pieces and 
    there be none to deliver. God is terrible out of his holy places. Remember 
    Sodom and Gomorrah! Remember Korah and his company! Mark well the graves of 
    lust in the wilderness! Nay, rather bethink you of the place where their 
    worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched!<i> Who is able to stand 
    against this justly angry God? </i>Who will dare to rush upon the bosses of 
    his buckler, or test the edge of his sword? <i>Be it ours to submit 
    ourselves as dying sinners to this eternal God, who can, even at this 
    moment, command us to the dust, and thence to Hell.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. So teach us to number our days.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Instruct us to set store by time, mourning for that time
    <i>past </i>wherein we have wrought the will of the flesh, using diligently 
    the time <i>present</i>, which is the accepted hour and the day of 
    salvation, and reckoning the time which lies in the <i>future </i>to be too 
    uncertain to allow us safely to delay any gracious work or prayer. 
    Numeration is a child's exercise in arithmetic—but in order to number their 
    days aright the best of men need the Lord's teaching. We are more anxious to 
    count the stars than our days, and yet the latter is by far more practical.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Men are led by reflections upon the brevity of time to 
    give their earnest attention to eternal things; they become humble as they 
    look into the grave which is so soon to be their bed, their passions cool in 
    the presence of mortality, and they yield themselves up to the dictates of 
    unerring wisdom</p></i>; but this is only the case when the Lord himself is the 
    teacher; he alone can teach to real and lasting profit. 
<p align="justify">Thus Moses prayed that the dispensations of justice might 
    be sanctified in mercy. "The law is our school master to bring us to 
    Christ", when the Lord himself speaks by the law. It is most fit that the 
    heart which will so soon cease to beat should while it moves be regulated by 
    wisdom's hand.<i> A short life should be wisely spent. We have not enough 
    time at our disposal to justify us in misspending a single quarter of an 
    hour</i>. Neither are we sure of enough life to justify us in 
    procrastinating for a moment. If we were wise in heart we should see 
    this—but mere head-knowledge will not guide us aright.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. Relent, O LORD, how long?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Come in mercy, to us again. Do not leave us to perish. Do 
    not allow our lives to be both brief and bitter. You have said to us, 
    "Return, O children of men", and now we humbly cry to you, "Return, O 
    preserver of men." Your presence alone can reconcile us to this transient 
    existence; turn unto us. As sin drives God from us, so repentance cries to 
    the Lord to return to us. When men are under chastisement they are allowed 
    to expostulate, and ask "how long?" Our fault in these times is not too 
    great boldness with God—but too much backwardness in pleading with him. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Have compassion on your servants. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Thus Moses acknowledges the Israelites to be God's 
    servants still. They had rebelled—but they had not utterly forsaken the 
    Lord; they owned their obligations to obey his will, and pleaded them as a 
    reason for pity. Will not a man spare his own servants? Though God smote 
    Israel—yet they were his people, and he had never disowned them, therefore 
    is he entreated to deal favorably with them. If they might not see the 
    promised land—yet he is begged to cheer them on the road with his mercy, and 
    to turn his frown into a smile. The prayer is like others which came from 
    the meek lawgiver when he boldly pleaded with God for the nation; it is 
    Moses-like. He here speaks with the Lord as a man speaks with his friend.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. O satisfy us early with your mercy. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Since they must die, and die so soon, the psalmist pleads 
    for speedy mercy upon himself and his brethren. <i>Godly men know how to 
    turn the darkest trials into arguments at the throne of grace. </i>He who 
    has but the heart to pray need never be without pleas in prayer. The only 
    satisfying food for the Lord's people is the favor of God; this Moses 
    earnestly seeks for, and as the manna fell in the morning he beseeches the 
    Lord to send at once his satisfying favor, that all through <i>the little 
    day of life </i>they might be filled therewith. </p>
<p align="justify">Are we so soon to die? Then, Lord, do not starve us while 
    we live. Satisfy us at once, we pray you. Our day is short and the night 
    hastens on, O give us in the early morning of our days to be satisfied with 
    your favor, that all through our little day we may be happy. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Being filled with divine love, their brief life on earth 
    would become a joyful festival, and would continue so as long as it lasted. 
    When the Lord refreshes us with his presence, our joy is such that no man 
    can take it from us. Apprehensions of speedy death are not able to distress 
    those who enjoy the present favor of God; though they know that the night 
    comes, they see nothing to fear in it—but continue to live while they live, 
    triumphing in the present favor of God and <i>leaving the future in his 
    loving hands. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Since the whole generation which came out of Egypt had 
    been doomed to die in the wilderness, they would naturally feel despondent, 
    and therefore their great leader seeks for them that blessing which, beyond 
    all others, consoles the heart, namely, the presence and favor of the Lord.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. Make us glad according to the days wherein you 
    have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">None can gladden the heart as you can, O Lord, therefore 
    as you have made us sad, be pleased to make us glad. Fill the other scale. 
    Proportion your dispensations. Give us the lamb, since you has sent us the 
    bitter herbs. Make our days as long as our nights. </p>
<p align="justify">The prayer is original, childlike, and full of meaning; 
    it is moreover based upon a great principle in providential goodness, by 
    which the Lord puts the good over against the evil in due measure. Great 
    trial enables us to bear great joy, and may be regarded as the herald of 
    extraordinary grace. </p>
<p align="justify">God's dealings are according to scale; small lives are 
    small throughout; and great histories are great both in sorrow and 
    happiness. Where there are high hills, there are also deep valleys. As God 
    provides the sea for leviathan, so does he find a pool for the minnow; in 
    the sea all things are in fit proportion for the mighty monster, while in 
    the little brook all things befit the tiny fish.</p>
<p align="justify">If we have fierce afflictions we may look for overflowing 
    delights, and our faith may boldly ask for them. God who is great in justice 
    when he chastens, will not be little in mercy when he blesses; he will be 
    great all through: let us appeal to him with unstaggering faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. Let your work appear unto your servants. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">See how he dwells upon that word servants. It is as far 
    as the law can go, and Moses goes to the full length permitted him. 
    Henceforth Jesus calls us not servants but friends, and if we are wise we 
    shall make full use of our wider liberty. Moses asks for displays of divine 
    power and providence conspicuously wrought, that all the people might be 
    cheered thereby. They could find no solace in their own faulty works—but in 
    the work of God they would find comfort. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And your glory unto their children. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">While their sons were growing up around them, they 
    desired to see some outshinings of the promised glory gleaming upon them. 
    Their sons were to inherit the land which had been given them by covenant, 
    and therefore they sought on their behalf some tokens of the coming good, 
    some morning dawnings of the approaching noonday. </p>
<p align="justify">How eagerly do godly men plead for their children. They 
    can bear very much personal affliction if they may but be sure that their 
    children will know the glory of God, and thereby be led to serve him. We are 
    content with the work, if our children may but see the glory which will 
    result from it: we sow joyfully, if they may reap.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon 
    us. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Even upon us who must not see your glory in the land of 
    Canaan; it shall suffice us if <i>in our characters the holiness of God is 
    reflected</i>, and if over all our camp the lovely excellencies of our God 
    shall cast a sacred beauty. <i>Sanctification should be the daily object of 
    our petitions. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And establish you the work of our hands upon us; yes, the 
    work of our hands establish it. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let what we do be done in truth, and last when we are in 
    the grave; may the work of the present generation minister permanently to 
    the building tip of the nation. Godly men are anxious not to work in vain. 
    They know that without the Lord they can do nothing, and therefore they cry 
    to him for help in the work, for acceptance of their efforts, and for the 
    establishment of their designs.</p>
<p align="justify">The church as a whole earnestly desires that the hand of 
    the Lord may so work with the hand of his people, that a substantial, yes, 
    an eternal edifice to the praise and glory of God may be the result. We come 
    and go—but the Lord's work abides.<i> We are content to die so long as Jesus 
    lives and his kingdom grows. </i>Since the Lord abides forever the same, we 
    trust our work in his hands, and feel that since it is far more his work 
    than ours, he will secure it immortality. When we have withered like grass 
    our holy service, like gold, silver, and precious stones, will survive the 
    fire.</p>
