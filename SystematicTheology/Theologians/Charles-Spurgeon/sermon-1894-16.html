          Thus saith the LORD: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither
          let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in
          his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
          understandeth, and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise
          lovingkindness, judgement, and righteousness, in the earth: for in
          these things I delight, saith the LORD.
        </p>
        <p>* *<br />*</p>
        <p>
          There is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is
          great in might. Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to
          thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the
          nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee,
          but they are together brutish and foolish.
        </p>
        <p>* *<br />*</p>
        <p>
          Thus saith the LORD: Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and
          maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD. For he
          shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good
          cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt
          land and not inhabited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD
          is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that
          spreadeth out his roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat
          cometh, but his leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the
          year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
        </p>

        <p>The New Covenant</p>
        <p>
          Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant
          with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according
          to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took
          them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my
          covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the
          LORD. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
          Israel after those days, saith the LORD; I will put my law in their
          inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their
          God, and they shall be my people: and they shall teach no more every
          man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD:
          for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest
          of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their
          sin will I remember no more.
