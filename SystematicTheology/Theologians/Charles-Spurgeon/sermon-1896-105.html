          1. Praise ye Jehovah! Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah; he will
          greatly delight in his commandments.2. His seed shall be powerful in
          the earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.3. Wealth
          and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for
          ever.

        <p>
          1 Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah Although the prophet begins
          with an exhortation, he has, as I have already pointed out, something
          farther in view, than simply the calling upon the faithful to praise
          God. To practice wickedness, and perpetrate injustice, is, in all
          quarters, accounted a great happiness; and, although integrity may be
          occasionally praised, nevertheless, there is scarcely one among a
          hundred who pursues it, because all imagine that they will be
          miserable unless, by one means or another, they seize as booty every
          thing which comes in their way. In opposition to this, the prophet
          tells us that more advantage is to be expected from God's paternal
          regard, than from the inflicting of every species of injury, and the
          perpetrating of every kind of injustice in our power; and by setting
          before us the certain hope of reward, he calls us back to the practice
          of equity and beneficence. The following is the analysis which I give
          of the verse: Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth
          himself in his commandments; and thus, by the second clause of the
          verse, the prophet specifies in what the fear of God consists. And
          that the addition of this explanatory clause is called for, is quite
          apparent from what we remarked towards the conclusion of the preceding
          psalm. For, while the law is boldly contemned by mankind, yet nothing
          is more common than to pretend that they fear God. Such impiety is
          well refuted by the prophet, when he acknowledges none as belonging to
          the worshippers of God, but he who endeavors to keep his law. The
          Hebrew verb chphph, chaphets, is rather emphatical, which is, as it
          were, to take his pleasure, and I have rendered to delight himself For
          the prophet makes a distinction between a willing and prompt endeavor
          to keep the law, and that which consists in mere servile and
          constrained obedience. We must, therefore, cheerfully embrace the law
          of God, and that, too, in such a manner, that the love of it, with all
          its sweetness, may overcome all the allurements of the flesh,
          otherwise, mere attention to it will be unavailing. Hence a man cannot
          be regarded as a genuine observer of the law, until he has attained to
          this -- that the delight which he takes in the law of God renders
          obedience agreeable to him. I now resume the consideration of the
          passage at large. The prophet, in affirming that the worshippers of
          God are happy, guards us against the very dangerous deception which
          the ungodly practice upon themselves, in imagining that they can reap
          a sort of happiness, I know not what, from doing evil.

          2 His seed shall be powerful For the purpose of confirming the
          statement which he advanced respecting the happiness of the man that
          fears Jehovah and takes delight in his commandments, the prophet
          enumerates the tokens of God's loving-kindness, which he is wont to
          bestow upon his worshippers. And, in the first place, he says that
          God's fatherly kindness is not confined to their own persons, it also
          extends to their posterity: agreeably to what is said in the law, |I
          am merciful to a thousand generations, towards them that love me and
          keep my commandments,| Exodus 34:7. And in Psalm 103:8, 9, and other
          passages, we have formerly adverted to this doctrinal statement. As,
          however, not a few are disposed to pervert this doctrine, by applying
          it as the standard according to which God dispenses his temporal
          favors, it is therefore proper to bear in mind what I have said in
          Psalm 37:25, that these are bestowed according to the manner, and in
          the measure, which God pleases. Sometimes it happens that a good man
          is childless; and barrenness itself is considered a curse of God.
          Again, many of God's servants are oppressed with poverty and want, are
          borne down under the weight of sickness, and harassed and perplexed
          with various calamities. It is therefore necessary to keep this
          general principle in view, That God sometimes bestows his bounty more
          profusely, and, at other times, more sparingly, upon his children,
          according as he sees it to be most for their good; and, moreover, he
          sometimes conceals the tokens of his kindness, apparently as if he had
          no regard for his people at all. Still, amid this perplexity, it
          constantly appears that these words were not uttered in vain, the
          righteous and their offspring are blessed God very frequently blasts
          the vain hopes of the ungodly, whose sole object is to bear rule in
          the world, and to raise their children to places of wealth and honor.
          On the other hand, as the faithful are satisfied with bringing up
          their children in the fear of God, and contented to live sparingly,
          God, as it were with an outstretched hand, exalts them to honor. Add
          to this, that anciently, under the law, the truth of this doctrine was
          more evident; because it was requisite for a people inexperienced and
          feeble, to be trained gradually, by means of temporal benefits, to
          entertain a better hope. And in our times, but for our vices, God's
          temporal kindness would shine more brightly upon us. For experience
          demonstrates that what is immediately subjoined does not uniformly
          hold true, wealth and riches shall be in the houses of the righteous
          It is no uncommon occurrence for the virtuous and holy to suffer
          hunger, and to be in want even of the most homely fare; and, for this
          reason, it would not be for their good were God to bestow more earthly
          benefits upon them. In afflicting circumstances, numbers of them would
          be incapable of behaving in a manner becoming their profession. In the
          meantime, we may observe, that the grace which the prophet commends
          appears principally in this, that the good and sincere are satisfied
          with their humble estate, whereas no portion, however large, even to
          the extent of the world itself, will content the ungodly worldling.
          The old adage holds true, That the covetous wants that which he has,
          as well as that which he has not; because he is master of nothing, and
          is the slave of his own wealth. In connection with this clause must
          also be taken that which follows, the righteousness of good men
          endureth for ever This, in fact, constitutes the true and proper
          difference between the godly and ungodly; because the latter may, for
          a time, hoard up immense wealth; yet, all that shall, according to the
          words of the prophet, |suddenly vanish away at the blast of the
          Almighty,| Haggai 1:9. And we daily see that what has been acquired by
          violence and deceit, becomes the prey and property of others. But, to
          the faithful, their integrity is the best and surest preserver of
          God's blessings.
