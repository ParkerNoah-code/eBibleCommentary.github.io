          "For the land whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land
          of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
          wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs; but the land whither
          ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh
          water of the rain of heaven; a land which the Lord thy God careth for;
          the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of
          the year, even unto the end of the year." -- Deuteronomy 11:10-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT HAS generally been considered, that the passage of the Jordan by
          the Israelites is typical of death, and that Canaan is a fitting
          representation of heaven. We believe that in some sense it is true,
          and we do fondly cherish the household words of those hymns which
          describe our passing through Jordan's billows, and landing safe on
          Canaan's side; but we do think that the allegory does not hold, and
          that Jordan is not a fair exhibition of death, nor the land of Canaan
          a fair picture of the sweet land beyond the swelling flood which the
          Christian gains after death. For mark you, after the children of
          Israel had entered into Canaan, they had to fight with their enemies.
          It was a land filled with foes. Every city they entered they had to
          take by storm, unless a miracle dismantled it. They were warriors,
          even in the land of Canaan, fighting for their own inheritance; and
          though each tribe had its lot marked out, yet they had to conquer the
          giant Anakim, and encounter terrible hosts of Canaanites. But when we
          cross the river of death we shall have no foes to fight, no enemies to
          encounter. Heaven is a place already prepared for us; out of it the
          evil ones have long ago been driven; there brethren shall await us
          with pleasing faces, kind hands shall clasp ours, and loving words
          shall alone be heard. The shout of war shall ne'er be raised by us in
          heaven; we shall throw our swords away, and the scabbards with them.
          No battles with warriors there, no plains besoaked with blood, no
          hills where robbers dwell, no inhabitants with chariots of iron. It is
          "a land flowing with milk and honey;" and it dreams not of the foeman
          of Canaan of old. We think the church has lost the beauty of
          Scripture, in taking Jordan to mean death, and that a far fuller
          meaning is the true allegory to be connected with it. Egypt, as we
          have lately observed to you, was typical of the condition of the
          children of God while they are in bondage to the law of sin. There
          they are made to work unceasingly, without wages or profit, but
          continually subject to pains. We said, again, that the coming up out
          of Egypt was the type of the deliverance which every one of God's
          people enjoys, when by faith he strikes the blood of Jesus on his
          lintel and his doorpost, and spiritually eats the paschal lamb; and we
          can also tell you now, that the passage through the wilderness is
          typical of that state of hoping, and fearing, and doubting, and
          wavering, and inconstancy, and distrust, which we usually experience
          between the period when we come out of Egypt, and attain unto the full
          assurance of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of you, my dear hearers, are really come out of Egypt; but you
          are still wandering about in the wilderness. "We that have believed do
          enter into rest;" but you, though you have eaten of Jesus, have not so
          believed on him as to have entered into the Canaan of rest. You are
          the Lord's people, but you have not come into the Canaan of assured
          faith, confidence, and hope, where we wrestle no longer with flesh and
          blood, but with principalities and powers in the heavenly places in
          Christ Jesus -- when it is no longer a matter of doubt with us whether
          we shall be saved, but we feel that we are saved. I have known
          believers who have existed for years almost without a doubt as to
          their acceptance. They have enjoyed a sweet and blessed reliance on
          Christ; they have come into Canaan; they have fed on the good old corn
          of the land; they now "lie passive in his hand, and know no will but
          his." They have such a sweet oneness with their blessed Lord Jesus,
          that they lay their head on his breast all day long, and they have
          scarcely any nights; they almost always live in days; for though they
          have not attained unto his perfect image, they feel themselves so
          manifestly in union with himself that they cannot and dare not doubt.
          They have entered into rest; they are come into Canaan. Such is the
          condition of the child of God, when he has come to an advanced stage
          in his experience, when God has so given him grace upon grace that he
          can say, "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
          I will fear no evil, for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff they
          comfort me."
        </p>
        <p>
          We will read this passage again; and bear in mind what I understand it
          to mean. It sets before the Christian's state, after he has attained
          to this faith and confidence in God; when he is no longer careful
          about the things of this life, when he does not water the ground with
          his foot, but has come to a land that drinketh in the rain of heaven.
          "The land whither thou goest in to possess it," -- the land of high
          and holy Christian privilege -- "is not as the land of Egypt, from
          whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with
          thy foot, as a garden of herbs; but the land, whither ye go to possess
          it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of
          heaven; a land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord
          thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto
          the end of the year." We shall have this morning to note, first of
          all, the difference between the Christian's temporal condition and
          that of the Egyptian worldling; and secondly, the special privilege
          vouchsafed to those who have entered into Canaan -- that the eyes of
          the Lord their God are always upon their land, "from the beginning of
          the year, even unto the end of the year."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. True religion makes a difference not only in a man, but in a man's
          condition; it affects not only his heart, but his state -- not only
          his nature, but his very standing in society. The Lord thy God cares
          not only for Israel, but for Canaan, where Israel dwells. God has not
          only a regard to the elect, but to their habitation, and not only so,
          but to all their affairs and circumstances. The moment I become a
          child of God, not only is my heart changed and my nature renewed, but
          my very position becomes different; the very beasts of the field are
          in league with me, and the stones thereof are at peace. My habitation
          is now guarded by Jehovah; my position in this world is no longer that
          of a needy mendicant -- I have become a gentleman-pensioner on the
          providence of God; my position, which was that of a bondslave in
          Egypt, is now become that of an inheritor in Canaan. In this
          difference of the condition of the Christian and the worldling, we
          shall mark three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the Christian's temporal condition is different to that of the
          worldling; for the worldling looks to secondary causes, the Christian
          looks to heaven; he gets his mercies thence. Read the text, "The land,
          whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from
          whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with
          thy foot, as a garden of herbs." The land of Egypt has never had any
          rain from heaven; it has been always watered from earthly sources. At
          a certain season the river Nile overflowed its banks, and covered the
          land; a stock of water was then accumulated in artificial reservoirs,
          and afterwards let out in canals, and allowed to run in little
          trenches through the fields. They had to water it as a garden of
          herbs. All their dependence was on the nether springs; they looked to
          the river Nile as the source of all their plenty, and even worshipped
          it. But the land to which you are coming is not watered from a river;
          "it drinketh water of the rain of heaven." Your fertility shall not
          come from such artificial sources as canals and trenches; you shall be
          fed from the water that descends from heaven! You see how beautifully
          this pictures a worldling and a Christian. Look at the worldling; what
          is his dependence? It is all upon the water below; he looks only to
          the water that flows from the river of this world. "Who will show us
          any good?" Some rely upon what they call chance -- (a river the source
          of which, like the source of the Nile, is never known;) and though
          continually disappointed, they still persevere in trusting to this
          unknown stream. Others, who are more sensible, trust to their hard
          work and honesty; they look to the source of that river, and they
          trace it to a fountain of human erection graced by a statue of labour.
          Ah! that river may yet fail you; it may not overflow its banks, and
          you may be starved. But, O Christian, what doest thou rely upon? Thy
          land "drinketh water of the rain of heaven;" thy mercies come not from
          the hand of chance; thy daily bread cometh not so much from thy
          industry as from thy heavenly Father's care; thou seest stamped upon
          every mercy heaven's own inscription, and every blessing comes down to
          thee perfumed with the ointment and spikenard, and the myrrh of the
          ivory palaces, whence God dispenses his bounties. Here is the
          difference between the assured Christian and the mere worldling: the
          one trusts to natural causes -- the other "looks through nature up to
          nature's God." and seeth his mercies as coming down fresh from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, let us improve this thought, by showing you the great value
          of it. Do you know a man who sees his mercies coming from heaven, and
          not from earth? How much sweeter all his mercies are! There is nothing
          in the world that tastes as sweet to the school-boy as that which
          comes from home. Those who live at the school may make him ever such
          good things, but he cares nothing for anything like that which comes
          from home. So will the Christian. All his mercies are sweeter because
          they are home-mercies. I love God's favours on earth; for everything I
          eat and drink tastes of home. And oh! how sweet to think, "That bread,
          my Father's hand moulded; that water, my Father droppeth out from his
          hand in the gentle rain." I can see everything coming from his hand.
          The land in which I live is not like the land of Egypt, fed by a
          river; but it "drinketh water of the rain of heaven." All my mercies
          come from above. Don't you like, beloved, to see the print of your
          Father's fingers on every mercy? You have heard of the haddock having
          the mark of the thumb of Peter on it! It is a fiction, of course; but
          I am sure all the fish that we get out of the sea of providence are
          marked by Jesus' fingers. Happy the lot of that man who receives
          everything as coming from God, and thanks his Father for it all! It
          makes anything sweet, when he knows it comes from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thought, again, has a great tendency to keep us from an
          overweening love of the world. If we think that all our mercies come
          from heaven, we shall not be so likely to love the world, as we shall
          be if we think that they are the natural products of the soil. The
          spies went to Eschol, and fetched thence an immense cluster of the
          grapes which grew there; but you do not find that the people said,
          "These are fine fruits, therefore we will stay here." No: they saw
          that the grapes came from Canaan, and thereupon they said, "Let us go
          on, and possess them." And so, when we get rich mercies, if we think
          they come from the natural soil of this earth, we feel,
        </p>
        <p>"Here I will for ever stay."</p>
        <p>
          But if we know that they come from a foreign clime, we are anxious to
          go
        </p>
        <p>"Where our dear Lord his vineyard keeps,</p>
        <p>And all the clusters grow."</p>
        <p>
          Christian, then, rejoice, rejoice! Thy mercies come from heaven;
          however small they be, still they are thy Father's gift; not one comes
          to thee without his knowledge, and his permission. Bless the Lord,
          therefore, that thou art come to Canaan; where thy "land drinketh
          water of the rain of heaven!"
        </p>
        <p>
          My dearly beloved, just stop here, and console yourselves, if you are
          in trouble. "Oh!" says one, "I know not what I shall do: where to turn
          myself I cannot tell." You are not like your brother, who is sitting
          near you; he has a competency; he has a river of Egypt to depend on;
          you have not any; nevertheless, there is the sky still. If you were to
          tell a farmer, "You have no rivers to water your lands." "Well," he
          would say, "I don't want them either; for I have clouds up there, and
          the clouds are enough." So, Christian, if thou hast nothing to depend
          on down below, turn thine eyes up there, and say, "The land, whither I
          go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence I came
          out, where I sowed my seed, and watered it with my foot, as a garden
          of herbs; but the land, whither I go to possess it, is a land of hills
          and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But now comes the second distinction, and that is, a difference in
          the toilsomeness of their lives. The worldly man, just like the
          Israelites in Egypt, has to water his land with his foot. Read the
          passage: -- "For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not
          as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy
          seed, and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs." This
          alludes, possibly to the practice, amongst all eastern nations where
          the land is irrigated, of letting out a certain quantity of water into
          a trench, and then having small gutters dug in the gardens, to compel
          the water to run along different parts of the ground. Sometimes one of
          these gutters might be broken; and then the gardener would press the
          mould against it with his foot, to keep the water in its proper
          channel. But I have inclined to think that the passage alludes to the
          method which those eastern countries have of pumping up the water by a
          tread-wheel, and so watering the land with their foot. However that
          may be, it means that the land of Egypt was watered with extraordinary
          labour, in order to preserve it from sterility. "But," says Moses,
          "the land, to which ye are going, is not a land which you will have to
          water with your foot. The water will come spontaneously; the land will
          be watered by the rain of heaven. You can sit in your own houses, or
          under your own vine, or under your own fig tree, and God himself shall
          be your irrigator. You shall sit still, and in quietness shall ye
          possess your souls.'" Now, here is a difference between the godly and
          ungodly: -- the ungodly man toils. Suppose his object is ambition; he
          will labor and labor, and labor, and spend his very life, until he
          obtains the desire pinnacle. Suppose it is wealth; how will he
          emaciate his frame, rob his body of its needed sleep, and take away
          the nourishment his frame requires, in order that he may accumulate
          riches! And if it is learning, how will he burn his eyes out with the
          flame of his hot desire, that he may understand all knowledge; how
          will he allow his frame to become weak, and weary, and wan, by
          midnight watchings, till the oil wherewith he lighteth himself by
          night comes from his own flesh, and the marrow of his bones furnisheth
          the light for his spirit! Men will in this way labour, and toil, and
          strive. But not so the Christian. No: God "giveth his beloved sleep."
          His "strength is to sit still." He knows what it is to fulfil the
          command of Paul: -- "I would have you without carefulness." We can
          take things as God gives them, without all this toil and labour. I
          have often admired the advice of old Cineas to Pyrrhus. Old story
          saith, that when Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was making preparation for
          his intended expedition into Italy, Cineas, the philosopher, took a
          favourable opportunity of addressing him thus: "The Romans, sir, are
          reported to be a warlike and victorious people; but if God permit us
          to overcome them, what use shall we make of the victory?" "Thou
          askest," said Pyrrhus, "a thing that is self-evident. The Romans once
          conquered, no city will resist us; we shall then be masters of all
          Italy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cineas added -- "And having subdued Italy, what shall we do next?"
          Pyrrhus not yet aware of his intentions, replied, "Sicily next
          stretches out her arms to receive us." "That is very probable," said
          Cineas, "but will the possession of Sicily put an end to the war?"
          "God grant us success in that," answered Pyrrhus, "and we shall make
          these only the forerunners of greater things, for then Libra and
          Carthage will soon be ours: and these things being completed, none of
          our enemies can offer any further resistance." "Very true," added
          Cineas, "for then we may easily regain Macedon, and make absolute
          conquest of Greece; and when all these are in our possession, what
          shall we do then?" Pyrrhus, smiling, answered, "Why then, my dear
          friend, we will live at our ease, take pleasure all day, and amuse
          ourselves with cheerful conversation." "Well sir," said Cineas, "and
          why may we not do this now, and without the labour and hazard of an
          enterprise so laborious and uncertain?" So, beloved, says the
          Christian. The worldly mans says, "Let me go and do this; let me go
          and do that; let me accumulate so many thousand pounds; let me get so
          rich; then I will enjoy myself and take my ease." "Nay," says the
          Christian, "I see no reason for doing it; why should I not make God my
          refuge now? Why should I not enjoy comfort and peace, and make myself
          happy now?" He does not want to water his land with his feet; but he
          sits down quietly, and his land "drinketh in water of the rain of
          heaven." Do not say I am preaching laziness. No such thing: I am only
          saying it is vain for you to rise up early, and sit up late, and eat
          the bread of carefulness, for, "Except the Lord build the house, they
          labour in vain that build it." But, if "he giveth his beloved sleep,"
          they rest in him; they know not these toils; that is, if they have
          attained to full assurance, and crossed into the Canaan of full
          confidence in God. They do not care to go ranging the world to find
          their happiness; but they say, "God is my ever present help; in him my
          soul is satisfied." They rest content in him. Their land is watered
          with the rain of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember a story of a young man who was a lawyer. In order to attain
          fame in his position he was extremely anxious to understand all the
          mysteries and tortuous windings of the law, and to acquire some power
          of oratory, that he might be able to deliver himself eloquently before
          the bench. For ten years did he live apart from other people, lest
          domestic habits should wean him from his studies; he wrapped himself
          every night in a blanket, and took one of his own volumes, and put it
          under his head; he denied himself food, eating only so many morsels a
          day, lest indigestion should impair his powers. Although he was an
          infidel, he believed in God; and he bowed his head so many times a
          day, and prayed that he might lose anything rather than his
          intellectual powers. "Make a giant of me!" -- that was his expression.
          And although his poor mother begged him to make himself more
          comfortable, he would not, but persisted in his course of
          abstemiousness and self-denial. One day, in reading one of his books,
          he saw this passage: "When all is gained, how little then is won! And
          yet to gain that little, how much is lost!" He stamped his foot, and
          raved like a maniac at the thought, that he had spent all these ten
          years, toiling and wearying himself for nothing; he saw the vanity of
          his course; he was driven to desperation, seized his axe, cut down the
          sign-board of his profession, and said, "Here ends this business."
          Turning to the same book, he found that it recommended Christianity as
          the rest of the weary soul; he found it in Christ, and attained to
          such an understanding of Christ, that he became a preacher of the
          gospel, and might well have preached on this text -- "The land whither
          thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence
          ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy
          foot, as a garden of herbs; but the land, whither ye go to possess it,
          is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh the water of heaven: a
          land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God
          are upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the
          year."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This brings us to the third and last difference that we will note
          this morning; and that is, that the unbeliever, he who has not crossed
          the Jordan and come to full confidence, does not understand the
          universality of God's providence, while the assured Christian does.
          You will see that in my text in a minute. In Egypt the ground is
          almost entirely flat; and where it is not flat, it is impossible, of
          course, to grow anything, unless the ground is watered at considerable
          difficulty by some method of artificial irrigation, which shall force
          the water on to the high places. "But," says Moses, "the land, whither
          ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys." The Egyptians
          could not get the water up on the hills, but you can; for the
          mountains drink in the rain, as well as the valleys. Now look at a
          worldling. Give him comforts, give him prosperity: oh! he can be so
          happy. Give him everything just as he likes it; make his course all a
          plain, all a dead valley and a flat; he can fertilize that, and water
          it; but let him have a mountainous trouble, let him lose a friend, or
          let his property be taken from him -- put a hill in his way, and he
          cannot water that, with all the pumping of his feet, and all the force
          he strives to use. But the Christian lives in "a land of hills and
          valleys;" a land of sorrow as well as joys; but the hills drink the
          water, as well as the valleys. We need not climb the mountains to
          water their heads, for our God is as high as the hills. High as our
          troubles, and mountainous as are our difficulties sometimes, we need
          not climb up with weary foot to make them fertile, for they are all
          made to work together for our good. Go, Egyptian; live thou in thy
          flat country, and enjoy its luxuries; thou hast thy papyrus, and thou
          writest mercies upon it, but it shall be the food of worms; we have no
          lotus, but we have a flower that blooms in paradise; and we write our
          mercies on rocks, and not on rushes. Oh! sweet Canaan, heavenly land,
          where I dwell, and where you dwell, my brother Christians -- a land
          which "drinketh water of the rain of heaven!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We must consider a little time, THE SPECIAL MERCY. "The eyes of
          the Lord are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto
          the end of the year." WE must now turn away altogether from the
          allegoric, and come to this special mercy, which is the lot only of
          God's people.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning
          of the year even unto the end of the year:" that is, upon the lot of
          all Christians individually. We have come now, beloved, to the end of
          another year -- to the threshold of another period of time, and have
          marched another year's journey through the wilderness. Come, now! In
          reading this verse over, can you say Amen to it? "The eyes of the Lord
          thy God are always upon you, from the beginning of the year even unto
          the end of the year." Some of you say, "I have had deep troubles this
          year." "I have lost a friend," says one. "Ah!" says another, "I have
          been impoverished this year." "I have been slandered," cries another.
          "I have been exceedingly vexed and grieved," says another. "I have
          been persecuted," says another. Well, but, beloved, take the year
          altogether -- the blacks and the whites, the troubles and the joys,
          the hills and the valleys altogether, and what have you to say about
          it? You may say, "Surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the
          days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."
          Do not pick out one day in the year, and say it was a bad day, but
          take all the year round, let it revolve in all its grandeur; let all
          the signs of the Zodiac come before you. Do not say, "I have been in
          Cancer so long a time," but run through them all, and then get into
          Libra, and judge between things that differ; and then what will you
          say? "Ah! bless the Lord! he hath done all things well; my soul, and
          all that is within me, bless his holy name!" And you know why all
          things have been well. It is because the eyes of the Lord have been
          upon you all the year. Oh! if those awful eyes had been shut for a
          single moment, by night or day, where should we have been? Why, we had
          not been at all but swept away, like airy dreams, into nihility. God
          watches over every one of his people, just as if there were only that
          one in the world; and he has been watching over you, so that when a
          trouble came, God said, "Trouble, avaunt!" "There shall no temptation
          happen to you but such as is common to man." And when your joys would
          have cloyed upon you, and around you, God has said, "Stand back, joy!
          I will not have you fondle him too much; he will be deceived by thee."
          "The eyes of the Lord" have been upon you continually, "from the
          beginning of the year even unto the end of the year." "Well," says
          one, "I cannot say so much of my year." Then I cannot say so much of
          you. I was speaking to the Christian; and if you cannot say of your
          year, "surely goodness and mercy have followed it all," I am afraid
          you are not a child of God, for methinks a child of God will say, when
          he reviews it all, "not one good thing hath failed of all the Lord God
          hath promised, but all hath come to pass."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, my brethren, might I not say a word to you concerning the eyes
          of the Lord having been upon us as a church? Ought we to let this year
          pass without rehearsing the works of the Lord? Hath he not been with
          us exceeding abundantly, and prospered us? It is during this year that
          we met together in the great assembly -- during this year that these
          eyes have seen the mighty gatherings of men who listened to our words
          on the Sabbath-day. We shall not soon forget our sojourn in Exeter
          Hall-shall we? During those months the Lord brought in many of his own
          elect, and multitudes who were unsaved up to that time were called by
          divine mercy, and brought into the fold. How God protected us there!
          What peace and prosperity hath he given to us! How hath he enlarged
          our borders, and multiplied our numbers, so that we are not few, and
          increased us, so that we are not weak! I do think we were not thankful
          enough for the goodness of the Lord which carried us there, and gave
          us so many who have now become useful to use in our church! Remember
          in how many places ye have worshipped God this year. This place has
          been enlarged, so that more can be held within its walls; now we can
          receive more to listen to the voice of the Gospel than we could
          before; and God seems to say, "Go, forward, go forward still." The
          goodness of the Lord has increased as we have gone along. I have often
          feared, lest the people should desert the house, and that when we made
          it larger we should not have enough to fill it: but the Lord still
          sends an overwhelming congregation, and still gives us grace to preach
          his gospel. How thankful should we be! Surely, "the eyes of the Lord"
          have been upon this church, "from the beginning of the year even unto
          the end of the year." We have had peace: not a rotten peace, I trust,
          but the peace of God. Nothing has arisen that should disturb our
          equanimity. The church has been kept by the grace of God faithful to
          the doctrines of grace. Ah! what a blessing it is, that our members
          have been kept from falling into sin! What a glorious thing that we
          are carried through another year safely! Some old writer has said,
          "Every hour that a Christian remains a Christian is an hour of
          miracle." It is true; and every year that the church is kept an entire
          church is a year of miracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a year of miracles. Tell it to the wide, wide world; tell it
          everywhere. "The eye of the Lord" hath been upon us, "from the
          beginning of the year even unto the end of the year." Two hundred and
          ten persons have this year united with us in church fellowship; about
          enough to have formed a church. One half the churches in London cannot
          number so many in their entire body; and yet the Lord has brought so
          many into our midst. And still they come; still they come. Whenever I
          have an opportunity of seeing those who are converted to God, they
          come in such numbers that many have to be sent away. Still they come,
          still they come; and well I am assured, that I have as many still in
          this congregation, who will during the present year come forward to
          put on the Lord Jesus Christ. How often has the sacred pool of baptism
          been opened this year! How sweetly have we assembled round the Lord's
          table! What precious moments we have had at the Monday evening prayer
          meetings! And how glorious it has been when we have recognized brother
          after brother, sister after sister publicly, by giving them the right
          hand of fellowship! In all our ways we hope we have acknowledged him,
          and he has directed our paths. Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done
          wonders; bless his name, for he has worked miracles; praise his grace,
          for he hath highly exalted his people; for he has worked miracles;
          praise his grace, for he hath highly exalted his people; unto him be
          honor, for ever and ever. And mark you, brethren, this church has
          known what it is to come out of Egypt. We have not toiled with our
          feet here. I hope there has been no desire to draw unfit persons into
          the church, I have had no toiling with my feet, I am sure, in
          preaching the gospel -- no legal preaching -- none of your exciting
          preaching -- none of all that toiling with your feet; but we have had
          nothing but the rain from heaven. We have not laboured to excite
          carnal passions, nor to preach sermons with a view of driving you into
          religious fevers. Sturdy old Calvinism will not let us do that. We
          cannot preach such sermons as Arminians can. The land has been watered
          by the rain of heaven. We have not had any of those fatal pestilential
          mists that sometimes gather round the church. It is proverbial, that
          wherever the revivalists go, they always carry desolation; before them
          is an Eden; behind them is a desert; wherever they go they scorch the
          land like firebrands; though hundreds seem to be converted to God,
          they are converted to ten times blacker sins than before, and the last
          end of them is worse than the first. We want not the getting up of a
          little feverish passion by appealing to the natural man; it is the
          drinking water of the rain of heaven that does the good. I trust it
          has been so here, and that "the eyes of the Lord" have been upon you
          "from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, beloved, I can say that, as a minister, the eyes of the Lord have
          been upon me this year. It has been my privilege, many times this year
          to preach his word. I think, more than four hundred times have I stood
          in the pulpit to testify his truth, and the eyes of the Lord have been
          upon me. Blessed be his name! whether it has been in the north, in the
          south, in the east, or in the west, I have never lacked a
          congregation; nor have I ever gone again to any of the places I have
          preached at, without hearing of souls converted. I cannot remember a
          single village, or town, that I have visited a second time without
          meeting with some who blessed God that they heard the word of truth
          there. When I went to Bradford last time, I stated in the pulpit that
          I had never heard of a soul being converted through my preaching
          there; and the good pew-opener came to Brother Dowson, and said, "Why
          didn't you tell Mr. Spurgeon that such-a-one joined the church through
          hearing him?" and instantly that dear man of God told me the cheering
          news. We have met with much opposition this year. Thanks to our
          brethren in the ministry, we have not had very much assistance from
          them. We have been enabled to say to them all, "I will not take from
          you, from a thread to a shoe-latchet, lest ye should say, I have made
          him rich." But how much of that bigotry which formerly existed has
          subsided! How much of that sneer, which was at one time so common, has
          now gone away! I am now, rather more afraid of their smiles than their
          frowns -- though I do not think I feel much of either. Cedo nulli, was
          my motto at the beginning, and I take it once more. I yield to none;
          but by the grace of God I preach his truth, and still, if he help me,
          will I hold on my way. And to the Three-one God, be eternal honor.
          Amen.<br />
