        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          "This is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our
          Righteousness. -- Jeremiah 23:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          MAN BY THE FALL sustained an infinite loss in the matter of
          righteousness. He suffered the loss of a righteous nature, and then a
          two-fold loss of legal righteousness in the sight of God. Man sinned;
          he was therefore no longer innocent of transgression. Man did not keep
          the command; he therefore was guilty of the sin of omission. In that
          which he committed, and in that which he omitted, his original
          character for uprightness was completely wrecked. Jesus Christ came to
          undo the mischief of the fall for his people. So far as their sin
          concerned their breach of the command, that he has removed by his
          precious blood. His agony and bloody sweat have for ever taken away
          the consequences of sin from believers, seeing Christ did by his one
          sacrifice bear the penalty of that sin in his flesh. He, his own self,
          bare our sins in his own body on the tree. Still it is not enough for
          a man to be pardoned. He, of course, is then in the eye of God without
          sin. But it was required of man that he should actually keep the
          command. It was not enough that he did not break it, or that he is
          regarded through the blood as though he did not break it. He must keep
          it, he must continue in all things that are written in the book of the
          law to do them. How is this necessity supplied? Man must have a
          righteousness, or God cannot accept him. Man must have a perfect
          obedience, or else God cannot reward him. Should He give heaven to a
          soul that has not perfectly kept the law; that were to give the reward
          where the service is not done, and that before God would be an act
          which might impeach his justice. Where, then, is the righteousness
          with which the pardoned man shall be completely covered, so that God
          can regard him as having kept the law, and reward him for so doing?
          Surely, my brethren, none of you are so besotted as to think that this
          righteousness can be wrought out by yourselves. You must despair of
          ever being able to keep the law perfectly. Each day you sin. Since you
          have passed from death unto life, the old Adam still struggles for
          dominion within you. And by the force of the lusts of the flesh you
          are brought into captivity to the law of sin which is in your members.
          The good you would do, you do not, and the evil you would not, that
          you too often do. Some have thought the works of the Holy Spirit in us
          would give us a righteousness in which we might stand. I am sure, my
          brethren, we would not say a word derogatory to the cork of the Holy
          Spirit. It is divine. But we hold it to be a great cardinal point in
          divinity that the work of the Spirit never meant to supplant the
          merits of the Son. We could not depreciate the Lord Jesus Christ in
          order to exalt the office of the Holy Spirit of God. We know that each
          particular branch of the divine salvation which was espoused by the
          persons of the Trinity has been carried out by each one to perfection.
          Now as we are accepted in the Beloved, it must be by a something that
          the Beloved did; as we are justified in Christ it must be by a
          something not that the Spirit has done, but which Christ has done. We
          must believe, then, -- for there is no other alternative -- that the
          righteousness in which we must be clothed, and through which we must
          be accepted, and by which we are made meet to inherit eternal life,
          can be no other than the work of Jesus Christ. We, therefore, assert,
          believing that Scripture fully warrants us, that the life of Christ
          constitutes the righteousness in which his people are to be clothed.
          His death washed away their sins, his life covered them from head to
          foot; his death the sneaky to God, his life was the gift to man, by
          which man satisfies the demands of the law. Herein the law is honored
          and the soul is accepted. I find that many young Christians who are
          very clear about being saved by the merits of Christ's death, do not
          seem to understand the merits of his life. Remember, young believers,
          that from the first moment when Christ did lie in the cradle until the
          time when he ascended up on high, he was at work for his people; and
          from the moment when he was seen in Mary's arms, till the instant when
          in the arms of death he "bowed his head and gave up the ghost," he was
          at work for your salvation and mine. He completed the work of
          obedience in his life, and said to his Father, "I have finished the
          work which thou gavest me to do." Then he completed the work of
          atonement in his death, and knowing that all things were accomplished,
          he cried, "It is finished." He was through his life spinning the web
          for making the royal garment, and in his death he dipped that garment
          in his blood. In his life he was gathering together the precious gold,
          in his death he hammered it out to make for us a garment which is of
          wrought gold. You have as much to thank Christ for loving as for
          dying, and you should be as reverently and devoutly grateful for his
          spotless life as for his terrible and fearful death. The text speaking
          of Christ, the son of David, the branch out of the root of Jesse,
          styles him THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having introduced the doctrine of imputed righteousness, I proofed to
          map out my subject. First, by way of affirmation; we say of the text
          -- it is so -- Christ is the Lord or righteousness; secondly, I shall
          exhort you to do him homage; let us call him so: for this is the name
          whereby he shall be called; and thirdly, I shall appeal to your
          gratitude; let us wonder at the reigning grace, which has caused us to
          fulfill the promise, for have been sweetly compelled to call him the
          Lord our righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, He is so. Jesus Christ is the Lord our righteousness.
          There are but three words, "JEHOVAH" -- for so it is in the original,
          -- "OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.' He is Jehovah. Read that verse, and you will
          clearly perceive that the Messias of the Jews, Jesus of Nazareth the
          Saviour of the Gentiles, is certainly Jehovah. He hath the
          incommunicable title of the Most High God. "Behold, the days come,
          saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous branch, and a
          king shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice
          in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
          safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
          RIGHTEOUSNESS." Oh, ye Arians and Socinians, who monstrously deny the
          Lord who bought you and put him to open shame by denying his divinity,
          read you that verse and let your blasphemous tongues be silent, and
          let your obdurate hearts melt in penitence because ye have so foully
          sinned against him. He is Jehovah, or, mark you, the whole of God's
          word is false, and there is no noun for a sinner's hope. We know, and
          this day we testify in his name, that the very Christ who did lie in
          the manger as an infant was infinite even then; that he who cried,
          cried for very pain as a child, was nevertheless saluted at that very
          moment as God by the songs of the creatures that his hands had made.
          He who walked in pain over the flinty acres of Palestine, was at the
          same time possessor of heaven and earth. He who had not where to lay
          his head, and was despised and rejected of men, was at the same
          instant God over all, blessed for evermore. He that sweat great drops
          of blood did bear the earth upon his shoulders. He who was flagellated
          in Pilate's hall was adored by spirits of the just made perfect. He
          who did hang upon the tree had the oration hanging upon him. He who
          died on the cross was the ever living, the everlasting One. As a man
          he died, as God he lives. As Mary's son he bled, as the son of the
          Eternal God he had the sway and the dominion over all the world. In
          nature Christ proves himself to be universal God. Without him was not
          anything made that was made. By him all things consist. Who less than
          God could make the heavens and the earth? Bow before him, bow before
          him, for he made you, and should not the creatures acknowledge their
          Creator?
        </p>
        <p>
          Providence attests his Godhead. He upholdeth all things by the word of
          his power Creatures that are animate have their breath from his
          nostrils; inanimate creatures that are strong and mighty stand only by
          his strength. He can say concerning the earth, "I bear the pillars
          thereof." In the deep foundations of the sea his power is felt, and in
          the towering arches of the starry heavens his might is recognized to
          the full. And as for Grace, we claim for Christ that he is Jehovah in
          the great kingdom of his grace. Who less than God could have carried
          your sins and mine and cast them all away? Who less than God could
          have interposed to deliver us from the jaws of hell's lions, and bring
          us up from the pit, having found a ransom? On whom less than God could
          we rely to keep us from the innumerable temptations that beset us? How
          can he be less than God, when he says, "Lo, I am with you always, unto
          the end of the world?" How could he be omnipresent if he were not God!
          How could he hear our prayers, the prayers of millions, scattered
          through the leagues of earth, and attend to them all, and give
          acceptance to all, if he were not infinite in understanding and
          infinite in merit? How were this if he were less than God? Let
          Atheists scoff, let Deists sneer, let the vain Socinian boast, let the
          Arian lift up his puny voice, but we will glory in this fact, that he
          that bought us with his blood is Jehovah -- very God of very God. At
          his footstool we bow and pay him the very homage that we pay to his
          Father and to the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>"Blessings more than we can give,</p>
        <p>Be Lord for ever thine."</p>
        <p>
          But the text speaks about righteousness too -- "Jehovah our
          righteousness." And he is so. Christ in his life was so righteous,
          that we may say of the life, taken as a vehicle, that it is
          righteousness itself. Christ is the law incarnate Understand me. He
          lived out the law of God to the very full, and while you see God's
          precepts written in fire on Sinai's brow, you see them written in
          flesh in the person of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>"My dear Redeemer and my Lord,</p>
        <p>I read my duty in thy word,</p>
        <p>But in thy life the law appears</p>
        <p>Drawn out in living characters."</p>
        <p>
          He never offended against the commands of the Just One. From his eye
          there never flashed the fire of unhallowed anger. On his lip there did
          never hang the unjust of licentious word. His heart was never stirred
          by the breath of sin or the taint of iniquity. In the secret of his
          reins no fault was hidden. In his understanding was no defect; in his
          judgment no error. In his miracles there was no ostentation. In him
          there was indeed no guile. His powers being ruled by his
          understanding, all of them acted and co-acted to perfection's very
          self, so that never was there any flaw of omission or stain of
          commission. The law consists in this first, "Thou shalt love the Lord
          thy God with all thy heart." He did so. It was his meat and his drink
          to do the will of him that sent him. Never man spent himself as he
          did. Hunger and thirst and nakedness were nothing to him, nor death
          itself if he might so be baptised with the baptism wherewith he must
          be baptized, and drink the cup which his Father had set before him.
          The law consists also in this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
          thyself." In all he did, and in all he suffered he more than fulfilled
          the precept, for "he saved others himself he could not save." He
          exhausted the utmost resources of love in the deep devotion and
          self-sacrifice of loving. He loved man better than his own life. He
          would sooner be spit upon than that man should be cast into the flames
          of hell and sooner yield up the ghost in agonies that cannot be
          described than that the souls his Father gave him should be cast away.
          He carried out the law, then, I say to the very letter he spelt out
          its mystic syllables, and verily he magnified it, and made it
          honorable. He loved the Lord his God, with all his heart, and soul,
          and mind, and he loved his neighbors as himself. Jesus Christ was
          righteousness impersonated. "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" he
          might well say. One thousand eight hundred years have passed since
          then, and blasphemy itself has not been able to charge him with a
          fault. Strange as it may appear, the most perverted judges have
          nevertheless acknowledged the awful dignity of his character. They
          have railed at his miracles; they have denied his Godhead; but his
          righteous character I know not that they have dared to impugn. They
          have hatched jokes about his generation; they have made his poverty a
          jest, and his death has been the theme of ribald song; but his life
          has staggered even the most unbelieving, and made the careless wonder
          how such a character could have been conceived even if it be a
          fiction, and much more, how it could have been executed if it be a
          fact. No one that I know of has dared to charge Christ with
          unrighteousness to man, or with a want of devotedness to God. See
          then, it is so. We do not stay to prove his righteousness any more
          than we did to prove his Godhead. The day is coming when men shall
          acknowledge him to be Jehovah, and when looking upon all his life
          while he was incarnate here, they shall be compelled to say that his
          life was righteousness itself. The pith, however, of the title, lies
          in the little word "our," -- "Jehovah our righteousness." This is the
          grappling iron with which we get a hold on him -- this is the anchor
          which dives into the bottom of this great deep of his immaculate
          righteousness. This is the saved rivet by which our souls are joined
          to him. This is the blessed hand with which our soul toucheth him, and
          he becometh to us all in all, "Jehovah our Righteousness"
        </p>
        <p>
          You will now observe that there is a most precious doctrine unfolded
          in this title of our Lord and Saviour. I think we may take it thus:
          When we believe in Christ, by faith we receive our justification. As
          the merit of his blood takes away our sin, so the merit of his
          obedience is imputed to us for righteousness. We are considered, as
          soon as we believe, as though the works of Christ here our works. God
          looks upon us as though that perfect obedience, of which I have just
          now spoken, had been performed by ourselves, -- as though our hands
          had been bony at the loom, an though the fabric and the stuff which
          have been worked up into the fine linen, which is the righteousness of
          the saints, had been grown in our own fields. God considers us as
          though we were Christ -- looks upon us as though his life had been our
          life -- and accepts, blesses, and rewards us as though all that he did
          had been done by us, his believing people. Accordingly, if you will
          turn to the thirty-third chapter of this same prophet Jeremiah, and
          look at the sixteenth verse, you will see it written, "This is the
          name wherewith she shall be called, the Lord our righteousness." I
          know that Socinus in his day used to call this an execrable,
          detectable, and licentious doctrine: probably it was, because he was
          an execrable, detectable, and licentious man. Many men use their own
          names when they are applying names to other persons; they are so well
          acquainted with their own characters, and so suspicious of themselves,
          that they think it best, before another can express the suspicion, to
          attach the very same accusation to someone else. Now we hold, you
          know, that this doctrine is not execrable, but most delightful, that
          it is not abominable, but Godlike, that it is not licentious, but
          holy: and let others say what they will of it, we will repeat the
          praise which we have been singing, --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, thy perfect righteousness</p>
        <p>My beauty is, my glorious dress;"</p>
        <p>
          and we will day when all things shall be tried by fire, for we feel
          confident that --
        </p>
        <p>"Bold shall we stand in that great day,</p>
        <p>For who aught to our charge shall lay,"</p>
        <p>when we are clothed with the righteousness divine?</p>
        <p>
          Imputation, so far from being an exceptional case with regard to the
          righteousness of Christ, lies at the very bottom of the entire
          teaching of Scripture. How did we fall, my brethren? We fell by the
          imputation of Adam's sin to us. Adam was our federal head; he
          represented us; and when he sinned, we sinned representatively in him,
          and what he did was imputed to us. You say that you never agreed to
          the imputation. Nay, but I would not have you say thus, for as by
          representation we fell, it is by the representative system that we
          rise. The angels fell personally and individually, and they never
          rise, but we fell in another, and we have therefore the power given by
          divine grace to rise in another. The root of the fall is found in the
          federal relationship of Adam to his seed; thus we fell by imputation.
          Is it any wonder that we should rise by imputation? Deny this
          doctrine, and I ask you -- How are men pardoned at all? Are they not
          pardoned because satisfaction has been offered for sin by Christ? Very
          well then, but that satisfaction must be imputed to them, or else how
          is God just in giving to them the results of the death of another,
          unless that death of the other be fire? of all imputed to them? When
          we say that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to an believing
          souls, we do not hold forth an exceptional theory, but we expound a
          grand truth, which is so consistent with the theory of the fall and
          the plan of pardon, that it must be maintained in order to make the
          gospel clear. I think it was this doctrine which Martin Luther called
          the article of standing or falling of the Church. I find a passage in
          his works which seems to me to refer to this doctrine rather than to
          justification by faith. He ought certainly to have said,
          "Justification by faith is the doctrine of standing or falling of the
          Church." But in Luther's mind, imputed righteousness we, so interwoven
          with justification by faith, that he could not see any distinction
          between the two. And I must confess, in trying to observe a
          difference, I do not see much. I must give up justification by faith
          if I give up imputed righteousness. True justification by faith is the
          surface soil, but then imputed righteousness is the granite rock which
          lies underneath it; and if you dig down through the great truth of a
          sinners being justified by faith in Christ, you must, as I believe,
          inevitably come to the doctrine of the imputed righteousness of Christ
          as the basis and foundation on which that simple doctrine rests.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let us stop a moment and think over this whole title -- "The
          Lord our righteousness." Brethren, the Law-giver has himself obeyed
          the law Do you not think that his obedience will be sufficient?
          Jehovah has himself become man that so he may do man's work: think you
          that he has done it imperfectly? Jehovah -- he who girds the angels
          that excel in strength -- has taken upon him the form of a servant
          that he may become obedient: think you that his service will be
          incomplete? Let the fact that the Saviour is Jehovah strengthen your
          confidence. Be ye bold. Be ye very courageous. Face heaven, and earth,
          and hell with the challenge of the apostle. "Who shall say anything to
          the charge of God's elect? "Look back upon your past sins, look upon
          your present infirmities, and all your future errors, and while you
          weep the tears of repentance, let no fear of damnation blanch your
          cheek. You stand before God to-day robed in your Saviour's garments,
          "with his spotless vestments on, holy as the Holy One." Not Adam when
          he walked in Eden's bowers was more accepted than you are, -- not more
          pleasing to the eye of the all-judging, the sin-hating God than you
          are if clothed in Jesus' righteousness and sprinkled with his blood.
          You have a better righteousness than Adam had. He had a human
          righteousness; your garments are divine. He had a robe complete, it is
          true, but the earth had woven it. You have a garment as complete, but
          heaven has made it for you to wear. Go up and down in the strength of
          this great truth and boast exceedingly, and glory in your God; and let
          this be on the top and summit of your heart and soul: "Jehovah, the
          Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          You will remember that in Scripture, Christ's righteousness is
          compared to fair white linen; then I am, if I wear it, without spot.
          It is compared to wrought gold; then I am, if I wear it, dignified and
          beautiful, and worthy to sit at the wedding feast of the King of
          kings. It is compared, in the parable of the prodigal son, to the best
          robe; then I wear a better robe than angels have, full they have not
          the best; but I, poor prodigal, once clothed in rage, companion to the
          nobility of the stye, -- I, fresh from the husks that swine do eat, am
          nevertheless clothed in the best robe, and am so accepted in the
          Beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is also everlasting righteousness. Oh! this is, perhaps,
          the fairest point of it -- that the robe be shall never be worn out;
          no thread of it shall ever give way. It shall never hang in tatters
          upon the sinner's back. He shall live, and even though it were a
          Methusaleh's life, the robe shall be as if it were woven yesterday. He
          shall pass through the stream of death, and the black stream shall not
          foul it. He shall climb the hills of heaven, and the angels shall
          wonder what this whiteness is which the sinner wears, and think that
          some new star is coming up from earth to thine in heaven. He shall
          wear it among principalities and powers, and find himself no whit
          inferior to them all. Cherubic garments and seraphic mantles shall not
          be so lordly so priestly, so divine, as this robe of righteousness
          this everlasting perfection which Christ has wrought out, and brought
          in and given to all his people. Glory unto thee, O Jesus, glory unto
          thee! Unto thee be hallels for ever; Hallelu -- jah! Thou art you --
          "Jehovah, the Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus expounded and vindicated this title of our Saviour, I
          would now APPEAL TO YOUR FAITH.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us call him so. "This is the name whereby he shall be called, the
          Lord our righteousness." Let us call him by this great name, which the
          mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath named. Let us call him -- poor
          sinners! -- even we, who are today smitten down with grief on account
          of sin. I want this text to be fulfilled in your ears and in your case
          to-day. You are guilty. Your own conscience acknowledges that the law
          condemns you, and you dread the penalty. Soul! he that trusteth Christ
          Jesus is saved, and he that believeth on him is not condemned. To
          every trustful spirit Christ is "the Lord our righteousness." Call him
          so, I pray thee. "I have no good thing of my own," sayest thou? Here
          is every good thing in him. "I have broken the law," sayest thou?
          There is his blood for thee. Believe in him, he will wash thee. "But
          then I have not kept the law. "There is his keeping of the law for
          thee. Take it, sinner, take it. Believe on him. "Oh, but I dare not,"
          saith one. Do him the honor to dare it. "Oh, but it seems impossible."
          Honour him by believing the impossibility then. "Oh, but how can he
          save such a wretch as I am?" Soul! Christ is glorified in saving
          wretches. As I told you the other day, Christ cures incurable sinners;
          so I say now he accepts unacceptable sinners. He receives sinners that
          think they are not fit to be received. Only do thou trust him and say,
          "He shall be my righteousness to-day." "But suppose I should do it and
          be presumptuous? It is impossible. He bids you, he commands you. Let
          that be your warrant. "This is the commandment, that ye believe on
          Jesus Christ whom he hath sent." If you cannot say it with a loud
          voice, yet with the trembling silence of your soul let heaven hear it.
          Yes, Jesus, "All unholy and unclean, I am nothing else but sin, yet I
          dare with fervent venture of these quivering lips to call thee, and to
          call upon thee now, as the Lord my righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          And you who have passed from a state of trembling hope into that of
          lively faith, I beseech you call him so. Let your faith say, as you
          see him suffering, bleeding, dying, "Thus my sins were washed away."
          But let not your faith stay there. As you see him sweating, toiling,
          living a self-denying laborious life, say, "Thus the law was kept for
          me." Come up to the foot of Sinai now, and if you see its lightnings
          flash, and hear its thunders roar, be brave, and say like Moses, "I
          will ascend above those thunders, I will stand enwrapped within the
          storm-cloud, and I will talk with God, for I have no cause for fear,
          there are no thunderbolts for me; for me no lightning flash can spend
          its arrow, I am perfectly, completely justified in the sight of God,
          through the righteousness of Jesus Christ." Say that, child of God!
          Does yesterday's sin make thee stammer? In the teeth of all thy sins
          believe that he is thy righteousness still. Thy good works do not
          improve his righteousness; thy bad works do not sully it. This is a
          robe which thy best deeds cannot mend and thy worst deeds cannot mar.
          Thou standest in him, not in thyself. Whatever, then, thy doubts and
          fears may have been, do now, poor troubled, distressed, distracted
          believer, say again, "Yes, he is the Lord my righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          And some of us can say it yet better than that: for we can say it not
          merely by faith, but by fruition. We remember well the day when we
          first called him "the Lord our righteousness." Oh, the peace it
          brought, the joy, the gladness, the transport! Since then we have
          proved it to he true, for we have had privileges we could not have had
          if he had not been our righteousness. We have had the privilege of
          reconciliation with God; and He could not be reconciled to one that
          had not a perfect righteousness, we have had access with boldness to
          God himself, and He would never have suffered us to have access if we
          had not worn our brother's garments. We have had adoption into the
          family, and the Spirit of adoption, and God could not have adopted
          into his family any but righteous ones. How should the righteous
          Father be God of an unrighteous family? Our prayers have been heard,
          and we have had gracious answers, and that could not have been -- for
          he could not heal the prayer of the wicked; he could not have heard us
          -- if it had not been that he seemed to hear Christ crying through us,
          and to have seen Christ's merits in us. And therefore granted the
          desire of our hearts. We have had in daily rich and sweet experience
          such manifestations of fellowship with the Father and with his Son
          Jesus Christ, that to us it is a matter of fact as well as a matter of
          faith, a matter of praise as well as a matter of profession, that
          Jesus Christ is "the Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, your divinity must be experimental or it will not profit
          you. I would not give a straw for your theology if you learned it
          merely out of a pollee, or out of a system of man's teaching. No, no,
          we must prove these things to be true in our lives. I can say it, and
          I must say it -- the testimony is not egotistical -- I know there is a
          comfort in the faith of Christ's imputed righteousness which no other
          doctrine can yield. There is something that a man can sleep on and
          wake on, can live on and die on, in the firm conviction that he is
          received by God as though the deeds of Christ were his deeds, and the
          righteousness of Christ his righteousness. Take away his filthy
          garments from him, set a fair mitre on his head, array him in fine
          linen. O, Joshua, priest of the Most High, thou man greatly beloved,
          come thou forth now in thy garments and offer acceptable sacrifice,
          seeing, thou wearest the garments of Jesus, our great High Priest."
          Let us, then, call upon his name and extol him in our worship as "the
          Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let the whole universal Church of Christ, in one glad song,
          call Jesus Christ the Lord their righteousness. Wake up, ye isles of
          the sea; shout, thou wilderness that Kedar doth inhabit; ye people of
          God, scattered and peeled, banished among the heathen, vexed with the
          filthy conversation of the idolaters, from your huts, from the
          destitute places that ye inhabit, sing, "The Lord our righteousness!"
          Let no heir of heaven be silent at this hour; let every soul be
          stirred. Though tempest-tossed and half a wreck, yet, mariner in
          Christ, say, "Thou art the Lord my righteousness." Though cast down
          into the deep dungeon, thou despairing soul, yet say, "The Lord my
          righteousness." Let no one of the entire believing family keel; back
          his song but together let us sing, "The Lord our righteousness." And
          you, ye spirits that walk in white, ye glorious ones that "day without
          night circle his throne rejoicing," ye saints that ere his day beheld
          him, and died, not having received the promise, but having beheld it
          afar off, -- Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and Samuel, and
          Jephthah, and David, and Solomon, and all the mighty host, sing ye,
          sing ye, sing ye unto him to-day; and let this be the summit of your
          song, "The Lord our righteousness." Our spirit bows before him now.
          Sweet fellowship beyond the stream! Me clasp our hands with those that
          went before; and while the cherubim can only say, "Holy, holy, holy;
          he is righteous," we lift up a higher note, and say, "yes, thrice
          holy, but the Lord our righteousness is he." Let none, then, of all
          his saints in heaven and in earth, refuse to call him "the Lord our
          righteousness"
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I now conclude, in the third place, by appealing to your
          GRATITUDE. Let us admire that wonderful and reigning grace which has
          led you and me to call him, "The Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          When I look back some ten or twelve years upon a foolish boy, who
          cared little for the things of God, who was burdened with an awful
          sense of sin, and thought that he never could be pardoned -- clad so
          often driven to the borders of despair that he was fain to make away
          with his own life, because he thought there was no happiness on earth
          for him -- I can only say for my own self. O the riches of the grace
          of God in Christ, that ever I should stand not only conscious that he
          is the Lord my righteousness, but to preach him to you! O God, thou
          hast done wonderful things! Thou saidst by the mouth of Jeremy, "This
          is the name whereby he shall be called." I call him so this day from
          my inmost soul. Jesus of Nazareth! suffering man! glorious God! thou
          art the Lord my righteousness! If I were to pass this question round
          these galleries, and down below oh, what hundreds of responses would
          there be from such as joyously obey the summons of gratitude! And
          among those about to be added to the Church (I am sure they would
          permit me to tell, for the honor of the glorious grace of God), there
          are very many who are special instances of that grace which has
          sweetly constrained them to call Christ their righteousness. Some of
          them, according to their own concession before us at the Church
          meeting, were not only revelling in drunkenness, one until he had well
          nigh drank away his reason by thirty years of habitual intoxication;
          but others of them were unclean and unchaste, till they had rioted in
          debauchery, and gone to the utmost lengths of crime. There be many in
          this place to-day, who would not, though they would blush for the
          past, refuse to tell, to the honor of redeeming grace, that once they
          had committed every crime in the catalogue except murder; and if they
          have not committed that, it was nothing but the sovereign grace of God
          that restrained them. Some members of this Church have sinned in every
          part of the world -- have sinned in every quarter of the globe -- have
          committed every form of lust and vice -- and if you had asked them ten
          years ago whether they should ever be in a place of worship, they
          would have repelled with an oath what they would have thought an
          insult, and would have cursed you for supposing that they should so
          degrade themselves as to profess the faith of Christ. Brothers and
          sisters, I should not be surprised if you were to stand up now and
          say, "Yes, still Jehovah Jesus is the Lord our righteousness." Oh! --
        </p>
        <p>"Wonders of grace to God belong;</p>
        <p>Repeat his mercies in your song."</p>
        <p>
          Who would have thought that the lip of the blasphemer should fulfill
          that very prophecy -- that the tongue that could scarce move without
          an oath should, nevertheless, glorify Christ, -- that the heart that
          was black with accumulated lust, -- the mouth which must have become a
          very sepulcher, breathing forth deadly miasma, has now become a place
          for song, and the heart a house for music, while heart and tongue say,
          "Yes, he is the Lord my righteousness this very day!"
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be a wonder if God should vow that the devils should yet sing
          his praise; but I do not think it would be a greater wonder than when
          he makes some of us sing his glorious praise. Brethren, you and I know
          that there is nothing in freewill doctrine; for in our case, at any
          rate, it was not true. Left to ourselves, where should we have been?
          What could Arminianism have done for us? Oh, no! it was irresistible
          grace that brought us to call him "the Lord our righteousness." It was
          that divine shall that broke in pieces our will. It was that strong
          arm that broke the iron sinew of our proud neck, and made us bow, even
          us, who would not have this man to reign over as. It was his finger
          that opened the blind eye; for once we could see now beauty in him. It
          was his breath that thawed our icy heart; for once we felt no love to
          him; --
        </p>
        <p>"But now, subdued by sovereign grace,</p>
        <p>Our spirit longs for his embrace;</p>
        <p>Our beauty this our glorious dress,</p>
        <p>Jesus the Lord our righteousness."</p>
        <p>
          And this shall be our glory here, and our song forever -- "The Lord
          our righteousness."<br />
