        <p>
          The learned editors of the Edinburgh series have given us only a
          specimen of these frauds, which, pretending to be a series of "papal
          edicts" from Clement and his successors during the ante-Nicene ages,
          are, in fact, the manufactured product of the ninth century, -- the
          most stupendous imposture of the world's history, the most successful
          and the most stubborn in its hold upon enlightened nations. Like the
          mason's framework of lath and scantlings, on which he turns an arch of
          massive stone, the Decretals served their purpose, enabling Nicholas
          I. to found the Papacy by their insignificant aid. That swelling arch
          of vanity once reared, the framework might be knocked out; but the
          fabric stood, and has borne up every weight imposed upon it for ages.
          Its strong abutments have been ignorance and despotism. Nicholas
          produced his flimsy framework of imposture, and amazed the whole
          Church by the audacity of the claims he founded upon it. The age,
          however, was unlearned and uncritical; and, in spite of remonstrances
          from France under lead of Hincmar, bishop of Rheims, the West
          patiently submitted to the overthrow of the ancient Canons and the
          Nicene Constitutions, and bowed to the yoke of a new canon-law, of
          which these frauds were not only made an integral, but the essential,
          part. The East never accepted them for a moment: her great
          patriarchates retain the Nicene System to this day. But, as the
          established religion of the "Holy Roman Empire," the national churches
          of Western Europe, one by one, succumbed to this revolt from historic
          Catholicity. The Eastern churches were the more numerous. They stood
          by the Constitutions confirmed by all the OEcumenical Synods; they
          altered not a word of the Nicene Creed; they stood up for the great
          Catholic law, "Let the ancient customs prevail;" and they were, and
          are to this day, the grand historic stem of Christendom. The Papacy
          created the Western schism, and contrived to call it "the schism of
          the Greeks." The Decretals had created the Papacy, and they enabled
          the first Pope to assume that communion with himself was the test of
          Catholic communion: hence his excommunication of the Easterns, which,
          after brief intervals of relaxation, settled into the chronic schism
          of the Papacy, and produced the awful history of the mediæval Church
          in Western Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          In naming Nicholas I. as the founder of the Papacy, and the first
          Pope, I merely reach the logical consequence of admitted facts and
          demonstrated truths. I merely apply the recognised principles of
          modern thought and scientific law to the science of history, and
          dismiss the technology of empiricism in this science, as our age has
          abolished similar empiricisms in the exact sciences. For ages after
          Copernicus, even those who basked in the light of the true system of
          the universe went on in the old ruts, talking as if the Ptolemaic
          theory were yet a reality: and so the very historians whose lucid
          pages explode the whole fabric of the Papal communion, still go on, in
          the language of fable, giving to the early Bishops of Rome the title
          of "Popes;" counting St. Peter as the first Pope; bewildering the
          student by many confusions of fact with fable; and conceding to the
          modern fabric of Romanism the name of "the Catholic Church," with all
          the immense advantages that accrue to falsehood by such a surrender of
          truth, and the consequent endowment of imposture with the raiment and
          the domain of Apostolic antiquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The student of this series must have noted the following fundamental
          facts: --
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the name papa was common to all bishops, and signified no
          pre-eminence in those who bore it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the Apostolic Sees were all equally accounted matrices of
          unity, and the roots of other Catholic churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That, down to the Council of Nicæa, the whole system of the Church
          was framed on this principle, and that these were the "ancient
          customs" which that council ordained to be perpetual.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That "because it was the old capital of the empire," and for no
          other reason (the Petrine idea never once mentioned), the primacy of
          honour was conceded to Old Rome, and equal honour to New Rome, because
          it was the new capital. It was to be named second on the list of
          patriarchates, but to be in no wise inferior to Old Rome; while the
          ancient and all-commanding patriarchate of Alexandria yielded this
          credit to the parvenu of Byzantium only on the principle of the
          Gospel, "in honour preferring one another," and only because the
          imperial capital must be the centre of Catholic concourse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the rest of the story must be sought in post-Nicene history. The
          salient points are as follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The mighty centralization about Constantinople; the three councils
          held within its walls; the virtual session of the other councils under
          its eaves; the inconsiderable figure of "Old Rome" in strictly
          ecclesiastical history; her barrenness of literature, and of great
          heroic sons, like Athanasius and Chrysostom in the East, and Cyprian
          and Augustine in the West; and her decadence as a capital, -- had led
          Leo I., and others after him, to dwell much upon "St. Peter," and to
          favour new ideas of his personal greatness, and of a transmitted
          grandeur as the inheritance of his successors. As yet, these were but
          "great swelling words of vanity;" but they led to the formulated fraud
          of the Decretals.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Ambition once entering the pale of Catholicity, we find a counter
          idea to that of the councils at the root of the first usurpation of
          unscriptural dignity. John "the Faster," bishop of New Rome, conceived
          himself not merely equal (as the councils had decreed) to the bishop
          of Old Rome, but his superior, in view of the decrepitude of the
          latter, and its occupation by the Goths, while the imperial dignity of
          Constantinople was now matured. He called himself "OEcumenical
          Bishop."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Gregory was then bishop of "Old Rome," and that was the time to
          assert the principle of the Decretals, had any such idea ever been
          heard of. How did he meet his brother's arrogance? Not appealing to
          decretals, not by asserting that such was his own dignity derived from
          St. Peter, but by protesting against such abasement of all the other
          patriarchs and all other bishops (who were all equals), and by
          pronouncing the impious assumption of such a nefarious title to denote
          a "forerunner of Antichrist." Plainly, then, there was no "Pope" known
          to Christendom at the close of the sixth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But hardly was Gregory in his grave when court policy led the
          Emperor Phocas (one of the most infamous of men) to gratify the wicked
          ambition of the new Bishop of Rome by giving to him the titular honour
          of being a "forerunner of Antichrist." Boniface III. (607 a.d.)
          assumed the daring title of "Universal Bishop." But it was a mere
          court-title: the Church never recognised it; and so it went down to
          his successors as mere "sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal" till the
          days of Charlemagne.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In his times the Petrine fable had grown upon the Western mind. All
          Western Europe had but one Apostolic See. As "the Apostolic See" it
          was known throughout the West, just as "the Post-Office" means that
          which is nearest to one's own dwelling. What was geographically true,
          had grown to be theologically false, however; and the Bishop of Rome
          began to consider himself the only inheritor of Apostolic precedency,
          if not of all Apostolic authority and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The formation of the Western Empire favoured this assumption: but
          it did not take definite shape while Charlemagne lived, for he
          regarded himself, like Constantine, the "head of the Church;" and in
          his day he acted as supreme pontiff, called the Council of Frankfort,
          overruled the Roman bishop, and, in short, was a lay-Pope throughout
          his empire. That nobody refused him all he claimed, that Adrian
          "couched like a strong ass" under the burden of his rebukes, and that
          Leo paid him bodily "homage," demonstrated that no such character as a
          "Pope" was yet in existence. Leo III. had personally "adored"
          Charlemagne with the homage afterwards rendered to the pontiffs, and
          Adrian had set him the example of personal submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But, Charlemagne's feeble sons and successors proving incapable of
          exercising his power, the West only waited for an ambitious and
          original genius to come to the See of Rome, to yield him all that
          Charlemagne had claimed, and to invest him with the more sacred
          character of the Apostolic head to the whole Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Such a character arose in Nicholas I. He found the Decretals made
          to his hand by some impostor, and he saw a benighted age ready to
          accept his assumptions. He therefore used them, and passed them into
          the organic canon-law of the West. The "Holy Roman Empire" reluctantly
          received the impious frauds the East contemptuously resisted. Thus the
          Papacy was formed on the base of the "Holy Roman Empire," and
          arrogated to itself the right to cut off and anathematize the greater
          part of Christendom, with the old patriarchal Sees. So we have in
          Nicholas the first figure in history in whose person is concentrated
          what Rome means by the Papacy. No "Pope" ever existed previously, in
          the sense of her canon-law; and it was not till two centuries longer
          that even a "Pope" presumed to pronounce that title peculiar to the
          Bishop of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, then, are the historical facts, which render vastly important
          some study of the Decretals. I shall give what follows exclusively
          from "Roman-Catholic" sources. Says the learned Dupin: --
        </p>
        <p>
          1. All these Decretals were unknown to all the ancient Fathers, to all
          the Popes and all the ecclesiastical authors that wrote before the
          ninth century. Now, what rational man can believe that so vast a
          number of letters, composed by so many holy Popes, containing so many
          important points in relation to the discipline of the Church, could be
          unknown to Eusebius, to St. Jerome, to St. Augustine, to St. Basil,
          and, in short, to all those authors that have spoken of their
          writings, or who have written upon the discipline of the Church? Could
          it possibly happen that the Popes, to whom these epistles are so very
          favourable, would never have cited and alleged them to aggrandize
          their own reputation? Who could ever imagine that the decisions of
          these Decretals should be never so much as quoted in any council or in
          any canon? He that will seriously consider with himself, that, since
          these Decretals have been imposed upon the world, they have been cited
          in an infinite number of places by Popes, by councils, and as often by
          canonists, will be readily convinced that they would have acquired
          immense credit, and been very often quoted by antiquity, if they had
          been genuine and true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I must direct attention to the all-important fact, that whatever
          may have been the authorship of these forgeries, the Roman pontiffs,
          and the "Roman Catholic" communion as such, have committed themselves
          over and over again to the fraud, as Dupin remarks above, and that,
          long after the imposture was demonstrated and exposed; in proof of
          which I cite the following, from one whose eyes were opened by his
          patient investigation of such facts, but who, while a member of the
          Roman communion, wrote to his co-religionist Cardinal Manning as
          follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it credible that the Papacy should have so often appealed to these
          forgeries for its extended claims, had it any better authorities --
          distinctive authorities -- to fall back upon? Every disputant on the
          Latin side finds in these forgeries a convincing argument against the
          Greeks. To prove this,' the universal jurisdiction of the Pope, said
          Abbot Barlaam, himself converted by them from the Greek Church, to
          convert his countrymen, one need only look through the decretal
          epistles of the Roman pontiffs from St. Clement to St. Sylvester.' In
          the twenty-fifth session of the Council of Florence the provincial of
          the Dominicans is ordered to address the Greeks on the rights of the
          Pope, the Pope being present. Twice he argues from the pseudo-decretal
          of St. Anacletus, at another time from a synodical letter of St.
          Athanasius to Felix, at another time from a letter of Julius to the
          Easterns, all forgeries. Afterwards, in reply to objections taken by
          Bessarion, in conference, to their authority, apart from any question
          of their authenticity, his position in another speech is, that those
          decretal epistles of the Popes, being synodical epistles in each case,
          are entitled to the same authority as the Canons themselves.' Can we
          need further evidence of the weight attached to them on the Latin
          side?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Popes appealed to them in their official capacity, as well as private
          doctors; (1) Leo IX., for instance, to the pseudo-donation in the
          prolix epistle written by him, or in his name, to Michael Cerularius,
          patriarch of Constantinople, on the eve of the schism. (2) Eugenius
          IV. to the pseudo-decretals of St. Alexander and Julius, during the
          negotiations for healing it, in his instructions to the Armenians. (3)
          But why, my lord, need I travel any further for proofs, when in the
          Catechism of the Council of Trent, that has been for three centuries
          the accredited instructor of the clergy themselves, recommended
          authoritatively by so many Popes, notwithstanding the real value of
          these miserable impostures had been for three centuries before the
          world, I find these words: On the primacy of the Supreme Pontiff, see
          the third epistle (that is, pseudo-decretal) of Anacletus'! Such is,
          actually, the authority to which the clergy of our own days are
          referred, in the first instance, for sound and true views on the
          primacy. (4) Afterwards, when they have mastered what is said there,
          they may turn to three more authorities, all culled likewise from
          Gratian, which they will not fail to interpret in accordance with the
          ideas they have already imbibed. Nor can I refrain from calling
          attention to a much more flagrant case. On the sacrament of
          confirmation there had been many questions raised by the Reformers,
          calculated to set people thinking, and anxious to know the strict
          truth respecting it. On this the Catechism proceeds as follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          "Since it has been already shown how necessary it would be to teach
          generally respecting all the sacraments, by whom they were instituted,
          so there is need of similar instruction respecting confirmation, that
          the faithful may be the more attracted by the holiness of this
          sacrament. Pastors must therefore explain that not only was Christ our
          Lord the author of it, but that, on the authority of the Roman pontiff
          St. Fabian (i.e., the pseudo-decretal attributed to him), He
          instituted the rite of the chrism, and the words used by the Catholic
          Church in its administration.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "Strange phenomenon, indeed, that the asseverations of such
          authorities should be still ordered to be taught as Gospel from our
          pulpits in these days, when everybody that is acquainted with the
          merest rudiments of ecclesiastical history knows how absolutely
          unauthenticated they are in point of fact, and how unquestionably the
          authorities cited to prove them are forgeries.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Absolutely, my lord, with such evidence before me, I am unable to
          resist the inference that truthfulness is not one of the strongest
          characteristics of the teaching of even the modern Church of Rome; for
          is not this a case palpably where its highest living authorities are
          both indifferent to having possible untruths preached from the pulpit,
          and something more than indifferent to having forgeries, after their
          detection as such, adduced from the pulpit to authenticate facts?
        </p>
        <p>
          "This, again, strongly reminds me of a conversation I had with the
          excellent French priest who received me into the Roman-Catholic
          Church, some time subsequently to that event. I had, as an Anglican,
          inquired very laboriously into the genuineness of the Santa Casa: and
          having visited Nazareth and Loretto since, and plunged into the
          question anew at each place, came back more thoroughly convinced than
          ever of its utterly fictitious character, notwithstanding the
          privileges bestowed upon it by so many Popes. On stating my
          convictions to him, his only reply was: There are many things in the
          Breviary which I do not believe, myself.' Oh the stumbling-blocks of a
          system in the construction of which forgeries have been so largely
          used, in which it is still thought possible for the clergy to derive
          edification from legends which they cannot believe, and the people
          instruction from works of acknowledged imposture!
        </p>
        <p>Further, Dupin remarks: --</p>
        <p>
          "The first man that published them, if we may believe Hincmar, was one
          Riculphus, bishop of Mentz, who died about the ninth century. It is
          commonly believed, seeing the collection bears the name of Isidore,
          that he brought them from Spain. But it never could have been composed
          by the great Archbishop of Seville; and there is great reason to
          believe that no Spaniard, but rather some German or Frenchman, began
          this imposture,
        </p>
        <p>
          "It likewise seems probable that some of these Decretals have been
          foisted in since the time of Riculphus. Benedict, a deacon of the
          church of Mentz, who made a collection of canons for the successors of
          Riculphus, may have put the last hand to this collection of false
          Decretals attributed to one Isidore, a different person from the
          famous Bishop of Seville, and surnamed Peccator, or Mercator. About
          his time a certain Isidore did come from Spain, along with some
          merchants, and then withdrew to Mentz. Not improbably, therefore, this
          man's name was given to the collection, and it was naturally believed
          that it was brought from Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And since these letters first appeared in an unlearned, dark age,
          what wonder is it that they were received with very little opposition?
          And yet Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims, with other French bishops, made
          great difficulty in accepting them, even in that time. Soon after,
          however, they acquired some authority, owing to the support of the
          court of Rome, the pretensions of which they mightily favoured.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the twin imposture of the "Donation of Constantine," it may be well
          to cite the same learned authority. But this shall be found elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me now recur to the same candid Gallican doctor, Dupin, who
          remarks as follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          "2. The imposture of these letters is invincibly proved from hence:
          because they are made up of a contexture of passages out of Fathers,
          councils, papal epistles, and imperial ordinances, which have appeared
          after the third century, down to the middle of the ninth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "3. The citations of Scripture in all these letters follow the Vulgate
          of St. Jerome, which demonstrates that they are since his time
          (a.d.420), and consequently do not proceed from Popes who lived long
          before St. Jerome.
        </p>
        <p>
          "4. The matter of these letters is not at all in keeping with the ages
          when those to whom they are attributed were living.
        </p>
        <p>
          "5. These Decretals are full of anachronisms. The consulships and
          names of consuls mentioned in them are confused and out of order; and,
          moreover, the true dates of the writers themselves, as Bishops of
          Rome, do not agree with those assumed in these letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          "6. Their style is extremely barbarous, full of solecisms; and in them
          we often meet with certain words never used till the later ages. Also,
          they are all of one style! How does it happen that so many different
          Popes, living in divers centuries, should all write in the same
          manner?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Dupin then goes on to examine the whole series with learning and
          candour, showing that every single one of them "carries with it
          unequivocal signs of lying and imposture." To his pages let the
          student recur, therefore. I follow him in the following enumeration of
          the frauds he calmly exposes with searching logic and demonstration:
          --
        </p>
        <p>
          1. St. Clement to St. James the Lord's Brother. -- Plainly spurious.
        </p>
        <p>2. The Second Epistle of Clement to the Same. -- Equally so.</p>
        <p>
          3. St. Clement to all Suffragan Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and Others
          of the Clergy: to all Princes Great and Small, and to all the
          Faithful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dupin remarks: "This very title suffices to prove the forgery, as, in
          the days of St. Clement, there were no "princes great or small" in the
          Church." He adds that it speaks of "subdeacons," an order not then
          existing, and that it is patched up from scraps of the apocryphal
          Recognitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A Fourth Letter of the Same. It is self-refuted by "the same
          reasons."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The Fifth Letter to St. James of St. Clement, Bishop of Rome and
          Successor of St. Peter.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," says Dupin, "as St. James died before St. Peter, it necessarily
          follows, that this epistle cannot have been written by St. Clement."
          Further, "We have one genuine epistle of St. Clement, the style of
          which is wholly different from that of these Decretals."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The Epistle of Anacletus. -- Barbarous, full of solecisms and
          falsehoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. A Second Epistle of Anacletus. -- Filled with passages out of
          authors who lived long after the times of Anacletus.
        </p>
        <p>8. A Third Letter, etc.. -- Spurious for the same reasons.</p>
        <p>
          9. An Epistle of Evaristus. -- Patched up out of writings of Innocent
          in the fifth century, dated under consuls not contemporaries of the
          alleged writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. A Second Epistle of the Same. -- Stuffed with patchwork of later
          centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. An Epistle of Alexander. -- Contains passages from at least one
          author of the eighth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. A Second Epistle of the Same. -- Refers to the Council of
          Laodicea, which was held (a.d.365) after Alexander was dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. A Third Epistle, etc. -- Quotes an author of the fifth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. An Epistle of Xystus. -- Dated under a consul that lived in
          another age, and quotes authors of centuries later than his own day.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. A Second Epistle of the Same. -- Subject to the same objections,
          anachronisms, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          16. An Epistle of Telesphorus. -- False dates, patched from subsequent
          authors, etc.
        </p>
        <p>17. An Epistle of Hyginus. -- Anachronisms, etc.</p>
        <p>
          18. A Second of the Same. -- Stuffed with anachronisms, and falsely
          dated by consuls not of his age.
        </p>
        <p>
          19. An Epistle of Pius I. -- Full of absurdities, and quotes "the
          Theodosian Code"!
        </p>
        <p>
          20. A Second. -- It is addressed to Justus, etc. Bad Latin, and wholly
          unknown to antiquity, though Baronius has tried to sustain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. A Third Letter, etc. -- Addressed to Justus, bishop of Vienna.
          False for the same reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          22. An Epistle of Anicetus. -- Full of blunders as to dates, etc.
          Mentions names, titles, and the like, unheard of till later ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          23. An Epistle of Soter. -- Dated under consuls who lived before Soter
          was bishop of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          24. A Second Letter, etc. -- Speaks of "monks," "palls," and other
          things of later times; is patched out of writings of subsequent ages,
          and dated under consuls not his contemporaries.
        </p>
        <p>25. An Epistle of Eleutherus. -- Subject to like objections.</p>
        <p>26. A Second Letter, etc. -- Anachronisms.</p>
        <p>
          27. A Third Letter, etc. -- Addressed to "Desiderius, bishop of
          Vienna." There was no such bishop till the sixth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          28. A Fourth Letter, etc. -- Quotes later authors, and is disproved by
          its style.
        </p>
        <p>
          29. An Epistle of Zephyrinus. -- Little importance to be attached to
          anything from such a source; but Dupin (who lived before his bad
          character came to light in the writings of Hippolytus) convicts it of
          ignorance, and shows that it is a patchwork of later ideas and
          writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          30. A Second Letter. -- "Yet more plainly an imposture," says Dupin.
        </p>
        <p>
          31. An Epistle of St. Callistus. -- What sort of a "saint" he was, our
          readers are already informed. This epistle is like the preceding ones
          of Zephyrinus.
        </p>
        <p>
          32. A Second Epistle, etc. -- Quotes from writings of the eighth
          century.
        </p>
        <p>
          33. An Epistle of Urban. -- Quotes the Vulgate, the Theodosian Code,
          and Gregory the Fourth.
        </p>
        <p>34. An Epistle of Pontianus. -- Anachronisms.</p>
        <p>35. A Second Epistle, etc. -- Barbarous and impossible.</p>
        <p>
          36. An Epistle of Anterus. -- Equally impossible; stuffed with
          anachronisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          37. An Epistle of Fabianus. -- Contradicts the facts of history
          touching Cyprian, Cornelius, and Novatus.
        </p>
        <p>
          38. A Second Epistle, etc. -- Self-refuted by its monstrous details of
          mistake and the like.
        </p>
        <p>39. A Third Epistle, etc. -- Quotes authors of the sixth century.</p>
        <p>
          40. An Epistle of Cornelius. -- Contradicts historical facts, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          41. A Second Epistle, etc. -- Equally full of blunders. "But nothing,"
          says Dupin, "shows the imposture of these two letters more palpably
          than the difference of style from those truly ascribed to Cornelius in
          Cyprian's works."
        </p>
        <p>
          42. A Third Letter, etc. -- Equally false on its face. Dupin, with his
          usual candour, remarks: "We find in it the word Mass,' which was
          unknown to the contemporaries of Cornelius."
        </p>
        <p>
          43. An Epistle of Lucius. -- It is dated six months before he became
          Bishop of Rome, and quotes authors who lived ages after he was dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          44. An Epistle of Stephen. -- "Filled with citations out of subsequent
          authors."
        </p>
        <p>
          45. A Second Epistle, etc. -- Open to the like objection; it does not
          harmonize with the times to which it is referred.
        </p>
        <p>Here Dupin grows weary, and winds up his review as follows: --</p>
        <p>
          For like reasons, we must pass judgment, in like manner, on the two
          Epistles of Sixtus II.; the two of Dionysius; the three of St. Felix
          I; the two of Eutychianus; one of Caius; two of Marcellinus and those
          of Marcellus; the three of Eusebius; those of Miltiades, and the rest
          of Isidore's collection: they are full of passages out of Fathers,
          Popes, and councils, more modern than the very Popes by whom they are
          pretended to be written. In them are many things that clash with the
          known history of those times, and were purposely framed to favour the
          court of Rome and to sustain her pretensions against the rights of
          bishops and the liberties of churches. But it would take up too much
          time to show the gross falsehood of these monuments. They are now
          rejected by common consent, and even by those authors who are most
          favourable to the court of Rome, who are obliged to abandon the
          patronage of these epistles, though they have done a great deal of
          service in developing the greatness of the court of Rome, and ruining
          the ancient discipline of the Church, especially with reference to the
          rights of bishops and ecclesiastical decisions.
        </p>
        <p>The following is the Translator's Preface to these frauds: --</p>
        <p>
          In regard to these Decretals, Dean Milman says: "Up to this period the
          Decretals, the letters or edicts of the Bishops of Rome, according to
          the authorized or common collection of Dionysius, commenced with Pope
          Siricius, towards the close of the fourth century. To the collection
          of Dionysius was added that of the authentic councils, which bore the
          name of Isidore of Seville. On a sudden was promulgated, unannounced,
          without preparation, not absolutely unquestioned, but apparently
          overawing at once all doubt, a new code, which to the former authentic
          documents added fifty-nine letters and decrees of the twenty oldest
          popes from Clement to Melchiades, and the donation of Constantine; and
          in the third part, among the decrees of the popes and of the councils
          from Sylvester to Gregory II., thirty-nine false decrees, and the acts
          of several unauthentic councils."
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the authorship and date of the False Decretals, Dean
          Milman says: "The author or authors of this most audacious and
          elaborate of pious frauds are unknown; the date and place of its
          compilation are driven into such narrow limits that they may be
          determined within a few years, and within a very circumscribed region.
          The False Decretals came not from Rome; the time of their arrival at
          Rome, after they were known beyond the Alps, appears almost certain.
          In one year Nicholas I. is apparently ignorant of their existence; the
          next he speaks of them with full knowledge. They contain words
          manifestly used at the Council of Paris, a.d.829, consequently are of
          later date. They were known to the Levite Benedict of Mentz, who
          composed a supplement to the collection of capitularies by Ansegise,
          between a.d.840-847. The city of Mentz is designated with nearly equal
          certainty as the place in which, if not actually composed, they were
          first promulgated as the canon law of Christendom."
