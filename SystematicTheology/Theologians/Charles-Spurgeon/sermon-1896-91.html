          6. Set thou over him a wicked person; and let the adversary stand at
          his right hand.7. When he is judged, let him depart guilty, and let
          his prayer be turned into sin. 8. Let his days be few: and let another
          receive his office.9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a
          widow: 10. And let his children wander without any settled habitation,
          and let them be beggars, and let them seek food out of their waste
          places. 11. Let the extortioner seize all that belongs to him, and let
          strangers spoil his labor.

          6 Set thou over him a wicked person. Hitherto he poured out his
          complaint against a vast number of persons; now he seems to direct it
          against a single individual. Probably he speaks of each of them
          individually. It is, however, equally probable that he refers in very
          marked terms to some one in particular among these wicked persons, the
          most notorious transgressor of any of them. Some conjecture, and not
          without reason, that Doeg is the person here aimed at, who, by his
          treason and revolt, sought to bring ruin, not only upon David, but
          also upon all the holy priests; and we know that this psalm is applied
          by Peter to Judas, (Acts 1:20) But with equal propriety, and certainly
          not less forcibly, may this complaint be considered as applicable to
          some most intimate and particular friend of the Psalmist. Respecting
          the imprecations contained in this psalm, it will be proper to keep in
          mind what I have said elsewhere, that when David forms such
          maledictions, or expresses his desires for them, he is not instigated
          by any immoderate carnal propensity, nor is he actuated by zeal
          without knowledge, nor is he influenced by any private personal
          considerations. These three matters must be carefully weighed, for in
          proportion to the amount of self-esteem which a man possesses, is he
          so enamoured with his own interests as to rush headlong upon revenge.
          Hence it comes to pass, that the more a person is devoted to
          selfishness, he will be the more immoderately addicted to the
          advancement of his own individual interests. This desire for the
          promotion of personal interest gives birth to another species of vice.
          For no one wishes to be avenged upon his enemies because that such a
          thing would be right and equitable, but because it is the means of
          gratifying his own spiteful propensity. Some, indeed, make a pretext
          of righteousness and equity in the matter, but the spirit of
          malignity, by which they are inflamed, effaces every trace of justice,
          and blinds their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          When these two vices, selfishness and carnality, are corrected, there
          is still another thing demanding correction, the repressing the ardor
          of foolish zeal, in order that we may follow the Spirit of God as our
          guide. Should any one, under the influence of perverse zeal, produce
          David as an example of it, that would not be an example in point; for
          to such a person may be very aptly applied the answer which Christ
          returned to his disciples, "Ye know not what spirit ye are of," Luke
          9:55. How detestable a piece of sacrilege is it on the part of the
          monks, and especially the Franciscan friars, to pervert this psalm by
          employing it to countenance the most nefarious purposes! If a man
          harbour malice against a neighbor, it is quite a common thing for him
          to engage one of these wicked wretches to curse him, which he would do
          by daily repeating this psalm. I know a lady in France who hired a
          parcel of these friars to curse her own and only son in these words.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I return to David, who, free from all inordinate passion, breathed
          forth his prayers under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Then, as to
          the ungodly, who live as the contemners of God, and who are constantly
          plotting the overthrow of the unsuspecting and the good, casting off
          all restraint, so that neither modesty nor honesty proves a check to
          them, surely they are deserving of the punishment of having a wicked
          person set over them And since, by means of intrigue and perfidy, they
          are constantly aiming at the extermination of the good, they are most
          justly punished by God, who raises up against them an adversary that
          should never depart from their side. Only let believers be on their
          guard, lest they should betray too much haste in their prayers, and
          let them rather leave room for the grace of God to manifest itself in
          their behalf; because it may turn out that the man, who to-day bears
          towards us a deadly enmity, may by to-morrow through that grace become
          our friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          7 When he is judged, let him depart guilty Another imprecation is,
          that, being summoned to judgment, he might be punished without mercy,
          and that, though he humbly crave forgiveness, the judge should remain
          inexorable. This might with propriety be understood to relate not
          merely to his being judged at the bar of men, but also at the tribunal
          of God. But as it accords very well with the decisions awarded by an
          earthly judge, and as this is the commonly received interpretation, I
          have no wish to depart from it. There are two things which must be
          noticed here; that the wickedness of the wicked may be so palpable as
          to leave no room to escape from the execution of justice, and that all
          their entreaties for pardon may be disregarded. Accordingly, the
          Psalmist represents him as a condemned criminal leaving the presence
          of the judge, bearing the ignominy of the condemnation which he
          righteously merited, having his nefarious deeds disclosed and
          detected. With respect to the other interpretation which places the
          ungodly before God's judgment-seat, it by no means appears absurd to
          say that their prayers should be turned against them to sin, the more
          especially as we know that all their sacrifices are an abomination
          unto him. And by how much they themselves are filthy, by so much do
          all their plausible virtues become offensive and displeasing to God.
          But as the scope of the passage is in favor of that interpretation
          which applies it to earthly judges, I do not consider it necessary to
          insist farther upon this point.

          8 Let his days be few Although this world is the scene of much toil
          and trouble, yet we know that these are pledges and proofs of God's
          loving-kindness, inasmuch as he frequently, and as a token of his
          love, promises to prolong the lives of men; not that it is absolutely
          necessary for us to remain long here, but that we may have an
          opportunity of sharing of God's fatherly love which he bears towards
          us, by which we may be led to cherish the hope of immortality. Now, in
          opposition to this, the brevity of human life is here introduced as a
          mark of God's disapprobation; for when he cuts off the wicked after a
          violent manner, he thus testifies that they did not deserve to breathe
          the breath of life. And the same sentiment is inculcated when,
          denuding them of their honor and dignity, he hurls them from the place
          of power and authority. The same thing may also happen to the children
          of God, for temporal evils are common to the good and to the bad; at
          the same time, these are never so mingled and blended together, but
          that one may perceive occasionally the judgments of God in a very
          manifest and marked manner. Peter, quoting this verse, Acts 1:20, says
          it behoved to be fulfilled in Judas, because it is written here, "let
          another take his bishopric." And this, he does on the assumed
          principle of interpretation that David here spoke in the person of
          Christ. To this it cannot be objected, that the Hebrew term phqvdh,
          pekudah, signifies generally superintendence, because Peter very
          properly applies it to the apostleship of Judas. In expounding this
          passage, sometimes in reference to a wife, or to the soul, (which is a
          precious jewel in man,) or to wealth and property, there is good
          reason to believe that, in doing so, the Jewish interpreters are
          actuated by pure malice. What purpose can it serve to pervert the
          sense of a word, the meaning of which is so pointed and plain, unless
          that, under the influence of a malignant spirit, they endeavor so to
          obscure the passage, as to make it appear not to be properly quoted by
          Peter? From these words we learn, that there is no cause why the
          ungodly should be proud while their reputation is high in this world,
          seeing they cannot after all escape from that doom which the Holy
          Spirit here declares awaits them. Here too we are furnished with very
          valuable matter of comfort and patience, when we hear that, however
          elevated may be their rank and reputation now, their downfall is
          approaching, and that they will soon be stript of all their pomp and
          power. In the two succeeding verses the malediction is extended both
          to the wife and children; and the desire, that she may be left a widow
          and they become fatherless, depends upon the brevity of that life to
          which the prophet formerly adverted. Mention is likewise made of
          beggary, and the want of all the necessaries of life, which is a proof
          of the magnitude of their guilt; for assuredly the Holy Spirit would
          not denounce against them a punishment so grievous and heavy for a
          trivial offense. In delivering up his property as booty to the
          extortioners, David must be understood as alluding to the poverty
          which was to overtake his children; for he is not speaking of a poor
          and mean person who at his death can leave nothing to his family, but
          of one who, regardless of right or wrong, has amassed wealth to enrich
          his children, but from whom God takes away the goods which he had
          unrighteously taken from others.<br />
