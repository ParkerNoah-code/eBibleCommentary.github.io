<p align="center">Charles Spurgeon</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">PSALM 56<br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician. To the tune of "A dove 
    on distant Oaks".</b> That mighty minstrel by degrees acquired a noble 
    repertoire of hallowed songs, and set them all to music. </p>
<p align="justify">We have here the songs of God's servant, who rejoices 
    once more to return from banishment, and to leave those dangerous places 
    where he was compelled to be silent, even from good. There is such deep 
    spiritual knowledge in this Psalm that we might say of it, "Blessed are you 
    David Barjonas, for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you." When 
    David plays the Jonah he is not like the prophet of that name; in David the 
    love of the dove predominates, but in Jonah its moaning and complaining are 
    most notable. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">A Michtam of David.</p></b> This is the second golden Psalm, 
    we had the first in Psalm 16, to which this Psalm has a great likeness, 
    especially in its close, for it ends in the joyful presence. A golden 
    mystery, the gracious secret of the life of faith is in both these Psalms 
    most sweetly unveiled, and a pillar is set up because of God's truth. 
<b>
<p align="justify">When the Philistines took him in Gath</p></b>. He was like a 
    dove in strangers' hands, and on his escape he records his gratitude.
<p align="justify">DIVISION. In verses 1-2, he pours out his complaint;<br/>
    in verses 3-4 he declares his confidence in God; <br/>
    in verses 5-6 he returns to his complaining,<br/>
    but pleads in earnest hope in verses 7-9, <br/>
    and sings a grateful song from verse 10 to the close.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Be merciful unto me, O God.</p></b> In my deep 
    distress my soul turns to you, my God. Man has no mercy on me, therefore 
    double your mercy to me. If your justice has let loose my enemies, let your 
    mercy shorten their chain. It is sweet to see how the tender dove like 
    spirit of the psalmist flies to the most tender attribute for support in the 
    hour of peril. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For man would swallow me up.</p></b> He is but your creature, 
    a mere man—yet like a monster he is eager for blood, he pants, he gapes for 
    me; he would not merely wound me, or feed on my substance, but he would 
    gladly swallow me altogether, and so make an end of me. 
<p align="justify">The open mouths of sinners when they rage against us 
    should open our mouths in prayer. We may plead the cruelty of men, as a 
    reason for the divine interposition—a father is soon aroused when his 
    children are abusively treated. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He fighting daily oppresses me.</p></b> He gives me no 
    interval—he fights daily. He is successful in his unrighteous war—he 
    oppresses me, he crushes me, he presses me sore. David has his eye on the 
    leader of his foes, and lays his complaint against him in the right place.
<p align="justify">We may thus plead against man, much more against that 
    great enemy of souls, the devil. We ask the Lord to forgive us our 
    trespasses, which is another way of saying, "Be merciful to me, O God," and 
    then we may say, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil 
    one." The more violent the attack of Satan, the stronger our plea for 
    deliverance.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. My enemies would daily swallow me up.</p></b> Their 
    appetite for blood never fails them. With them there is no truce or 
    armistice. They are many, but one mind animates them. Nothing I can do can 
    make them relent. Unless they can quite devour me, they will never be 
    content. The ogres of nursery tales exist in reality in the enemies of the 
    church, who would crush the bones of the godly, and make a mouthful of them 
    if they could. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For there are many that fight against me.</p></b> Sinners are 
    gregarious creatures. Persecutors hunt in packs. These wolves of the church 
    seldom come down upon us singly. The number of our foes is a powerful plea 
    for the interposition of the one Defender of the faithful, who is mightier 
    than all their bands. 
<p align="justify">These foes of the gracious are also keen-eyed, and ever 
    on the watch, hence the margin calls them "observers." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O most High. </p></b>Thus he invokes against the lofty ones 
    of the earth the aid of one who is higher than the highest. Some translate 
    the words differently, and think that the writer means that his foes 
    assailed him from the high places in which pride and power had placed them. 
    Saul, his great foe, attacked him from his throne with all the force which 
    his high position placed at his disposal. Our comfort in such a case is near 
    to hand, for God will help us from a higher place than our proudest foes can 
    occupy. The greatness of God as the Most High is a fertile source of 
    consolation to weak saints oppressed by mighty enemies.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. When I am afraid.</p></b> David was no braggart, he 
    does not claim never to be afraid, and he was no brutish Stoic free from 
    fear because of the lack of tenderness. David's intelligence deprived him of 
    the stupid heedlessness of ignorance, he saw the imminence of his peril, and 
    was afraid. We are <i>men</i>, and therefore liable to overthrow. We are <i>
    feeble</i>, and therefore unable to prevent it. We are <i>sinful </i>men, 
    and therefore deserving it, and for all these reasons we are afraid. But the 
    condition of the psalmist's mind was complex—he feared, but that fear did 
    not fill the whole area of his mind, for he adds, <b>I will trust in you</b>.
    
<p align="justify">It is possible, then, for <i>fear </i>and <i>faith </i>to 
    occupy the mind at the same moment. We are strange beings, and our 
    experience in the divine life is stranger still. We are often in a twilight, 
    where light and darkness are both present, and it is hard to tell which 
    predominates. It is a blessed fear which drives us to trust. </p>
<p align="justify">Unregenerate fear drives from God—gracious fear drives to 
    him. If I fear man I have only to trust God, and I have the best antidote. 
    To trust when there is no cause for fear, is but the name of faith; but to 
    be reliant upon God when occasions for alarm are abundant and pressing, is 
    the conquering faith of God's elect.</p>
<p align="justify">Though the verse is in the form of a resolve, it became a 
    fact in David's life, let us make it so in ours. Whether the fear arises 
    from without or within, from past, present, or future, from temporals, or 
    spirituals, from men or devils—let us maintain faith, and we shall soon 
    recover courage.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. In God whose word I praise.</p></b> Faith brings 
    forth praise. He who can trust, will soon sing. God's promise, when 
    fulfilled, is a noble subject for praise, and even before fulfillment it 
    should be the theme of song. It is in or through God that we are able to 
    praise. We praise as well as pray, in the Spirit. Or we may read it—in 
    extolling the Lord one of the main points for thanksgiving is his revealed 
    will in the Scriptures, and the fidelity with which he keeps his word of 
    promise. 
<b>
<p align="justify">In God I have put my trust.</p></b> Altogether and alone 
    should we stay ourselves on God. What was a gracious resolve in the former 
    verse, is here asserted as already done. I will not fear what men can do 
    unto me. Faith exercised, fear is banished, and holy triumph ensues, so that 
    the soul asks, "What can man do unto me?" What indeed? He can do me no real 
    injury; all his malice shall be overruled for my good. Man is flesh, flesh 
    is grass—Lord, in your name I defy its utmost wrath. 
<p align="justify">There were two verses of complaint, and here are two of 
    confidence; it is well to weigh out a sufficient quantity of the sweet to 
    counteract the sour.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Every day they twist my words.</p></b> This is a 
    common mode of warfare among the ungodly. They put our language on the 
    rack—they extort meanings from it which it cannot be made fairly to contain. 
    Thus our Savior's prophecy concerning the temple of his body, and countless 
    accusations against his servants, were founded on <i>willful perversions</i>. 
    Those who do this every day become great adepts in the art. A wolf can 
    always find in a lamb's discourse a reason for eating him. Prayers are 
    blasphemies if you choose to read them the wrong way upwards. 
<b>
<p align="justify">All their thoughts are against me for evil.</p></b> No 
    mixture of good will tone down their malice. Whether they viewed him as a 
    king, a psalmist, a man, a father, a warrior, a sufferer—it was all the 
    same, they saw through colored glass, and could not think a kind thought 
    towards him. Even those actions of his which were an undoubted blessing to 
    the commonwealth, they endeavored to undervalue. Oh, foul spring, from which 
    never a drop of pure water can come!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. They gather themselves together.</p></b> Firebrands 
    burn the fiercer for being pushed together. They are afraid to meet the 
    godly man until their numbers place terrible odds against him. Come out, you 
    cowards, man to man, and fight the old hero! No, you wait until you are 
    assembled like thieves in bands, and even then you waylay the man. There in 
    nothing brave about you. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They hide themselves.</p></b> In ambush they wait their 
    opportunity. Men of malice are men of cowardice. He who dares not meet his 
    man on the king's highway, writes himself down as a villain. Constantly are 
    the reputations of godly men assailed with deep laid schemes, and diabolical 
    plots, in which the anonymous enemies stab in the dark. 
<b>
<p align="justify">They mark my steps</p></b>, as hunters mark the trail of 
    their game, and so track them. Malicious men are frequently very 
    sharp-sighted to detect the failings, or supposed failings, of the 
    righteous. Spies are not all in the pay of earthly governments, some of them 
    will have wages to take in red hot coin from one who himself is more subtle 
    than all the beasts of the field.
<b>
<p align="justify">When they wait for my soul.</p></b> Nothing less than his 
    life would content them, only his present and eternal ruin could altogether 
    glut them. The godly man is no fool, he sees that he has enemies, and that 
    they are many and crafty; he sees also his own danger, and then <i>he shows 
    his wisdom by spreading the whole case before the Lord, and putting himself 
    under divine protection.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. Shall they escape by iniquity?</p></b> Will such 
    wickedness as this stand them in good stead? Can it be that this conduct 
    shall enable them to avoid the sentence of earthly punishment? They slander 
    the godly man to screen themselves—will this avail them? They have cunningly 
    managed hitherto, but will there not be an end to their games? 
<b>
<p align="justify">In your anger cast down the people, O God.</p></b> Trip them 
    up in their tricks. Hurl them from the steep cliff. A persecuted man finds a 
    friend even in an angry God, how much more in the God of love! When men seek 
    to cast us down, it is but natural and not at all unlawful to pray that they 
    may be disabled from the accomplishment of their villainous designs. What 
    God often does, we may safely ask him to do.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. You count my wanderings. </p></b>Every step which 
    the fugitive had taken when pursued by his enemies, was not only observed 
    but thought worthy of counting and recording. We perhaps are so confused 
    after a long course of trouble, that we hardly know where we have or where 
    we have not been; but the omniscient and considerate Father of our spirits 
    remembers all in detail; for he has counted them over as men count their 
    gold, for even the trial of our faith is precious in his sight. 
<b>
<p align="justify">You put my tears into your bottle.</p></b> His sorrows were 
    so many that there would need a great wineskin to hold them all. There is no 
    allusion to the little complimentary lachrymators for fashionable and 
    fanciful Romans, it is a more robust metaphor by far; such floods of tears 
    had David wept that a leathern bottle would scarce hold them. He trusts that 
    the Lord will be so considerate of his tears as to store them up as men do 
    the juice of the vine, and he hopes that the place of storage will be a 
    special one—<i>your</i> bottle, not <i>a</i> bottle. 
<p align="justify">Are they not in your book? Yes, they are recorded there, 
    but let not only the record but the grief itself be present to you. Look on 
    my griefs as real things, for these move the heart more than a mere account, 
    however exact. How condescending is the Lord! How exact his knowledge of us! 
    How generous his estimation! How tender his regard!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. When I cry unto you, then shall my enemies turn 
    back.</p></b> So soon as I pray, they shall fly. So surely as I cry, they shall 
    be put to the rout.
<p align="justify">"So swift is prayer to reach the sky,<br/>
 So kind is God to me."</p>
<p align="justify">The machinery of prayer is not always visible, but it is 
    most efficient. God inclines us to pray, we cry in anguish of heart, he 
    hears, he acts, the enemy is turned back. What irresistible artillery is 
    this, which wins the battle as soon as its report is heard! What a God is 
    this, who harkens to the cry of his children, and in a moment delivers them 
    from the mightiest adversaries! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">This I know.</p></b> This is one of the believer's 
    certainties, his axioms, his infallible, indisputable verities. For God is 
    for me. This, we know, and we know, therefore, that none can be against us 
    who are worth a moment's fear. "If God be for us, who can be against us?" 
    Who will restrain prayer when it is so potent? Who will seek any other ally 
    than God, who is instantly present so soon as we give the ordained signal, 
    by which we testify both our need and our confidence?
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. In God, whose word I praise. </p></b>Now comes the 
    thanksgiving. He is a wretch who, having obtained help, forgets to return a 
    grateful acknowledgment. <i>The least we can do is to praise him from whom 
    we receive such distinguished favors</i>. 
<p align="justify">Does David here mean "by God's grace I will praise him"? 
    If so, he shows us that all our emotions towards God must be in God, 
    produced by him and presented as such. </p>
<p align="justify">Or does he mean, "that which in God is most the object of 
    my praise is his word, and the faithfulness with which he keeps it"? If so, 
    we see how attached our hearts should be to the sure word of promise, and 
    especially to him who is the <i>WORD incarnate</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord is to be praised under every aspect, and in all 
    his attributes and acts, but certain mercies peculiarly draw out our 
    admiration towards special portions of the great whole. That praise which is 
    never special in its direction cannot be very thoughtful, and it is to be 
    feared cannot be very acceptable. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In the Lord will I praise his word.</p></b> He delights to 
    dwell on his praise, he therefore repeats his song. The change by which he 
    brings in the glorious name of Jehovah is doubtless meant to indicate that 
    under every aspect he delights in his God and in his word.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. In God, whose word I praise.</p></b> This and the 
    former verse are evidently the chorus of the Psalm. We cannot be too careful 
    of our faith, or see too sedulously that it is grounded on the Lord alone.
<b>
<p align="justify">I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. </p></b><i>
    Faith has banished fear. </i>He views his foes in their most forcible 
    character, calling them not flesh, but indicating them as <i>man</i>—yet he 
    dreads them not; though the whole race were his enemies he would not be 
    afraid now that his trust is stayed on God. He is not afraid of what they 
    threaten to do, for much of that they cannot do; and even what is in their 
    power, what they can do, he defies with holy daring. He speaks for the 
    future, "I will not," for he is sure that the security of the present will 
    suffice for days to come.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Your vows are upon me, O God.</p></b> Vows made in 
    his trouble he does not lightly forget, nor should we. We voluntarily made 
    them, let us cheerfully keep them. All professed Christians are men under 
    vows, but especially those who in hours of dire distress have rededicated 
    themselves unto the Lord. 
<b>
<p align="justify">I will render praises unto you.</p></b> With heart, and 
    voice, and gift, we should cheerfully extol the God of our salvation. The 
    practice of making solemn vows in times of trouble is to be commended, when 
    it is followed by the far less common custom of fulfilling them when the 
    trouble is over.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. For you have delivered my soul from death. </p></b>
    His enemies were defeated in their attempts upon his life, and therefore he 
    vowed to devote his life to God. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Will not you deliver my feet from falling?</p></b> One mercy 
    is a plea for another, for indeed it may happen that the second is the 
    necessary complement of the first. It little matters that we live, if we are 
    made to fall in character by the thrusts of our enemies. As better not be, 
    as live to be bereft of honor, and fallen prostrate before my enemies. 
<b>
<p align="justify">That I may walk before God in the light of the living</p></b>, 
    enjoying the favor and presence of God, and finding the joy and brightness 
    of life therein. Walking at liberty, in holy service, in sacred communion, 
    in constant progress in holiness, enjoying the smile of Heaven—this I seek 
    after. 
<p align="justify">Here is the loftiest reach of a godly man's ambition, to 
    dwell with God, to walk in righteousness before him, to rejoice in his 
    presence, and in the light and glory which it yields. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus in this short Psalm, we have climbed from the 
    ravenous jaws of the enemy—into the light of Jehovah's presence, a path 
    which only faith can tread.</p>
