        <p>The Metrical System of Biblical Verse</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          In the strictest sense the term 'metrical' is not applicable to
          Biblical verse, since this is constituted, not by any numbering of
          syllables, but by the parallelism of whole clauses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LORD of Hosts is with us,<br />The God of Jacob is our refuge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is verse, not in virtue of any particular number of syllables in
          the lines, but because the second line is felt to run parallel with
          the first. This principle of parallelism of clauses underlies the
          whole of versification in Scriptural literature. As however the
          different modes of combination and variation of these parallel lines
          in Biblical poetry correspond, to a large extent, with those of
          metrical lines in other languages, it is convenient to speak of the
          principles governing them as a 'metrical system.'
        </p>
        <p>
          One consequence however of the difference between Biblical and other
          verse should always be borne in mind. The parallelism of clauses,
          which makes the foundation of Hebrew verse, is also a thing proper to
          oratorical prose in all languages. Accordingly in Hebrew prose and
          verse overlap: the extremes of either (e.g. Psalms and Chronicles) are
          strongly contrasted, but there is a middle style which can be
          presented in either form. Hence there is nothing strange in the fact
          that the same passage of Scripture may be presented by one editor as
          prose and by another as verse, according to the purpose of each
          arrangement. [For example: the Oration on Immortality (page 75), which
          for a specimen of oratory is here arranged as prose, is printed as
          verse in the Revised Version of the Apocrypha.]
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The simplest type of parallelism in Biblical literature may be
          called 'Antique Rhythm.' It is the metre of most of the traditional
          poetry preserved in the historic books of Scripture. Its unit consists
          in a couplet, of which either member may be strengthened by a parallel
          line, but not both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me die the death of the righteous.<br />And let my last end be
          like his!
        </p>
        <p>
          He saith, which heareth the words of God,<br />Which seeth the vision
          of the Almighty,<br />Falling down, and having his eyes open.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,<br />And shall break
          their bones in pieces,<br />And smite them through with his arrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a unit may be called a 'strain.' It will be seen in the examples
          that the first strain is a simple couplet, the second has its first
          line strengthened, the last has its second line strengthened. This
          power of occasionally strengthening either line of a couplet by an
          additional line gives the Antique Rhythm a flexibility suited to
          spontaneous composition. A similar device is found in connection with
          the traditional ballad poetry of England, of which such collections as
          The Percy Reliques are accidentally preserved specimens. While the
          regular metre of such ballads is a four-line stanza, yet a few poems,
          such as the Ballad of Sir Cauline, show some stanzas with individual
          lines strengthened:
        </p>
        <p>
          Fair Christabel, that lady mild,<br />Was had forth of her tower;<br />But
          ever she droopeth in her mind,<br />As nipt by an ungentle wind<br />Doth
          some pale lily flower.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poetry of the historic books mostly takes the form of aggregations
          of such 'strains' of Antique Rhythm, with no further structure.
          Occasionally such a poem will fall into verse paragraphs or 'strophes'
          [to be distinguished from the antistrophic system presently to be
          described]: an example is David's Song of Victory (see note on page
          266). [For a combination of Antique Rhythm and the Antistrophic
          system, see note to vii on page 267.]
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The metre of Wisdom verse is highly elaborate: we find here, not
          only the parallelism of successive clauses, but the 'high parallelism'
          which correlates all parts of a whole poem with one another. Two types
          may be distinguished: the Stanza structure and the Antistrophic
          structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stanzas are familiar to the English reader: in Biblical poetry groups
          of three lines, or four lines, etc., recur in succession: a simple
          example is the Chorus of Watchmen (on page 236).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Antistrophic system is familiar to students of Greek, as the
          metrical form of tragic choral odes. In this case the stanzas run in
          pairs, strophe and antistrophe, the theory being that the antistrophe
          exactly repeats the metrical form of its strophe; if another strophe
          follows the form may altogether change, but the changed form will be
          repeated in the corresponding antistrophe. [This may be expressed by
          the formula a a', b b', c c', etc.] Besides the pair of strophes there
          may be an introduction, or conclusion, or both. No. i of the Sonnets
          (on page 125) is an example of a poem consisting simply of strophe and
          antistrophe; No. iii (page 126) has also a conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Footnote 7: The term strophe is the Greek for 'turning': the system
          is derived from the dance performance of Greek odes, according to
          which the chorus danced from the altar to the end of the orchestra in
          one stanza, then 'turned,' and <i>retraced their steps</i> for the
          antistrophe or 'answering' stanza. The term strophe has come to be
          used also for verse paragraphs where there is no antistrophic
          arrangement. (See page 266, note on vi.)]
        </p>
        <p>
          Both in the case of the Stanza structure and the Antistrophic
          structure there are various modifications and elaborations --
          duplication, inversion, interruption, etc.: these it will be
          sufficient to explain in connection with the examples in which they
          are found.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The metre of Lyrics is in the main the same as that of Wisdom
          poetry. But in the strictest kinds of lyrics the structure is further
          determined by the musical performance. A lyric may be a solo, or the
          matter may be arranged for 'antiphonal' performance between different
          performers, e.g. choruses of Men and of Women. Antiphonal and
          antistrophic structure go easily together: see Deborah's Song, page
          152. The musical performance also introduces the 'refrain,' a passage
          recurring (with or without changes for musical effect): for example
          see The Song of Moses and Miriam (page 149).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A characteristic metrical system in Biblical verse is the 'Doom
          form.' Here the thread of the poem is in what, for form and spirit,
          may be called prose; but this prose is interrupted at intervals by
          lyric verse, celebrating or realising what the prose brings forward.
          This is chiefly found in prophecies of 'doom,' or denunciation of the
          foes of Israel (hence the name): the prose is a Divine word of
          denunciation, the lyrics are mostly impersonal celebrations of what
          the Divine speaker says. The form is easily collected from examples;
          see pages 175-181.
        </p>
        <p>STORY</p>
        <p>
          Story as a form of literature differs from History by its appeal to
          the imagination and emotions, whereas History addresses itself to our
          sense of record and scientific explanation. It is of no consequence
          whether the matter of the story be historic fact or invention; in the
          one case the writer selects, in the other case he frames, such details
          as will have the desired effect in presenting the story to the mind of
          the reader. The stories of the Bible are scattered through the
          history, of which they form a part; thus a reader of the Bible in its
          ordinary versions may be required at any moment to alter the character
          of his attention without anything to warn him of the change. In the
          Modern Reader's Bible (volumes Genesis, The Exodus, The Judges, The
          Kings) the stories are separated from the surrounding matter by
          titles. Selections of these stories enter into the present volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          /i. Joseph and his Brethren./ This is one of the most elaborate and
          artistically beautiful stories in all literature. It emphasises an
          important place in the Biblical history, Joseph being a link between
          the Children of Israel and the world empire of Egypt. Among elements
          of story beauty note the personality of Joseph, its attractiveness
          wherever he goes and its gradual maturing. Note also the sketches of
          varied life which make a background to the story as it moves along --
          glimpses of shepherd life, of caravan trading, of palace life in
          Egypt. But the main interest will be the 'plot' -- the technical term
          for the harmony that binds the different parts of a story into one
          whole. In the present case there are three 'motives' underlying the
          plot. (1) What has been called the 'oracular action': the interest of
          mystic dream oracles gradually becoming clear as the oracles are
          fulfilled. (2) The development of an ironic situation -- Joseph
          recognising his brethren but not recognised by them: once developed
          this situation is prolonged to the utmost by the hero's conflict of
          feelings, between resentment and family affection. (3) Beneath all
          other motives is the providential overruling of human events for high
          purposes (compare page 27).
        </p>
        <p>
          /ii. The Witness of Balaam./ The place of this story in the main
          history is indicated by its title: the 'Exodus' is the period of
          development for Israel from a family to a nation, and towards the
          close of the period Balaam, an outsider, bears witness in spite of
          himself to the growing numbers of the nation and to its glorious
          future. -- In literary form it is a 'mixed epic' or 'canti-fable': a
          story in prose that breaks into verse at appropriate places. (Compare
          the expression <i>took up his parable</i>: the parable is an undefined
          term for a more specialised literary form occurring in the course of
          more general literature, such as a fable in the midst of a discourse,
          or a poem in the midst of prose.) -- Its interest rests partly upon
          the conception of the 'Blessing and the Curse': there is the
          superstitious idea of the efficacy of these in the minds of Balak and
          his people, while the true Blessing comes from the prophetic vision
          accorded to Balaam by God. [Compare 'The Stolen Blessing' in the
          Genesis volume.] In character Balaam is a sincere worshipper of
          Jehovah outside the ranks of Jehovah's people, who however from
          interested motives conforms to the heathen world around him as far as
          he can. [Outside this story the general history shows him as yielding
          at last to material interest and acting as tempter to Israel: compare
          Revelation, chapter ii.14.] -- The third paragraph (page 34) is the
          famous story of Balaam's Ass. It is the opinion of some that this is a
          fable interwoven with the main story: it is in favour of this view
          that the following paragraph,
          <i>So Balaam went with the princes of Balak</i>, etc., seems the
          natural continuation of the second paragraph; while the
          <i>princes of Balak</i> are ignored in the story of the Ass.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iii. The Crowning of Abimelech./ This occupies an important place in
          the general history. Originally Israel is ruled only by the invisible
          Jehovah; gradually the secularising forces around lead to the
          institution of visible kings. This story is the first attempt at
          crowning a king, the work of a faction, with civil war and ruin as a
          result. -- It is a story of war and adventure. [Compare the Raid on
          Michmash, or The Feud of Saul and David in the Judges volume.] -- Its
          interest also rests upon the bitter fable of Jotham in scorn of
          kingship: the fable has the effect of a curse since it is literally
          fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iv. Samson's Wedding Feast./ This illustrates a variety of story
          called 'Idyl': the word is almost equivalent to 'trifle,' and the term
          is applied to incidents of love or domestic life in contradistinction
          to graver matters of history. [Three Idyl Stories (Ruth, Esther,
          Tobit) are contained in the Biblical Idyls volume of this series.] --
          Characteristic of such a story is the game of riddles; the original
          riddle, answer, and rejoinder are all in single couplets. -- It is not
          a pure idyl; feats of hero strength form another interest, as with
          other stories of Samson.
        </p>
        <p>
          /v-vii./ These are Prophetic Stories. As the secularising tendency in
          Israel towards visible kings prevails against the original conception
          of a spiritual rule by an invisible God there arises an order of
          'prophets,' who stand forth as representatives of the invisible
          Jehovah, and are thus often in opposition to the external government.
          So in the history of The Kings stories of these prophets, with their
          miraculous powers, take the place of the stories of heroes and their
          feats in earlier parts of the history. During the captivity in
          Babylon, Daniel in a similar way represents the Hebrew God against the
          king and hierarchy of Babylon.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vii. Page 63./ I have followed a tradition that the mystic writing on
          the wall was interpreted by Daniel reading downward instead of across
          [or rather, down, up, down: the form of writing known as
          boustrophedon, that is, the way an ox turns in a furrow]. If the
          handwriting was in an unknown alphabet Daniel must have said so, or
          why should his interpretation be accepted at once? But if the
          characters were those to which the beholders were accustomed, but
          arranged in an unthought-of direction, it is easy to realise the
          puzzle of the audience and the instantaneous acceptance of the
          solution.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>ORATORY</p>
        <p>
          /i. The Oration of Moses at the Rehearsal of the Blessing and the
          Curse./ The Book of Deuteronomy, from which this is taken, is a
          collection of the Orations and Songs of Moses, constituting his
          Farewell to the People of Israel. The general subject both of the
          oratory and song is the Covenant between Jehovah and his people, now
          for the first time committed to writing, and entrusted by the retiring
          leader of Israel to the Levites and Elders. The third of these
          orations is connected with a ceremonial occasion. An ordinance has
          been made for the ceremony of 'The Blessing and the Curse' to be an
          institution of the promised land: representatives of the Blessing are
          to stand on one mountain and representatives of the Curse on the
          opposite slope, the whole ritual solemnly enforcing the sanctity of
          the Covenant. At present however the people are on the wilderness side
          of Jordan; accordingly Moses arranges a <i>Rehearsal</i> of this
          ceremony, on ground resembling the valley between Ebal and Gerizim.
          This rehearsal is allowed to proceed to a certain point when Moses
          stops it, and takes the subject of the blessings and curses into his
          own hands. Hence the abrupt commencement of this oration. -- As
          elements of oratorical beauty note (1) the interweaving and
          parallelism of sentences, (2) the terrific crescendo and climax of
          denunciation. The oration must be spoken to get the full effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          /ii. Immortality and the Covenant with Death./ This is an example of
          the Written Address, Oratory that is not intended to be spoken. It is
          one of a series of imaginary addresses by King Solomon to the other
          rulers of the nations, constituting a work entitled 'The Wisdom of
          Solomon' (in volume 3 of the present series). -- The author's style is
          distinguished by a peculiar order of thought, according to which some
          of the leading points of his argument take the form of digressions.
          The thought of this discourse is that death is no part of the natural
          order of the universe, but is introduced into the world by the
          wickedness of men. The author imagines a monologue of the wicked, led
          by despair of aught beyond the grave to a life of luxury and
          oppression. Another imaginary monologue expresses the feelings of the
          same wicked men as they awaken from death to the life beyond. But as a
          digression between these two monologues the author places his
          reflections on the 'hopes of the ungodly,' that is, the substitutes in
          earlier thought for the grand conception of a life beyond death. These
          substitutes are (1) the living over again in posterity, (2) long life
          in this world. With regard to the first he argues that the brood of
          the ungodly is unstable and accursed: better is childlessness with
          virtue. As to the hopes of long life, he argues that the old age of
          the wicked is without honour; whereas a life cut short may be a life
          perfected.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iii-vii./ These are Prophetic Discourses. Considered as part of the
          literature of Oratory these Prophetic Discourses hold an intermediate
          position between the spoken and the written address. What appears as a
          discourse in the books of the prophets is probably not the exact
          report of a speech, but the substance of a speech, or of several
          similar speeches, worked up again into the style of a written address.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iii. The Great Arraignment./ This discourse of Isaiah takes the form
          of a theme (God's arraignment of his people as rebels) treated in four
          paragraphs: the prophet's remonstrance -- repentance by oblations --
          repentance of life -- corruption redeemed with judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iv. The Covenant with Death./ The phrase Covenant with Death in the
          title of this discourse of Isaiah has a different meaning from the
          same phrase in the title of another discourse (ii). In the latter it
          meant a supposed invitation to Death to come as a friend, by those who
          were 'of his portion'; in the present case it means an agreement with
          Death to pass by the supposed speaker while he visits others. -- This
          discourse illustrates what is a characteristic feature of Hebrew
          literature -- the 'pendulum structure,' by which the thought
          alternates in successive paragraphs between one and the other of two
          contrasting themes, in this case between Judgment and Salvation. The
          prophet is writing for the southern kingdom of Judah. Commencing with
          the rival kingdom of northern Israel he denounces drunken Ephraim, and
          how its crown of pride shall be trodden down (Judgment). But
          (Salvation) there shall be a crown of glory for the residue. Now he
          proceeds to Judgment upon Judah: the drunken rulers who trust to a
          refuge of lies, which the overflowing scourge shall sweep away. But
          there is Salvation for the patient. This comfort is imparted in
          agricultural images: the cruel plowing does not go on for ever, the
          gentle sowing comes; there are sharp threshing instruments [for the
          guilty], the gentle threshing with the rod for the precious cummin;
          and even the threshing is not to crush, but to make corn fit for
          bread.
        </p>
        <p>
          /v. The Utter Destruction and the Great Restoration./ A discourse made
          by companion pictures linked together by two parallel passages, each a
          parenthetic quintet, interrupting the pictorial description, which is
          afterwards resumed, with words emphasising the prophecy as a whole:
          <i>Seek ye out of the book of the LORD and read</i> [how all these
          woes shall come to pass] ... <i>Strengthen ye the weak hands</i> [with
          these glorious promises]. -- Note that Edom is only mentioned as
          typical of the foes of Israel in general, the pictures being of
          universal destruction and restoration. There is a similar use of Egypt
          and Edom as types of all the foes of Israel in another discourse (page
          220).
        </p>
        <p>
          /vi. The Sword of the LORD./ This is an illustration of a very
          peculiar form of discourse, which is without parallel in modern
          literature. Ezekiel is the great representative of 'Emblem Prophecy,'
          that is, discourses which have for texts some symbolic action or piece
          of dumb show. But in extreme examples of Emblem Prophecy, like the
          present, symbolism pervades the whole of the discourse: attitude,
          gesture, visible emblem, sustained dumb show, song, are all mingled
          together and combined with oratory. -- The discourse falls into four
          parts. (1) At the opening, the prophet sets his face toward Jerusalem:
          there is no symbolic action beyond this. (2) But as the address
          progresses, he suddenly draws forth a sword: this is the sword of the
          Lord which is to go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, and it
          will not return any more. Suddenly, the dramatic speaker has
          identified himself with the victims of this Divine sword:
          <i>Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins</i
          >, etc. Now the theme of the sword is resumed, and with it mingles
          what is evidently some military strain or folk-lore song, of which the
          augmenting lines suggest the gathering spirit of combat:
          <i>A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished</i>, etc. For
          a single moment the other side is presented -- a people careless and
          secure: <i>the Rod of my son</i> [they say]
          <i>it contemneth every tree</i>. But the impending destruction
          continues to gather force:
          <i>And it is given to be furbished that it may be handled</i>, etc.
          There is a sudden change, and cries and howls proclaim how the sword
          has fallen upon the people, and the <i>Rod that contemneth</i> is no
          more. The emblematic movement seems to become more and more rapid
          [through three verses of the song:
          <i>And let the sword be doubled the third time</i>, etc.]. -- (3) A
          total change here ensues. The sword now becomes emblematic of the
          sword of Babylon; and the imaginary picture is that of the conqueror
          arriving at the junction of the ways and deciding by his omens to
          proceed against Jerusalem. -- (4) Once more there is a total change:
          the sword now stands for Israel's enemies, the children of Ammon, and
          the verse conveys their boasting. But suddenly the prophetic speaker
          plunges the sword into its sheath: so is symbolically introduced the
          fate of Ammon to return to the land of his birth and perish there.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vii. Wreck of the Goodly Ship Tyre./ This illustrates a
          characteristic of Ezekiel's style by which, in place of visible
          symbolism, illustrated by the last example, a single image is
          sustained through the whole of a discourse. In the present case it is
          the image of a ship. Tyre was the great maritime city of antiquity:
          its grandeur is conveyed under the image of a ship which all the
          nations of the known world combine to build and load; the judgment is
          the wrecking of this goodly ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          /viii./ Amongst other things the prophetic books contain 'Sentences,'
          that is, brief sayings of prophets, each like an epigram, complete in
          itself. These no doubt passed from mouth to mouth like proverbs, and
          were collected by the prophets. The examples in this section are from
          the Book of Jeremiah.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>WISDOM</p>
        <p>
          'Wisdom' is the name given to the department of Biblical literature
          which corresponds to Philosophy in modern literature. It is however
          always philosophy in application to human life and conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          The starting-point of Wisdom literature is the /Unit Proverb/, which
          is a unit of thought in a unit of form. The unit of form is the
          couplet or triplet of verse: see above, page 242. Examples are given
          on pages 107-9. It will be seen that this Unit Proverb is a
          meeting-point of prose and verse literature: its form is verse, its
          matter (philosophy) belongs to the literature of prose. Accordingly it
          is natural that the more extended forms of Wisdom literature should
          take two directions: one on the side of verse, the other on the side
          of prose.
        </p>
        <p>
          /Epigrams/ and /Maxims/: examples of these are found on pages 109-11.
          The Epigram is a verse saying, of a few lines in length, in which two
          lines (not necessarily consecutive) are capable of standing by
          themselves as a unit proverb. In the examples given the two lines in
          each epigram that stand out on the left may be read as a proverb
          complete in itself. Such a germ proverb is the text of the epigram,
          the remaining lines serve to expand this text. The corresponding prose
          form is the Maxim, a unit proverb text with a brief prose comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          /Essays./ A more extended form of Wisdom literature, on the side of
          prose, is the Essay. The word has various uses: the Scriptural essays
          are not of the modern type (like those of Macaulay or Emerson), but of
          the antique type like the essays of Bacon. The title of an essay
          suggests a theme, on which the rest is a prose comment. (Pages
          112-24.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Verse compositions consisting of comments upon themes are in this
          series called /Sonnets/. In general literature the idea underlying the
          Sonnet is the adaptation of the matter to the outer form, as if a
          poet's thought were poured into special moulds. In English and Italian
          sonnets there is only one such form or mould -- a sequence of 14 lines
          divided according to a particular plan; the matter of these sonnets
          must be condensed or expanded to suit this plan. The nearest approach
          to this in Scriptural literature is the Fixed or Number Sonnet: the
          opening of this suggests a number scheme, to which the rest conforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          There be three things which are too wonderful for me, Yea, four which
          I know not:<br />The way of an Eagle in the air;<br />The way of a
          Serpent upon a rock;<br />The way of a Ship in the midst of the
          sea;<br />And the way of a Man with a Maid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The examples quoted in the present volume are different. They may be
          called 'Free Sonnets': the moulding in these is to nothing more
          restricted than 'high parallelism,' that is, not the parallelism
          binding successive lines into a stanza, but the bond which may
          correlate the most distant parts of a poem into a single scheme. The
          scheme of parallelism for each sonnet will be given in a separate
          note.
        </p>
        <p>Essays</p>
        <p>
          /ii./ This essay touches upon what was the great difficulty to early
          Hebrew thinkers: the visible prosperity of the wicked, which seemed to
          them contrary to their conception of 'judgment' or righteous
          providence. The author in this essay endeavours to meet the difficulty
          by two thoughts: (1) how a change of fate at the very end of life may
          make all the difference; (2) how the punishment may come in the next
          generation. -- A resemblance will be noted at one point to a parable
          of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          /v./ An essay on the Choice of Company, in five paragraphs: The danger
          of unknown company in a house -- the good only are proper objects of
          charity -- friendship not trustworthy until tested by adversity -- the
          humble can only be defiled by contact with the proud -- like will to
          like, and riches cannot consort with poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vi./ This essay is founded upon the old conception of society by
          which the educated formed a separate class -- here called 'the
          scribes.' Translated into modern ideas of life the argument would be
          that no life in any social station must be without leisure, and on
          such leisure self-culture depends.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vii./ This section makes a transitional stage to the next division of
          our selections, as it consists of an Essay containing a Sonnet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument of the whole is that Life is a thing of joy, tempered by
          the sense of responsibility. The latter idea is conveyed by the word
          'judgment,' which throughout the Old Testament stands for the
          irreconcilable antagonism between good and evil, and the certain
          overthrow of evil: the recognition of this makes action responsible.
          With this limitation, the author urges that the very shortness of life
          and youth is so much incentive to make joyful what days are allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scheme of high parallelism [see above, page 256] in this sonnet is
          the 'pendulum structure': the alternation of successive lines between
          two thoughts is conveyed to the eye by the indenting of the lines. The
          middle lines put symbolic descriptions of old age; the lines indented
          on the left drop the symbolism and speak in plain terms. [The lines
          indented on the right are subordinate clauses.]
        </p>
        <p>
          The matter of the sonnet is a tour-de-force of symbolism, under which
          are veiled the symptoms of senile decay followed by death. It is very
          likely that some of the symbols may be lost; but it is not difficult
          to see, without straining, a possible interpretation for each; and
          some of them have passed into traditional use. The poetic beauty of
          the passage is marvellous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Or ever the sun, and the light ... be darkened</i>: in view of the
          opening words of the preceding essay, which take the 'light' and 'sun'
          as symbols of the whole happiness of conscious existence, it is clear
          that the darkening of this light is the gradual failing of the joy of
          living. -- <i>And the clouds return after the rain</i>: an exquisite
          symbol, closely akin to the last. In youth we may overstrain and
          disturb our health, but we soon rally; these are storms that quickly
          clear up. In age the rallying power is gone: "the clouds return after
          the rain." -- <i>The keepers of the house shall tremble</i>: Cheyne
          understands of the hands and arms, the trembling of which is a natural
          accompaniment of old age. --
          <i>The strong men shall bow themselves</i>: the stooping frame; the
          plural is merely by attraction to 'keepers.' --
          <i>The grinders cease because they are few</i>: obviously of the
          teeth. -- <i>Those that look out of the windows be darkened</i>: the
          eyes becoming dim. -- <i>The doors shall be shut in the street</i>:
          the general connection of ideas makes it inevitable that the
          'folding-doors' should be the jaws; clenched jaws are so marked a
          feature in the skull that it is not difficult to associate them with
          the picture of old age. --
          <i
            >When the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the
            voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought
            low</i
          >: these must be taken together: appetite, speech, and sleep are all
          feeble. Grinding must be interpreted as grinders in the previous part
          of the sonnet: the loud or low sound of such grinding may fitly typify
          the eagerness of appetite or the reverse. The early waking or short
          sleeping of old age is well known. <i>The daughters of music</i> are
          the tones of the voice. --
          <i
            >They shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors shall be in
            the way</i
          >: the gait of old age is, through physical feebleness, much what the
          gait of a person terrified is for other reasons. --
          <i
            >The almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a
            burden, and the caperberry shall burst</i
          >: the three are linked together as being images from natural objects,
          not because of their symbolising similar things.
          <i>The blossoming of the almond tree</i> probably refers to the sparse
          white hairs of age. The name of this tree in Hebrew is founded on the
          fact that it is the first to blossom; though not strictly white, its
          blossoms may be called whitish: the whitish blossoms, solitary while
          all is bare around, just yield the image required. The grasshopper is
          evidently a symbol for a small object, which is nevertheless heavy to
          feeble age. <i>The caperberry shall burst</i>: the last stage of its
          decay: the failing powers at last give way. And then follows the
          dropping of the symbolism: "Man goeth to his long home."
        </p>
        <p>
          So far we have had symbols for failure of powers; now for actual death
          and dissolution.
          <i>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken</i
          >: a symbol from the house-lamp of gold, suspended by a silver cord,
          suddenly slipping its cord and breaking, its light becoming
          extinguished. For bowl in this sense compare Zechariah, chapter iv.2,
          3. --
          <i
            >Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at
            the cistern</i
          >: these are exquisite symbols for the sudden and violent cessation of
          every-day functions. Compare the popular proverb: "The pitcher goes to
          the well once too often." --
          <i>And the spirit return unto God who gave it</i>: this by analogy
          with the previous line must be interpreted to mean no more than that
          the man becomes just what he was before he was born.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Sonnets</p>
        <p>
          /i. The Sluggard./ The metrical scheme of this sonnet is simple: a
          strophe balanced by an antistrophe. [See above, page 244.]
        </p>
        <p>
          /ii. The Mourning for the Fool./ Metrical scheme: a brief strophe and
          antistrophe and conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iii. The Two Paths./ Strophe, the way of wisdom; antistrophe, the
          path of the wicked; conclusion, union of the two in a common image.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iv. The Creator has made Wisdom the Supreme Prize./ The metrical
          scheme of this sonnet is an example of 'antistrophic inversion': that
          is, two strophes followed by their antistrophes, but the antistrophe
          to the second strophe precedes the antistrophe to the first. [This is
          sometimes expressed by the formula a b b a; or (reckoning the number
          of lines in each strophe) 4, 6; 6, 4.] The printing makes this clear
          to the eye. -- The unity of thought in the sonnet is the conception of
          Wisdom as a prize. The middle strophe and antistrophe describe the
          richness of this prize; the opening strophe makes 'chastening' the
          cost at which it is obtained by the individual from the Lord; and the
          corresponding antistrophe (at the end) explains the reason for this
          costliness -- wisdom was the instrument by which the whole universe
          was created.
        </p>
        <p>
          /v. Watchfulness of Lips and Heart./ A Prayer in sonnet form. The
          metrical scheme is an illustration of 'duplication' applied to
          antistrophic structure: a quatrain question (strophe 1) has a couplet
          answer (strophe 2); then the quatrain is duplicated into an octet
          (antistrophe 1), and the answer is duplicated into a quatrain
          (antistrophe 2). [The lines of invocation are not counted in strophe
          and antistrophe 2.]
        </p>
        <p>
          /vi. Wisdom and the Fear of the Lord./ This is one of the most
          elaborate sonnets: its metrical scheme combines antistrophic and
          stanza structure (above, page 243). There is first a strophe with its
          antistrophe; then a series of stanzas; but these stanzas illustrate
          the metrical device of 'augmenting,' for they increase, as the thought
          gathers strength, from 3 lines to 5 lines and 6 lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vii. Wisdom and the Strange Woman./ This is at once the foremost of
          wisdom poems in its thought, and the most elaborate in sonnet
          structure: here, as always, the structure is an exact reflection of
          the thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          The metrical scheme shows stanza structure throughout. The poem falls
          into seven sections. In sections 1, 3, 4, 7, which contain the thread
          of argument, we find octet and ten-line stanzas. Section 2, which
          breaks off from the argument to give a picture of temptation, changes
          to sextet stanzas. Sections 5 and 6, the monologue of Wisdom, are cast
          in quatrains, but as the monologue crescendoes to its climax the
          quatrains 'augment' to 5, 6, 7 lines. There is further the artistic
          device of 'interruption': the regular flow of stanzas is broken at
          critical points by single couplets (like musical rhythm interrupted by
          recitative); again in section 2 the actual speech of the temptress is
          an irregular mass of lines outside the stanza structure, and this
          break in the flow of lines has a fine effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of the poem is in the highest degree grand and bold.
          Scriptural philosophy loves to celebrate under the name 'Wisdom' the
          union of all things, whether of the external universe or of the
          spiritual life, in one Divine harmony. In this poem this Wisdom is to
          be personified, and to proclaim her attractions. But the poet prepares
          the way by contrast with the spirit of temptation, also personified in
          female form practising her allurements. This is displayed in a boldly
          drawn picture; and then the poet, with the words
          <i>Doth not Wisdom cry?</i> suddenly turns round and presents 'Wisdom'
          as the temptress to good.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>LYRICS</p>
        <p>
          /i-ii./ These two selections are from the Book of Job. This consists
          of matter mainly philosophic worked up into an elaborate poem in which
          all literary forms -- epic, lyric, drama, rhetoric, etc. -- are
          blended in a way unparalleled in modern literature. Hence the form of
          these two pieces is intermediate between wisdom sonnets and the
          lyrical poems that follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          /i. An Elegy of a Broken Heart./ In the Book of Job this intervenes
          between the Story Prologue, which is prose, and the main body of the
          poem, which takes a dramatic form. Job breaks the silence to dilate,
          with lyrical elaboration, upon the situation of utter ruin which is to
          be the starting-point of the dramatic discussion. Hence the title of
          the section in the whole poem of Job is 'Job's Curse': but it admits
          of being separated from the action of the drama as an independent
          poem, with some such title as I have given it. -- In metrical scheme
          it falls into two sections. Section 1 is an example of 'interruption'
          (compare note to vii of the sonnets). It will be seen that the last
          two lines continue the sentence begun by the first two lines, making
          with them a quatrain: between come masses of parallel lines
          interrupting with a tour-de-force of execration. Section 2 is made up
          of introductory quatrain, strophe, and antistrophe.
        </p>
        <p>
          /ii. The Creator's Joy in his Creation./ This selection from Job is a
          part of the 'Divine Intervention,' which may be read as a complete
          poem. That drama introduces the Voice of God out of the whirlwind as
          taking a part in the dialogue. The link between the Divine
          Intervention as a whole and the general argument is the impossibility
          of any mortal grasping the mysteries of the universe, which mysteries
          enfold the glories of nature as well as the dark ways of providence
          which Job and his friends have been discussing. As a part of this
          general thought the portion here cited works out the idea of the
          Creator's joy in his creation -- a joyous sympathy with the infinities
          of great and small throughout the universe. It might be an expansion
          of the words in the story of the creation: "And God saw everything
          that he had made, and, behold, it was very good." -- The metrical
          scheme of this poem is a variation of the 'pendulum structure.' [Page
          251.] It may be called a 'triple pendulum,' or alternation between
          three notes: one note is made by the startling questions of nature
          mysteries, another (lines indented to the right) exquisitely pictures
          the details of these wonders of nature, while for a third (lines still
          more to the right) there is a word of challenge to Job to answer.

          /iii-v./ These three selections are lyrics in the strictest sense.
          Originally all poetry is of the form technically called
          'Ballad-Dance,' that is, verse combined with musical accompaniment and
          dancing. When this primitive poetry branches out into other forms,
          lyric is the form which retains most of the musical element. The poems
          here cited are lyrics in the strict sense that their structure is
          determined by the mode of their musical performance. This is seen by
          the 'antiphonal' distribution of the matter, for example, between
          choruses of men and women, and by the recurrence of passages
          ('refrains').

          /iii. Song of Moses and Miriam./ This is arranged for a Chorus of Men,
          taking the successive sections of the song, and a Chorus of Women,
          singing the refrain. The metre is Antique Rhythm (above, page 242):
          the successive strophes augment with the growing fulness of the theme.
          The first strophe (after the prelude) simply states the fact of the
          deliverance; the second pictures it in detail, the third meditates on
          the consequences to the furthest future.
        </p>
        <p>
          /iv. Deborah's Song./ This also is arranged for a Chorus of Men, led
          by Barak, and a Chorus of Women, led by Deborah. It is in Antique
          Rhythm (above, page 242). Its structure is antiphonal as between Men,
          Women, and the two combined. The structure is further elaborated by
          'interruption' [passages printed in italics], where the singers
          encourage one another.

          To appreciate the matter of the song it should be compared with the
          description of the incident in plain historic prose (Judges, chapter
          iv). It is not difficult to make out from this narrative (1) that
          Heber the Kenite, Jael's husband, was acting as a spy against his
          allies of Israel, and betraying their movements to the tyrant. Jael's
          act was treachery in retaliation for the treachery on the other side
          by her husband. This explains the exultation over her deed in
          Deborah's Song. (2) This treachery of Heber had upset the plans of
          Deborah and Barak: helpless against the iron chariots, their only hope
          had been to assemble secretly on the heights of Kedesh and attempt a
          surprise. But while the army of Sisera, warned by Heber, were awaiting
          them on the plains of Esdraelon, a sudden thunder storm with rain
          (commemorated in the Song) converted the whole plain into a morass.
          The army of Barak fell on the foe while their horses were struggling
          in the mud, and extirpated them at a blow.

          /V. David's Lament./ This simple elegy is cast in quatrain stanzas.
          Its only elaboration is an augmenting refrain. This beautiful refrain
          seems to rest for its effect upon the bringing together of two ideas,
          like a crescendo and decrescendo in music: How are the mighty fallen!
          This fragmentary refrain as it appears at the beginning is enlarged at
          the passage from the section on Saul to that on Jonathan, and still
          further enlarged at the close of the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vi. David's Song of Victory./ This is in Antique Rhythm: its
          structure is 'strophic' (above, page 243). There is an introduction
          and conclusion, and three unequal strophes: the first pictures the
          deliverance, the second meditates on the principle involved
          (deliverance of the righteous), the third extends the confidence thus
          produced to the whole past and future. The most notable artistic
          effect is the sudden change at the prayer of the afflicted one: all
          nature is convulsed as the Almighty rushes to the rescue.
        </p>
        <p>
          /vii. The Bride's Reminiscences./ This is introduced as an example of
          the Lyric Idyl. The term 'idyl' has been explained above (page 248,
          note to iv): such idyls may be either narrated as stories, or brought
          out lyrically or dramatically, as in the present case. It is one of a
          series of lyric idyls making up the poem of Solomon's Song. The story
          underlying this poem has been variously interpreted; the
          interpretation followed in this series (Biblical Idyls volume) is that
          King Solomon, visiting his vineyards on Mount Lebanon, has come by
          surprise upon a beautiful Shulammite maiden. As she flies from the
          royal suite he seeks her in shepherd disguise and wins her love, then
          he brings her as queen to his palace. The present selection is Idyl II
          of the series, and contains two of the Bride's Reminiscences of this
          courtship. The first is of a visit by the disguised king on a fair
          spring morning, and how the lovers were interrupted by the harsh
          voices of the Bride's Brothers crying out that the foxes were in the
          vineyards. The second is a dream of losing and finding her lover. [The
          passages in italics are not spoken by the Bride, but are the poet's
          interludes, dividing the different sections of the poem.] -- Metrical
          scheme. The idyls are a combination of Antique Rhythm and Antistrophic
          structure: but the parallelism of strophe and antistrophe must be
          reckoned in strains, not in lines (see above, page 242): thus we have
          four strains balanced by four, then two by two; then (in the Dream)
          three by three. [The refrains are outside the metrical scheme.]

        <p>/viii, ix./ These are songs from the books of the prophets.</p>
        <p>
          /viii. The Battle of Carchemish./ This is a War Ballad, in triplet
          stanzas with 'duplication.' The battle celebrated was a turning-point
          in history, settling for ever the supremacy of the Babylonian over the
          Egyptian empire: these were the two world empires between which
          parties in the nation of Israel fluctuated, the whole strength of
          Jeremiah and the prophetic party being thrown against Egypt.

          /ix./ This /Song of Zion Redeemed/ forms a section of the Isaiahan
          'Rhapsody of Zion Redeemed' [chapters xl-lxvi]. It is in stanzas of 4,
          or occasionally 6 and 8 lines, the flow interrupted by couplets,
          especially at the beginning of the sections. Compare above, page 262,
          note to /vii/ (Sonnets).
        </p>
        <p>
          /x, xi./ These are illustrations of a characteristic feature of
          Biblical poetry -- the 'Doom form.' See above, page 245.
        </p>
        <p>
          /x. Isaiah's Doom of Babylon./ The structure is made up of the Divine
          word of the overthrow of Babylon [prose passages] interrupted at
          intervals by [impersonal] songs, realising or celebrating what the
          Divine word brings forward. The last of these verse interruptions is a
          fully developed Ode on Fallen Babylon. The structural form of this ode
          is antistrophic inversion (7, 6; 6, 7), like that of No. /iv/ of the
          Sonnets (above, page 260). Another effect in this ode is the Taunt or
          Dirge Song. --
          <i>My consecrated ones ... them that exult in my majesty.</i> The
          Divine voice is heard calling to God's 'hosts,' the idea suggested by
          the title 'Jehovah Sabaoth.' Compare Joel, chapter iii.11 and 13;
          Psalm ciii.20, 21. --
          <i
            >I will sit upon the mount of congregation in the uttermost parts of
            the north</i
          >: the north is regularly in Scripture the quarter from which Divine
          judgment is looked for (e.g. Ezekiel, chapter i.4; Jeremiah vi. i; Job
          xxxvii.22).
        </p>
        <p>
          /xi. Nahum's Doom of Nineveh./ This is a Doom Prophecy directed
          against Nineveh, partly in the structure called above 'doom form,'
          partly in other forms. It falls into seven sections. Sections 1 and 2
          are meditations in pendulum form (above, page 251), the paragraphs
          alternating between judgment and salvation. Section 3 is in doom form:
          the Divine announcement of doom is interrupted by lyric realisation of
          the sudden attack upon Nineveh in the midst of its careless security.
          Section 4 is a brief lyric triumph over Nineveh overthrown. Section 5
          resumes the doom form: the Divine denunciation interrupted by lyric
          realisation of Nineveh in its pride. With section 6 this passes into a
          Taunt Song (as in example /x/). The seventh section is a brief lyric
          meditation upon Nineveh overthrown and desolate.
