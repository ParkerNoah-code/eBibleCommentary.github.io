          1. When all the seed shall have come to perfection, they state that
          then their mother Achamoth shall pass from the intermediate place, and
          enter in within the Pleroma, and shall receive as her spouse the
          Saviour, who sprang from all the Ã†ons, that thus a conjunction may be
          formed between the Saviour and Sophia, that is, Achamoth. These, then,
          are the bridegroom and bride, while the nuptial chamber is the full
          extent of the Pleroma. The spiritual seed, again, being divested of
          their animal souls, and becoming intelligent spirits, shall in an
          irresistible and invisible manner enter in within the Pleroma, and be
          bestowed as brides on those angels who wait upon the Saviour. The
          Demiurge himself will pass into the place of his mother Sophia; that
          is, the intermediate habitation. In this intermediate place, also,
          shall the souls of the righteous repose; but nothing of an animal
          nature shall find admittance to the Pleroma. When these things have
          taken place as described, then shall that fire which lies hidden in
          the world blaze forth and burn; and while destroying all matter, shall
          also be extinguished along with it, and have no further existence.
          They affirm that the Demiurge was acquainted with none of these things
          before the advent of the Saviour.

        <p>
          2. There are also some who maintain that he also produced Christ as
          his own proper son, but of an animal nature, and that mention was made
          of him by the prophets. This Christ passed through Mary just as water
          flows through a tube; and there descended upon him in the form of a
          dove at the time of his baptism, that Saviour who belonged to the
          Pleroma, and was formed by the combined efforts of all its
          inhabitants. In him there existed also that spiritual seed which
          proceeded from Achamoth. They hold, accordingly, that our Lord, while
          preserving the type of the first-begotten and primary tetrad, was
          compounded of these four substances, -- of that which is spiritual, in
          so far as He was from Achamoth; of that which is animal, as being from
          the Demiurge by a special dispensation, inasmuch as He was formed
          [corporeally] with unspeakable skill; and of the Saviour, as respects
          that dove which descended upon Him. He also continued free from all
          suffering, since indeed it was not possible that He should suffer who
          was at once incomprehensible and invisible. And for this reason the
          Spirit of Christ, who had been placed within Him, was taken away when
          He was brought before Pilate. They maintain, further, that not even
          the seed which He had received from the mother [Achamoth] was subject
          to suffering; for it, too, was impassible, as being spiritual, and
          invisible even to the Demiurge himself. It follows, then, according to
          them, that the animal Christ, and that which had been formed
          mysteriously by a special dispensation, underwent suffering, that the
          mother might exhibit through him a type of the Christ above, namely,
          of him who extended himself through Stauros, and imparted to Achamoth
          shape, so far as substance was concerned. For they declare that all
          these transactions were counterparts of what took place above.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They maintain, moreover, that those souls which possess the seed of
          Achamoth are superior to the rest, and are more dearly loved by the
          Demiurge than others, while he knows not the true cause thereof, but
          imagines that they are what they are through his favour towards them.
          Wherefore, also, they say he distributed them to prophets, priests,
          and kings; and they declare that many things were spoken by this seed
          through the prophets, inasmuch as it was endowed with a transcendently
          lofty nature. The mother also, they say, spake much about things
          above, and that both through him and through the souls which were
          formed by him. Then, again, they divide the prophecies [into different
          classes], maintaining that one portion was uttered by the mother, a
          second by her seed, and a third by the Demiurge. In like manner, they
          hold that Jesus uttered some things under the influence of the
          Saviour, others under that of the mother, and others still under that
          of the Demiurge, as we shall show further on in our work.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Demiurge, while ignorant of those things which were higher than
          himself, was indeed excited by the announcements made [through the
          prophets], but treated them with contempt, attributing them sometimes
          to one cause and sometimes to another; either to the prophetic spirit
          (which itself possesses the power of self-excitement), or to [mere
          unassisted] man, or that it was simply a crafty device of the lower
          [and baser order of men]. He remained thus ignorant until the
          appearing of the Lord. But they relate that when the Saviour came, the
          Demiurge learned all things from Him, and gladly with all, his power
          joined himself to Him. They maintain that he is the centurion
          mentioned in the Gospel, who addressed the Saviour in these words:
          "For I also am one having soldiers and servants under my authority;
          and whatsoever I command they do." They further hold that he will
          continue administering the affairs of the world as long as that is
          fitting and needful, and specially that he may exercise a care over
          the Church; while at the same time he is influenced by the knowledge
          of the reward prepared for him, namely, that he may attain to the
          habitation of his mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material,
          and animal, represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures
          are no longer found in one person, but constitute various kinds [of
          men]. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption. The
          animal, if it make choice of the better part, finds repose in the
          intermediate place; but if the worse, it too shall pass into
          destruction. But they assert that the spiritual principles which have
          been sown by Achamoth, being disciplined and nourished here from that
          time until now in righteous souls (because when given forth by her
          they were yet but weak), at last attaining to perfection, shall be
          given as brides to the angels of the Saviour, while their animal souls
          of necessity rest for ever with the Demiurge in the intermediate
          place. And again subdividing the animal souls themselves, they say
          that some are by nature good, and others by nature evil. The good are
          those who become capable of receiving the [spiritual] seed; the evil
          by nature are those who are never able to receive that seed.<br />
