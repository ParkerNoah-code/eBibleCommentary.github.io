          1. The following are the transactions which they narrate as having
          occurred outside of the Pleroma: The enthymesis of that Sophia who
          dwells above, which they also term Achamoth, being removed from the
          Pleroma, together with her passion, they relate to have, as a matter
          of course, become violently excited in those places of darkness and
          vacuity [to which she had been banished]. For she was excluded from
          light and the Pleroma, and was without form or figure, like an
          untimely birth, because she had received nothing [from a male parent].
          But the Christ dwelling on high took pity upon her; and having
          extended himself through and beyond Stauros, he imparted a figure to
          her, but merely as respected substance, and not so as to convey
          intelligence. Having effected this, he withdrew his influence, and
          returned, leaving Achamoth to herself, in order that she, becoming
          sensible of her suffering as being severed from the Pleroma, might be
          influenced by the desire of better things, while she possessed in the
          meantime a kind of odour of immortality left in her by Christ and the
          Holy Spirit. Wherefore also she is called by two names -- Sophia after
          her father (for Sophia is spoken of as being her father), and Holy
          Spirit from that Spirit who is along with Christ. Having then obtained
          a form, along with intelligence, and being immediately deserted by
          that Logos who had been invisibly present with her -- that is, by
          Christ -- she strained herself to discover that light which had
          forsaken her, but could not effect her purpose, inasmuch as she was
          prevented by Horos. And as Horos thus obstructed her further progress,
          he exclaimed, Iao, whence, they say, this name Iao derived its origin.
          And when she could not pass by Horos on account of that passion in
          which she had been involved, and because she alone had been left
          without, she then resigned herself to every sort of that manifold and
          varied state of passion to which she was subject; and thus she
          suffered grief on the one hand because she had not obtained the object
          of her desire, and fear on the other hand, lest life itself should
          fail her, as light had already done, while, in addition, she was in
          the greatest perplexity. All these feelings were associated with
          ignorance. And this ignorance of hers was not like that of her mother,
          the first Sophia, an Æon, due to degeneracy by means of passion, but
          to an [innate] opposition [of nature to knowledge]. Moreover, another
          kind of passion fell upon her (Achamoth), namely, that of desiring to
          return to him who gave her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This collection [of passions] they declare was the substance of the
          matter from which this world was formed. For from [her desire of]
          returning [to him who gave her life], every soul belonging to this
          world, and that of the Demiurge himself, derived its origin. All other
          things owed their beginning to her terror and sorrow. For from her
          tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed; from her smile all
          that is lucent; and from her grief and perplexity all the corporeal
          elements of the world. For at one time, as they affirm, she would weep
          and lament on account of being left alone in the midst of darkness and
          vacuity; while, at another time, reflecting on the light which had
          forsaken her, she would be filled with joy, and laugh; then, again,
          she would be struck with terror; or, at other times, would sink into
          consternation and bewilderment.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now what follows from all this? No light tragedy comes out of it,
          as the fancy of every man among them pompously explains, one in one
          way, and another in another, from what kind of passion and from what
          element being derived its origin. They have good reason, as seems to
          me, why they should not feel inclined to teach these things to all in
          public, but only to such as are able to pay a high price for an
          acquaintance with such profound mysteries. For these doctrines are not
          at all similar to those of which our Lord said, "Freely ye have
          received, freely give." They are, on the contrary, abstruse, and
          portentous, and profound mysteries, to be got at only with great
          labour by such as are in love with falsehood. For who would not expend
          all that he possessed, if only he might learn in return, that from the
          tears of the enthymesis of the Æon involved in passion, seas, and
          fountains, and rivers, and every liquid substance derived its origin;
          that light burst forth from her smile; and that from her perplexity
          and consternation the corporeal elements of the world had their
          formation?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. I feel somewhat inclined myself to contribute a few hints towards
          the development of their system. For when I perceive that waters are
          in part fresh, such as fountains, rivers, showers, and so on, and in
          part salt; such as those in the sea, I reflect with myself that all
          such waters cannot be derived from her tears, inasmuch as these are of
          a saline quality only. It is clear, therefore, that the waters which
          are salt are alone those which are derived from her tears. But it is
          probable that she, in her intense agony and perplexity, was covered
          with perspiration. And hence, following out their notion, we may
          conceive that fountains and rivers, and all the fresh water in the
          world, are due to this source. For it is difficult, since we know that
          all tears are of the same quality, to believe that waters both salt
          and fresh proceeded from them. The more plausible supposition is, that
          some are from her tears, and some from her perspiration. And since
          there are also in the world certain waters which are hot and acrid in
          their nature, thou must be left to guess their origin, how and whence.
          Such are some of the results of their hypothesis.

          5. They go on to state that, when the mother Achamoth had passed
          through all sorts of passion, and had with difficulty escaped from
          them, she turned herself to supplicate the light which had forsaken
          her, that is, Christ. He, however, having returned to the Pleroma, and
          being probably unwilling again to descend from it, sent forth to her
          the Paraclete, that is, the Saviour. This being was endowed with all
          power by the Father, who placed everything under his authority, the
          Æons doing so likewise, so that "by him were all things, visible and
          invisible, created, thrones, divinities, dominions." He then was sent
          to her along with his contemporary angels. And they related that
          Achamoth, filled with reverence, at first veiled herself through
          modesty, but that by and by, when she had looked upon him with all his
          endowments, and had acquired strength from his appearance, she ran
          forward to meet him. He then imparted to her form as respected
          intelligence, and brought healing to her passions, separating them
          from her, but not so as to drive them out of thought altogether. For
          it was not possible that they should be annihilated as in the former
          case, because they had already taken root and acquired strength [so as
          to possess an indestructible existence]. All that he could do was to
          separate them and set them apart, and then commingle and condense
          them, so as to transmute them from incorporeal passion into
          unorganized matter. He then by this process conferred upon them a
          fitness and a nature to become concretions and corporeal structures,
          in order that two substances should be formed, -- the one evil,
          resulting from the passions, and the other subject indeed to
          suffering, but originating from her conversion. And on this account
          (i.e., on account of this hypostatizing of ideal matter) they say that
          the Saviour virtually created the world. But when Achamoth was freed
          from her passion, she gazed with rapture on the dazzling vision of the
          angels that were with him; and in her ecstasy, conceiving by them,
          they tell us that she brought forth new beings, partly after her own
          image, and partly a spiritual progeny after the image of the Saviour's
          attendants.
