          Now we have heard that the crime of conspiracies prevails in your
          parts, and it has been shown us that the people are conspiring against
          their bishops; of which crime the craft is hateful, not only among
          Christians, but even among the heathen, and it is forbidden by foreign
          laws. And therefore the laws not only of the Church, but of the world,
          condemn those who are guilty of this crime; and not only those indeed
          who actually conspire, but those also who take part with such. Our
          predecessors, moreover, together with a very numerous body of bishops,
          ordained that any guilty of this offence among those who are set in
          the honour of the priesthood, and who belong to the clergy, should be
          deprived of the honour which they enjoy; and they ordered that others
          should be cut off from communion, and expelled from the Church; and
          they decreed, at the same time, that all men of both orders should be
          infamous (infames); and that, too, not only for those who did the
          deed, but for those also who took part with such. For it is but
          equitable that those who despise the divine mandates, and prove
          themselves disobedient to the ordinances of the fathers, should be
          chastised with severer penalties, in order that others may fear to do
          such things, and that all may rejoice in brotherly concord, and all
          take to themselves the example of severity and goodness. For if (which
          may God forbid) we neglect the care of the Church, and are regardless
          of its strength, our slothfulness will destroy discipline, and injury
          will be done assuredly to the souls of the faithful. Such persons,
          moreover, are not to be admitted to accuse any one: neither can their
          voice, nor that of those who are under the ban, injure or criminate
          any man.<br />
