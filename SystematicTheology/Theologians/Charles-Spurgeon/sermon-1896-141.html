          49. Remember thy word. He prays that God would really perform what he
          promised; for the event proves that he does not forget his word. That
          he is speaking of the promises we infer from the end of the verse, in
          which he declares, that cause was given him to hope, for which there
          would be no place unless grace had been presented to him. In the
          second verse he asserts, that though God still kept him in suspense,
          yet he reposed with confidence in his word. At the same time he
          informs us, that during his troubles and anxieties, he did not search
          after vain consolation as the world is wont to do who look around them
          in all quarters to find something to mitigate their miseries; and if
          any allurements tickle their fancy, they make use of these as a remedy
          for alleviating their sorrows. On the contrary, the prophet says he
          was satisfied with the word of God itself; and that when all other
          refuges failed him, there he found life full and perfect;
          nevertheless, he covertly confesses, that if he do not acquire courage
          from the word of God, he will become like a dead man. The ungodly may
          sometimes experience elevation of spirit during their miseries, but
          they are totally destitute of this inward strength of mind. The
          prophet, then, had good reason for stating, that in the time of
          affliction the faithful experience animation and rigor solely from the
          word of God inspiring them with life,. Hence, if we meditate carefully
          on his word, we shall live even in the midst of death, nor will we
          meet with any sorrow so heavy for which it will not furnish us with a
          remedy. And if we are bereft of consolation and succor in our
          adversities, the blame must rest with ourselves; because, despising or
          overlooking the word of God, we purposely deceive ourselves with vain
          consolation.

          51. The proud have greatly scorned me This example is eminently
          useful, as it serves to inform us, that though our honesty may render
          us obnoxious to the insults of the ungodly, we ought, by our
          unflinching constancy, to repel their pride, lest we should take a
          dislike to the law of God. Many who, in other respects, would be
          disposed to fear God, yield to this temptation. The earth has always
          been filled with the impious contemners of God, and at this day it is
          almost overrun with them. Wherefore, if we do not disregard their
          reviling, there will be no stability in our faith. In calling
          unbelievers proud, he applies to them a very appropriate designation:
          for their wisdom consists in despising God, lightly esteeming his
          judgments, trampling all piety under foot, and, in short, pouring
          contempt upon the celestial kingdom. Were they not blinded with pride,
          they would not follow such a headlong course. We must interpret the
          words in this manner: Though the proud have treated me with scorn, I
          have not turned aside from thy law. We must not overlook the,,
          particle very much, or greatly, which imports, that he was harassed,
          not merely occasionally or for a short time, by the ungodly, but that
          the attack was continued from day to day. Let us learn from these
          words, that the wicked, in consequence of their forming the great
          majority of mankind, arrogate to themselves the greater liberty. The
          number of the godly who worship God reverently is always small. Hence
          we must hold out against a large troop and rabble of the impious if we
          would maintain our integrity.

          52. I called to mind thy judgments of old, O Jehovah! In this psalm,
          the judgments of God are generally taken for his statutes and decrees,
          that is, his righteousness. In this place, in consequence of the
          qualifying phrase, of old, it is more probable that they refer to the
          examples by which God has made himself known as the righteous Judge of
          the world. Why does he say that the law of God has been from
          everlasting? This may to some extent be accounted for from the
          righteousness here mentioned not being of recent growth, but truly
          everlasting, because the written law is just an attestation of the law
          of nature, through means of which God recalls to our memory that which
          he has previously engraved on our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am rather inclined to adopt another interpretation, That David
          remembered the judgments of God, by which he testified that he had
          established his law perpetually in the world, Such a settlement is
          very necessary for us; because, when God does not make bare his arm,
          his word frequently produces little impression. But when he takes
          vengeance upon the ungodly, he confirms what he had spoken; and this
          is the reason why in civil law penalties are called confirmations. The
          term accords better with God's judgments, by which he establishes the
          authority of his law, as if a true demonstration accompanied his
          words. And seeing he declares that he called to mind the most ancient
          of God's judgments, it becomes us to learn, that if his judgments are
          not displayed as frequently as we would desire, for the strengthening
          of our faith, this is owing to our ingratitude and apathy; for in no
          past age have there been wanting clear demonstrations for this very
          purpose; and thus it may with truth be affirmed, that God's judgments
          have flowed in one continued manner from age to age, and that the
          reason why we have not perceived them is, our not deigning to open our
          eyes to behold them. If any one object, that it is contrary to the
          nature of his judgments to afford consolation to because they are
          calculated rather to strike us with terror, the answer is at handy --
          that the faithful are made to tremble for fear of God's judgments, as
          far as is requisite for the mortification of their flesh. On the other
          hand, these supply them with a large source of consolation, from the
          fact of their learning from them, that God exercises his
          superintending providence over the human race. Farther, they learn,
          that after the wicked have reveled in licentiousness for a season,
          they shall at length be sisted before the judgment-seat of God; but
          that they themselves, after having patiently combated under such a
          Guardian of their welfare, can be in no doubt about their
          preservation.

          53. Terror seized me This verse may be understood in two senses;
          either that the prophet was grievously afflicted when he saw God's law
          violated by the wicked, or that he was horror-struck at the thought of
          their perdition. Some would render it ardor, which does not so
          properly agree with the nature of the passage; I therefore abide by
          the term fear, by which I think his ardent zeal is pointed out, in
          that he was not only deeply grieved at the transgressions of the law,
          but held in the utmost detestation the impious boldness of those who
          lightly esteemed the law of God. At the same time, it is worthy of
          notice, that it is no new ground of offense to the faithful, if
          numbers throw off God's yoke, and set up the standard of rebellion
          against him. This, I repeat, must be attended to, because many derive
          flimsy and frivolous pretexts for it, from the degeneracy of the age,
          as if they must needs howl while they live among wolves. In the days
          of David, we see there were many who apostatized from the faith, and
          yet, so far was he from being discouraged or dismayed by these things,
          that the fear of God rather kindled a holy indignation in his bosom.
          What is to be done, then, when surrounded by bad examples, but that we
          should vie with each other in holding them up to detestation? And here
          a contrast, if not directly stated, is implied, between the flattering
          unction which we apply to ourselves, believing that all is lawful
          which is common, and the horror with which the prophet tells us he was
          seized. If the wicked, haughtily and without restraint, set themselves
          in opposition to God, in consequence of our not being alive to his
          judgments, we convert that into an occasion of perverse confidence and
          insensibility. On the contrary, the prophet asserts that he was seized
          with horror, because, though he considered the long-suffering of God,
          on the one hand, yet, on the other, he was fully persuaded that he
          must, sooner or later, call for condign punishment.

          54. Thy statutes have been my songs. He repeats in different words
          what he had formerly mentioned, that the law of God was his sole or
          special delight during all his life. Singing is an indication of joy.
          The saints are pilgrims in this world, and must be regarded as God's
          children and heirs of heaven, from the fact that they are sojourners
          on earth. By the house of their pilgrimage, then, may be understood
          their journey through life. One circumstance merits particular notice,
          that David, during his exile from his native country, ceased not to
          draw consolation, amid all his hardships, from the law of God, or
          rather a joy which rose above all the sadness which his banishment
          occasioned to him. It was a noble specimen of rare virtue, that when
          he was denied a sight of the temple, could not draw near to the
          sacrifices, and was deprived of the ordinances of religion, he yet
          never departed from his God. The phrase, the house of his pilgrimage,
          is employed, therefore, to enhance the conduct of David, who, when
          banished from his country, still retained the law of God deeply
          engraved on his heart, and who, amid the severity of that exile, which
          was calculated to deject his spirits, cheered himself by meditating
          upon the law of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          55. By night I remembered thy name, O Jehovah! As the second clause of
          the verse depends on the first, I consider the whole verse as setting
          forth one and the same truth; and, therefore, the prophet means that
          he was induced, by the remembrance he had of God, to keep the law.
          Contempt of the law originates in this, that few have any regard for
          God; and hence, the Scripture, in condemning the impiety of men,
          declares that they have forgotten God, (Psalm 50:22; 78:11; 106:21).
          To rectify this, David exhorts that the remembrance of God is the only
          remedy for preserving us hi his fear, and in the observance of his
          law; and assuredly, as often as his majesty occurs to our minds, it
          will tend to humble us, and the very thought of it will provoke us to
          the cultivation of godliness. The word night is not intended by him to
          mean the remembering of God merely for, short time, but a perpetual
          remembrance of him; he, however, refers to that season in particular,
          because then almost all our senses are overpowered with sleep. "When
          other men are sleeping, God occurs to my thoughts during my sleep." He
          has another reason for alluding to the night-season, That we may be
          apprised, that though there was none to observe him, and none to put
          him in remembrance of it, -- yea, though he was shrouded in darkness,
          -- yet he was as solicitous to cherish the remembrance of God, as if'
          he occupied the most public and conspicuous place.
        </p>
        <p>
          56. This was done to me. I doubt not that the prophet, under the term
          z't, zoth, comprehends all God's benefits; but as he comes before God
          in relation to blessings then being enjoyed by him, he speaks as if he
          were pointing to them. Hence, under this term is included an
          acknowledgment of all the benefits with which he had been crowned; or,
          at all events, he declares that God had borne testimony, by some
          signal deliverance, to the integrity of his conduct. He does not boast
          of meriting any thing, as the Pharisees in our day do, who, when they
          meet with any such matter in Scripture, pervert it to prove the merit
          of works. But the prophet had no other design, than to set himself in
          diametrical opposition to the despisers of God, who either impute all
          their prosperity to their own industry, or ascribe it to chance, and
          malignantly overlook or conceal God's superintending providence. He
          therefore calls upon himself to return to God, and invites others to
          follow his example, and exhorts them, that as God is an impartial
          judge, he will always reserve a recompense for piety. Probably, too,
          by this holy boasting he repels the base slanders of the ungodly, by
          which we lately saw he was grievously assailed.<br />
