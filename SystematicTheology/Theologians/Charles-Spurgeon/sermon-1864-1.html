        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.549)</p>

        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we
          cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for
          verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
          shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it
          shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this
          kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.| -- Matthew 17:19-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE NARRATIVE, of which our text forms a part, describes a scene which
          took place immediately after the transfiguration of our Lord. Not to
          divorce it therefore from its connection, let us glance at the
          antecedents of the case, that nothing may be lost by negligence, or
          that peradventure we may gain something by meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          How great the difference between Moses and Christ! When Moses had been
          forty days upon the mountain-top, he underwent a kind of
          transfiguration, so that his face shone with exceeding brightness when
          he came down among the people, and he was obliged to put a veil over
          his face; for they could not bear to look upon his glory. Not so our
          Saviour! He had been really transfigured with a greater glory than
          Moses could ever know, and yet, as he came down from the mount,
          whatever radiance shone upon his face, it is not written that the
          people could not look upon him, but rather they were amazed, and
          running to him, they saluted him. The glory of the law repelled; for
          the majesty of holiness and justice, drive the awed spirits away from
          God. But the greater glory of Jesus attracts; though he is holy, and
          just, and righteous too, yet blended with these there is so much of
          truth and grace that sinners run to Jesus, amazed at his goodness,
          attracted by the charming fascination of his love, and they salute
          him, become his disciples, and take him to be their Lord and Master.
          Some of you may be just now blinded by the dazzling brightness of the
          law of God. You feel its claims on your conscience, but you cannot
          keep it in your life. It is too high; you cannot attain to it. Not
          that you find fault with the law; on the contrary, it commands your
          profoundest esteem. Still you are in no wise drawn by it to God; you
          are rather hardened in your heart, and you may be verging towards the
          inference of desperation: |As it is impossible for me to earn
          salvation by the works of the law, I will continue in my sins.| Ah,
          poor heart! Turn thine eye away from Moses, with all his repelling
          splendour, and look to Jesus, yonder, crucified for sinful men. Behold
          his flowing wounds, and thorn crowned head! He is the Son of God, and
          therein he is greater than Moses. He bear the wrath of God, and
          therein he shows more of God's justice than Moses' broken tablets
          could ever do. Look thou to him, and as thou feelest the attraction of
          his love, fly to his arms and thou shalt be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          How different the spirit of Moses and Jesus! When Moses comes down
          from the mountain, it is to purge the camp. He seems to grasp the
          fiery sword; he breaks the golden calf; he smites the idolaters; but
          when Jesus comes down from the mountain, he finds a strife in the
          camp, as Moses did; he finds his own apostles worsted and beaten, just
          as Aaron had been defeated by the clamours of the people; but he has
          not a word of cursing; there is a gentle rebuke -- |O faithless and
          perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
          suffer you?| His actions are actions of mercy -- no breaking in
          pieces, but healing; no cursing, but blessing: love sits smiling on
          his brow, as he touches the poor wretch who is almost dead with
          diabolical possession, and restores him to life and health. Go you
          then, to Jesus; leave the law and your own self-righteousness, for
          these can do nothing but curse you. Fly to Jesus, for be you
          whomsoever you may, there are pardons on his lips; there are blessings
          in his hands; there is love in his heart; and he will not disdain to
          receive even you.
        </p>
        <p>
          How much of condescension there is in the manner of Christ! Our Lord,
          we have told you, had been very glorious on the mountain's top, with
          Moses and Elias, yet, when he comes down into the midst of the crowd,
          he doth not disdain the cry of the poor man, not refuse to touch him
          who was possessed with a devil. Observe my Masters condescension, for
          he deigns attention, and yet his manner softens into pity and
          presently it melts into a gracious sympathy, as if this was the only
          channel through which his peerless power could flow. Then remember, he
          is the same to-day as he was then.
        </p>
        <p>|Now though he reigns exalted high,</p>
        <p>His love is still as great:| --</p>
        <p>
          He is willing now to receive sinners as when it was said of him, |This
          man receiveth sinners and eateth with them:| just as ready to receive
          you, poor sinners, as when he was called |The friend of publicans and
          sinners.| Come to him. Bow at his feet. His love invites you still.
          Believe that the transfigured and glorified Jesus is still a loving
          Saviour, willing to pardon and forgive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again what choice instruction there is in history! After Jesus
          had been absent for some time, he came back. You may ask for what
          purpose he had retired? Evidently he went up into the mountain to
          pray. It was while he was praying (and I make no doubt, fasting
          likewise) that the fashion of his countenance changed. By his own
          personal devotion, and by the Father's special revelation, he had thus
          come back, as it were, with great refreshment to carry on his
          ministry. Hence we become witnesses of a marvelous power which he
          immediately showed forth, and of no less remarkable counsel which he
          spoke to his disciples, when they felt their own weakness. Thus we
          have before us, on our text, a peculiar case -- a patient, who utterly
          baffled the skill of all his disciples, healed at once by the great
          Master; and we have a reason given why the apostles themselves were
          not able to deliver him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us look for a little time at this very sad case; not so singular
          either, methinks, but that we may find the round about us. Then let us
          notice the scene around the case -- the father, the disciples, the
          scribes. Afterwards we shall joyfully observe the Saviour's coming
          into the midst and deciding all the difficulty; and, lastly, we shall
          attend to the reason he gives in private to his disciples, why they,
          before his coming, were utterly powerless to achieve the work.
        </p>
        <p>I. First we have before us a VERY PECULIAR CASE.</p>
        <p>
          It appears that the disciples had cast out devils of all sorts.
          Wherever they had gone, heretofore, this was their uniform testimony,
          |Lord, even the devils are subject unto us;| but now they are baffled.
          They seem to have encountered a devil of the worst kind. There are
          grades in devilry as there are in human sin. All men are evil, but all
          men are not alike evil. All devils are full of sin, but they are not
          all sinful to the same degree. Do we not read in Scripture, |Then
          goeth he and taketh unto him seven other spirits more wicked than
          himself?| It may be there is a gradation in the wickedness of devils,
          and perhaps, also, in their power to fulfil their wicked impulses. We
          can scarcely think that all devils are Satans. There seems to be one
          chief arch-spirit, one great Diabolus, who is an accuser of the
          brethren -- one mighty Lucifer, who fell down from heaven and has
          become the prince of the powers of darkness. In all his hosts it is
          probable that there is not his like. He stands first and chief of
          those fallen morning stars; the rest of the spirits may stand in
          different grades of wickedness, a hierarchy of hell. This poor wretch
          seems to have been possessed of one of the worst, most potent, and
          violent, and virulent of these evil spirits. I believe, brethren, that
          here we have a picture of a certain class of individuals who are not
          only desperately sinful, but subject to extraordinary impulses which
          carry them to infernal lengths and depths of infamy; they are
          incapable of restraint, a terror to their kinfolk, and a misery to
          themselves. All men are sinful, as I have said before; but the power
          of depravity in some men is much stronger than in others; at least, if
          it be not intrinsically stronger, yet it certainly has manifestations
          in some which we have never perceived in common among men. Let us try
          and pick out the case according to the narrative. How frequently, dear
          friends, too frequently, alas! have we seen young people who have
          answered to the description here given. They have had a precocity of
          wickedness. When Jesus asked the father, |How long has he been in this
          way?| the answer was, |Of a child.| I remember having once known such
          a child, over whom, paroxysms of passion came, in which his face would
          turn black. When he was able to run about, and was sent to a public
          school, a flint-stone, a club, a brick-bat, anything which might come
          next to hand, he would throw, without a moment's thought, at any one
          who vexed him. His knife would be drawn from his pocket and opened in
          an instant. The young assassin has often been prevented from stabbing
          others by a careful hand and watchful eye which guarded him. We have
          noticed this, I say, in the very young. They begin to lie early and to
          thieve soon, and the young lip even assays to swear, while the anxious
          mother cannot understand where the child could have learnt it. You
          have protected such a child from contamination, and seemed to shut him
          in and girdle him about with holy influences; and yet, in these
          desperate instances, as soon as ever the child could know the right
          from the wrong, he has deliberately chosen the wrong with a violence
          of self-will and recklessness of consequences altogether unusual. Some
          such cases we have seen. O, may God grant it never be your lot or
          mine, to be the parents of such children. Yet such there have been,
          and such men there are who have grown up now, and the youthful
          passions of their childhood have become developed; and you may find
          them with the low forehead and dark scowling eye, if you will, in our
          prison-houses. Or if you see them in the streets, you may hopefully
          wish that they may be in prison ere long, for they are unsafe abroad.
          Of a child they seem to have been possessed with the chief of devils,
          and to have been carried captive by him at his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          This lad seems also to have been afflicted with what is here called
          lunacy, which was, indeed, only a form of epilepsy. He was constantly
          subjected, it seems, to epileptic fits; for I think we can hardly
          understand lunacy to mean anything short of occasional madness.
          Attacks of such outrageous violence would come upon him, that there
          would be no enduring him. He would then dash himself into the fire, or
          if water were near, he would attempt self destruction by plunging in
          to it. We have met with persons of this kind, perfectly outrageous and
          beyond all command, when fits of evil came upon them. I will instance
          cases which I have observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know a man now, he may be here this morning; if he is , he will
          recognize his own portrait. At times he is as reasonable as anyone I
          could wish to associate with. He enjoys listening to the Word of God.
          He is, in some respects, an amiable, excellent, and respectable man.
          But occasionally fits of drunkenness come upon him, in which he is
          perfectly powerless under the influence of the demon; and while it
          lasts, it matters not, even when he knows he is wrong, a thousand
          angels could not drag him from it. He is thrown into the water of
          self-destruction, and he will continue in it. You may urge him and
          reason with him, and you may think -- oh, how often some have thought
          who love him! -- he will never do that again; he is too sensible a
          man; he has been too well-taught; the Word of God has had such an
          effect upon him, that he will never do it again; yet he does; he
          repeats the old paroxysms, and has done for twenty or thirty years;
          and, if he lives, unless sovereign grace prevent it, he will die a
          drunkard, as sure as he is a living man, and go from his drink to
          damnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another case, from which I likewise draw from life. The man is kind,
          tender, and generous -- generous to a fault. He has a home -- he had
          one, I ought to say -- he had a home, and he was the light of it. No
          one ever suspected him -- that is, in his better times -- of any
          grievous faults; but sometimes -- and this has been concealed by many
          an indulgent friend -- an attack of lasciviousness comes upon him, and
          at such seasons it matters not what the temptation may be, nor how
          foul the vice may be, the man runs into it. If you should meet him in
          the street, and talk with him, and argue with him, it would be all
          time and labour thrown away; nay, I have known him break up his home,
          and cross the sea to go to another land, that he might indulge his
          vile passions without rebuke, or the restraint of associating with
          former friends. He will come back again, broken-hearted, wondering
          that he ever could be such a fool; but he will go again. It is in him.
          The devil is in him, and, unless God casts it out, he will do the same
          again, deliberately choosing his own damnation. Though he knows it,
          yet so possessed of the love of sin is he, that when the fit comes
          upon him, this diabolical epilepsy, he falls into sin with his whole
          might and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might go on describing cases of the kind, but you will not need that
          I should picture any more; it could only be to vary the different
          forms of sin. However, let me try once more. A lad had as good a
          father as a child could have. He was bound apprentice. It became
          whispered in a few weeks that little moneys were missing. The father
          was very grieved, so indeed was the master, and the matter was quietly
          hushed up. A little while after the same thing occurred. The
          indentures were cancelled, and nothing more was said of it; but the
          father was sorely perplexed. He looked out for some other situation
          for the boy where he might, perhaps, recover his character. After a
          time it was precisely the same again. Bad companions had got hold of
          him, or rather, he had become a ringleader among other bad companions.
          Well, something else must be tried. It was tried. He has had twenty
          situations, and they have all been thrown up from the very same cause.
          And now, what think you is his treatment of his parents? Instead of
          being grateful for the repeated kindness and longsuffering shown to
          him, he will break out sometimes into such dreadful passions, that
          even the lives of his parents are scarcely safe; and when he has been
          in his old haunts a little more than usual, he is really so terrible a
          being, that his mother who loves him and who weeps over him, would
          almost as soon see a fiend from hell as see him; for when he comes
          home, everything goes wrong; confusion, is in the house, and terror in
          every heart; he acts precisely as if he were a madman. They have said,
          |Send him to Australia, or send him to America| -- where they do send
          many of that sort -- but if he goes there he will turn up, sooner or
          later, at the foot of the gallows; he is desperately set on evil, and
          nothing turns him aside. He tears and foams at the mouth with passion;
          his whole heart goes forth outrageously after anything like vice, and
          there appears to be not one redeeming trait in his character; or, if
          there be, it only seems to be subjected tot he power his lusts. He
          devises means to be more mighty to do mischief in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          What dreadful cases these are! Wherefore am I talking of them? Dear
          friends , I have taken them because it has been laying upon my heart
          to encourage and comfort you who are constrained to carry a daily
          cross in having such relations and such children as these. It is one
          of the heaviest afflictions which can come upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case before us, the child was both deaf and dumb -- not, I
          suppose, through any organic effect, but through the epilepsy, and the
          Satanic possession. So often we have seen children -- shall I look
          them in the face this morning, as I stand here? -- they are no
          children now -- who are positively deaf to all spiritual sounds. They
          have been pleaded with, but it is vain. They know the truth, they know
          the whole truth, but they do not know the power of it. They are never
          absent from family prayer, nor in any prayer are they ever forgotten
          by their parents. They come to this place; they attend our classes;
          they go to revival services. Now and then there is something like a
          little emotion, but it does not come to much; they are precisely
          similar to the deaf adder which cannot be charmed, charm we never so
          wisely. Others of the family have been converted. Nearly all the
          household has now been brought to Christ. Lydia has had her heart
          opened; God has been much pleased to call young Timothy; but this one
          remains, and after much anxiety, much effort, much labour, no good has
          been achieved. The adamant seems as soft as their heart, and the ear
          of the deaf as much alive to rebuke as their conscience. This again is
          a very sad case.
        </p>
        <p>
          I meet sometimes, too, with cases of another kind -- persons who are
          beset with very high doctrine, who have got the devil in them, puffing
          up their fleshly minds with a vain conceit of sound understanding, and
          degrading their carnal profession with a loathsome impurity of heart
          and life. You will talk with them; they will tell you they wish to be
          saved -- would give their right arm to be saved; but it is not in
          their power. You bid them believe in Jesus. They have no sense, they
          tell you, of the need of a Saviour; they are not in a fit state to
          believe. When God's time comes, the thing will occur. They love high
          doctrine; they will hear nothing else but it; but then their Sunday,
          if there is a temptation which comes across their path, will be spent
          anywhere but in the worship of God; and during the week they give way
          to all sorts of sins. Whatever temptation comes, they go after it. The
          comfort they get from their religion, which they wrap about them like
          a cloak, is this -- that no minister speaks the truth except one or
          two; that the truth is fatalism; that all they have to do is to be
          carried along like dead, inanimate logs down the stream, and that they
          are not at all responsible; or if they are responsible, it is merely
          to maintain with unflinching hardihood their own crude sentiments. I
          have seen some of these people -- good people in their own way too --
          of whom I have thought that the conversation of drunkards was more
          hopeful than theirs; for that damnable fatalism, which by some is put
          instead of the predestination of the Scriptures, has locked them up --
          put them in an iron cage: and so they are beyond the reach of help,
          going on in their sin, rejecting the gospel of Christ, while assaying
          to be connoisseurs of its choicest mysteries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brothers and sisters, why are such cases as these permitted? Why
          doth the Lord allow the devil thus to fill the soul with sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it is, first, to show that there is a reality of sin. If we
          were all moral and outwardly respectable, we should begin to think sin
          was but a fancy. These daring sinners show the reality of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to manifest the reality of divine grace; for when these are
          saved, then it is we wonder, and we are compelled to say, |There is
          something in this. If such a hard, iron nature yet melts before the
          power of divine love, there must be a majesty in it.|
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to humble us too, to throw us on our back, and let us see how
          utterly powerless human agency is. When you cannot get in the thin end
          of the wedge, much less the whole wedge; when the ploughshare breaks
          on the edge of a hard rock; when the edge of the sword turns against
          the armour, then it is to draw yourself out of self to God. You see it
          is a deadly evil, where only omnipotence can help. Your soul says,
          |Lord, put out thine arm! Now do it, and the glory shall be thine.|
          This is probably the chief reason; it is in order that God may get
          great glory to himself. He lets the devil have it all his own way.
          |There,| he says, |pick your own ground, fight in your own territory,
          manoeuvre in your own way, and, with a word, I will crush your power.|
          He gives Satan great advantage, lets him entrench himself firmly in
          the soul from youth up, so that the victory may be splendid to the
          greatest degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have thus before us now, for our sorrowful contemplation, the case
          of one whose disease mocks the physician, laughs at all human
          endeavours, and defies the watchful care of mild and gentle treatment
          to mitigate its force, or ameliorate its fearful symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Turn we now with passing glance, to LOOK AT THE SCENE AROUND. The
          company is made up of five sorts of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are the scribes -- cynics, methinks, to a man -- |We told you
          so! We told you so!| they say. |Your Master pretended to give you
          power to cast out devils. No such thing! you cannot cast out devils.
          Those whom you healed were not truly possessed. Little enough was ever
          the matter with them, and so they got better. They were fanciful, and
          they believed you through enthusiasm. The dupes of credulity, your
          incantations bewitched them, and so they got better. But you cannot
          cast out a devil -- you cannot cast that devil out.| |Now then,| says
          one of the scribes to Andrew, |cast it out. Come, Phillip, try what
          you can do!| And inasmuch as after all trying, the devil would not go
          out -- |Ah! just so!| they say, |they are impostors. There is nothing
          in it| Just recall it, friends, to your own memories, have not you
          seen men of that kind? |Ah yes,| they say, | the gospel converts one
          sort of people, such as always go to places of worship, the more
          intelligent and respectable of the community, but, you see, it is no
          good in these tough cases. These hardened ones -- it cannot touch
          them. They are beyond its power.| |Aha!| they say, |where is the
          boasted might of this great physician? He can heal your finger-aches;
          he does not know how to make these foul diseases fly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then here is the poor father, all dejected. |I brought him to you -- I
          knew you did cast out devils, and I thought you could cast my son's
          devil out, and he would be healed. I am disappointed in you all. Yet I
          do think your Master can do it, but I am not sure that even he can. If
          such excellent apostles, as you are, have tried so hard, and have
          failed, I do not think there can be any chance for me. I am full of
          unbelief. O, I wish I had never brought my child here at all, to make
          a public spectacle of him, that he might be a witness to your
          failures.| That is the poor father. Perhaps that poor father is here
          this morning and he is saying, |Ah, I do believe, but still I am full
          of unbelief. I have brought my daughter; I have brought my child under
          the sound of the Word; I have prayed, and wrestled with God in prayer,
          and my child is not saved.| |I have brought my husband,| says one good
          woman, |but he is just as full of Satan as he ever was. I must give it
          up in despair.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, there are the disciples, and they look pitiable indeed.
          |Well,| they say, |we do not know how to account for it. We cannot
          tell you how it is. We have said the same in this case that we were
          wont to say in others.| |Why| says one of them, |when I went abroad
          and just said In the name of Jesus Christ I command thee to come out
          of him,' the unclean spirit always did come out in every other case. I
          cannot comprehend this. I must give it up.| |We all must give it up,|
          says the apostles. For some unknown cause, this seems to be quite out
          of the catalogue of cases which we are commissioned to cure. And so we
          sometimes hear dejected ministers, after preaching long at such hard
          shells as these -- they say, |Well, we cannot understand it. The
          gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
          believeth.' Oh, it must be that these are fore-ordained unto
          damnation; we must give it up.| That is how unbelieving ministers talk
          -- or at least the most part of ministers in their season of misgiving
          and chagrin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then there is the general crowd. They are neither this way nor
          that. They say they will see fair. |Come, clear the ring out. If Jesus
          Christ be not an impostor -- if he be God -- certainly he can heal
          this poor man.| Now here is the test and the ordeal, |If that man be
          not healed, we,| says the crowd, |will not believe; but, if he be,
          then we will believe that Jesus Christ is sent of God.| O dear
          friends, how often we have thought of those very hard cases in this
          way. There are hundreds of undecided people looking on and saying,
          |Ah, if So-and-so were converted, then I should say there was
          something in it. If truly we could have a new heart and a right
          spirit, then I, too, would turn to God with full purpose of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was the fifth party there, and that was the devil himself. Oh,
          how triumphant was he! |Ah!| he seemed to say, |try your exorcism; go
          on with your words; preach at him; pray at me; weep over me; do what
          you will, you cannot get me out.| There he seems to stand intrenched
          within the stronghold of the poor tortured heart. |Do your best, do
          your worst, I am not afraid of you. I have got this man, and I will
          keep him. I have so fixed myself in him that no power shall ever be
          able to heal him.| So we seem to hear that vile shriek of hell over
          some men, |Yes,| saith he, |I will trust him to go into Spurgeon's
          Tabernacle. I know the thousands there have felt the power of the Holy
          Ghost in making new men of them, this is a case I can trust. There is
          nothing that will ever touch him. The great hammer has knocked the
          chains off many, but it cannot touch his chains; they are harder than
          iron. I have no fear for him;| and perhaps he is gloating his thoughts
          now with the torments of the man in another world. Ah, thou foul
          fiend! if our Master should come here this morning, thou shouldst sing
          another tune. if he should say, |Come out of him thou foul spirit,|
          thou wilt go back howling to thy vile den; for his voice can do what
          our voice never could have done. And may we not easily realize such a
          scene enacted in this congregation? You have the scoffers, you have
          the anxious parent, the ministry confessedly powerless in the matter;
          the crowd looking on, and the devil rejoicing that such cases are
          quite beyond human strength. What more can you want to vivify the
          picture before your imagination?
        </p>
        <p>III. But look! THE MASTER COMES.</p>
        <p>
          Ah! the master comes! Forthwith the scene changes. The lieutenants and
          the captains who began the battle did not understand the art of war;
          the were precipitant and hasty. The right wing was broken; the left
          began to reel; the centre almost fails. The trumpets of the adversary
          begin to sound a victory. Here they come -- their dread artillery in
          front. What will become of the army now? Hold! Hold! What is that I
          see? A cloud of dust. Who comes galloping there? It is the
          commander-in-chief. |What are you at?| says he, |What are you at?| In
          a moment he sees this is not the way to fight. He comprehends the
          difficulties of the case in an instant. |Forward there! Forward There!
          Backward there!| The scale is turned. The mere presence of the
          commander-in-chief has changed the whole face of the field; and now,
          ye adversaries, ye may turn your backs and fly. It was so in Jesus'
          case exactly. His lieutenants and captains -- the apostles -- had lost
          the day. He comes into the field; comprehends the state of the case.
          |Bring him hither to me,| says he, and the poor wretch, foaming and
          tormented, is brought to him, and he says, |Come out of him, thou
          unclean spirit.| The thing is done; the victory achieved; the
          undecided receive Christ as a prophet; the scoffers' mouths are shut;
          the trembling father rejoices, and the poor demoniac is cured.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet when Jesus Christ came to cure this poor man, he was in as bad
          a state as he well could be. Nay, the very presence of the Saviour
          seemed to make it worse. As soon as ever the devil perceived that
          Christ was come he began to rend and tear his poor victim. As quaint
          old Fuller says -- like a bad tenant whose lease is out, he hates the
          landlord, and so he does all the damage he can, because he has got
          notice to quit. Often just before men are converted, they are worse
          than ever; there is an unusual display of their desperate wickedness,
          for then the devil hath great wrath, now that his time is short.
        </p>
        <p>
          The struggles of this child are appalling. The devil seemed as if he
          would kill him before he would be healed; and after great paroxysms of
          the most frightful kind, the poor youth laid upon the ground, pale,
          and still as a corpse, insomuch that many said, |He is dead.| It is
          just the same with many conversions of these desperate sinners. Their
          convictions are so terrible; frequently the work of the devil within
          them keeping them from Christ is so furious that you would give up all
          hope. You say, |That man will be driven mad; those acute feelings, the
          intense agony of his spirit will rob him of all mental power, and then
          in abject persecution he will die in his sin.| Ah! dear friends, this
          again is only a piece of Satan's infamy. He knew, and knew right well
          that Christ would set that poor young man free, and therefore he sets
          upon him with all his might, to torment him while he may. Have I any
          such desperate case among my hearers this morning -- one who has been
          as a son of Belial among the children of men? Is the devil tormenting
          you to-day? Do you feel tempted to commit suicide? Are you urged to
          some freak of yet greater sin in order to drown your griefs and
          strangle your conscience? O poor soul, do no such thing, for my Master
          will soon stoop over you, and take you by the hand and lift you up,
          and your comfort shall begin, because the unclean spirit is cast out.
          |Ah! he means to destroy me,| says the soul under conviction. Nay,
          soul, God does not destroy those whom he convinces of sin. Men do not
          plough fields which they have no intention to sow. If God ploughs you
          with conviction he will sow you with gospel comfort, and you shall
          bring forth a harvest of his glory. As a woman at her work first plies
          the needle with its sharp prick, and then draws the thread after it,
          so in your case the sharpness of sorrow for sin will be speedily
          followed by the silver thread of joy and peace in believing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And oh, mark it! The vision just now, up there on the mountain of
          glory, resolved itself into |Jesus only.| His peerless radiance
          eclipsed every other. So, too, it is |Jesus only,| down there in the
          valley. His matchless grace can encounter no rival. Keep this forever
          in your mind's eye -- it is the Master who did it all. His appearance
          on the scene removed all difficulties. In such extreme cases, there
          will be, and there must be, a most eminent display of God's power; and
          that power may be unassociated with means. Under any circumstances, it
          will be the Lord alone doing it, to the praise and glory of his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, we come to the last, and perhaps the most important part of
          the sermon. The riddle is perplexing. |WHY COULD NOT WE CAST HIM OUT?|
          Let the Master tell us the reasons why these cases thwart our power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Saviour said it was for want of faith -- want of faith. No man may
          expect to be the means of the conversion of a sinner without having
          faith which leads him to believe that the sinner will be converted.
          Such things may occur, but it is not the rule. If I can preach in
          faith that my hearers will be saved, they will be saved. If I have no
          faith, God may honour his Word, but it will be in no great degree;
          certainly he will not honour me. Abandoned sinners, if converted by
          means, are usually brought under the power of divine grace through
          ministers of great faith. Have you observed -- there were persons who
          heard all the small fry of the Whitefieldian age; they had listened to
          this preacher and to that. Under whom were they converted? Under Mr.
          Whitefield, because Mr. Whitefield was a man of masterly faith. He
          believed that the lost could be reclaimed -- that the worst diseases
          could be healed, the most heinous, abandoned, profligate, blasphemous
          sinners could be saved. He preached to them as if he expected the deaf
          would be charmed by the gospel melody, and the dead would be quickened
          at the commanding call of the great Redeemer's name. At Surrey Chapel,
          over yonder, in Rowland Hill's day, some of the grossest blackguards
          and biggest scamps who ever infested London, were saved. Why? Because
          Rowland Hill preached the gospel to big sinners, and believed the fact
          of big sinners being converted. The respectable people of his day
          said, |Oh, yes! it is only tag, rag, and bob-tail who go to hear Mr.
          Hill.| |Just so,| said Mr. Hill, | and welcome tag, and welcome rag,
          and welcome bob-tail; they are the very people that I want| |What is
          the good of such people as they are, going to hear the gospel? Why
          does Mr. Hill try to preach to harlots and thieves?| they said. |They
          are just the very people,| said Mr. Hill. |I believe that these people
          can be saved.| It was want of faith in the others; for if a man have
          faith as a grain of mustard seed, let it be ever so little, yet, if it
          is true, it is mighty in proportion to its power. Mr. Hill had the
          power of faith, and he was the means of the conversion of very great
          sinners. A few years ago it was utterly hopeless to try and reclaim
          fallen daughters of sin, but a few men had faith that it could be
          done, and it has been done; and I will now make bold to say that if
          there be a great sinner here, such as I tried to describe just now,
          some gross case of infernal possession, if that person be not saved,
          it is for the want of faith in our case. If we have brought that
          person before God, and have not been anxious about his salvation, and
          God has not heard that prayer, it is because we could not believe it
          possible such a case could be saved. If God gives you the power to
          believe that any soul will be saved, it will be saved; there is no
          doubt about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, our Saviour added, |Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by
          prayer and fasting.| What does he mean by that? I believe he meant
          that in these very special cases ordinary preaching of the Word will
          not avail, and ordinary prayer will not suffice. There must be an
          unusual faith, and to get this there must be an unusual degree of
          prayer; and to get that prayer up to the right point, there must be,
          in many cases, fasting as well. No doubt there is something special
          about the admonition to prayer, from the association in which it
          stands. One sort of Christian will use formal supplications; and the
          petitions they ask are founded upon a sense of propriety, without any
          glow of feeling. Another sort will wait for the Spirit to move them;
          and when certain impulses stimulate their minds, they rejoice in a
          sense of liberty. Yet I show you a more excellent way There be those
          who watch unto prayer, wait before the Lord, seek his face, and
          exercise patience till they get an audience. Such disciples continue
          in their retirement until they have an experience of access for which
          they crave.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what is fasting for? That seems to be the difficult point. It is
          evidently accessory to the peculiar continuance in prayer, practised
          oftentimes by our Lord, and advised by him to his disciples. Not a
          kind of religious observance, in itself meritorious, but a habit, when
          associated with the exercise of prayer, unquestionably helpful. I am
          not sure whether we have lost a very great blessing in the Christian
          Church by giving up fasting. It was said there was superstition in it;
          but, as an old divine says, we had better have a spoonful of
          superstition than a porringer full of gluttony. Martin Luther, whose
          body, like some others, was of a gross tendency, felt as some of us
          do, that in our flesh dwelleth no good thing, in another sense than
          the apostle meant it; and he used to fast frequently. He says his
          flesh was wont to grumble dreadfully at abstinence, but fast he would,
          for he found that when he was fasting, it quickened his praying. There
          is a treatise by an old Puritan, called, |The soul fattening
          institution of fasting,| and he gives us his own experience that
          during a fast he has felt more intense eagerness of soul in prayer
          than he had ever done at any other time. Some of you, dear friends,
          may get to the boiling point in prayer, without fasting. I do think
          that others cannot, and probably if we sometimes set apart a whole day
          for prayer for a special object, we should at first feel ourselves
          dull, and lumpish, and heavy. Then let us resolve, |Well, I shall not
          go down to my dinner. I shall stop here. I feel anxious for a praying
          frame of mind, and I will keep alone; and if when the time for evening
          meal came on, we should say, |I feel a little craving of hunger, but I
          will satisfy them with some very slender nutriment -- a piece of
          bread, or something of the kind -- and I will continue in prayer,| I
          think that very likely towards evening our prayers would become more
          forcible and vehement than at any other part of the day. We do not
          exactly recommend this for those who are weak. There are some men with
          little or no encumbrance of flesh about them; but others of us of a
          heavy make, with sluggishness for a temptation, have to cry out
          because we are rather like stones on the ground than birds in the air.
          To such, I think, we can venture to recommend it from the words of
          Christ. At any rate, I can suppose a father here setting apart a day
          of prayer, going on wrestling with God without any intermission;
          pleading with him till, as it was said of the famous martyr of
          Brussels, he would so pray that he forgot everything except his
          prayer; and when they came to call him to meat, he made no answer, for
          he had got out of all earthly things in his wrestling with the angel,
          that he could not think of anything besides. Such a man taking up the
          case of a gross sinner, I believe, would be the means of that sinner's
          conversion; and the reason why some are never brought to Christ, is,
          speaking after the manner of men, because we have not got the
          qualified to deal with them; for |this kind goeth not out save with
          prayer and fasting.| When we have prayed, and have reached the point
          of true faith, then the sinner is saved by the mighty power of God,
          and Christ is glorified. Methinks I have some in this house who are
          ready to say, |Well, if such be the case, I will try it. I will take
          the Master at his word.| Brother, brother, if half-a-dozen of us
          joined together, it might be better; nay, |If two agree as touching
          any one thin,| it would be done. Let some of us put it to the test
          upon some big sinner, and see whether it does not come true. I think I
          may fairly ask you who are lovers of souls, who have eyes which do
          weep, and hearts which can feel, to try my Master's prescription, and
          see if the most unmanageable devil which ever took possession of a
          human heart, be not driven out, as the result of prayer and fasting,
          in the exercise of your faith. The Lord bless you in this thing, and
          may he bring us all to trust in Jesus by a saving faith. To him be
          glory, for ever and ever. Amen.<br />
