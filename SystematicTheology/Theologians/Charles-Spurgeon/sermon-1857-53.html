        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.161)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 1, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round
          about his people from henceforth even for ever." -- Psalm 125:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE CHANGES of society may well illustrate the immutability of God. In
          the days of David, Jerusalem was looked upon as an impregnable
          fortress. It is surrounded by a natural rampart of hills; and appears
          to lie in the center of an amphitheatre raised purposely for its
          defense. By the ancient Jew it was considered to be an impregnable
          citadel. How changed now are the manners of war! A small troop could
          easily take the city, and it must indeed be a strong army that would
          be able to garrison it in its present condition. Yet whilst Jerusalem
          is changed, and the figure has become inappropriate, Jerusalem's God
          remains, for with him is "no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
          We must this morning consider the text, not as we should understand it
          in our day, but as we should have understood it in David's time. David
          looked upon the city of Jerusalem, and he thought within himself, "No
          army can ever be able to surprise this city, and however numerous may
          be the invading hosts, my people will always be able to hold their own
          in the midst of a city so firmly fortified both by nature and by art."
          In his time, indeed, and in the time of his son Solomon, I suppose it
          would have been utterly impossible for any enemy, possessed only of
          the tactics of ancient warfare, to have scaled those mighty ramparts
          of earth which God had piled about the city. And therefore, when David
          said in his day, "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the
          Lord is round about his people;" he meant this -- "As Jerusalem is
          fortressed by the mountains, so are God's people castled in the
          covenant, fortressed in the Omnipotence of God, and therefore they are
          impregnably secure. We shall thus understand the text, and endeavor
          this morning to work out the great thought of the security of God's
          people in the arms of Jehovah their Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall consider the text, first, as relating to the Church as a
          whole, and then we shall endeavor to note how it applies to every
          individual in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. FIRST, THE CHURCH AS A WHOLE is secured by God beyond the reach of
          harm. She is ably garrisoned by Omnipotence, and she is castled within
          the faithful engagements of the covenant. How often has the Church
          been attacked; but how often has she been victorious? The number of
          her battles is just the number of her victories. Foes have come
          against her; they have compassed her about, they have compassed her
          about like bees, but in the name of God she has destroyed them. The
          bull of Bashan and the dog of Belial, the mighty and the
          insignificant, have all conspired to overthrow the Church; but he that
          sitteth in heaven hath laughed at them, the Lord hath had them in
          derision, and his church hath been as Mount Zion, which cannot be
          removed, but which abideth for ever. Turn ye now to the roll of
          history and read how the Church has been fortressed by God, when
          fiercely attacked by men.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Persecution has unsheathed its bloody sword, and sought to rend up
          the Church by its roots, or fell it with its axe. Tyrants have heated
          their furnaces, have prepared their racks, have erected their stakes,
          the martyrs of Christ have been dragged by thousands to a terrible
          death, the confessors have had to stand forth at the risk of their
          lives, protesting the gospel of God against the dominant of the times.
          The little flock has been scattered hither and thither, and the dogs
          of persecution have worried them in every corner whither they have
          fled. Into every nation of the earth have they wandered; in sheepskins
          and goatskins have they been clothed; their houses have been in the
          rocks and their sleeping places in the caves of the earth. Like the
          stag pursued by the hounds, they have not had a moment's space for so
          much as to take their breath. But has the Church been subdued? Has she
          ever been overcome? O God, thou hast proved the invincibility of thy
          truth; thou hast manifested the power of thy Word, for thou hast not
          only preserved thy Church in the time of greatest trouble, but,
          blessed be thy name thou hast made the hour of her peril the hour of
          her greatest triumph. You will find that whenever the Church has been
          the most persecuted she has been the most successful. The heathen
          Pro-consuls wondered when they saw the many who were prepared to die.
          They said, "Surely a madness must have seized upon mankind, that they
          cannot be content to commit suicide, but are so fond of death that
          they must come to our bar and plead that they are lovers of Christ as
          if they sought to compel us to execute them." God gave grace for the
          moment and in the day of persecution he braced the nerves of his
          people, and made them mighty to do or die, as God would have it. But,
          surely, had not Christ's Church been surrounded by the mountains of
          God's Omnipotence, she must have fallen a prey to her numerous
          enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But by-and-bye the devil grew wiser. He saw that overt persecution
          would not suffice for the putting down of God's Church, and he
          therefore adopted another measure not less cruel but more crafty. "I
          will not only slay them," said he, "I will malign them." Did you ever
          read in history the horrible reports which were set afloat in the
          early ages of Christianity concerning the Christians. I dare not tell
          you with what vices the early Christians were charged in their private
          assemblies. It is certain that they were the purest and most virtuous
          of men, but never were men so fearfully belied. The very heathens who
          revelled in vice, despised the followers of Jesus on account of crimes
          which the voice of the liar had laid to their charge. A few years
          elapsed and the mud which had been cast upon the snow-white garments
          of Christ's Church fell off from them, leaving them whiter than
          before, the clouds that sought to obscure the light of the heaven of
          the gospel were blown away, and "fair as the moon and clear as the
          sun" the innocence of Christ's Church shone forth again. But the devil
          has adopted the same plan in every period. He has always sought to
          slander any race of Christians who are the means of revival. I would
          not believe any minister to be eminently successful, if I were
          informed that everybody praised him. I am certain that such a case
          would be an exception, a glaring exception to all the rules of
          history. You remember what was said of Whitfield in his day. He was
          charged with crimes that Sodom never knew; and yet a more pure and
          heavenly man God never sent to tread this wicked earth. And it ever
          must be so. The Church struggling with sin and wickedness, must
          through the enmity of the evil one find herself bespattered and
          besmeared with slander. The wicked when they can do nothing else
          against the righteous, will spit falsehood on them. But has the Church
          suffered through their slander, or hath ever a solitary Christian lost
          aught by it? No, the Lord God who set the mountains round about
          Jerusalem has so put himself about his people, that no weapon that is
          formed against us shall prosper, and every tongue that riseth against
          us in judgment we shall condemn. This is the heritage of the people of
          the Lord. Fear not, O Church of Christ, the slimy serpent of slander
          for even in thy cradle, like Hercules, when the snakes of slander came
          against thee thou didst slay them in thine infantile grasp, more than
          a conqueror through him that loved thee. And now that God is with
          thee, and the shout of a king in thy midst, fear not, though all men
          should speak against thee, thy Master will yet honor thee, and thou
          wilt come up from the pool of slander like a sheep from the washing,
          the fairer for thy black baptism, the more admired, the more lovely
          for all the scorn and ignominy that men have cast upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, Satan learned wisdom, and he said, "Now inasmuch as I cannot
          destroy this people, neither by sword nor slander, lo, this will I do,
          I will send into their midst wolves in sheeps clothing, I will inspire
          divers heretics, carried away with their own lusts, who shall in the
          midst of the church promulgate lies and prophecy smooth things in the
          name of the Lord. And Satan has done all this with a vengeance. In
          every era of the church there have been numberless bands of heretics.
          Only a small company have in certain times adhered to the truth,
          whilst the mass of professing Christians have gone aside and have
          perished in the gainsaying of Korah. Look at the earliest days of
          Christianity. Scarcely were the apostles in their graves, and their
          souls in paradise, than there sprang up men who denied the Lord that
          bought them -- some who did evil that good might come, whose damnation
          was just. Heresies of all kinds began to spring up, even in the first
          fifty years after the departure of our Master. Since that time the
          world has been very prolific of every shape and form of doctrine
          except the truth, and down to these modern times heresies have
          prevailed. Now behold how Satan seeks to quench the light of Israel.
          There is the heresy of Rome, she that sitteth upon many waters seeketh
          as far as she can to delude the Church, and to draw the rest of the
          world aside from the truth of God. She, with all the craft of hell,
          seeketh to proselyte where'er she may from those who are the professed
          followers of the truth; she will change her shape in every land; in
          her own dominions she will build the dungeon, and practice intolerance
          -- in a land of freedom she can plead for liberty, and pretend to be
          its warmest friend. Base harlot that she is, her whoredoms have not
          yet ceased, nor is the cup of her fornications full. She seeketh still
          to devour the nations and swallow them up quick. There is her sister
          the Puseyism of the Church of England, I speak nothing now concerning
          my evangelical brethren. God Almighty shield them and bless them! My
          only marvel is, that they do not come out altogether, and touch not
          the unclean thing. But, alas, Puseyism is seeking to eat out the very
          vitals of our godliness, telling the masses that the priest is
          everything -- putting down Christ and exalting the man, putting
          baptismal water in the place of the influences of the Divine Spirit,
          and exalting sacraments into the place which is only to be held by the
          Lord our God. Truly this dangerous and deceptive, beautiful and
          foolish system of religion is much to be feared, although we know that
          the true Church of God must ever be safe, for against her the gates of
          hell shall not prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! that we should have to say something else! and this concerning
          those who are commonly called evangelical, who have a form of error
          more insidious and evil still. Alas that I should have to "cry aloud
          and spare not," concerning these matters. These are days when a false
          charity would have us hold our tongues against the evils that we hate.
          My brethren, in the midst of our dissenting churches especially there
          is a system which does not deserve the name of system, except from its
          systematic desire to crush every system. There is a system springing
          up which takes out of the Gospel every truth that makes it precious
          plucks every jewel out of the crown of the Redeemer, and tramples it
          under the foot of men. In a large number of our pulpits at this time
          you will not hear the Gospel preached by a month together. Anything
          else you like you may hear preached: Anti-state Churchism, political
          affairs -- these are the current staple of the day; Christ and him
          crucified may go to the dogs for them. Polities fill up the pulpits,
          and philosophy stands in the place of theology. And when there is a
          little theology, what say they? Instead of exalting the Holy Spirit as
          the first and prime agent, they are ever exhorting men to do what only
          God's Spirit can do for them, and not reminding them that the
          effectual grace of God is necessary; the covenant, the "everlasting
          covenant, ordered in all things and sure" is sneered at the banner
          once held so manfully by Calvin, who took it from the hand of
          Augustine leaping over centuries to grasp it, who again received it
          from the hand of the apostle Paul -- the banner of the old fashioned
          truth is to a great degree furled, and we are told that these old
          doctrines are effete and out of date. Puritanical divinity, they say,
          is not the divinity for these times; we must have a new gospel for a
          go-a-head era. We must have sermons preached which, if they be not
          absolute denial of every doctrine of the gospel, are at least sneers
          at them all. The man effects to be so supremely wise, that he in his
          own brain can devise a gospel better, fairer than the ancient gospel
          of the blessed God, Now, this is one of the attempts of the enemy to
          put down the truth, but he will never be able to do it, for "As the
          mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his
          people from henceforth even for ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          I will not be hard, but I must say a word to many of my brethren of
          the denomination to which I belong. There are many of you call
          yourselves Particular Baptists, by which you mean that you are
          Calvinists, and yet, gentlemen, your consciences are easy, and some of
          you have never preached upon election since you were ordained. The
          peculiarities of "the five points" are concealed. These things, you
          say, are offensive. And so, gentlemen, you would rather offend God
          than you would offend man. But you reply, "These things, you know, are
          high doctrines; they had better not be preached: they will not be
          practical." I do think that the climax of all man's blasphemy is
          centred in that utterance. Will you dare to say, "There are some parts
          of God's truth that we do not want to preach to the people." Tell me
          that God put a thing in the Bible that I am not to preach! You are
          finding fault with my God. But you say, "It will be dangerous." What!
          God's truth dangerous? I should not like to stand in your shoes when
          you have to face your Maker on the day of judgment after such an
          utterance as that. If it be not God's truth, let it alone; but if you
          believe the thing, out with it. The world will like you just as well
          for being honest, and if the world does not your Master will. Keep
          back nothing; tell the whole gospel out. Tell out man's
          responsibility: do not stutter at it. Tell out divine sovereignty: do
          not refuse to talk of election, use the word, even if they sneer, tell
          men that if they believe not the blood is on their own heads, and then
          if the high people turn against you, snap your finger in their face;
          tell them you do not care -- that to you it is nothing, nothing at all
          to please man; your Master is in heaven, and him will you please, come
          fair, come foul. This done, Satan would be balked and defeated; but at
          the present moment, he is mightily striving thus to overthrow the
          church by ill doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The craftiest invention of the devil, with which he seeks, in the
          last place to put out the church, is a device which has amazed me
          above every other. "Now;" says Satan, "If I can quench the church,
          neither by persecution, nor slander, nor heresy, I will invent another
          mode of destroying her." And I have often marveled at the depths of
          deceit which are centred in this last invention of Satan. Satan seeks
          to divide the church, to set us apart from one another, and not allow
          those who love the same truth to meet with each other and to work
          together in love, and peace, and harmony. "Now," says the devil, "I
          have it. Here is one body of good men -- they are very fond of one
          part of God's truth. Now, there are two sets of truths in the Bible.
          One set deals with man as responsible creature, the other class of
          truths deals with God as the infinite Sovereign, dispensing his mercy
          as he pleases. Now these dear brethren are very fond of man's
          responsibility: they will preach it, and they will preach it so that
          if they hear the brother over the other side of the street preach
          God's sovereignty, they will be very wroth with him. And then I will
          make the brethren who preach divine sovereignty forget the other part
          of the truth, and hate the brethren that preach it." Do you not see
          the craft of the enemy? Both of these good men are right; they both
          preach parts of truth; but they each so set their part of truth at the
          top of the other that a rivalry commences. Why, I have stepped in and
          heard a godly brother preach a sermon that sent my blood through my
          veins at a most rapid rate, whilst he earnestly preached of sin, of
          righteousness, and of judgment to come but he spoilt all his sermon by
          indirectly hinting -- "Now, take care you don't hear Mr. So-and-so,
          because he will contradict all this, and tell you that you are saved
          by grace, and that it is not of yourself but it is the gift of God." I
          went, of course, and heard the good man, because I was told not to go.
          Well, he was preaching that "it is not of the will of the flesh, nor
          of the will of man, but of God," and I thought he handled the text
          very manfully, when he showed that God was the author of all
          salvation; only in a parenthesis he told us not to go to that
          work-mongering shop on the other side of the road. Why, they were both
          right, but they had each got different parts of the truth; one, that
          truth which dealt with man as responsible; the other, that which deals
          with God as a Sovereign; and the devil had so perverted their judgment
          that they could not see that both things were true, but they must go
          fighting each other just to make sport for Satan. Now, I wonder that
          the church has not been utterly destroyed by this last device, for it
          is the craftiest thing, I believe, that Satan has yet brought under
          our notice, though without doubt his depths are too deep for our
          understanding. But, brethren, despite all this, let bigotry rave, let
          intolerance rail till it goes mad, the church is just as secure, for
          God hath set himself round about her, "even as the mountains are round
          about Jerusalem, from henceforth even for evermore."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now just notice, before we leave this point, that as the Church
          always has been preserved, the text assures us she always will be,
          henceforth even for ever. There is a nervous old woman here. Last
          Saturday night she read the newspaper, and she saw something about
          five or six clergymen going over to Rome: she laid down her
          spectacles, and she began crying, "Oh! the Church is in danger, the
          Church is in danger." Ah! put your spectacles on; that is all right;
          never mind about the loss of those fellows. Better gone; we did not
          want them; do not cry if fifty more follow them, do not be at all
          alarmed. Some church may be in danger, but God's Church is not. That
          is safe enough, that shall stand secure, even to the end. I remember
          with what alarm some of my friends received the tidings of the
          geological discoveries of modern times, which did not quite agree with
          their interpretation of the Mosaic history of the creation. They
          thought it an awful thing that science should discover something which
          seemed to contradict the Scriptures. Well, we lived over the
          geological difficulty, after all. And since then there have been
          different sets of philosophic infidels, who have risen up and made
          wonderful discoveries, and poor timid Christians have thought, "What a
          terrible thing! This surely will be the end of all true religion; when
          science can bring facts against us, how shall we be able to stand?"
          They just waited about another week, and on a sudden they found that
          science was not their enemy, but their friend, for the Truth though
          tried in a furnace like silver seven times, is ever a gainer by the
          trial. Ah! ye that hate the church, she shall ever be a thorn in your
          side! Oh! ye that would batter her walls to pieces, know this, that
          she is impregnable, not one of her stakes shall be removed, not one of
          her cords shall be broken. God hath fixed her where she is, and by
          divine decree established her on a rock. Do you hate the Church? Hate
          on: it will never be moved by all your hate. Do you threaten to crush
          it? It shall crush you, but you shall never injure it. Do ye despise
          and laugh at it? Ah! the day is coming when the laugh shall be on the
          other side. Wait a little while, and when her Master shall suddenly
          come in his glory, then shall it be seen on whose side is the victory,
          and who were the fools that laughed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have disposed of the first point; THE CHURCH impregnably
          secure, fortressed, and castled by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. What is true of the mass is true of the unit. The fact which
          relates to the Church includes in it EVERY MEMBER OF THE CHURCH. God
          has fortressed his people; so that every believer is infallibly
          secure. There are in the world certain people who teach that Christ
          gives grace to men, and tells them, "Now, you shall be saved it you
          will persevere; but this must be left to yourself." This reminds me of
          an old Puritanical illustration, "The Duke of Alva having given some
          prisoners their lives, they afterwards petitioned him for some food.
          His answer was, that, he would grant them life but no meat.' And they
          were famished to death." The deniers of final perseverance represent
          the Deity in a similar view. God promises eternal life to the saints
          if they endure to the end,' but he will not secure to them the
          continuance of that grace without which eternal life cannot be had!
          Oh! surely if that were true, eternal life were not worth a fig to any
          of us. Unless our God who first saves us did engage to keep us alive
          and to provide for all our necessities, of what use were eternal life
          at all? But we bless his name,
        </p>
        <p>"Whom once he loves he never leaves,</p>
        <p>But loves them to the end."</p>
        <p>Once in Christ, in Christ for ever,</p>
        <p>Nothing from his love can sever."</p>
        <p>
          The Christian is fortified and secured from all harm. And yet, O child
          of God, there be many that will seek to destroy thee, and thy fears
          will often tell thee that thou art in the jaws of the enemy.
          Providence will often seem against thee, thine eyes shall be seldom
          dry; it may be funeral shall follow funeral. Loss shall follow loss; a
          burning house shall be succeeded by a blasted crop. The Christian in
          this world is not secured against the perils which happen to manhood.
          Oh! child of God, it may seem that all things are against thee;
          perhaps all God's waves and billows will go over thee; thou mayest
          know what hunger, and nakedness, and thirst do mean; thou mayest be
          found in this world houseless, friendless, fatherless, motherless, but
          oh! remember, that neither famine, nor hunger, nor poverty, nor
          sickness, nor weakness, nor contempt, can separate thee from the love
          of God, which is in Christ Jesus thy Lord. Thou mayest sink ever so
          low, but thou canst never sink lower than the arm of God can reach.
          Thy poor ship may be drifted before the gale, but it shall never go so
          fast but God can keep her off the rocks. Be of good cheer, the trials
          of this mortal life shall work out for thee "a far more exceeding and
          eternal weight of glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, you may be tempted by the world! traps may be set for you on
          every hand, you may be tempted by your flesh, your corruptions may
          have great power over you, and often stagger your faith, and make you
          tremble, lest you should be utterly overthrown, and the devil may set
          upon you with fiery darts, he may pierce you with foul insinuations,
          he may almost make you blaspheme, and with terrible suggestions he may
          drive you well-nigh to despair. But oh! remember,
        </p>
        <p>"Hell and thy sins obstruct thy course,</p>
        <p>But hell and sin are vanquished foes;</p>
        <p>Thy Jesus nailed them to his cross</p>
        <p>And sang the triumph when he rose."</p>
        <p>
          And thou mayest, too, be overcome by sin. Thou mayest fall God grant
          thou mayest not; but though thou be kept eminently consistent and
          extremely virtuous, thou wilt sin and sometimes that sin will get such
          a head against thee that thou canst scarcely stem the torrent.
          Conscience will whisper, "How couldst thou be a child of God, and yet
          sin thus?" And Satan will howl in thine ears, "He that sinneth knoweth
          not God." And so thou wilt be ready to be destroyed by thy sin. But do
          thou then, in the hour of thy dark distress, read this verse -- "As
          the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about
          his people from henceforth even for ever." Be thou confident in this,
          that even sin itself shall not be able to cut the golden link which
          joins thee to thy Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you never heard the sermons of those people who believe in the
          apostacy of the saints? Have you not heard them very pathetically
          enlarge on the dangers of Christians? They say, "Yes, you may serve
          God all your life, but perhaps in the last article of death your faith
          may faint, sin may prevail, and you may be destroyed." And they
          illustrate their very beautiful and comfortable idea by the figure of
          a ship foundering just as she reaches the harbour. Now, many wooden
          ships, I doubt not, do founder, and many ships built in free-will
          dockyards founder too; but the chosen vessels of mercy are insured
          against perishing, and were never known to be shipwrecked yet. As an
          old divine says, there are no wrecks to be seen on the sea which rolls
          between Jerusalem on earth and Jerusalem above. There are many
          tempests, but never any shipwrecks. Bishop Hooker sweetly says
          "Blessed for ever and ever, be that mother's child whose faith hath
          made him the child of God. The earth may shake, the pillars thereof
          may tremble under us, the countenance of the heavens may be appalled,
          the sun may lose his light, the moon her beauty, the stars their
          glory, but concerning the man that trusted in God, if the fire have
          proclaimed itself unable as much as to singe a hair of his head; if
          lions, beasts ravenous by nature and keen by hunger, being set to
          devour, have, as it were, religiously adored the very flesh of a
          faithful man; what is there in the world that shall change his heart,
          overthrow his faith, alter his affections towards God, or the
          affection of God to him?" Oh, when we once believe this doctrine and
          receive it in our hearts as true, what a tendency it has to make the
          spirit buoyant in the deep waters, to enable us to sing in the midst
          of the fierce billows. Who need fear, if our salvation is made secure
          by the covenant of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now for a few moments, without detaining you too long, I will try
          to show some reasons why it is quite certain that the believer cannot
          by any possibility perish. I want to do this, because I have a
          multitude of letters from this large congregation every week, and I
          have to say to the glory of God, there are many of those letters that
          make me so glad I can scarcely contain myself, whilst others arouse
          all the anxiety of my heart. Among them is one something like this.
          "Sir, I know that I was once a child of God; many years ago I had such
          delightful feelings, and such ecstacies, that I cannot doubt but what
          if I had died then I should have gone to heaven; but now, sir, I am in
          such distress that I am quite sure if I were to die now I should be
          lost." Now, my brother, I know you are here. You may take it to
          yourself. There are only two solutions to your mystery. If you were a
          child of God then, you are a child of God now, and if you would have
          gone to heaven then you will go to heaven now, be you what you may; if
          you ever were regenerated, regeneration is a work that is never done
          but once, and if it has been done once for you, it has not lost its
          efficacy -- you are a child of God yet. But I am inclined to think you
          never were a child of God: you had a few fine ecstacies; but you never
          knew the plague of your own heart; I am afraid, young man, you were
          never taken into God's stripping room, never were tied up to the
          halberts, and never had the ten-thonged whip of law on your back. But,
          anyhow, do not tell me any more that you were converted once but not
          now, because if you were converted to God, God would have kept you.
          "The righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands
          shall wax stronger and stronger."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now shall I tell you why it is certain a believer cannot perish?
          In the first place, how can a believer perish if that Scripture be
          true, which saith, that every believer is a member of Christ's body!
          If you will only grant me my head afloat above the water I will give
          you leave to drown my fingers. Try it: you cannot do it. As long as a
          man's head is above the flood you cannot drown him -- it is clean
          impossible -- nor yet drown any part of his body. Now, a Christian is
          a part of Christ, the Head. Christ, the head of the body, is in
          heaven, and until you can drown the head of the body, you cannot drown
          the body, and if the head be in heaven, beyond the reach of harm, then
          every member of the body is alive and secure, and shall at last be in
          heaven too. Dost thou imagine, O heretic, that Christ will lose a
          member of his body! Will Christ dwell in heaven with a mangled frame?
          God forbid! If Christ hath taken us into union with himself, though we
          be the meanest members of his heavenly body, he will not allow us to
          be cut away. Will a man lose a arm, or a leg, or an hand, whilst he
          can help himself? Ah! no, and whilst Christ is omnipotent, nought
          shall pluck his children from his body, for they are of "his flesh and
          his bones."
        </p>
        <p>
          But again: how can a believer perish, and yet God be true? God has
          said "When thou passest through the rivers I will be with thee, and
          the floods shall not overflow thee." Now, if they should overflow us,
          how can God be true? "When thou passest through the fires thou shalt
          not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Then if we
          could ever find a believer consumed, we could prove God's promise
          broken. But we cannot do that. God is with his children, and ever will
          be. Besides has he not said, "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and
          they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my
          hands?" Ay, beloved, how can God be God, and yet his people plucked
          out of his hand? Surely he were no God to us, if he were unfaithful to
          a promise so oft repented and so solemnly confirmed. Besides, mark ye
          this. If one saint should fall away and perish, God would not only
          break his word, but his oath, for he hath sworn by himself, because he
          could swear by no greater, "that by two immutable things, in which it
          was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who
          have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us." No, an
          oath-breaking God, a promise-despising Jehovah, were an impossibility;
          and therefore a perished child of God is alike impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we need not fear, beloved, that we shall ever perish, if we love
          the Saviour for the last reason is all potent. Will Christ lose that
          which he has bought with his own blood? Yes, there are men with
          judgments so perverted, that they believe Christ died for those that
          are damned, and bought with his own blood men that perish. Well, if
          they choose to believe that, I do not envy them the elasticity of
          their intellects; but this I conceive to be but an axiom, that what
          Christ has paid for so dearly with his own heart's blood he will have.
          If he loved us well enough to bear the excruciating agonies of the
          cross, I know he loves "well enough to keep us to the end." If when we
          were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much
          more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life." For I am
          persuaded that he that spared not his own life, but delivered it up
          for his people, will not withhold aught that Omnipotence can "ire.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I close by addressing myself for a moment or two to ungodly
          persons present. Thinking persons they must be, or else what I say
          will not be likely to be noticed by them. When I was a boy I remember
          having a meditation something like this: "Now, I should not like to be
          a thief or a murderer, or an unclean person." I had such a training
          that I had an abhorrence of sin of that sort. "And yet," thought I to
          myself, "I may be hung yet; there is no reason why I should not turn
          out a thief," because I recollected there were some of my
          schoolfellows, older than I was, who had already become very eminent
          in dishonesty; and I thought, "why may not I?" No one can tell the
          rapture of my spirit, when I thought I saw in my Bible the doctrine
          that if I gave my heart to Christ he would keep me from sin and
          preserve me as long as I lived. I was not quite sure of it -- not
          quite certain that was the truth of the Bible, though I thought so;
          but I remember when I heard the minister of some small hyper chapel
          utter the same truth. Oh! my heart was full of rapture; I panted after
          that gospel. "Oh!" I thought, if God would but love me, if I might but
          know myself to be his!" For the enchanting part of it was, that if I
          were so he would keep me to the end. That made me so in love with the
          gospel, that boy as I was, knowing nothing savingly about the gospel,
          it made me love the thought of being saved, because, if saved, God
          would never turn me out of doors. That made the gospel very precious
          to me in my childhood; so that when the Holy Spirit showed me my guilt
          and led me to seek a Saviour, that doctrine was like a bright star to
          my spirit. I always looked forward to that. I thought, "Well, if I can
          once look to Christ, and cast myself on him, then he will grant me
          grace that I shall to the end endure." And oh! that doctrine is so
          precious to me now, that I do think if anybody could possibly convince
          me that final perseverance is not a truth of the Bible, I should never
          preach again, for I feel I should have nothing worth preaching. If you
          could once make me believe that the regeneration of God might fail of
          its effect, and that the love of God might be separated from his own
          chosen people, you might keep that Bible to yourself; between its
          cover there is nothing that I love, nothing that I wish for, no gospel
          that is suitable for me. I count it to be a gospel beneath the dignity
          of God, and beneath the dignity of even fallen manhood, unless it be
          everlasting, "ordered in all things and sure."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now poor trembling sinner, thou that knowest thy sins, believe on
          Christ this morning, and thou art saved, and saved for ever. Do but
          this moment look to him that died upon the tree, and, my brother, my
          sister, give me thine hand, and let us weep for joy that thou
          believest, and let our joy accumulate when we remember that the
          pillars of the heavens may totter, the solid foundations of the earth
          may reel, the countenance of the heavens may be astonished, the sun
          may be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, but nought shall
          pluck thee from the strength of Israel's hands. Thou art, thou shalt
          be infallibly secure. Come, O Holy Spirit, bless these words; for
          Jesus sake. Amen.
