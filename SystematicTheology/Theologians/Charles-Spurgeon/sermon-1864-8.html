        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.556)</p>
        <p>By the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"A friend of publicans and sinners." -- Matthew 11:19.</p>
        <p>
          MANY A TRUE WORD is spoken in jest, and many a tribute to virtue has
          been unwittingly paid by the sinister lips of malice. The enemies of
          our Lord Jesus Christ thought to brand him with infamy, hold him up to
          derision, and hand his name down to everlasting scorn, as "a friend of
          publicans and sinners." Short-sighted mortals! Their scandal published
          his reputation. To this day the Savior is adored by the title which
          was minted as a slur. It was designed to be a stigma, that every good
          man would shudder at and shrink from; it has proved to be a
          fascination which wins the heart, and enchants the soul of all the
          godly. Saints in heaven, and saints on earth delight to sing of him
          thus --
        </p>
        <p>"Savior of sinners they proclaim,</p>
        <p>Sinners of whom the chief I am."</p>
        <p>
          What the invidious Jews said in bitter spleen, has been turned by the
          Holy Spirit to the most gracious account. Where they poured out vials
          of hate, odours of sacred incense arise. Troubled consciences have
          found a sweet balm in the very sound. Jesus, "the friend of publicans
          and sinners," has proved himself friendly to them, and they have
          become friends with him; so completely has he justified the very name
          which his enemies gave him in ribald affront.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall take this title of Jesus to-night as an order of distinction
          which sets forth his excellency, and as God helps us, we shall try to
          exalt his name and proclaim his fame, while we attempt to explain how
          he was the friend of sinners; and how he shows that he is still the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. OUR LORD PROVED HIMSELF IN HIS OWN TIME TO BE THE FRIEND OF
          SINNERS.
        </p>
        <p>
          What better proof could he give of it than coming from the majesty of
          his Father's house to the meanness of Bethlehem's manger? What better
          proof could he give than leaving the society of cherubim and seraphim,
          to lie in the manger where the horned oxen fed, and to become the
          associate of fallen men? The incarnation of the Savior in the very
          form of sinners, taking upon himself the flesh of sinners, being born
          of a sinner, having a sinner for his reputed father -- his very being
          a man, which is tantamount to being in the same form with sinners --
          surely this were enough to prove that he is the sinner's friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you take up the roll of his earthly lineage and begin to read it
          through, you will be struck with the fact that there are but few women
          mentioned in it; and yet three out of those mentioned were harlots, so
          that even in his lineage there was the taint of sin, and a sinner' s
          blood would have run in his veins if he had been the true son of
          Joseph; but inasmuch as he was begotten by the Holy Ghost, who
          overshadowed the Virgin, in him was no sin; yet his reputed pedigree
          ran through the veins of sinners. Tamar, and Rahab, and Bath-sheba are
          three names which bring to remembrance deeds of shame, and yet these
          stand in the records as the ancestors of the Son of Mary, the sinner's
          friend!
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as Jesus Christ, being born in the likeness of sinful flesh,
          has come to years of maturity, and has commenced his real life-work,
          he at once discloses his friendship for sinners by associating with
          them. You do not find him standing at a distance, issuing his mandates
          and his orders to sinners to make themselves better, but you find him
          coming among them like a good workman who stands over his work; he
          takes his place where the sin and the iniquity are, and he personally
          comes to deal with it. He does not write out a prescription and send
          by another hand his medicines with which to heal the sickness of sin,
          but he comes right into the lazar-house, touches the wounded, looks at
          the sick; and there is healing in the touch; there is life in the
          look. The great Physician took upon himself our sicknesses and bare
          our infirmities, and so proved himself to be really the sinner's
          friend. Some people appear to like to have a philanthropic love
          towards the fallen, but yet they would not touch them with a pair of
          tongs. They would lift them up if they could, but it must be by some
          machinery -- some sort of contrivance by which they would not degrade
          themselves or contaminate their own hands. Not so the Savior. Up to
          the very elbow he seems to thrust that gracious arm of his into the
          mire, to pull up the lost one out of the horrible pit and out of the
          miry clay. He takes himself the mattock and the spade, and goes to
          work in the great quarry that he may get out the rough stones which
          afterwards he will himself polish with his own bitter tears and bloody
          sweat, that he may make them fit to shine for ever in the glorious
          temple of the Lord his God. He comes himself into direct, personal
          contact with sin, without being contaminated with it. He comes as
          close to it as a man can come. He eats and drinks with sinners. He
          sits at the Pharisee's table one day, and does not rise because there
          is a crowd of people no better than they should be coming near him.
          Another day he goes to the publican's house, and the publican had, no
          doubt, been a great extortioner in his time; but Jesus sits there, and
          that day does salvation come to that publican's house. Beloved, this
          is a sweet trait about Christ, and proves how real and how true was
          his love, that he made his associations with sinners, and did not shun
          even the chief of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nay, he not only came among them, but he was always seeking their good
          by his ministry. If there was anywhere a sinner, a lost sheep of the
          house of Israel, Christ was after that sinner. Never such an
          indefatigable shepherd; he sought that which was lost till he found
          it. One of his earliest works of mercy we will tell you of in brief.
          He was once on a journey, and Samaria was a little out of his way; but
          there lived in a city of that country a woman -- ah! the less said of
          her the better. She had had five husbands, and he whom she then had
          was not her husband, nor were any of the others either. She was a
          disgrace to that city of Samaria. But Jesus, who has a keen eye for
          sinners, and a heart which beats high for them, means to save that
          woman, and he must and he will have her. Being weary, he sits down on
          a well to rest. A special providence brings the woman to the well. The
          conventionalities of society forbid him to talk with her. But he
          breaks through the narrow bigotry of caste. A Samaritan by birth, he
          cares not for that; but will that most holy being condescend to have
          familiar conversation with her -- a dishonor to her sex? He will. His
          disciples may marvel when they come back and find him talking with
          her, but he will do it. He begins to open up the Word of life to her
          understanding, and that woman becomes the first Christian missionary
          we ever hear of, for she ran back to the city, leaving her water-pot,
          and crying, "Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did:
          is not this the Christ?" And they came and believed; and there was
          great joy in that city of Samaria. You know, too, that there was
          another sinner. He was a bad fellow -- I fear him. He had been
          constantly grinding the faces of the poor, and getting more out of
          them by way of taxation than he should have done; but the little man
          had the bump of curiosity, and he must needs see the preacher, and the
          preacher must needs love him; for I say there was a wonderful
          attraction in Jesus to a sinner. That sinner's heart was like a piece
          of iron: Christ's heart was like a loadstone; and wherever there was a
          sinner the loadstone began to feel it, and soon the sinner began to
          feel the loadstone too. "Azccheus," said Christ, "make haste, and come
          down; for to-day I must abide at thy house;" and down comes the
          sinner, and salvation has come to his house at that hour, Oh! Christ
          never seemed to preach so sweetly as when he was preaching a sinner's
          sermon. I would have loved to have seen that dear face of his when he
          cried, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
          give you rest;" or, better still, to have seen his eyes running with
          whole showers of tears when he said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem . . . how
          often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth
          her chickens under her wings, and ye would not even!" or to have heard
          him preach those three great sermons upon sinners when he described
          the woman as sweeping the house and taking away the dust, that she
          might find the lost piece of her money; and the shepherd going from
          hill to hill after the wandering sheep; and the father running to
          welcome that rag-clad prodigal; kissing him with the kisses of love,
          clothing him with the best robe, and inviting him into the feast,
          while they did dance and make merry because the lost was found, and he
          who was dead was alive again. Why, he was the mightiest of preachers
          for sinners, beyond a doubt, Oh! how he loved them! Never mind the
          Pharisees: he has thunderbolts for them. "Woe unto you, Scribes and
          Pharisees!" But when publicans and harlots come, he always has the
          gate of mercy ajar for them. For them he always has some tender word,
          some loving saying, such as this -- "Him that cometh unto me, I will
          in no wise cast out." "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
          forgiven unto men;" or such like words of tender wooing. The very
          chief of sinners was thus drawn into the circle of his disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you know, dear friends, he did not prove his love merely by
          preaching to them, and living with them, and by his patience in
          enduring their contradiction against himself, and all their evil words
          and deeds, but he proved it by his prayers too. He used his mighty
          influence with the Father in their behalf. He took their polluted
          names on his holy lips; he was not ashamed to call them brethren.
          Their cause became his own, and in their interest his pulse throbbed.
          How many times on the cold mountains he kept his heart warm with love
          to them! How often the sweat rolled down his face when he was in an
          agony of spirit for them I cannot tell you. This much I do know, that
          on that self-same night when he sweat as it were great drops of blood
          falling down to the ground, he prayed this prayer -- after having
          prayed for his saints, he went on to say -- "Neither pray I for these
          alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their
          word." Here, truly, the heart of the Savior was bubbling up and
          welling over towards sinners. And you never can forget that almost his
          last words were, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
          do." Though wilfully and wickedly they pierced his hands and his feet,
          yet were there no angry words, but only that short, loving, hearty
          prayer -- "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Ah!
          friends, if there ever was a man who was a friend to others, Jesus was
          a friend to sinners his whole life through.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, however, is but little. As for the river of the Savior's love to
          sinners, I have only brought you to its banks. You have but stood on
          the bank and dipped your feet in the flood; but now prepare to swim.
          So fond was he of sinners that he made his grave with the wicked. He
          was numbered with the transgressors. God's fiery sword was drawn to
          smite a world of sinners down to hell. It must fall on those sinners.
          But Christ loves them. His prayers stay the arm of God a little while,
          but still the sword must fall in due time. What is to be done? By what
          means can they be rescued? Swifter than the lightning's flash I see
          that sword descending. But what is that in vision I behold? It falls
          -- but where? Not on the neck of sinners; it is not their neck which
          is broken by its cruel edge; it is not their heart which bleeds
          beneath its awful force. No; the "friend of sinners" has put himself
          into the sinner's place! and then, as if he had been the sinner,
          though in him was no sin, he suffers, bleeds, and dies -- no common
          suffering -- no ordinary bleeding -- no death such as mortals know. It
          was a death in which the second death was comprehended; a bleeding in
          which the very veins of God were emptied. The God-man divinely
          suffered. I know not how else to express the suffering. It was a more
          than mortal agony, for the divine strengthened the human, and the man
          was made vast and mighty to endure through his being a God. Being God
          and man he endured more than ten thousand millions of men all put
          together could have suffered. He endured, indeed, the hells of all for
          whom he died, the torments, or the equivalent for the torments, which
          all of them ought to have suffered -- the eternal wrath of God
          condensed and put into a cup, too bitter for mortal tongue to know,
          and then drained to its utmost dregs by the loving lips of Jesus.
          Beloved, this was love. "Herein is love, that while we were yet
          sinners, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." "Greater love hath
          no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." This
          Christ has done, and he is, therefore demonstrated to be the friend of
          sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the trial is over; the struggle is passed; the Savior is dead and
          buried; he rises again, and after he has spent forty days on earth --
          in that forty days proving still his love for sinners -- he rose again
          for their justification; I see him ascending up on high. Angels attend
          him as the clouds receive him.
        </p>
        <p>"They bring his chariot from on high,</p>
        <p>To bear him to his throne;</p>
        <p>Clap their triumphant wings and cry,</p>
        <p>'The glorious work is done.'"</p>
        <p>
          What pomp! What a procession! What splendor! He will forget his poor
          friends the sinners now, will he not? Not he! I think I hear the song,
          "Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
          doors, that the King of Glory may come in." The bars of massy light
          are all unloosed; the pearly gates are all wide open flung; and as he
          passes through, mark you, the highest joy which swells his soul is
          that he has opened those gates, not for himself, for they were never
          shut on him, but that he has opened them for sinners. It was for this,
          indeed, he died; and it is for this that he ascends on high, that he
          may "open the kingdom of heaven for all believers." See him as he
          rides through heaven's streets! "Thou hast ascended up on high; thou
          hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts of men." Ah! but
          hear the refrain, for this is the sweetest note of all the hymn, "Yea,
          for the rebellious also -- yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord
          God might dwell among them." The scattered gifts of his coronation,
          the lavish bounties of his ascension, are still for sinners. He is
          exalted on high -- for what? To give repentance and remission of sins.
          He still wears upon his breastplate the names of sinners; upon his
          hands and upon his heart does he still bear the remembrance of those
          sinners; and every day for the sinner's sake he doth not hold his
          peace, and for the sinner's sake he doth not rest, but cries unto God
          until every sinner shall be brought safely home. Every sinner who
          believeth, every sinner who was given to him, every sinner whom he
          bought with blood -- he will not rest, I say, till all such are
          gathered to be the jewels of his crown, world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methinks we cannot say more; and 1 think you will say we could not
          have said less concerning the way in which the Savior proved himself
          to be the sinner's friend. If there are any of you who dare to doubt
          him after this, I know not what further to advance. If there can be
          one who has proved himself your friend, surely Jesus did it, and he is
          willing to receive you now. What he has done he still continues to do.
          O that you might have grace to perceive that Jesus is the lover of
          your soul, that you might find the blessedness which all these tokens
          of friendship, of which we have been speaking, have brought for
          believing sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. While we change the subject a little, we shall still keep to the
          text, and notice WHAT CHRIST IS DOING NOW FOR SINNERS.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a deep principle involved here -- a principle the Pharisee of
          old could not understand, and the cold heart of humanity is slow to
          embrace it to-day. I have two explanations to offer of the way in
          which Jesus personally discovers himself to be the friend of sinners,
          and I will just mention these before I come to the application of the
          subject I intend. Once upon a time a woman was brought to Jesus by the
          Scribes and Pharisees: she was an adulteress, she had been taken in
          the very act. They tell "the sinners friend" what sentence Moses would
          pronounce in such a case, and they ask him, how sayest thou? This they
          said tempting him. They were not much concerned about the unhappy
          creature; the accusation they were intent to lay was against the Man
          of Nazareth. You know how he disposed of the case, and put her
          accusers out of countenance. He did not bring the sinner up before the
          magistrate; nay, he would not act the judge's part, and pronounce
          sentence, rather would he act the neighbor's part; he acquitted
          himself as a friend. There is a proverb among a certain class of
          hard-dealing tradesmen, "We know no friendship in business;" and full
          well they carry it out, while they grind the faces of the poor without
          pity, and strive to over-reach one another without fairness. And there
          was in like manner no friendship, no mercy whatever, among those
          gentlemen of the long robe. Righteousness, to their idea, stood in
          exacting justice with rigid severity; and as for wickedness, it was
          only shameful when it was found out. She who was taken in the act must
          be stoned. They who had done it secretly must prosecute. The real
          friendship of Jesus appears in his singling out the object of pity;
          and where they accused him of winking at crime and harbouring the
          criminal, he was truly laying the axe at the root of the tree, and
          sheltering the victims while he upbraided the arrogant rulers, whose
          secret vices were the genuine cause of the wretchedness which had
          fallen upon the dregs of the nation. I commend this thought to your
          consideration. When it is said of him, he is a "friend of pubhicans
          and sinners," it was implied that he was not a friend of Scribes and
          Pharisees. Yet again, I want you to notice that the office which
          Christ came to fulfill towards sinners was that of pure, unmingled
          friendship. Let us give you an illustration. There is an awful story
          abroad: a murder has been committed; and the poor wretch who committed
          it has cut his own throat. The policeman and the surgeon are quickly
          on the spot. The one comes there in the interest of law, the other
          attends in the interest of humanity. Says the officer of police, "Man,
          you are my prisoner;" says the doctor, "My dear fellow, you are my
          patient." And now he lays a delicate hand upon the wound, he stanches
          the blood, applies soft liniments, binds it up with plasters, and,
          bending down his ear, listens to the man's breathing: taking hold of
          his hand, he feels his pulse: gently raising his head, he administers
          to him some wine or stimulant, takes him to the hospital, gives the
          nurse instructions to watch him, and orders that he shall be given
          nutritious diet as he is able to bear it. Day after day he still
          visits him, and uses all his skill and all his diligence to heal the
          man's Wounds. Is that the way to deal with criminals? Certainly it is
          not the manner in which the police deal. Their business is to find out
          all the traces and evidences of his guilt. But the medical attendant
          is not concerned with the man as an evil doer, but as a sufferer. So
          is it with the sinner. Moses is the officer of justice who comes to
          arrest him. Christ is the good Physician who comes to heal him; he
          says, "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thy help."
          He deals with the disease, with the wounds, with the sufferings of
          sinners. He is therefore their friend. Of course the parallel will
          only go a little way. In the instance of the murderer, the surgeon
          would hand his patient over to the officers as soon as his wound was
          recovered; but in the conduct of our Savior he redeems the soul from
          under the law, and delivers it from the penalty of sin, as well as
          restores it from the self-inflicted injuries. But oh! if I could but
          show thee that Christ treats the sinner with pity, rather than with
          indignation; that the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives,
          but to save them; that his visit to our world was mediatoral, not to
          condemn the world, but to give his life a ransom for many; surely,
          then, thou wouldst see reason enough why the sinner should look to him
          as a friend indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! then; I would go further. I would entreat thee to make the case
          thine own. Thou art a sinner; can I not convince thee that he is thy
          friend?
        </p>
        <p>
          You were sick the other day. The physician looked very grave, and
          whispered something to your wife. She did not tell you what it was,
          but your own life trembled in the scale, and it is a wonder you are
          here to-night. Shall I tell you why you are here? Do you see that tree
          yonder? It has been standing in its place for many years, but it has
          never yielded any fruit, and several times the master of the garden
          has said, "Cut it down." The other day the woodman came with his axe;
          he felt its edge, it was sharp and keen enough, and he began to cut,
          and the chips were flying, and he made a deep gash. But the gardener
          came by, one who had watched over the tree, and had hope of it even
          yet, and he said, "Spare it -- spare it yet a little longer; the wound
          thou hast made may heal; and I will dig about it, and dung it, and if
          it bring forth fruit well; spare it another year, and if not then cut
          it down." That tree is yourself. The woodman is Death. That chipping
          at the trunk of the tree was your sickness. Jesus is he who spared
          you. You had not been here to-night -- you had been there in hell
          among damned spirits, howling in unutterable woe, if it had not been
          that the friend of sinners had spared your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And where are you to-night? Perhaps, my hearers, you are in an unusual
          place for you. Your Sunday evenings are not often spent in the house
          of God. There are other places which know you, but your seat there is
          empty to-night. There has been much persuasion to bring you here, and
          it may be that you have come against your will; but some friend has
          asked you to conduct him to the spot, and here you are. Do you know
          why you are here? It is a friendly providence, managed by the sinner's
          friend which has brought you here, that you may hear the sound of
          mercy, and have a loving invitation tendered to you. Be grateful to
          the Savior that he has brought you to the gospel-pool. May you -- O,
          may you this night be made to step in and be washed from sin! But it
          is kind of him, and proves how true a friend he is of sinners, that he
          has brought you here. I will leave you now where you are, and I will
          tell you how he has dealt with other sinners, for mayhap this may lead
          you to ask him to deal the same with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know a sinner -- while I live I must know him. Full well do I
          remember him when he was hard of heart and an enemy to God by a
          multitude of wicked works. But this friend of sinners loved him; and
          passing by one day, he looked right into his soul with such a look,
          that his hard heart began to break. There were deep throes as though a
          birth of a divine sort were coming on. There was an agony, and there
          was a grief unutterable; and that poor soul did not think it kind of
          Jesus; but, indeed, it was kindness too intense ever fully to
          estimate, for there is no saving a soul except by making it feel its
          need of being saved. There must be in the work of grace an emptying
          and a pulling down before there can be a filling and a building up.
          That soul knew no peace for many a year, and the sole of its foot had
          no rest; but one day
        </p>
        <p>"I heard the voice of Jesus say,</p>
        <p>Come unto me and rest;</p>
        <p>Lay down, thou weary one, lay down,</p>
        <p>Thy head upon my breast.</p>
        <p>I came to Jesus as I was,</p>
        <p>Weary, and worn, and sad,</p>
        <p>I found in him a resting-place,</p>
        <p>And he has made me glad!</p>
        <p>I heard the voice of Jesus say,</p>
        <p>Behold, I freely give</p>
        <p>The living water, thirsty one,</p>
        <p>Stoop down, and drink, and live.</p>
        <p>I came to Jesus and I drank</p>
        <p>Of that life-giving stream;</p>
        <p>My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,</p>
        <p>And now I live in him.</p>
        <p>I heard the voice of Jesus say,</p>
        <p>I am this dark world's light,</p>
        <p>Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,</p>
        <p>And all thy days be bright.</p>
        <p>I look'd to Jesus and I found</p>
        <p>In him my star, my sun</p>
        <p>And in that light of light I'll walk,</p>
        <p>Till travelling days are done."</p>
        <p>
          Ay, said I, Christ is the friend of sinners! So say I, and so will I
          say while this poor lisping stammering tongue can articulate a sound.
          And methinks God had a design of abundant mercy when he saved my soul.
          I had not then believed it, though a mother's loving accents might
          have whispered it in my ears. But he seems to remind me of it over and
          over again, till love and terror mingle in my breast, saying, "Woe is
          me if I preach not the gospel." O my blessed Master, thou dost trust
          my lips when thou dost bear witness to my heart. Thou givest charge to
          my tongue when thou constrained my soul. "Am I a chosen vessel?" It is
          to bear his name to sinners. As a full bottle seeks vent, so must my
          testimony pant for utterance. O sinner, if thou trustest him, he will
          be such a friend to thee; and if thou hast now a broken heart and a
          contrite spirit, these are his work; and it is a proof of his great
          love to thee if he has made thee to hunger and thirst after him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me impress upon you that Jesus is the friend of the friendless.
          She who had spent all her money on physicians without getting relief,
          obtained a cure gratis when she came to him. He who bath "nothing to
          pay" gets all his debts cancelled by this friend. And he who was ready
          to perish with hunger, finds not only a passing meal, but a constant
          supply at his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know of a place in England still existing, where there is a dole of
          bread served to every passer-by who chooses to ask for it. Whoever he
          may be he has but to knock at the door of St. Cross Hospital, and
          there is the dole of bread for him. Jesus Christ so loveth sinners
          that he has built a St. Cross Hospital, so that, whenever a sinner is
          hungry, he has but to knock and have his wants supplied. Nay, he has
          done better; he has attached to this hospital of the cross a bath; and
          whenever a soul is black and filthy it has but to go there and be
          washed. The fountain is always full, always efficacious. There is no
          sinner who ever went into it and found it, could not wash away his
          stains. Sins which were scarlet and crimson have all disappeared, and
          the sinner has been whiter than snow. As if this were not enough,
          there is attached to this hospital of the cross a wardrobe, and a
          sinner, making application simply as a sinner, with nothing in his
          hand, but being just empty and naked, he may come and be clothed from
          head to foot. And if he wishes to be a soldier, he may not merely have
          an under garment, but he may have armor which shall cover him from the
          sole of his foot to the crown of his head. Nay, if he wants a sword he
          shall have that given to him, and a shield too. There is nothing that
          his heart can desire that is good for him which he shall not receive.
          He shall have spending-money so long as he lives, and he shall have an
          eternal heritage of glorious treasure when he enters into the joy of
          his Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I cannot tell you all that Christ has done for sinners, but
          this I know, that if he meets with you to-night, and becomes your
          friend, he will stand by you to the last. He will go home with you
          to-night. No matter how many pairs of stairs you have to go up, Jesus
          will go with you. No matter if there be no chair to sit down on, he
          will not disdain you. You shall be hard at work to-morrow, but as you
          wipe the sweat from your brow he shall stand by you. You will,
          perhaps, be despised for his sake, but he will not forsake you. You
          will, perhaps, have days of sickness, but he will come and make your
          bed in your sickness for you. You will, perhaps, be poor, but your
          bread shal be given you, and your water shall be sure, for he will
          provide for you. You will vex him much and grieve his Spirit. You will
          often doubt him -- you will go after other lovers. You will provoke
          him to jealousy, but he will never cease to love you. You will,
          perhaps, grow cold to him, and even forget his dear name for a time,
          but he will never forget you. You may, perhaps, dishononr his cross,
          and damage his fair fame among the sons of men, but he will never
          cease to love you; nay, he will never love you less -- he cannot love
          you more. This night he doth espouse himself unto you. Faith shall be
          the wedding-ring which he will put upon your finger. He plights his
          troth to you,
        </p>
        <p>"Though you should him ofttimes forget</p>
        <p>His lovingkindness fast is set."</p>
        <p>
          His heart shall be so true to you that he will never leave you nor
          forsake you. You will come to die soon, but the friend of sinners, who
          loved you as a sinner and would not cast you off when your sinnership
          kept breaking up, will still he with you when you come to the sinner's
          doom, which is to die. I see you going down the shelving banks of
          Jordan, but the sinner's friend goes with you. Ah! dear heart, he will
          put his arm beneath you, and bid you fear not; and when in the thick
          shades of that grim night you expect to see a fearful visage -- the
          grim face of Death -- you shall see instead thereof, you shall see his
          sweet and smiling face, bright as an evening star, by your soul, and
          you shall hear him say, "Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed; I
          am thy God." You will land in the world of spirits by-and-by; but will
          the sinner's friend forsake you then? No; he will be pleased to own
          you; he will meet you on the other side the Jordan, and he will say,
          "Come, my beloved, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, and
          have bought thee, though thou wast a sinner vile, and now I am not
          ashamed to confess thee before my holy angels; nay, come with me, and
          I will take thee to my Father's face, and will confess thee there."
          And when the day shall come in which the world shall be judged, he
          will be thy friend then. Thou shalt sit on the bench with him. At the
          right hand of the Judge shalt thou stand, accepted in him who was
          thine Advocate, and who is now thy Judge, to acquit thee. And when the
          splendours of the millennium shall come, thou shalt partake of them;
          and when the end shall be, and the world shall be rolled up like a
          worn-out vesture, and these arching skies shall have passed away like
          a forgotten dream; when eternity, with its deep-sounding waves shall
          break upon the mocks of time and sweep them away for ever -- then, on
          that sea of glass mingled with fire, thou shalt stand with Christ, thy
          friend still, owning thee notwithstanding all thy misbehaviour in the
          world which has gone, and loving thee now, loving thee on as long as
          eternity shall last. Oh! what a friend is Christ to sinners, to
          sinners!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now do recollect, that we have been talking about sinners; there is a
          notion abroad that Jesus Christ came into the world to save
          respectable people, and that he will save decent sort of folks; that
          those of you who go regularly to a place of worship, and are good sort
          of people, will be saved. Now Jesus Christ came into the world to save
          sinners; and who does that mean? Well, it includes some of us who have
          not been permitted to go into outward sin; but it also includes within
          its deep, broad compass those who have gone to the utmost extent of
          iniquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talk of sinners! Walk the streets by moonlight, if you dare, and you
          will see sinners then. Watch when the night is dark, and the wind is
          howling, and the picklock is grating in the door, and you will see
          sinners then. Go to you jail, and walk through the wards, and see the
          men with heavy, over-hanging brows, men whom you would not like to
          meet out at night, and there are sinners there. Go to the
          Reformatories, and see those who have betrayed an early and a juvenile
          depravity, and you will see sinners there. Go across the seas to the
          place where a man will gnaw a bone upon which is reeking human flesh,
          and there is a sinner there. Go you where you will, and ransack earth
          to find sinners, for they are common enough; you may find them in
          every lane and street, of every city and town, and village and hamlet.
          It is for such that Jesus died. If you will select me the grossest
          specimen of humanity, if he be but born of woman, I will have hope of
          him yet, because the gospel of Christ is come to sinners, and Jesus
          Christ is come to seek and to save sinners. Electing love has selected
          some of the worst to be made the best. Redeeming love has bought,
          specially bought, many of the worst to be the reward of the Savior's
          passion. Effectual grace calls out and compels to come in many of the
          vilest of the vile; and it is therefore that I have tried to-night to
          preach my Master's love to sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! by that love, looking out of those eyes in tears; oh! by that
          love, streaming from those wounds flowing with blood; by that faithful
          love, that strong love, that pure, disinterested, and abiding love;
          oh! by the heart and by the bowels of the Savior's compassion, I do
          conjure you turn not away as though it were nothing to you; but
          believe on him and you shall be saved. Trust your souls with him and
          he will bring you to his Father's right hand in glory everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>May God give us a blessing for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br /></p>
