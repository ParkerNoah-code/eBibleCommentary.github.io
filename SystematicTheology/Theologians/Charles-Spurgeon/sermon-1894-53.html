        <p>The Modern Reader's Bible.</p>
        <p>
          A Series of Books from the Sacred Scriptures,<br />presented in Modern
          Literary Form,
        </p>
        <p>BY</p>
        <p>RICHARD G. MOULTON,</p>
        <p>M.A. (Camb.), Ph.D. (Penn.),</p>
        <p>Professor of Literature in English in the University of Chicago.</p>
        <p>PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
        <p>The Outlook, New York.</p>
        <p>
          "The effect of these changes back to the original forms under which
          the sacred writings first appeared will be, for the vast majority of
          readers, a surprise and delight; they will feel as if they had come
          upon new spiritual and intellectual treasures, and they will
          appreciate for the first time how much the Bible has suffered from the
          hands of those who have treated it without reference to its literary
          quality. In view of the significance and possible results of Professor
          Moulton's undertaking, it is not too much to pronounce it one of the
          most important spiritual and literary events of the times. It is part
          of the renaissance of Biblical study; but it may mean, and in our
          judgment it does mean, the renewal of a fresh and deep impression of
          the beauty and power of the supreme spiritual writing of the world."
        </p>
        <p>Presbyterian and Reformed Review.</p>
        <p>
          "Unquestionably here is a task worth carrying out: and it is to be
          said at once that Dr. Moulton has carried it out with great skill and
          helpfulness. Both the introduction and the notes are distinct
          contributions to the better understanding and higher appreciation of
          the literary character, features and beauties of the Biblical books
          treated."
