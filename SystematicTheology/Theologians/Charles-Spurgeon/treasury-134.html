<p align="center">PSALM 128 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Title. A Song of Degrees. There is an evident ascent from 
    the last Psalm: that did but hint at the way in which a house may be built 
    up, but this draws a picture of that house built, and adorned with domestic 
    bliss through the Lord's own blessing. There is clearly an advance in age, 
    for here we go beyond children to children's children; and also a progress 
    in happiness, for children which in the last Psalm were <i>arrows </i>are 
    here <i>olive plants</i>, and instead of speaking "with the enemies in the 
    gate" we close with "peace upon Israel." Thus we rise step by step, and sing 
    as we ascend.</p>
<p align="justify">Subject—It is a family hymn—a song for a marriage, or a 
    birth, or for any day in which a happy household has met to praise the Lord. 
    Like all the songs of degrees, it has an eye to Zion and Jerusalem, which 
    are both expressly mentioned, and it closes like Psalm 125:1-5, Psalm 
    130:1-8, and Psalm 131:1-3, with an allusion to Israel. It is a short Psalm, 
    but exceedingly full and suggestive. Its poetry is of the highest order. 
    Perhaps in no country can it be better understood than in our own, for we 
    above all nations delight to sing of "Home, sweet home." </p>
<p align="justify">1 Blessed is everyone that fears the Lord; that walks in 
    his ways.</p>
<p align="justify">2 For you shall eat the labor of your hands; happy shall 
    you be, and it shall be well with you.</p>
<p align="justify">3 Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of 
    your house, your children like olive plants round about your table.</p>
<p align="justify">4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that fears 
    the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">5 The Lord shall bless you out of Zion: and you shall see 
    the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.</p>
<p align="justify">6 Yes, you shall see your children's children, and peace 
    upon Israel.<br/>
 </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 128:1<br/>
    "Blessed is every one who fears the Lord."</p></b> The last 
    Psalm ended with a blessing—for the word there translated "happy" is the 
    same as that which is here rendered "blessed"—thus the two songs are joined 
    by a catch-word. There is also in them a close community of subject.<i> The 
    fear of God is the corner-stone of all blessedness. </i>We must reverence 
    the ever-blessed God before we can be blessed ourselves. Some think that 
    this life is an evil, an infliction, a thing upon which rests a curse; but 
    it is not so, the God-fearing man has a present blessing resting upon him. 
    It is not true that it would be to him "something better not to be." He is 
    happy now, for he is the child of the happy God, the ever-living Jehovah; 
    and he is even here a joint-heir with Jesus Christ, whose heritage is not 
    misery, but joy.
<p align="justify">This is true of every one of the God-fearing, of all 
    conditions, in all ages: each one and every one is blessed. Their 
    blessedness may not always be seen by carnal reason, but it is always a 
    fact, for God himself declares that it is so; and we know that those whom he 
    blesses are blessed indeed. Let us cultivate that <i>holy filial fear </i>of 
    Jehovah which is the essence of all true religion—the fear of reverence, of 
    dread to offend, of anxiety to please, and of entire submission and 
    obedience. This fear of the Lord is the fit fountain of holy living, we look 
    in vain for holiness apart from it. None but those who fear the Lord will 
    ever walk in his ways.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Who walks in his ways." </p></b>The pious life which God 
    declares to be blessed, must be practical as well as emotional. It is idle 
    to talk of fearing the Lord, if we act like those who have no care whether 
    there is a God or not. God's ways will be our ways if we have a sincere 
    reverence for him. If the heart is truly joined unto God, the feet will 
    follow hard after him. A man's heart will be seen in his walk, and the 
    blessing will come where heart and walk are both with God. 
<p align="justify">Note that the first Psalm links the blessing with the 
    walk in a negative way, "Blessed is the man that walks not," etc.; but here 
    we find it in connection with the positive form of our conduct. To enjoy the 
    divine blessing we must be active, and walk; we must be methodical, and walk 
    in certain ways; and we must be godly, and walk in the Lord's ways. </p>
<p align="justify">God's ways are blessed ways; they were cast up by the 
    Blessed One, they were trodden by him in whom we are blessed, they are 
    frequented by the blessed, they are provided with means of blessing, they 
    are paved with present blessings, and they lead to eternal blessedness. Who 
    would not desire to walk in them?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 128:2<br/>
    "For you shall eat the labor of your hands." </p></b>The 
    general doctrine of Psalm 128:1 here receives a personal application note 
    the change to the second person, "you shall eat," etc. This is the portion 
    of God's saints—to work, and to find a reward in so doing. God is the God of
    <i>laborers</i>. We are not to leave our worldly callings because the Lord 
    has called us by grace, we are not promised a blessing upon romantic 
    idleness or unreasonable dreaming, but upon hard work and honest industry.
    
<i>
<p align="justify">Though we are in God's hands we are to be supported by 
    our own hands. He will give us daily bread, but it must be made our own by 
    labor.</p></i> All kinds of labor are here included; for if one toils by the 
    sweat of his brow, and another does so by the sweat of his brain, there is 
    no difference in the blessing; save that it is generally more healthy to 
    work with the body than with the mind only.
<p align="justify">Without God it would be vain to labor; but when we are 
    laborers together with God a promise is set before us. The promise is that 
    labor shall be fruitful, and that he who performs it shall himself enjoy the 
    recompense of it. It is a grievous ill for a man to slave his life away and 
    receive no fair remuneration for his toil, as a rule, God's servants rise 
    out of such bondage and claim their own, and receive it—at any rate, this 
    verse may encourage them to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">"The laborer is worthy of his hire." Under the Theocracy 
    the chosen people could see this promise literally fulfilled; but when evil 
    rulers oppressed them their earnings were withheld by churls, and their 
    harvests were snatched away from them by marauders. Had they walked in the 
    fear of the Lord they would never have known such great evils. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Some men never enjoy their labor, for they give 
    themselves no time for rest. </p></i>Eagerness to <i>get</i>,<i> </i>takes from 
    them the ability to enjoy. Surely, if it is worth while to labor, it is 
    worth while to eat of that labor. "Happy shall you be," or, Oh, your 
    happiness. Heaped up happinesses in the plural belong to that man who fears 
    the Lord. He is happy, and he shall be happy in a thousand ways.
<p align="justify">The context leads us to expect family happiness. Our God 
    is our household God. The Romans had their idol-gods, but we have far more 
    than they in the one only living and true God. "And it shall be well with 
    you," or good for you. Yes, good is for the good; and it shall be well with 
    those who do well.</p>
<p align="justify">"What cheering words are these!<br/>
    Their sweetness who can tell?<br/>
    In time, and to eternal days,<br/>
    'Tis with the righteous well!"</p>
<p align="justify">If we fear God, we may dismiss all other fear. In walking 
    in God's ways we shall be under his protection, provision, and approval; 
    danger and destruction shall be far from us; all things shall work our good.
    </p>
<p align="justify">In God's view it would not be a blessed thing for us to 
    live without exertion, nor to eat the unearned bread of dependence. <i>The 
    happiest state on earth is one in which we have something to do, strength to 
    do it with, and a fair return for what we have done. </i>This, with the 
    divine blessing, is all that we ought to desire, and it is sufficient for 
    any man who fears the Lord and abhors covetousness. Having food and 
    clothing, let us be therewith content.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 128:3<br/>
    "Your wife."</p></b> To reach the full of earthly felicity, a 
    man must not be alone. A helpmeet was needed in Paradise, and assuredly she 
    is not less necessary outside of it. He who finds a wife finds a good thing. 
    It is not every man that fears the Lord, who has a wife; but if he has, she 
    shall share in his blessedness and increase it.
<b>
<p align="justify">"Shall be as a fruitful vine."</p></b> To complete domestic 
    bliss children are sent. They come as the lawful fruit of marriage, even as 
    clusters appear upon the vine. For the grapes, the vine was planted; for 
    children was the wife provided. It is generally well with any creature when 
    it fulfills its purpose, and it is so far well with married people when the 
    great design of their union is brought about. They must not look upon 
    fruitfulness as a burden, but as a blessing. 
<p align="justify">Good wives are also fruitful in kindness, thrift, 
    helpfulness, and affection. If they bear no children, they are by no means 
    barren if they yield us the wine of consolation and the clusters of comfort.
    <i>Truly blessed is the man whose wife is fruitful in those good works which 
    are suitable to her near and dear position.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"By the sides of your house." </p></b>She keeps to the 
    house—she is a home bird. She is a fruitful vine, and a faithful 
    house-keeper; if you wish to find her, she is within the house—she is to be 
    found both inside and outside the home, but her chief fruitfulness is in the 
    inner side of the dwelling, which she adorns. Eastern houses usually have an 
    open square in the center, and the various rooms are ranged around the 
    sides—there shall the wife be found, busy in one room or another, as the 
    hour of the day demands.<i> She keeps at home, and so keeps the home. 
</i>
<p align="justify">It is her husband's house, and she is her husband's; as 
    the text puts it—"your wife," and "your house"; but by her loving care her 
    husband is made so happy that he is glad to own her as an equal proprietor 
    with himself, for he is hers, and the house is hers too.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Your children like olive plants round about your table."</p></b> 
    Hundreds of times have I seen the young olive plants springing up around the 
    parent stem, and it has always made me think of this verse. The Psalmist 
    never intended to suggest the idea of olive plants round a table, but of 
    young people springing up around their parents, even as olive plants 
    surround the fine, well-rooted tree. 
<p align="justify">The figure is very striking, and would be sure to present 
    itself to the mind of every observer in the olive country. How beautiful to 
    see the gnarled olive, still bearing abundant fruit, surrounded with a 
    little band of sturdy successors, any one of which would be able to take its 
    place should the central olive be blown down, or removed in any other way.
    </p>
<p align="justify">It is not the olive plants, but the children, that are 
    round about the table. Moreover, note that it is not olive branches, but 
    plants—a very different thing. Our children gather around our table to be 
    fed, and this involves expenses: how much better is this than to see them 
    pining upon beds of sickness, unable to come for their meals! What a 
    blessing to have sufficient food to put upon the table! Let us for this 
    benefit praise the bounty of the Lord. The wife is busy all over the house, 
    but the youngsters are busiest at meal-times; and if the blessing of the 
    Lord rest upon the family, no sight can be more delightful. </p>
<p align="justify">Here we have the <i>vine </i>and the <i>olive tree </i>
    blended—joy from the fruitful wife, and solid comfort from the growing 
    family; these are the choicest products earth can yield, our families are 
    gardens of the Lord. It may help us to value the privileges of our home if 
    we consider where we would be if they were withdrawn. What if the dear 
    partner of our life were removed from the sides of our house to the recesses 
    of the sepulcher?<i> What is the trouble of children compared with the 
    sorrow of their loss? </i>Think, dear father, what would be your grief if 
    you had to cry with Job, "Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days 
    when God preserved me; when my children were about me!"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 128:4<br/>
    "Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed who fears the 
    Lord."</p></b> Mark this. Put a <i>Nota Bene </i>against it, for it is worthy of 
    observation. It is not to be inferred that all blessed men are married, and 
    are fathers; but that this is the way in which the Lord favors godly people 
    who are placed in domestic life. He makes their relationships happy and 
    profitable. In this fashion does Jehovah bless God-fearing households, for 
    he is the God of all the families of Israel. We have seen this blessing 
    scores of times, and we have never ceased to admire in domestic peace the 
    sweetest of human felicity. <i>Family blessedness comes from the Lord, and 
    is a part of his plan for the preservation of a godly race, and for the 
    maintenance of his worship in the land</i>. To the Lord alone we must look 
    for it. The possession of riches will not ensure it; the choice of a healthy 
    and beautiful bride will not ensure it; the birth of numerous lovely 
    children will not ensure it: there must be the blessing of God, the 
    influence of piety, the result of holy living.
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 128:5<br/>
    "The Lord shall bless you out of Zion."</p></b> A spiritual 
    blessing shall be received by the gracious man, and this shall crown all his 
    temporal mercies. He is one among the many who make up God's inheritance; 
    his tent is part and parcel of the encampment around the tabernacle; and 
    therefore when the blessing is pronounced at the center it shall radiate to 
    him in his place. The blessing of the house of God shall be upon his house.
    
<p align="justify">The priestly blessing which is recorded in Numbers 
    6:24-26, runs thus: "May the LORD bless you and protect you. May the LORD 
    smile on you and be gracious to you. May the LORD show you his favor and 
    give you his peace." This is it which shall come upon the head of the 
    God-fearing man. Zion was the center of blessing, and to it the people 
    looked when they sought for mercy, from the altar of sacrifice, from the 
    mercy-seat, from the Shekinah-light, yes, from Jehovah himself, the blessing 
    shall come to each one of his holy people. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And you shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of 
    your life."</p></b> He shall have a patriot's joy as well as a patriarch's 
    peace. God shall give him to see his country prosper, and its metropolitan 
    city flourish. When <i>tent</i>-mercies are followed by <i>temple</i>-mercies, 
    and these are attended by <i>national-</i>mercies—the man, the worshiper, 
    the patriot is trebly favored of the Lord. This favor is to be permanent 
    throughout the good man's life, and that life is to be a long one, for he is 
    to see his sons' sons. Many a time does true religion bring such blessings 
    to men; and when these good things are denied them, they have a greater 
    reward as a compensation.
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 128:6<br/>
    "Yes, you shall see your children's children."</p></b> This 
    is a great pleasure. Men live their young lives over again in their 
    grandchildren. Does not Solomon say that "children's children are the crown 
    of old men"? So they are. The good man is glad that a pious stock is likely 
    to be continued; he rejoices in the belief that other homes as happy as his 
    own will be built up wherein altars to the glory of God shall smoke with the 
    morning and evening sacrifice. This promise implies long life, and that life 
    rendered happy by its being continued in our offspring. <i>It is one token 
    of the immortality of man that he derives joy from extending his life in the 
    lives of his descendants.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"And peace upon Israel." </p></b>With this sweet word, Psalm 
    125 was closed. It is a favorite formula. Let God's own heritage be at 
    peace, and we are all glad of it. We count it our own prosperity for the 
    chosen of the Lord to find rest and quiet. Jacob was sorely tossed about; 
    his life knew little of peace; but yet the Lord delivered him out of all his 
    tribulations, and brought him to a place of rest in Goshen for a while, and 
    afterwards to sleep with his fathers in the cave of Machpelah. His glorious 
    Seed was grievously afflicted and at last crucified; but he has risen to 
    eternal peace, and in his peace we dwell.
<p align="justify">Israel's <i>spiritual </i>descendants still share his 
    chequered conditions, but there remains a rest for them also, and they shall 
    have peace from the God of peace. Israel was a praying petitioner in the 
    days of his wrestling, but he became a prevailing prince, and therein his 
    soul found peace.</p>
