        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.597)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday October 30th, 1864 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" -- Amos 3:3.</p>
        <p>
          THE BELIEVER IS AGREED with God. The war between the most holy God and
          his offending creatures is over in the case of bloodwashed sinners;
          not suspended by a truce, but ended for ever by a peace which passeth
          all understanding. The believer is fully agreed with God concerning
          the divine law: he confesses that "the law is holy, and just, and
          good": he would not have it altered if he could. He rejoices in the
          way of God's testimonies more than in all riches; yea, in his precepts
          doth he take delight, praying evermore, "O let me not wander from thy
          commandments." He joyfully acknowledges that the Judge of all the
          earth rules mankind by a law in which there is no injustice, by
          statutes which subserve the best interests of the governed, while they
          secure the glory of the great Governor. The Christian "consents unto
          the law that it is good." He is agreed with God, moreover, that a
          breach of the law should be visited with penalty: he would be
          unwilling that sin should go unpunished. He feels that the sanctions
          of law, however terrible, are absolutely necessary, and required to be
          severe. Above all, he is agreed with God in that great atonement for
          sin which God himself has ordained and provided in the person of Jesus
          Christ. Gazing upon the matchless sacrifice of Calvary, while the Lord
          is content, the believer is satisfied; where God finds satisfaction
          for his injured honour, the believer finds the noblest object of
          admiration and adoration. Thou lovest Golgotha, O thou Judge of the
          earth; and thy people are perfectly agreed with thee in this.
          Henceforth the Christian is at one with God in his love of holiness:
          he delights in the law of God after the inward man. Sin, which is
          abhorrent to the Most High, is obnoxious to the Christian in that
          measure in which he is enlightened and conformed unto the image of
          Christ. Great God, thou hast unsheathed thy sword, and bathed it in
          heaven, for the destruction of all evil, and thy redeemed are on thy
          side, abhorring that which is evil, and resolving to fight under thy
          command till the last sin shall be cut off. Thou hast uplifted thy
          banner because of the truth, and around thy standard the soldiers of
          the cross are rallying; for thy battle, O Most High, is the battle of
          the Church; thy foes are our foes, and thy friends are the excellent
          of the earth, in whom is all our delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          I trust that most of us who are here met in the name of Jesus, feel a
          deep, sincere, and constant agreement with God. We have been guilty of
          murmuring at his will; but yet our newborn nature evermore at its core
          and center knoweth that the will of the Lord is wise and good; and we
          therefore bow our heads with reverent agreement, and say, "Not as I
          will, but as thou wilt." "The will of the Lord be done." Our soul,
          when through infirmity she is tempted to rebellion, nevertheless
          struggles after complete resignation of her wishes and desires to the
          will of the Most High. We do not covet the life of self-will, but we
          sigh after the spirit of self-denial; yea, of self-annihilation, that
          Christ may live in us, and that the old Ego, the carnal I, may be
          altogether slain. I would be as obedient to my God as are those
          firstborn sons of light, his messengers of flaming fire. As the
          mercury feels the mysterious changes of the air, and sensitively moves
          in accordance with the atmosphere, so would I being surrounded by my
          God, evermore perceive his wish and will, and move at once in
          obedience thereto. Our strength shall be perfect when we have no
          independent will, but move and act only as we are moved and acted on
          by our gracious God. I hope that at this hour we can truly say, that
          notwithstanding our many sins, we do love the Lord our God; and if we
          could have our will this morning, we would follow his commands without
          the slightest departure from the narrow path. We are in heart agreed
          with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text reminds us that this agreement gives us power to walk with
          God. May we be enabled to claim this privilege which divine grace has
          bestowed on us: power to walk with God in daily, habitual, friendly,
          intimate, joyous communion. Believer, you can walk with God this very
          day. He is as near to thee as he was to Abraham beneath the oak at
          Mamre, or Moses at the back of the desert. He is as willing to show
          thee his love as he was to reveal himself to Daniel on the banks of
          Ulai, or to Ezekiel by the streams of Chebar. Thou hast no greater
          distance this day between thee and thy God, than Jacob had when he
          laid hold upon the angel and prevailed. He is thy father, as truly as
          he was the father of the people whom he covered by day with a cloud,
          and cheered by night with a pillar of fire; and though no Shekinah
          lights up a golden mercy-seat, yet the throne of grace is quite as
          glorious and even more accessible than in the days of old. He shall
          hide thee in his pavilion, as he did his servant David; yea, in the
          secret of the tabernacle shall be thy hiding-place. Enoch's privilege
          was not peculiar to him; it is thy birthright: claim it. Noah's high
          honour of walking with God was not reserved for him alone; it belongs
          to thee also, shut in as thou art in the ark of the covenant, and
          saved from the deluge of divine wrath. It should be the Christian's
          delight to be always with his God; walking with him in unbroken
          fellowship. Enoch did not take a turn or two with God, as Matthew
          Henry observes, but he walked with him four hundred years. O that we
          might cease to be with our God as wayfaring men who tarry but for a
          night: may we dwell in God, and may he dwell in us. Walking implies
          action; and our actions should always be in the Lord. The Christian,
          whatsoever he eateth, or drinketh, or doeth, should do all in the name
          of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by him.
          Walking has in it the thought of progress; but all our progress should
          be with God. As we are rooted and grounded in Christ, so we must ask
          to grow up in him; ever abiding in our highest moments with God, and
          never imagining or conceiving any progress which shall remove us from
          humble confidence in him. Beloved brother in the Lord, it may be that
          thy heart is agreed with God, and yet thou hast lost for a time thy
          walking with him; be not at ease in thy soul till thou hast regained
          it. Search thine own heart by the light of the Word and of the Holy
          Spirit; and when thou knowest thyself to be agreed with God, through
          Him who is our peace, hesitate not to draw near with holy confidence
          to thy Father and thy God, notwithstanding all thy past wanderings;
          for he welcomes thee to walk with him, seeing that thou art agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this season we, as a Church, have had our hearts set upon a revival
          of religion in our midst. Many of us will be greatly and grievously
          disappointed if such a revival shall not take place. We have felt
          moved to cry for it; I think I may say we have been almost unanimously
          thus moved. Already there are signs that God is visiting us in a very
          remarkable manner, but our souls are set upon a greater work than we
          have ever seen. Now, dear friends, we need as the first and most
          essential thing in this matter, that God should walk with us. In vain
          we shall struggle after revival unless we have his presence. If, then,
          we desire to have his presence with us, we must see to it that we are
          perfectly agreed with him both in the design of the work, and in the
          method of it; and I desire this morning to stir up your pure minds to
          heart-searching and vigilant self-examination, that every false way
          may be purged from us, since God will not walk with us as a Church,
          unless we be agreed with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first remark, then, of this morning, is simply this, -- we desire
          in this matter to walk together with God; but, in the second place, if
          we would have him with us we must be agreed with him; and therefore,
          thirdly, we desire to purge ourselves of everything which would mar
          our perfect agreement with God, and so prevent his coming to our aid.
          I do ask the prayers of God's people that he may enable me to speak to
          profit this morning, for if ever I felt my own unfitness to edify the
          saints, I do so just now: I will even confess that if I could have had
          my own choice, I should have left it to some one else to address you
          this morning. My harp is out of tune, and the strings are all
          loosened, but the chief musician understands his instruments, and
          knows how to get music out of us, and in answer to prayer he will
          doubtless sustain us and give you a blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let us, first, AVOW OUR DESIRE THAT IN OUR PRESENT EFFORT WE MAY
          WALK WITH GOD; otherwise our strivings after revival will be very
          wearisome.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know of nothing more saddening than to attend a prayer-meeting where
          the devotion is forced, and the fervour laborious; where brethren puff
          and strain like engines with a load behind them too heavy for them to
          drag. It is painful to detect an evident design to get up an
          excitement, and wind up the people to the proper pitch; when the
          addresses are adapted to foster hotheadedness, and the prayers to
          beget superstition. God's true saints cannot but feel that to gain the
          graces of the Spirit by fleshly vehemence is sad work. They retire
          from such a meeting, and they say, "How different is this from
          occasions when God's Spirit has been really at work with us!" Then,
          like a ship with her sails filled with a fair wind, floating
          majestically along without tugging and straining, the Church, borne
          onward with the breath of the divine Spirit, with a full tide of
          heaven's grace, speeds on her glorious way. "If thy presence go not
          with me, carry us not up hence," was the request of Moses; and I think
          we may rather deprecate than desire a revival if God's presence be not
          in it. Lord, let us stay as we are, crying and groaning to see better
          days, rather than permit us to be puffed up with the notion of revival
          without thine own power in it; let us have no special prayer-meetings
          merely for the sake of them; but let us, O let us receive special
          blessings as the result of prayer: if thou dost not intend to help us
          now let us weep in secret, but let us not rejoice in a mere name if
          the substance be lacking. During a course of meetings by which we
          desire to excite the hearts of believers to a deeper interest in
          spiritual things; if there be not a gracious power in them, you will
          soon perceive a dulness, a flagging, a heaviness, a weariness stealing
          over the assembly; the numbers will decline, the prayers will become
          less fervent, and the whole thing will degenerate into a hollow sham
          or a mournful monotony. To come up from the wilderness is hard
          climbing unless we lean on our beloved. O thou who art our beloved and
          adorable Lord, lest our souls grow weary in well-doing, and faint for
          heaviness, be pleased to let us enjoy communion with thyself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only is there weariness in our own attempts, but they always end
          in disappointment, unless God walketh with us. Ye may pray, and pray,
          and pray, but there shall be no conversions, no sense of quickening,
          until the Spirit's working be distinctly recognized. The minister
          shall be just as much a preacher of the mere letter as ever he was;
          the Church officers shall be as formal and official as ever they were;
          the Church members shall be as inconsistent and as indifferent as they
          were wont to be; the congregation shall be as uninterested and as
          unmoved as they were in the worst times, except the Spirit of God work
          with us. In this thing we may quote the words of the psalmist, "Except
          the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except
          the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain
          for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows:
          for so he giveth his beloved sleep." O friends, it is well to have a
          holy industry and a devout perseverance; it is well to strain every
          nerve, and put forth every effort; but all this must end in the most
          sorry, heart-sickening failure, unless the Lord rend the heavens and
          come down. I am telling you what you all do know, and what I trust you
          feel, but it is what we are constantly forgetting; for many are they
          that go a warfare at their own charges, and so become both bankrupt
          and defeated; and many be they who would build God's house simply by
          stress of human effort, but they fail, because God is not there to
          give them success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet more; supposing that in this our attempt at revival, we should not
          be favoured with the presence of God; then prayer will be greatly
          dishonoured. I take it, that when a Church draws near to God in
          special prayer, asking any mercy, if she does not receive that mercy
          on account of some disagreement with God, then her belief in prayer
          is, for the future, greatly weakened; and this is a most serious evil,
          for it loosens the girdle of the loins of God's saints. Anything which
          makes men doubt the efficacy of prayer, is an injury to their
          spirituality; and thus upon the largest scale God's Church will suffer
          loss if her prayers shall remain unanswered. We must go on; it would
          be ruin to forbear or to turn our backs. As a Church, we must now
          conquer or die. How can I again stir you up to supplication, if on
          this occasion your prayers should be in vain? I shall come into this
          pulpit with but a faint heart to speak of my Master's faithfulness if
          he does not give you evidences of it. Ah! my brethren, when you are
          lifting up your voices in intercession, I cannot expect to mark your
          earnestness nor to behold your faith, unless that faith shall be
          confirmed just now by a shower of divine mercy. To the world at large
          the non-hearing of prayer would be a ready argument, either against
          the existence of God, or else against the reality of his promise. I
          hope such a thing as this will not occur. "Aha! aha!" saith the enemy,
          "see what has come of it all! The people cried, but they cried in
          vain. They met in large numbers; they approached the mercy-seat with
          tears and groans, but no result has come of it; there have been no
          more conversions than before, and God's strength has not been put
          forth." Would you desire that such a calamity as this should occur.
          The true soldiers of the cross in our Israel would almost as soon lay
          down their necks, as that God's honour should thus be attainted in the
          presence of his foes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, every attempt at revival of religion which proves a failure,
          -- and fail it must without the presence of God, -- leaves the Church
          in a worse condition than it was before; because, if it should prove a
          failure, from the want of any stir at all; then God's people fall back
          into their former lethargy, with an excuse for continuing in it; or if
          a false stir be made, a reaction follows of a most injurious
          character. I suppose the worst time in the Christian Church is
          generally that which follows the excitement of a revival; and if that
          revival has had no reality in it, the mischief which is done is awful
          and incalulable. If no excitement shall come at all, the mischief is
          still as great; God's people, being disappointed, have little heart to
          listen to further exhortations to future zealous action, become
          contented with their Laodicean lukewarmness, and it becomes impossible
          to bestir them again. If a revival should apparently have success and
          yet God be not in it, perhaps this is even worse. The wild-fire and
          madness of some revivals have been a perfect disgrace to the common
          sense of the age, let alone the spirituality of the Church. I know,
          and speak not without book, when I declare that some churches have
          been seriously deteriorated and permanently injured by large
          admissions of excited but unconverted persons; so that the only thing
          a fresh pastor could do was to begin afresh, and purge the church book
          throughout, sweeping off scores of carnal persons; the beginning anew
          being almost hopeless, because, after the paroxysm of passion about
          religion has passed, there follows a season in which religion is
          treated with indifference, if not with disdain. I had rather see a
          Church asleep, than see it awake into the fever of fanaticism: better
          that she should lie still than do mischief. O dear friends, we have
          felt in our souls, not that we may have revival, but that we must have
          it; and when we think of the incalculable damage that shall be done to
          us all if the Lord does not visit us, I am sure we must again draw
          near to the angel and wrestle afresh, with this determination, that we
          will not let him go unless he bless us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may be confirmed in our anxious desire to have the Lord walking
          with us in this thing, when we consider the blessings which are sure
          to flow from his presence. Ah! what holy quickening shall come upon
          every one of us. The preacher will not have to lament that he has so
          little power in prayer; both alone and in your presence he shall be
          strengthened to intercede as an angel of God. You shall not have to
          mourn that the service lacks its former sweetness. You will feel the
          blessedness you knew when first you saw the Lord. You will not have to
          mourn that you are cold and dead, that your songs languish, and that
          your prayers expire; instead thereof, every action shall be fraught
          with vigour, every thought shall glow with earnestness, every word
          shall be clothed with divine power. Let God arise; and doubts and
          fears shall betake themselves to their hiding-places, as the bats
          conceal themselves at the rising of the dawn. Let the Lord visit you;
          and difficulties which frown like Alps, will sink to plains. Let him
          arise; and all your enemies shall flee before you, as the smoke before
          the wind; the heavens shall drop with showers of mercy; and even your
          sins and all the guilt thereof, shall shake as Sinai shook at the
          presence of the God of Israel. A Church with God's presence in it is
          holy, happy, united, earnest, laborious, successful; fair as the moon
          before the Lord, and clear as the sun in the eyes of men, she is
          terrible as an army with banners to her enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If God shall be pleased to be with his Church, then direct good shall
          visit our congregation. We used to say at Park Street, that there were
          not many seat-holders unconverted. The like is to a great extent true
          here. The immense increase of our Church gives us the hope that the
          day will come when there will not be a single seat unoccupied by a
          believer: but it is not the case yet. I suppose the Church is about
          half the congregation now. There are some, however, that from the very
          first have listened; but so far as salvation is concerned, they have
          listened in vain: they have been moved to tears, they have made good
          resolutions; but after ten or eleven years of ministry, they are just
          where they were, except that they have accumulated fresh guilt. Some
          desire to be Christians, but they harbour some darling lust. We know
          some who used to feel under the Word, but do not feel now. The voice
          which once was like a trumpet, now lulls them to sleep. Some have made
          a compromise; and one day they will serve God and another day they
          will serve their sins; like the Samaritans who feared the Lord and
          served other gods. Now let our cries be heard for the Master's
          presence, and we shall soon see these brought in; hearts of stone
          shall be turned to flesh; the iron of the Word shall break the
          northern iron and steel; Jehovah Jesus shall ride victoriously through
          those gates which have been barred against him, and there shall be
          shouting in heaven because the Lord hath gotten him the victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wider blessings will follow. A Church is never blessed alone. If any
          one Church shall stand in the vigour of piety, other Churches shall
          take example therefrom, and make an advance towards a better state.
          Here we have around us many Churches, hills which God has blessed; but
          they, like ourselves, have a tendency to slumber. Let God pour out his
          Spirit here, and the shower will not be confined to these fields, but
          will drop upon other pastures, and they shall rejoice on every side.
          Our testimony for God rings through this land; from one end of it to
          the other. Our ministry is not hidden under a bushel nor confined to a
          few. Tens of thousands listen every week to our word; and if the Lord
          shall be pleased to bless it, then shall it be as ointment poured
          forth, to load the moral atmosphere with a savour of Christ crucified.
          One nation cannot feel the power of God without communicating some of
          its blessing to another. The Atlantic cannot divide: no tongue or
          language can separate us. If God bless France or Switzerland, the
          influence shall be felt upon the Continent; if he should bless our
          island, all the whole earth must feel the power thereof. Therefore do
          we feel encouraged mightily to pray. O, my brethren, the world grows
          old; man's faith is getting weary of long waiting; the false prophets
          begin again to appear, and cry lo here, and lo there; but the Lord
          must come; of this are we confident: in such an hour as we think not,
          he may appear. How would we have him find us at his coming? Would we
          have him find his servants sleeping? his stewards wasting his goods?
          his vinedressers with neglected vines? his soldiers with swords rusted
          into their scabbards? No, we would have him find us watching, standing
          upon the watch-tower, feeding his sheep, tending his lambs, succouring
          the needy, comforting the weary, helping the oppressed. Gird up your
          loins then, I pray you, as men that watch for their Lord. If my words
          could have the power in them which I feel they lack, I would stir you
          up, dear brethren and sisters, to seek unto the mighty God of Jacob,
          that when the Son of Man cometh, if he find no faith upon the earth
          elsewhere, at least he may find it in you: if zeal shall be extinct in
          every other place, at least may he find one live coal yet glowing in
          your bosom. For this we want his presence, for without it we can do
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings me, in the second place, to observe, that IF WE WOULD
          HAVE THE PRESENCE OF GOD, IT IS NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD BE AGREED
          WITH HIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must be agreed with God as to the end of our Christian existence.
          God hath formed us for himself, that we may show forth his praise. The
          main end of a Christian man is, that having been bought with precious
          blood, he may live unto Christ, and not unto himself. O brethren! I am
          afraid we are not agreed with God in this. I must say it, painful
          though it be, there are many professors, and there are some in this
          Church, who at least appear to believe that the main end of their
          Christian existence is to get to heaven, to get as much money as they
          can on earth, and to leave as much as they can to their children when
          they die; I say, "to get to heaven," for they selfishly include that
          as one of the designs of divine grace; but I question, if it were not
          for their happiness to go to heaven, whether they would care much
          about going, if it were only for God's glory; for their way of living
          upon earth is always thus: "What shall I eat? what shall I drink?
          wherewithal shall I be clothed?" Religion never calls out their
          thoughtfulness. They can judge, and weigh, and plot, and plan to get
          money, but they have no plans as to how they can serve God. The cause
          of God is scarcely in their thoughts. They will pinch and screw to see
          how little they can contribute in any way to the maintenance of the
          cause of truth, or to the spread of the Redeemer's kingdom; they will
          so far condescend to consider religion, as to think how they can
          profess it in the most economical manner, but nothing more. You will
          not hear me speak so foolishly and madly, as if I thought that it were
          not just and laudable in a man to seek to make money to supply the
          wants of his family, or even to provide for them on his own decease;
          such a thing is just and right: but whenever this gets to be the main
          thought; and I am persuaded it is the leading thought of too many
          professors, such men forget whose they are, and whom they serve; they
          are living to themselves; they have forgotten who it is that has said,
          "Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with silver and
          gold." Oh! I pray God that I may feel that I am God's man, that I have
          not a hair on my head which is not consecrated, nor a drop of my blood
          which is not dedicated to his cause; and I pray, brethren and sisters,
          that you may feel the same; that selfishness may clean die out of you;
          that you may be able to say without any straining of the truth, "I
          have nothing to care for, nor to live for in this world, but that I
          may glorify God, and spread forth the savour of my Saviour's name." We
          cannot expect the Master's blessing till we are agreed about this.
          This is God's will: is it our will to-day? I know I have around me
          many faithful hearts, who will say, "My desire is, that whether I live
          or die, Christ may be glorified in me": if we be all of that mind, God
          will walk with us; but every one who is of another mind, and of a
          divided heart, is a hindrance and an injury to us in our progress. It
          would be no loss to lose such persons, but a spiritual benefit to the
          entire cause, if this dead lumber were cast out. When the body gets a
          piece of rotten bone into it, it never rests, till, with pain, it
          casts out the dead thing: and so with the Church; the Church may be
          increased by dead members, but when she begins to get vigorous and
          full of life, her first effort is with much pain, perhaps with much
          marring of her present beauty, to cause the dead substance to come
          forth; and if this should be the case, though we shall pity those who
          are cast forth, yet for our own health's sake, we may thank God and
          take courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we would have God with us we must be agreed as to the real
          desirableness and necessity of the conversion of souls. God thinks
          souls to be very precious, and his own words are, "As I live, saith
          the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but had
          rather that he should turn unto me and live." Are we agreed with God
          in that? Our God thinks souls to be so precious, that if a man could
          gain the whole world and lose his soul, he would be a loser. Are we
          agreed with him there? In the person of Christ, our God wept over
          Jerusalem; watered with tears that city which must be given up to the
          flames. Have we tears, too? have we compassion, too? When God thinks
          of sinners it is in this wise: "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how
          shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how
          shall I set thee as Zeboim?" Can we bemoan sinners in that way? Do we
          stir our souls to an agony of grief because men will turn from God and
          will wilfully perish in their sin? If, on the contrary, you and I
          selfishly say, "We are safe, it does not matter to us whether others
          are brought to know Christ," we are not agreed, God will not work with
          us; and such of you as feel this indifferentism, this cursed lethargy,
          are our bane, our burden, our hindrance. God forgive you, and stir you
          up to feel that your heart will not rest unless poor sinners are
          plucked as brands from the burning. Are we agreed here?
        </p>
        <p>
          If we would have the Lord with us, in the next place, we must be
          agreed as to the means to be used in revival. We are agreed that the
          first means is the preaching of Christ. We do not want any other
          doctrine than that we have received -- Christ lifted up upon his
          cross, as the serpent was lifted up upon the pole. This is the remedy
          which we, in this house of prayer, believe in. Let others choose sweet
          music, or pictures, or vestments, or baptismal water, or confirmation,
          or human rites; we abhor them, and pour contempt upon them; as for us,
          our only hope lies in the doctrine of a substitute for sinners, the
          great fact of the atonement, the glorious truth that Christ Jesus came
          into the world to seek and to save sinners. I think we are agreed with
          God in this, that the preaching of Christ is the way by which
          believers shall be saved. God's great agency is the Holy Spirit. We
          are agreed, brethren, that we do not want sinners to be converted by
          our persuasion, we do not want them brought into the Church by
          excitement; we want the Spirit's work, and the Spirit's work alone. I
          would not bend my knee once in prayer, much less day by day, to win a
          mere excitement; we have done without it, and we shall do without it
          by the grace of God; but I would give mine eyes, if I might but know
          that the Holy Spirit himself would come forth, and show what divinity
          can do in turning hearts of stone to flesh. In this thing, I think ,
          that we are agreed with God. But God's way of blessing the Church is
          by the instrumentality of all her members. The multitude must be fed,
          but it must not be by Christ's hand alone, "He gave the bread to the
          disciples, and the disciples, to the multitude." Are you all agreed
          here? I am afraid not. Many of you are engaged in works of usefulness,
          and I will make this my boast this day, that I had never thought that
          I should meet with a people so apostolic in their zeal as the most of
          you have been. I have marvelled, and my heart has rejoiced when I have
          seen what self-sacrifice some of the poorest among you have made for
          Christ; what zeal, what enthusiasm you have manifested in the
          spreading abroad of the Saviour's name. But still there are some of
          you who are doing nothing whatever, you have a name to live, but I
          fear that you are dead; you are very seldom at a prayer-meeting --
          even some Church members and persons whom I know are not kept at home
          by business, but by sheer indifference to the cause of God. Some of
          you are never provoked to zeal and to good works. That you come and
          listen to us, is something; and for what you do we are grateful; but
          for what you do not do, over this we mourn, because we fear that we
          are restrained in our efforts for the spread of the Saviour's kingdom,
          because as a Church we are not agreed in God's plan; and we shall be
          restrained until every man in the Church can say, "I will consecrate
          myself this day unto the Lord of hosts; if there is anything to be
          done, be it to be a door-keeper in the house of God, here am I.
        </p>
        <p>"There's not a lamb among his flock,</p>
        <p>I would disdain to feed;</p>
        <p>There's not a foe before whose face</p>
        <p>I'd fear his cause to plead."</p>
        <p>
          Yet again, dear friends, are we agreed this day as to our utter
          helplessness in this work? I caught a good sentence the other day.
          Speaking with a Wesleyan minister, I said to him, "Your denomination
          during the past year did not increase: you have usually had a large
          increase to your numbers. You were never so rich as now; your
          ministers were never so well educated; you never had such good chapels
          as now, and yet you never had so little success. What are you doing?
          -- knowing this to be the fact, what are you doing? How are the minds
          of your brethren exercised with regard to this?" He comforted me much
          by the reply. He said, "It has driven us to our knees: we thank God
          that we know our state and are not content with it. We have had a day
          of humiliation, and I hope," he said, "some of us have gone low enough
          to be blessed." There is a great truth in that last sentence, "low
          enough to be blessed," I do fear me that some of us never do go low
          enough to be blessed. When a man says, "Oh! yes, we are getting on
          very well, we do not want any revival that I know of," I fear me he is
          not low enough to be blessed; and when you and I pray to God with
          pride in us, with self-exaltation, with a confidence in our own zeal,
          or even in the prevalence of our own prayers of themselves, we have
          not come low enough to be blessed. An humble Church will be a blessed
          Church; a Church that is willing to confess its own errors and
          failures, and to lie at the foot of Christ's cross, is in a position
          to be favoured of the Lord. I hope we are agreed, then, with God, as
          to our utter unworthiness and helplessness, so that we look to him
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I charge you all to be agreed with God in this thing, that if any good
          shall be done, any conversions shall occur, all the glory must be
          given to him. Revivals have often been spoiled, either by persons
          boasting that such-and-such a minister was the means of them, or else,
          as in the case of the North of Ireland, by boasting that the work was
          done without ministers. That revival, mark you, was stopped in its
          very midst and seriously damaged by being made a kind of curiosity,
          and a thing to be gazed at and to be wondered at by persons both at
          home and abroad. God does not care to work for the honour of men,
          either of ministers or of laymen, or of Churches either; and if we
          should say, "Ah! well, I should like to see the presence of God with
          us that we may have many conversions, and put it in the Magazine, and
          say, that is how things are done at the Tabernacle," why we should not
          have a blessing that way. Crowns! crowns! crowns! but all for thy head
          Jesu! laurels and wreaths! but none for man, all for him whose own
          right hand and whose holy arm hath gotten him the victory. We must all
          be agreed on this point, and I hope we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And now to conclude. LET US PUT AWAY ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH OFFEND
          OUR GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before God appeared upon Mount Sinai, the children of Israel had to
          cleanse themselves for three days. Before Israel could take possession
          of the promised rest of Canaan, Joshua had to see to it that they were
          purified by the rite of circumcision. Whenever God would visit his
          people, he always demands of them some preparatory purging, that they
          may be fit to behold his presence; for two cannot walk together,
          unless that which would make them disagree be purged out. A few
          suggestions then, as to whether there is anything in us with which God
          cannot agree. Here I cannot preach to you indiscriminately, but put
          the task into the hand of each man to preach to himself. In the days
          of the great weeping, we read that every man wept apart and his wife
          apart, the son apart, and the daughter apart, all the families apart.
          So it must be here. Is there pride in me? Am I puffed up with my
          talent, my substance, my character, my success? Lord purge this out of
          me, or else thou canst not walk with me, for none shall ever say that
          God and the proud soul are friends: he giveth grace to the humble; as
          for the proud, he knoweth them afar off, and will not let them come
          near to him. Am I slothful? do I waste hours which I might usefully
          employ? Have I the levity of the butterfly, which flits from flower to
          flower, but drinks no honey from any of them? or have I the industry
          of the bee, which, wherever it lights, would find some sweet store for
          the hive? Lord, thou knowest my soul, thou understandest me. Am I
          doing little where I might do much? Hast thou had but little reaping
          for much sowing? Have I hid my talent in a napkin? Have I spent that
          talent for myself, instead of spending it for thee? Slothful souls
          cannot walk with God. "My Father worketh," saith Jesus, "and I work";
          and you who stand in the market-place idle, may stand there with the
          devil, but you cannot stand there with God. Let every brother who is
          guilty of this, purge away his sloth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or am I guilty of worldliness. This is the crying sin of many in the
          Christian Church. Do I put myself into association with men who cannot
          by any possibility profit me? Am I seen where my Master would not go?
          Do I love amusements which cannot afford me comfort when I reflect
          upon them; and which I would never indulge in, if I thought that
          Christ would come while I was at them? Am I worldly in spirit as to
          fashion? Am I as showy, as volatile, as frivolous as men and women of
          the world? If so, if I love the world, the love of the Father is not
          in me; consequently he cannot walk with me, for we are not agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, am I covetous? do I scrape and grind? is my first thought, not
          how I can honour God, but how I can accumulate wealth? When I gain
          wealth, do I forget to make use of it as a steward? If so, then God is
          not agreed with me; I am a thief with his substance; I have set myself
          up for a master instead of being a servant, and God will not walk with
          me till I begin to feel that this is not my own, but his; and that I
          must use it in his fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, am I of an angry spirit? Am I harsh towards my brethren? Do I
          cherish envy towards those who are better than myself, or contempt
          towards those who are worse off? If so, God cannot walk with me, for
          he hates envy, and all contempt of the poor is abhorrent to him. Is
          there any lust in me? Do I indulge the flesh? Am I fond of carnal
          indulgences by which my soul suffers? If so, God will not walk with
          me; for chambering, and wantonness, and gluttony, and drunkenness,
          separate between a believer and his God: these things are not
          convenient to a Christian. Before the great feast of unleavened bread,
          a Jewish parent would sweep out every piece of leaven from his house;
          and so anxious would he be, and so anxious is the Jew at the present
          day, that he take a candle and sweeps out every cupboard, no matter
          though there may have been no food put in there at any time, he is
          afraid lest by accident a crumb may be somewhere concealed in the
          house; and so, from the garret to the cellar, he clears the whole
          house through, to purge out the old leaven. Let us do so. I cannot
          think you will do so as the effect of such poor words as mine; but if
          my soul could speak to you, and God blessed the utterance, you would.
          For my own part, I cry unto my Master, that if there be anything that
          can make me more fit to be the messenger of God to you and to the sons
          of men, however painful might be the preparatory process, he would
          graciously be pleased not to spare me of it. If by sickness, if by
          serious calamities, if by slander and rebuke, more honour can be
          brought to him, then hail! and welcome! all these things; they shall
          be my joy; and to receive them shall be delight. I pray you, utter the
          same desire: "Lord, make me fit to be the means of glorifying thee."
        </p>
        <p>"The dearest idol I have known,</p>
        <p>Whate'er that idol be;</p>
        <p>Help me to tear it from its throne,</p>
        <p>And worship only thee."</p>
        <p>
          What! do you demur? Do you want for ever to go on in the old
          dead-and-alive way in which the Churches are just now? Do you feel no
          sacred passion stirring your breast to anguish for the present, and to
          hope for the future? O ye cravens, who dread the battle, slink to your
          beds; but ye who have your Master's spirit in you, and would long to
          see brighter and better days, lift up your heads with confidence in
          him who will walk with us if we be agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          My text has a main bearing upon the unconverted: I think of preaching
          from it this evening to those who are not agreed with God, and who
          cannot walk with him. I pray that they may be reconciled unto God by
          the death of his Son; and the most likely means to accomplish this,
          will be by your earnest and fervent prayers. O Lord, hear and answer
          for Jesus' sake. Amen.
