          When Abgar had returned from the East, he learnt that the Romans
          suspected him of having gone there to raise troops. He therefore made
          the Roman commissioners acquainted with the reasons of his journey to
          Persia, as well as the treaty concluded between Ardach√®s and his
          brothers; but no credence was given to his statement: for he was
          accused by his enemies Pilate, Herod the tetrarch, Lysanias and
          Philip. Abgar having returned to his city Edessa leagued himself with
          Aretas, king of Petra, and gave him some auxiliary troops under the
          command of Khosran Ardzrouni, to make war upon Herod. Herod had in the
          first instance married the daughter of Aretas, then had repudiated
          her, and thereupon taken Herodias, even in her husband's lifetime, a
          circumstance in connection with which he had had John the Baptist put
          to death. Consequently there was war between Herod and Aretas on
          account of the wrong done the daughter of Aretas. Being sharply
          attacked, Herod's troops were defeated, thanks to the help of the
          brave Armenians; as if, by divine providence, vengeance was taken for
          the death of John the Baptist.<br />
