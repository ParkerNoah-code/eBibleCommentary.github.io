          1. God, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving
          us the token of the Virgin. But not as some allege, among those now
          presuming to expound the Scripture, [thus:] "Behold, a young woman
          shall conceive, and bring forth a son," as Theodotion the Ephesian has
          interpreted, and Aquila of Pontus, both Jewish proselytes. The
          Ebionites, following these, assert that He was begotten by Joseph;
          thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvellous
          dispensation of God, and setting aside the testimony of the prophets
          which proceeded from God. For truly this prediction was uttered before
          the removal of the people to Babylon; that is, anterior to the
          supremacy acquired by the Medes and Persians. But it was interpreted
          into Greek by the Jews themselves, much before the period of our
          Lord's advent, that there might remain no suspicion that perchance the
          Jews, complying with our humour, did put this interpretation upon
          these words. They indeed, had they been cognizant of our future
          existence, and that we should use these proofs from the Scriptures,
          would themselves never have hesitated to burn their own Scriptures,
          which do declare that all other nations partake of [eternal] life, and
          show that they who boast themselves as being the house of Jacob and
          the people of Israel, are disinherited from the grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For before the Romans possessed their kingdom, while as yet the
          Macedonians held Asia, Ptolemy the son of Lagus, being anxious to
          adorn the library which he had founded in Alexandria, with a
          collection of the writings of all men, which were [works] of merit,
          made request to the people of Jerusalem, that they should have their
          Scriptures translated into the Greek language. And they -- for at that
          time they were still subject to the Macedonians -- sent to Ptolemy
          seventy of their elders, who were thoroughly skilled in the Scriptures
          and in both the languages, to carry out what he had desired. But he,
          wishing to test them individually, and fearing lest they might
          perchance, by taking counsel together, conceal the truth in the
          Scriptures, by their interpretation, separated them from each other,
          and commanded them all to write the same translation. He did this with
          respect to all the books. But when they came together in the same
          place before Ptolemy, and each of them compared his own interpretation
          with that of every other, God was indeed glorified, and the Scriptures
          were acknowledged as truly divine. For all of them read out the common
          translation [which they had prepared] in the very same words and the
          very same names, from beginning to end, so that even the Gentiles
          present perceived that the Scriptures had been interpreted by the
          inspiration of God. And there was nothing astonishing in God having
          done this, -- He who, when, during the captivity of the people under
          Nebuchadnezzar, the Scriptures had been corrupted, and when, after
          seventy years, the Jews had returned to their own land, then, in the
          times of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, inspired Esdras the priest,
          of the tribe of Levi, to recast all the words of the former prophets,
          and to re-establish with the people the Mosaic legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Since, therefore, the Scriptures have been interpreted with such
          fidelity, and by the grace of God, and since from these God has
          prepared and formed again our faith towards His Son, and has preserved
          to us the unadulterated Scriptures in Egypt, where the house of Jacob
          flourished, fleeing from the famine in Canaan; where also our Lord was
          preserved when He fled from the persecution set on foot by Herod; and
          [since] this interpretation of these Scriptures was made prior to our
          Lord's descent [to earth], and came into being before the Christians
          appeared -- for our Lord was born about the forty-first year of the
          reign of Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the
          Scriptures were interpreted; -- [since these things are so, I say,]
          truly these men are proved to be impudent and presumptuous, who would
          now show a desire to make different translations, when we refute them
          out of these Scriptures, and shut them up to a belief in the advent of
          the Son of God. But our faith is stedfast, unfeigned, and the only
          true one, having clear proof from these Scriptures, which were
          interpreted in the way I have related; and the preaching of the Church
          is without interpolation. For the apostles, since they are of more
          ancient date than all these [heretics], agree with this aforesaid
          translation; and the translation harmonizes with the tradition of the
          apostles. For Peter, and John, and Matthew, and Paul, and the rest
          successively, as well as their followers, did set forth all
          prophetical [announcements], just as the interpretation of the elders
          contains them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. For the one and the same Spirit of God, who proclaimed by the
          prophets what and of what sort the advent of the Lord should be, did
          by these elders give a just interpretation of what had been truly
          prophesied; and He did Himself, by the apostles, announce that the
          fulness of the times of the adoption had arrived, that the kingdom of
          heaven had drawn nigh, and that He was dwelling within those that
          believe on Him who was born Emmanuel of the Virgin. To this effect
          they testify, [saying,] that before Joseph had come together with
          Mary, while she therefore remained in virginity, "she was found with
          child of the Holy Ghost;" and that the angel Gabriel said unto her,
          "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
          shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be
          born of thee shall be called the Son of God;" and that the angel said
          to Joseph in a dream, "Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled
          which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, Behold, a virgin shall be with
          child." But the elders have thus interpreted what Esaias said: "And
          the Lord, moreover, said unto Ahaz, Ask for thyself a sign from the
          Lord thy God out of the depth below, or from the height above. And
          Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. And he said,
          It is not a small thing for you to weary men; and how does the Lord
          weary them? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold,
          a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His name
          Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat: before He knows or chooses
          out things that are evil, He shall exchange them for what is good; for
          before the child knows good or evil, He shall not consent to evil,
          that He may choose that which is good." Carefully, then, has the Holy
          Ghost pointed out, by what has been said, His birth from a virgin, and
          His essence, that He is God (for the name Emmanuel indicates this).
          And He shows that He is a man, when He says, "Butter and honey shall
          He eat;" and in that He terms Him a child also, [in saying,] "before
          He knows good and evil;" for these are all the tokens of a human
          infant. But that He "will not consent to evil, that He may choose that
          which is good," -- this is proper to God; that by the fact, that He
          shall eat butter and honey, we should not understand that He is a mere
          man only, nor, on the other hand, from the name Emmanuel, should
          suspect Him to be God without flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And when He says, "Hear, O house of David," He performed the part
          of one indicating that He whom God promised David that He would raise
          up from the fruit of his belly (ventris) an eternal King, is the same
          who was born of the Virgin, herself of the lineage of David. For on
          this account also, He promised that the King should be "of the fruit
          of his belly," which was the appropriate [term to use with respect] to
          a virgin conceiving, and not "of the fruit of his loins," nor "of the
          fruit of his reins," which expression is appropriate to a generating
          man, and a woman conceiving by a man. In this promise, therefore, the
          Scripture excluded all virile influence; yet it certainly is not
          mentioned that He who was born was not from the will of man. But it
          has fixed and established "the fruit of the belly," that it might
          declare the generation of Him who should be [born] from the Virgin, as
          Elisabeth testified when filled with the Holy Ghost, saying to Mary,
          "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy belly;"
          the Holy Ghost pointing out to those willing to hear, that the promise
          which God had made, of raising up a King from the fruit of [David's]
          belly, was fulfilled in the birth from the Virgin, that is, from Mary.
          Let those, therefore, who alter the passage of Isaiah thus, "Behold, a
          young woman shall conceive," and who will have Him to be Joseph's son,
          also alter the form of the promise which was given to David, when God
          promised him to raise up, from the fruit of his belly, the horn of
          Christ the King. But they did not understand, otherwise they would
          have presumed to alter even this passage also.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But what Isaiah said, "From the height above, or from the depth
          beneath," was meant to indicate, that "He who descended was the same
          also who ascended." But in this that he said, "The Lord Himself shall
          give you a sign," he declared an unlooked-for thing with regard to His
          generation, which could have been accomplished in no other way than by
          God the Lord of all, God Himself giving a sign in the house of David.
          For what great thing or what sign should have been in this, that a
          young woman conceiving by a man should bring forth, -- a thing which
          happens to all women that produce offspring? But since an unlooked-for
          salvation was to be provided for men through the help of God, so also
          was the unlooked-for birth from a virgin accomplished; God giving this
          sign, but man not working it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. On this account also, Daniel, foreseeing His advent, said that a
          stone, cut out without hands, came into this world. For this is what
          "without hands" means, that His coming into this world was not by the
          operation of human hands, that is, of those men who are accustomed to
          stone-cutting; that is, Joseph taking no part with regard to it, but
          Mary alone co-operating with the pre-arranged plan. For this stone
          from the earth derives existence from both the power and the wisdom of
          God. Wherefore also Isaiah says: "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I
          deposit in the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, the
          chief, the corner-one, to be had in honour." So, then, we understand
          that His advent in human nature was not by the will of a man, but by
          the will of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Wherefore also Moses giving a type, cast his rod upon the earth, in
          order that it, by becoming flesh, might expose and swallow up all the
          opposition of the Egyptians, which was lifting itself up against the
          pre-arranged plan of God; that the Egyptians themselves might testify
          that it is the finger of God which works salvation for the people, and
          not the son of Joseph. For if He were the son of Joseph, how could He
          be greater than Solomon, or greater than Jonah, or greater than David,
          when He was generated from the same seed, and was a descendant of
          these men? And how was it that He also pronounced Peter blessed,
          because he acknowledged Him to be the Son of the living God?
        </p>
        <p>
          9. But besides, if indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not,
          according to Jeremiah, be either king or heir. For Joseph is shown to
          be the son of Joachim and Jechoniah, as also Matthew sets forth in his
          pedigree. But Jechoniah, and all his posterity, were disinherited from
          the kingdom; Jeremiah thus declaring, "As I live, saith the Lord, if
          Jechoniah the son of Joachim king of Judah had been made the signet of
          my right hand, I would pluck him thence, and deliver him into the hand
          of those seeking thy life." And again: "Jechoniah is dishonoured as a
          useless vessel, for he has been cast into a land which he knew not.
          Earth, hear the word of the Lord: Write this man a disinherited
          person; for none of his seed, sitting on the throne of David, shall
          prosper, or be a prince in Judah." And again, God speaks of Joachim
          his father: "Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joachim his
          father, king of Judea, There shall be from him none sitting upon the
          throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the heat of
          day, and in the frost of night. And I will look upon him, and upon his
          sons, and will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
          upon the land of Judah, all the evils that I have pronounced against
          them." Those, therefore, who say that He was begotten of Joseph, and
          that they have hope in Him, do cause themselves to be disinherited
          from the kingdom, failing under the curse and rebuke directed against
          Jechoniah and his seed. Because for this reason have these things been
          spoken concerning Jechoniah, the [Holy] Spirit foreknowing the
          doctrines of the evil teachers; that they may learn that from his seed
          -- that is, from Joseph -- He was not to be born but that, according
          to the promise of God, from David's belly the King eternal is raised
          up, who sums up all things in Himself, and has gathered into Himself
          the ancient formation [of man].
        </p>
        <p>
          10. For as by one man's disobedience sin entered, and death obtained
          [a place] through sin; so also by the obedience of one man,
          righteousness having been introduced, shall cause life to fructify in
          those persons who in times past were dead. And as the protoplast
          himself Adam, had his substance from untilled and as yet virgin soil
          ("for God had not yet sent rain, and man had not tilled the ground" ),
          and was formed by the hand of God, that is, by the Word of God, for
          "all things were made by Him," and the Lord took dust from the earth
          and formed man; so did He who is the Word, recapitulating Adam in
          Himself, rightly receive a birth, enabling Him to gather up Adam [into
          Himself], from Mary, who was as yet a virgin. If, then, the first Adam
          had a man for his father, and was born of human seed, it were
          reasonable to say that the second Adam was begotten of Joseph. But if
          the former was taken from the dust, and God was his Maker, it was
          incumbent that the latter also, making a recapitulation in Himself,
          should be formed as man by God, to have an analogy with the former as
          respects His origin. Why, then, did not God again take dust, but
          wrought so that the formation should be made of Mary? It was that
          there might not be another formation called into being, nor any other
          which should [require to] be saved, but that the very same formation
          should be summed up [in Christ as had existed in Adam], the analogy
          having been preserved.<br />
