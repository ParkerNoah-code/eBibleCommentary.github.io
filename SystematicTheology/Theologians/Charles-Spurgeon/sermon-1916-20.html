        <p>
          "Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his
          refuge." -- Psalm 14:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          GOD'S Word divides the whole human race into two portions. There is
          the seed of the serpent, and the seed of the woman -- the children of
          God, and the children of the devil -- those who are by nature still
          what they always were, and those who have been begotten again unto a
          lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. There
          are many distinctions among men, but they are not much more than
          surface-deep. This one distinction, however, goes right through, and
          it is very deep. I may say that between the two classes, the saved and
          the unsaved, there is a great gulf fixed. There is as wide a
          difference between the righteous and the wicked as there is between
          the living and the dead. The Psalmist, David, in this particular Psalm
          calls one class of men fools, and another class the poor. You will
          observe that he begins by describing the fool, by which he does not
          mean one particular man. but the whole race as it is by nature -- the
          whole of that portion of the human race that remains unregenerate. In
          our text he describes another class as the poor, in which he
          comprehends all the saved, all the godly, all the righteous, of whom
          our Redeemer hath said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is
          the kingdom of heaven." Now from the very first, between the two seeds
          there has always been an enmity -- an enmity which has never been
          mitigated, and never will. It displays itself in various ways, but it
          is always there. In some ages the enmity has burst forth into open
          persecution -- Herod has sought the young child to destroy it; Haman
          has sought to destroy the whole generation of Israel; stakes have been
          erected, and the faithful have been burnt; racks and inhuman engines
          of cruelty have been fashioned by the art of man, through the malice
          of his heart, to exterminate, if it were possible, the children of the
          living God. For there is war -- perpetually war to the knife -- war
          ever between the two generations. At this particular time the warfare
          is not less bitter; but the restraints of Providence do not allow it
          to display itself as it once did, and it now generally takes the form
          of cruel mockings so that our text is as applicable to the present
          race as it was in David's time, "Ye have shamed the counsel of the
          poor, because the Lord is his refuge." The fool bath made a mock of
          the righteous man, called the poor man; and this has been the subject
          of his mockery, that the godly man has been fool enough as he calls
          him, to put his trust in God, and to make this the main point and
          purpose of his life. There may be some here who have done this; all of
          us do it to some extent until we are new-born. We ridicule, if not
          with the tongue, yet in our heart, those who have made God their
          refuge, for when we begin to value the people of God, it is a sign of
          some degree of grace in us: "We know that we have passed from death
          unto life, because we love the brethren"; but until we come into that
          state of grace there is a hatred or contempt, more or less developed,
          against those who are resting in the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I shall at this time first of all speak of those who are mocked;
          secondly, of the mockers; and thirdly, of how those who are mocked
          might to behave towards those who try to put them to shame. First,
          then, let us take the subject -- the object -- of the mockery of
          carnal minds.
        </p>
        <p>I. WHO ARE MOCKED.</p>
        <p>
          Here we have three points: "Ye have shamed the poor," that is, the
          persons; "the counsel of the poor," that is the reasons of their
          faith; then their faith itself, "because the Lord is his refuge."
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, it is very common for ungodly men to pour contempt upon
          God's people, the poor; and oftentimes they will do it by the use of
          these words. It so happens that many of God's people are poor in
          pocket, and how often do hear the observation, "Oh! these Methodists,
          these Presbyterians, these Baptists, they are a set of poor people,
          mechanics, and servant-girls and so on," and how often is that uttered
          with a sneer upon the lips! Well now, that is a fine thing to make fun
          of, isn't it, for, after all, what is there to be ashamed of in honest
          poverty? I will stand here and say that if I could stand to-morrow
          morning in Cheapside, and pick out a dozen poor men, and then if I
          were to pick out a dozen middle-class men, and then if I were to pick
          out a dozen rich men, I believe, as to character, they would be very
          much of a muchness. You shall go, if you will, and pick out at random
          twelve good princes, and see if you could do it; but I will pick you
          out twelve working men that shall be honest, and upright, and chaste
          -- which great men are not always. The poor are no worse than the
          rich, and have no more right to be despised. And if it were true that
          all who fear God were poor, it might, perhaps, be rather to their
          credit than to their dishonour, for, at any rate, nobody would be able
          to say that their Dockets were lined with the result of fraud. If they
          were poor, they would, at any rate, be free from many of the
          accusations that might be brought against rich men. I care no more for
          one class than another, especially when I preach the gospel -- you are
          all alike to me, one as the other -- but this I will say, that of all
          jests and all sneers that is one of the most ridiculous and mean
          against godly people, because they are poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the sneer then takes another form. It is not that they are poor in
          pocket, so much as that they are very poor in education. "Ah!" say
          they, "these people -- well, what do they know? They are not
          philosophical; they are not amongst those who cultivate the higher
          walks of literature; they are mostly plain, simple-minded people, and,
          therefore, they believe their Bibles." Well, I don't believe that.
          Amongst Christian people there are many men of as high an education as
          among any class. The mind of Newton found root in Scripture, and
          discovered depths which it could not fathom. But even if you say that,
          what of it? If these men have the wisdom which cometh from above, they
          have something that will last when the wisdom which is merely of this
          earth will have perished. Go, take the skull of the wise man in your
          hand, and look at it. Is it not as brown, is it not as ghastly a sight
          as the skul1 of the peasant? And what matters it to him, now that he
          lies among the clods of the valley, that once he spent his nights,
          with the lamp, poring into ancient tomes, or walked with his staff to
          heaven to measure the distance of the stars, or bored into the depths
          of the earth? It in all one to him, and if he is a lost soul, ah! who
          would not give the preference to the man that was learned in the
          kingdom of heaven beyond the man that was only learned in the things
          of earth? I see no great reason for jest on the subject therefore. And
          the sneer is, to say the least, ungenerous; for if the ungodly be so
          much the wiser, let them show their wisdom by not sneering at those
          who do not happen to possess their gifts, but who possess what is much
          more precious.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then it will take another shape -- this shaming of the poor
          because of their poverty. Whey will say, "Ah! but they are poor in
          spirit; they have not good ideas of themselves. Hear them -- they are
          always confessing sinfulness and weakness, and they appear to go
          through the world without self-reliance, relying upon some unseen
          power, and always distrusting themselves, and they do not seem to have
          the pluck that the ungodly have. Why, we, we who know not God can
          drink, and they will stop where we can go. And we can let out an oath,
          but they are afraid. And there is many a song that we can sing that
          these fastidious folks would not dare to hear, and there is many an
          amusement which we can enjoy which they, poor creatures, are obliged
          to deny themselves." Ah! well, well, if they choose to be miserable, I
          do not know that you could do better than pity them. It would be a
          pity to be angry with them for not enjoying what you enjoy. Don't,
          therefore, sneer. But, after all, sir, you know very well that there
          is more manliness in refusing to sin than there is in sinning; that
          there is more pluck in saying, "No, I cannot," than there is in being
          led by the devil, first into one sin, and then into another. And these
          men of the world that have this high spirit, and are so bold and brave
          -- what is it better than the high spirit of a lunatic, who dares to
          put his hand in the fire? I dare not do that which would dishonour
          God. I am thankful to be such a coward that I dare not venture it. But
          you shall not say that we are cowardly. Lived there ever a more
          earnest Christian than Havelock? Were there ever better soldiers than
          his Highlanders, who learned to bow the knee before Jehovah? But, O
          sirs, they could fight; they were men brave enough in the day of
          battle, though they could not be brave in the way in which the ungodly
          are. Talk to us Christians about want of courage! Do you ever wish to
          see the Ironsides again in England, with old Oliver Cromwell at their
          head? We hate war, but still we quote these instances to show that a
          man can bow before God like .a sneaking Presbyterian, as you call him,
          and yet rise up and drive the Cavaliers, like chaff before the wind.
          It is not true that we are poor in spirit in the sense that is often
          attached to us. We have as much of courage of the right kind as the
          ungodly have. But, sir, we can afford to bear your jest. We are afraid
          to be damned; we are afraid to take a leap into the dark future, with
          wrath upon our heads; we do tremble before the living god, though we
          will tremble nowhere else. We count it no dim honour to fear him who
          is a consuming fire. But this is commonly the cry, "They're a poor
          set; they're a poor set of milksops." "Ye have shamed the counsel of
          the poor."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now the next point -- a very common jest -- is the reasons that
          Christian men give for being Christians. You notice the text says,
          "the counsel of the poor," for the Christian, when he becomes a
          believer in Christ, takes counsel about it. He does not believe his
          Bible because his grandmother did; he does not accept the Word of God
          because some priest has told him it is true; he takes counsel, and
          considers. This counsel, however, is generally sneered at, as though
          there were no reasonableness in it; therefore, let me just state it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian has taken counsel with his own weakness. He says, "I
          cannot trust myself; I am very apt to go wrong; therefore, will I put
          myself into the great Father's hands, and pray him to lead and guide
          me. I will not go to my business in the morning until I have asked for
          his protection, nor will I close the day without asking still that I
          may be under his care." His reason is because he feels himself to be a
          weak and fallible creature, and he wants protection. That looks to me
          to be very reasonable, but to some it seems to be the theme for
          laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian has next taken counsel with his observations. He has
          looked about in the world, and he could not see that ungodly men
          derive pleasure from their sins. He hears them shouting loudly enough
          sometimes, but he knows who hath woe, and who hath redness of the
          eyes?"they that tarry long at the wine," men of drink; "they that go
          to seek mixed wine." He has seen the ungodly in their quieter moments,
          and observed how unsatisfactory all their best things are, and, upon
          the whole, he considers that what the world offers to its devotees is
          not worth his seeking for. Moreover, the Christian man has sometimes
          seen the sinner die, and' having seen him die, he has discovered that
          there is nothing in the principles of ungodliness to give a man
          comfort in his dying hour. Some of us have heard language from ungodly
          men in their deaths that we would hardly like to repeat, the very
          memory of which makes our blood chill. I remember once being at the
          bedside of a man who alternately cursed and asked me to pray. I could
          not pray as I would desire. I did what I could, and thee he would tell
          me it was no good; his, sins would never be forgiven him; and then he
          would turn again to blasphemy. It was a dread sight. I never saw --
          and I have seen many ungodly people did never saw one die of whom I
          could say, "Let me die the death of this sinner, and let my last end
          be like his"; nor do I think such sights are ever or anywhere to be
          seen. The Christian man, therefore, having taken counsel of that,
          looks for something better that may be his stay in the time of
          trouble, and be his comfort in the time of his departure out of this
          life. That looks to me to be good reasoning. I think it is, and yet
          there are some who sneer at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian man has also taken counsel with the Bible. Believing it
          to be God's Word, he feels that one word of God is worth a ton weight
          of human reason. He would sooner have a drachm of revelation than have
          all the weight of authority that could be brought to bear upon his
          mind. And assuredly, if God be true, he is not incorrect in his
          judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Christian man has taken counsel with his own conscience,
          and he finds that when he walks near to God, he is most happy. He
          discovers that, in keeping God's commandments, there is great reward,
          and though he does not expect to be saved by his works, yet he finds
          himself most sustained when he walks most carefully and jealously
          before the world, and when most near to his heavenly Father. Taking
          such counsel as this, and finding it so much to his own inward
          advantage, I cannot blame him that he still puts his trust where he
          does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Christian man takes counsel with his own experience.
          There are some of us who are as sure that God hears our prayers as we
          are sure that twice two make four. It is to us not a conjecture, no,
          nor even a belief, but a matter of fact. We are habitually in the
          custom of going to God and asking for what we want, and receiving it
          at his hands; and it is no use anybody telling us that prayer is
          useless. We find it constantly useful. It is of no avail for people to
          say these are happy coincidences. They are very strange indeed --
          strange coincidences when they occur again and again, and again, and
          God continually hears our prayers. The witness that the Christian has
          to the truth of his religion does not lie in the books of the learned.
          He is thankful for them, but his chief witness lies here -- in his own
          heart, in his own inward experience. Now we always say that you must
          speak as You find. The Christian has found God faithful to him, has
          found him support him in the time of trial, has found him answer his
          prayers in the hour of distress; and this is the counsel that he has
          taken for himself, and he, therefore, for these reasons relies upon
          God. Well, sneer as some may, I think we will do with our trust in
          God, my brethren, as the natives of a certain American State are said
          to have done when they, instead of making a law-book, agreed that the
          State should be governed by the laws of God, until they had time to
          make better -- we will continue to put our trust in God until somebody
          shall show us something better; we will still pray, and get answered;
          we will still bear our troubles before God, and get rid of them; we
          will still rely upon Christ and find comfort until somebody shall
          bring us something better, and it won't be just yet; and, until then,
          sneers and laughter shall not much affect us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, once more, the great point at which the ungodly mostly aim
          their scoffs is the actual faith of the believer. He has made God to
          be his refuge. And what, what do they say, Why, "It's all canting
          talk." I do not particularly know what that means, but if ever
          Christian men are accused of being cants, they can make the retort by
          saying that the canting is quite as much on one side as the other, for
          of all cants the cant against cant is the worst cant that ever was
          canted. But surely if a man shall speak the truth in other things, and
          you know he does, it is not fair to say he does not speak the truth
          when he says he puts his trust in God. The man is not insincere.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh!" but they will say, "it is ridiculous -- a man trusting in God."
          Yes, but you do not think it ridiculous to trust in yourselves. Many
          of you don't think it ridiculous to trust in some public man. Half of
          the world is trusting in its riches, and is there anything ridiculous
          in leaning upon that arm that bears the earth's huge pillars up? If
          so, ridicule on. To trust weakness seems to you to be sense. I say to
          trust Qmnipotence is infinitely superior wisdom, and we will continue
          to trust in God, for to us it seems to be no absurdity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," they will say, "what does your God do for you? Some of you
          Christian people are very poor; some of you very sick -- very much in
          trouble." Mark you, our God never said we should not be, but, on the
          contrary, told us it should be so. What he does for us is this -- in
          six troubles he is with us, and in the seventh he does not forsake us.
          He never made us a promise that we should be rich; he never made us a
          promise of constant help; on the contrary, it is written, "In the
          world ye shall have tribulation." But our God does this for us, that
          we look upon those troubles as being so much fire that shall purge our
          silver: so much of the winnowing fan that shall drive away the chaff
          and leave the corn clean. We glory in tribulation and rejoice in the
          afflictions which God has laid upon us. Still, that will always be a
          point of jest. But there is one remark I will make before I leave
          this. I should like any man who doubts the reality of faith in God to
          do go down to Bristol, and go to Kingsdown and see the orphan-houses
          there, which Mr. George Muller has built. Now there they stand --
          substantial brick and mortar, and inside there are 2,500 boys and
          girls. They eat a good deal, want a good deal of clothing, and so on.
          And how comes the money? All the world knows, and no man can gainsay
          it, that it comes in answer to prayer, and as the result of Mr.
          Muller's faith -- that, that faith has often been tried, but has never
          failed. What God has done for Mr. Muller, he has done for scores of us
          after our own way, and in our own walk, and we glorify his name.
          Though that stands as a palpable witness, we are not less able to say
          than Mr. Muller, there is a God that heareth prayer, and whoever may
          jest at faith, we continue in it still, and glory in it, and rejoice.
          Now this is what is the matter of jest for the mockers. But my time
          flies, so I must now speak a few words only upon: --
        </p>
        <p>II. WHO ARE THE MOCKERS?</p>
        <p>
          Our text says they are fools. Well, that is my opinion; but it does
          not signify what my opinion may be. The point that does signify,
          however, is that it is God's opinion of every man who is not a
          believer or trusting in his God. In plain English, every such man is a
          fool. That is God's opinion of him -- God that cannot err -- who is
          never too severe, but who speaks the literal truth -- that he is a
          fool. Let me add, it will be that man's opinion of himself one day. If
          he shall ever be converted -- oh! that he may! -- he will think
          himself a fool to have been so long an unbeliever; and if not, when
          the truth of Scripture shall be proved, and he shall be cast into
          hell, then will he see his folly, and own himself to be what God said
          before he was, namely, a fool. O sir, do not run the risk. There was
          an observation made by a countryman that is well worth quoting, when
          he said to the unbeliever. "I have two strings to my bow; you have
          not. Now," said he, "suppose there is no God, I am as well off as you
          are; but suppose there is, where are you?" So can we say, "Suppose,
          after all, our religion should be a delusion. It has made us very
          happy up till now; but as for you -- suppose it should be true? Ah!
          where are you then, who have despised it and have turned away from
          God?" May each man who does not believe in his God know how foolish he
          is. Now as I gave you the reasons for the poor man's faith, let me
          give you the reasons why the unbeliever usually is an unbeliever. It
          is principally because he knows not God; and none of us like to trust
          a person we don't know. He knows nothing of the Most High, has never
          communed with him, nor even seen him in his works; and, therefore, he
          cannot trust him. The unbeliever will also say that he cannot trust
          God because he cannot see him, as if everything that is real must,
          therefore, be the object of sight as if there were not forces in
          nature about which no doubts can be entertained that are far beyond
          the ken of sight. They will also say that they cannot trust God
          because they cannot understand him. If we could understand God, he
          would not be God, for it is a part of the nature of God that he should
          be infinitely greater than any created mind. I have heard of a man who
          went into a smith's smithy one day, and he began complaining of the
          wet weather. "Why," said he, "smith, you talk about Providence! There
          is too much wet by half. If there were any Providence, it would manage
          things a great deal better. There is the wheat nearly all spoilt, and
          the barley is going. I tell you," says he, "there is no Providence;
          things don't go right." The smith took no notice of his observations,
          but after a while walked across the smithy, and took down an
          odd-looking tool which he used in his craft, and said to him, "Do you
          know what that is used for?" "No," said he, I don't." "Look at it;
          look at it, and find out." He did look, and then he said he did not
          know. The smith put up that tool, and took down another, an
          ugly-looking tool, and says he, "Do you know what I use that for?"
          "No," says the man, "I cannot conceive what you do with that." You
          can't! Look at it, and see; perhaps you will find out." He looked at
          the thing, and then he said, "No, I really do not know what is the use
          you put that to." The smith put it up, and then walked leisurely back
          and said, "You are a great dunce. You do not know the use of my tools,
          and I am only a smith; and you set up to judge of the use of God's
          tools, and say what is right and what is wrong. You don't even know
          about a smithy, and yet, you pretend to know about the whole world. It
          is a most unreasonable reason not to believe in God because I cannot
          understand him. The reason at the bottom is this -- the ungodly man
          does not trust God, because he is God's enemy. He knows there is a
          quarrel between the two. He has broken the law, he has become an enemy
          to his Maker; and how shall a man trust his enemy? Besides, he knows
          that God won't do what he would like God to do. He would like God to
          give him good health to go on in sin; he would like him to make him
          happy in his lusts; he would like him to let him live a sinner and die
          a saint; he would like him to shape the world so that man might take
          his sinful pleasure and live as he liked, and yet, after all, receive
          the wages of a righteous life; and as God won't do that -- won't bring
          himself down to the sinner's taste -- therefore, the sinner says, "I
          cannot trust God," and then he turns round and laughs at the man who
          can, just to quiet his own conscience and keep the little sense there
          is within him from rebelling against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I spoke of the Christian's faith; just let me speak of the
          unbeliever's faith. It takes much more faith to be an unbeliever than
          to be a believer. I am sure the philosophies of the present age which
          are currently set forth would require a deal more credulity than I am
          the master of. I can believe Scripture readily, and without violence
          to my soul, but I could not accept the theory even of the development
          of our race, which is so much cried up nowadays, nor a great many
          other theories. They seem to me to require a far greater sweep of
          credulity than anything that is written in the Word of God. To the
          ungodly man this seems reasonable. "It is reasonable to trust a great
          man, and to hope that he will be the maker of you; it is reasonable to
          trust your own reason -- to believe you can steer your own course; it
          is reasonable to be a self-made man, self-reliant; it is reasonable to
          look after the main change; it is reasonable to get all the money you
          can; it is reasonable to put your confidence in it (of course, it has
          not any wings, and won't fly away); it is a reasonable and discreet
          thing to live in this world as if you were to live for ever in it, and
          never think of another world at all." To a great many it seems to be
          philosophy to get as far away from God as ever you possibly can, and
          then you will get to be a wise man that the creature is wisest when it
          forgets its creator. That is the world's creed, and I can only say
          that if they scoff at our creed, we can fairly enough scoff at theirs.
          Trust in yourselves! Why, you are fools to think of such a thing.
          Trust in your wealth! Have you not seen rich men disappear? How about
          a few years ago when -- we must remember it well, and remember it
          sorrowfully -- how a panic comes, and down go the towers of the great,
          and those who seemed to be rich burst like bubbles And oh! the joys of
          earth! How soon are they scattered, how speedily do they disappear!
          What are they, after all, but a will o' the wisp? If it be a wise
          thing to live in this world, and never think of dying, God grant that
          I may be a fool. If it be a wise thing to think all about this poor
          body, and never about my immortal soul, may I never know such wisdom.
          If it be a wise thing to go into the future as a leap in the dark,
          believing nothing, and only by that means kept from fear, may I never
          know such philosophy. Truly it seems to me to be wisdom that I, a
          creature who certainly did not make myself, should think of my
          Creator; that I, a sinner, should accept that blessed way of
          salvation, which is laid before me in the Word of God; that I, weak
          and unable to steer my own course, should put my hand into the great
          Father's hand and say, "Lead me, guide me by thy counsel, and
          afterward receive me to glory." This may be jested at and sneered at,
          but it can bear a sneer and will outlive the mocker. Now, lastly: --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. HOW OUGHT THOSE WHO ARE MOCKED BEHAVE towards those that at mock
          at them? Well, the first thing is, never yield an inch. You young men
          in the great firms of London, you working men that work in the
          factories -- you are sneered at. Let them sneer. If they can sneer you
          out of your religion, you have not got any worth having. Remember you
          can be laughed into hell, but you can never be laughed out of it. A
          man may by ridicule give up what religion he thought he had, but if he
          cast away his soul, his companions who caused his loss cannot help him
          in the day of his travail, and anguish, and bitterness, before the
          throne of the Most High. Why be ashamed? "They called me a saint." I
          remember once a person calling me a saint in the street. All I thought
          was, "I wish he could prove it." Once a man, passing me in the street,
          said, "There is John Bunyan." I think I felt six inches taller at the
          least. I was delighted to be called by such a name as that. "Oh! but
          they will point at you." Cannot you bear to be pointed at? "But they
          will chaff you." Chaff -- let them chaff you. Can that hurt a man that
          is a man? If you are a molluscous creature that has no backbone, you
          may be afraid of jokes, and jeers, and jests; but if God has made you
          upright, stand upright and be a man. Moreover, there is one thing you
          should always do when you are ashamed -- pray. The next verse in the
          Psalm is, "Oh! that God would turn the captivity of Zion." The best
          refuge for a believer in times of persecution is his secret resort to
          God. Let him to on his kneed and say, "My Lord, I have been counted
          worthy to be spoken ill of for thy name's sake. Help me to bear it.
          Now is my time of trial. Strengthen me to bear this reproach. Grant
          that it may be no heavy burden to me, but may I rather rejoice in it
          for thy name's sake." God will help you, beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then next to that, pray always, most for those who treat you worst.
          Make them the constant subjects of your prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I would say, in your actions prove the sincerity of your
          prayers by extra kindness towards those who are unkind to you. Heap
          coals of fire upon their head. That is an expression not always
          explained. When the crucible is to be brought to a great heat, and the
          metal to be thoroughly melted, it is not enough for the coals all
          around it to glow. The silversmith that is desiring to melt it
          thoroughly will heap them so that the metal shall be all surrounded by
          flames. Do so, I pray you, with any of your enemies; heap kindnesses
          upon them. A Christian woman had often prayed for a very ungodly and
          unkind husband, but her prayers were not heard. However she did this,
          she treated him more kindly than she had ever done before. If there
          was any little thing that she could think of that would please his
          palate, if she had to deny herself, that would be on the table. She
          kept the house scrupulously comfortable, and did all she could. And
          one day someone said to her, "How is it that you, with such a husband
          can act so towards him?" "Well," she said, "I hope I shall win his
          soul yet, but if not" -- and then the tears came in her eyes -- all
          the happiness he will have will be in this life, and so I will let him
          have all I can possibly give him, since he has no happiness in the
          life to come." Do that with the ungodly. Lay yourself out to oblige
          and serve them. Let it be known of you that the best way to get a good
          turn out of you is to do you a bad turn. "Oh!" says one, "it is too
          hard. Tread on a worm, and it will turn." And is a worm to be an
          example to a Christian? Christ Jesus, art thou not better for an
          exemplar than a poor worm that creeps into the earth? What did our
          Saviour do but pray for his murderers? The blood they shed redeemed
          them that shed it. We have heard the old story of the sandal-wood tree
          that perfumes the axe that cuts it. Do you so, O Christian! Perfume
          with your love the axe that wounds you. Be like the anvil that never
          strikes the hammer again, but yet the anvil wears out many hammers by
          its indomitable patience. Be patient, be courteous, be kind -- in a
          word, Christ-like; and how know you that these very persons who hate
          you most to-day will not love you well to-morrow, and come together
          with you to the communion table, and together rejoice in our blessed
          Saviour?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if I have seemed to preach too harshly to-night, it is not so in
          my heart. Oh! how I wish you all, everyone without exception, knew
          what a blessed life the Christian life is! I would, not lie for God
          himself, but I speak the truth to you. I never knew what perfect peace
          was until I looked to Christ upon the cross, and rested my soul on
          him. I have had trials, and have suffered bitter pains, but I have
          always found consolation when I have turned my eyes to my bleeding
          Saviour, and have given myself up again to the great Father's hands.
          He is a blessed Lord. I serve a good Master. Trust him, give your
          hearts up to him, and if you have spoken against his people, or
          rebelled against his love, he is willing to receive you. He has no
          hard word to say to returning ones. Come to him; come and welcome.
          Come just now, and the Lord receive you, for his mercy's sake.
          Amen.<br />
