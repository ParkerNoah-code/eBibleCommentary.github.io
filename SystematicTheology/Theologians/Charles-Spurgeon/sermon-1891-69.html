          1. Moreover, in addition to what has been said, Basilides himself
          will, according to his own principles, find it necessary to maintain
          not only that there are three hundred and sixty-five heavens made in
          succession by one another, but that an immense and innumerable
          multitude of heavens have always been in the process of being made,
          and are being made, and will continue to be made, so that the
          formation of heavens of this kind can never cease. For if from the
          efflux of the first heaven the second was made after its likeness, and
          the third after the likeness of the second, and so on with all the
          remaining subsequent ones, then it follows, as a matter of necessity,
          that from the efflux of our heaven, which he indeed terms the last,
          another be formed like to it, and from that again a third; and thus
          there can never cease, either the process of efflux from those heavens
          which have been already made, or the manufacture of [new] heavens, but
          the operation must go on ad infinitum, and give rise to a number of
          heavens which will be altogether indefinite.

          2. The remainder of those who are falsely termed Gnostics, and who
          maintain that the prophets uttered their prophecies under the
          inspiration of different gods, will be easily overthrown by this fact,
          that all the prophets proclaimed one God and Lord, and that the very
          Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things which are therein; while
          they moreover announced the advent of His Son, as I shall demonstrate
          from the Scriptures themselves, in the books which follow.

          3. If, however, any object that, in the Hebrew language, diverse
          expressions [to represent God] occur in the Scriptures, such as
          Sabaoth, Eloë, Adonai, and all other such terms, striving to prove
          from these that there are different powers and gods, let them learn
          that all expressions of this kind are but announcements and
          appellations of one and the same Being. For the term Eloë in the
          Jewish language denotes God, while ElOeim and EleOuth in the Hebrew
          language signify "that which contains all." As to the appellation
          Adonai, sometimes it denotes what is nameable and admirable; but at
          other times, when the letter Daleth in it is doubled, and the word
          receives an initial guttural sound -- thus Addonai -- [it signifies],
          "One who bounds and separates the land from the water," so that the
          water should not subsequently submerge the land. In like manner also,
          Sabaoth, when it is spelled by a Greek Omega in the last syllable
          [SabaOth], denotes "a voluntary agent;" but when it is spelled with a
          Greek Omicron -- as, for instance, Sabaoth -- it expresses "the first
          heaven." In the same way, too, the word JaOth, when the last syllable
          is made long and aspirated, denotes "a predetermined measure;" but
          when it is written shortly by the Greek letter Omicron, namely Jaoth,
          it signifies "one who puts evils to flight." All the other expressions
          likewise bring out the title of one and the same Being; as, for
          example (in English ), The Lord of Powers, The Father of all, God
          Almighty, The Most High, The Creator, The Maker, and such like. These
          are not the names and titles of a succession of different beings, but
          of one and the same, by means of which the one God and Father is
          revealed, He who contains all things, and grants to all the boon of
          existence.

          4. Now, that the preaching of the apostles, the authoritative teaching
          of the Lord, the announcements of the prophets, the dictated
          utterances of the apostles, and the ministration of the law -- all of
          which praise one and the same Being, the God and Father of all, and
          not many diverse beings, nor one deriving his substance from different
          gods or powers, but [declare] that all things [were formed] by one and
          the same Father (who nevertheless adapts [His works] to the natures
          and tendencies of the materials dealt with), things visible and
          invisible, and, in short, all things that have been made [were
          created] neither by angels, nor by any other power, but by God alone,
          the Father -- are all in harmony with our statements, has, I think,
          been sufficiently proved, while by these weighty arguments it has been
          shown that there is but one God, the Maker of all things. But that I
          may not be thought to avoid that series of proofs which may be derived
          from the Scriptures of the Lord (since, indeed, these Scriptures do
          much more evidently and clearly proclaim this very point), I shall,
          for the benefit of those at least who do not bring a depraved mind to
          bear upon them, devote a special book to the Scriptures referred to,
          which shall fairly follow them out [and explain them], and I shall
          plainly set forth from these divine Scriptures proofs to [satisfy] all
          the lovers of truth.
