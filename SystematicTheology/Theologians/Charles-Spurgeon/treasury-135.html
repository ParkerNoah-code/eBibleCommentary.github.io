          TITLE. A Song of Degrees. I fail to see how this is a step beyond the
          previous Psalm; and yet it is clearly the song of an older and more
          tried individual, who looks back upon a life of affliction in which he
          suffered all along, even from his youth. Inasmuch as patience is a
          higher, or at least a more difficult grace than domestic love, the
          ascent or progress may perhaps be seen in that direction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Probably if we knew more of the stations on the road to the Temple we
          should see a reason for the order of these Psalms; but as that
          information cannot be obtained, we must take the songs as we find
          them, and remember that, as we do not now go on pilgrimages to Zion,
          it is our curiosity and not our necessity which is a loser by our not
          knowing the cause of the arrangement of the songs in this Pilgrim
          Psalter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          AUTHOR, ETC. It does not seem to us at all needful to ascribe this
          Psalm to a period subsequent to the captivity. Indeed, it is more
          suitable to a time when as yet the enemy bad not so far prevailed as
          to have carried the people into a distant land. It is a mingled hymn
          of sorrow and of strong resolve. Though sorely smitten, the afflicted
          one is heart whole, and scorns to yield in the least degree to the
          enemy.

          The poet sings the trials of Israel, verses 1-3; <br />
          the interposition of the Lord, verse 4; <br />
          the unblessed condition of Israel's foes, verses 5-8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a rustic song, full of allusions to husbandry. It reminds us of
          the books of Ruth and Amos.<br />

            Verse 1. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may
            Israel now say.

        >In her present hour of trial she may remember her former afflictions
        and speak of them for her comfort, drawing from them the assurance that
        he who has been with her for so long will not desert her in the end.
        <p align="justify">
          The song begins abruptly. The poet has been musing, and the fire
          burns, therefore he speaks with his tongue; he cannot help it, he
          feels that he must speak, and therefore may now say what he has to
          say.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The trials of the church have been repeated again and again, times
          beyond all count—the same afflictions are fulfilled in us as in our
          fathers. Jacob of old found his days full of trouble; each Israelite
          is often harassed; and Israel as a whole has proceeded from
          tribulation to tribulation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Many a time", Israel says, because she could not say how many times.
          She speaks of her assailants as "they", because it would be impossible
          to write or even to know all their names. They had straitened,
          harassed, and fought against her from the earliest days of her
          history—from her youth; and they had continued their assaults right on
          without ceasing.<i>
            Persecution is the heirloom of the church, and the ensign of the
            elect.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Israel among the nations was peculiar, and this peculiarity brought
          against her many restless foes, who could never be easy unless they
          were warring against the people of God. When in Canaan, at the first,
          the chosen household was often severely tried; in Egypt it was heavily
          oppressed; in the wilderness it was fiercely assailed; and in the
          promised land it was often surrounded by deadly enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It was something for the afflicted nation that it survived to say,
          "Many a time have they afflicted me." The affliction began early,
          "from my youth"; and it continued late. The earliest years of Israel
          and of the Church of God are spent in trial. Babes in grace are
          cradled in opposition. No sooner is the manchild born than the dragon
          is after it. "It is", however, "good for a man that he bear the yoke
          in his youth", and he shall see it to be so when in after days he
          tells the tale.

            Verse 2. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth.
          </p></b
        >
        Israel repeats her statement of her repeated afflictions. The fact was
        uppermost in her thoughts, and she could not help soliloquizing upon it
        again and again. These repetitions are after the manner of poetry—thus
        she makes a sonnet out of her sorrows, and music out of her miseries.
        <b> <p align="justify">"Yet they have not prevailed against me."</p></b
        >We seem to hear the beat of timbrels and the clash of cymbals here: the
        foe is derided; his malice has failed. "Cast down, but not destroyed",
        is the shout of a victor. Israel has wrestled, and has overcome in the
        struggle. If Israel overcame the angel of the covenant, what man or
        devil shall vanquish him? The fight was oft renewed and long protracted:
        the champion severely felt the conflict, and was at times fearful of the
        issue; but at length he takes breath, and cries, "Yet they have not
        prevailed against me." "Many a time;" yes, "many a time", the enemy has
        had his opportunity and his advantage, but not so much as once has he
        gained the victory.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 3. The plowers plowed up on my back.</p></b
        >The scourgers tore the flesh as ploughmen furrow a field. The people
        were maltreated like a criminal given over to the lictors with their
        cruel whips; the back of the nation was scored and furrowed by
        oppression.
        <p align="justify">
          It is a grand piece of imagery condensed into few words. The afflicted
          nation was, as it were, lashed by her adversaries so cruelly that each
          blow left a long red mark, or perhaps a bleeding wound, upon her back
          and shoulders, comparable to a furrow which tears up the ground from
          one end of the field to the other.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many a heart has been in like case; smitten and sore wounded by them
          that use the scourge of the tongue; so smitten that their whole
          character has been cut up and scored by calumny. The true church has
          in every age had fellowship with her Lord under his cruel
          flagellations: his sufferings were a prophecy of what she would be
          called hereafter to endure, and the foreshadowing has been fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Zion has in this sense been ploughed as a field. They made long their
          furrows—as if delighting in their cruel labor. They missed not an
          inch, but went from end to end of the field, meaning to make thorough
          work of their congenial engagement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who laid on the scourge did it with a thoroughness which showed
          how hearty was their hate. Assuredly the enemies of Christ's church
          never spare pains to inflict the utmost injury—they never do the work
          of the devil deceitfully, or hold back their hand from blood. They
          smite so as to plough into the man; they plough the quivering flesh as
          if it were clods of clay; they plough deep and long with countless
          furrows; until they leave no portion of the church unfurrowed or
          unassailed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Ah me! Well did Latimer say that there was no busier ploughman in all
          the world than the devil; whoever makes short furrows, he does not.
          Whoever balks and shirks, he is thorough in all that he does. Whoever
          stops work at sundown, he never does. He and his children plough like
          practiced ploughmen; but they prefer to carry on their pernicious work
          upon the saints behind their backs, for they are as cowardly as they
          are cruel.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. The LORD is righteous.</p></b> Whatever
        men may be, Jehovah remains just, and will therefore keep covenant with
        his people and deal out justice to their oppressors. Here is the hinge
        of the condition: this makes the turning point of Israel's distress. The
        Lord bears with the long furrows of the wicked, but he will surely make
        them cease from their ploughing before he has done with them. He has cut
        asunder the cords of the wicked. The rope which binds the oxen to the
        plough is cut; the cord which bound the victim is broken; the bond which
        held the enemies in cruel unity has snapped.
        <p align="justify">
          As in Psalm 124:7 we read, "the snare is broken; we are escaped", so
          here the breaking of the enemies' instrument of oppression is Israel's
          release.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sooner or later a righteous God will interpose, and when he does so,
          his action will be most effectual; he does not unfasten, but cuts
          asunder, the harness which the ungodly use in their labor of hate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Never has God used a nation to chastise his Israel without destroying
          that nation when the chastisement has come to a close: he hates those
          who hurt his people even though he permits their hate to triumph for a
          while for his own purpose. If any man would have his harness cut, let
          him begin to plough one of the Lord's fields with the plough of
          persecution. The shortest way to ruin, is to meddle with a saint: the
          divine warning is, "He who touches you touches the apple of his eye."

        And so say we right heartily. If this be an imprecation, let it stand;
        for our heart says "Amen" to it. It is but justice that those who hate,
        harass, and hurt the good, should be brought to naught. Those who
        confound right and wrong, ought to be confounded. Those who turn back
        from God, ought to be turned back.

          We desire their welfare as men—and their downfall as traitors. Let
          their conspiracies be confounded, their policies be turned back. How

          dearest to our hearts?

          This present age is so flippant that if a man loves the Savior he is

          bigot. As for ourselves, despite all objectors, we join heartily in
          this commination; and would revive in our heart the old practice of
          Ebal and Gerizim, where those were blessed who bless God, and those
          were cursed who make themselves a curse to the righteous.

          We have heard men desire a thousand times that the gallows might be
          the reward of the assassins who murdered two inoffensive men in
          Dublin, and we could never censure the wish; for justice ought to he
          rendered to the evil as well as to the good. Besides, the church of
          God is so useful, so beautiful, so innocent of harm, so fraught with
          good, that those who do her wrong, are wronging all mankind and
          deserve to be treated as the enemies of the human race. Study a
          chapter from the "Book of Martyrs", and see if you do not feel
          inclined to read an imprecatory Psalm over Bishop Bonner and Bloody
          Mary. It may be that some wretched nineteenth century sentimentalist
          will blame you—pay him no attention.

          </p></b
        >
        Grass on the housetop is soon up and soon down. It sprouts in the heat,
        finds enough nutriment to send up a green blade, and then it dies away
        before it reaches maturity, because it has neither earth nor moisture
        sufficient for its proper development. Before it grows up it dies; it
        needs not to be plucked up, for it hastens to decay of itself.
        <p align="justify">
          Such is and such ought to be the lot of the enemies of God's people.
          Transient is their prosperity—and speedy is their destruction. The
          height of their position, as it hastens their progress, so it hurries
          their doom. Had they been lower in station they had perhaps been
          longer in being. "Soon ripe, soon rotten", is an old proverb. Soon
          plotting and soon rotting, is a version of the old adage which will
          suit in this place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have seen grass on the rustic thatch of our own country cottages
          which will serve for an illustration almost as well as that which
          comes up so readily on the flat roofs and domes of eastern
          habitations. The idea is that they make speed to success, and equal
          speed to failure. Persecutors are all sound and fury, flash and flame;
          but they speedily vanish—more speedily than is common to men.

        <p align="justify">
          Grass in the field withers, but not so speedily as grass on the
          housetops. Without a mower the tufts of verdure perish from the roofs,
          and so do opposers pass away by other deaths than fall to the common
          lot of men; they are gone, and none is the worse. If they are missed
          at all, their absence is never regretted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Grass on the housetop is a nonentity in the world—the house is not
          impoverished when the last blade is dried up: and, even so, the
          opposers of Christ pass away, and none lament them. One of the fathers
          said of the apostate emperor Julian, "That little cloud will soon be
          gone"; and so it was. Every skeptical system of philosophy has much
          the same history; and the like may be said of each heresy. Poor,
          rootless things, they are—and are not. They come and go, even though
          no one rises against them. Evil carries the seeds of dissolution
          within itself. So let it be.
