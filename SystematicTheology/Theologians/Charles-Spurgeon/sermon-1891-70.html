          Thou hast indeed enjoined upon me, my very dear friend, that I should
          bring to light the Valentinian doctrines, concealed, as their votaries
          imagine; that I should exhibit their diversity, and compose a treatise
          in refutation of them. I therefore have undertaken -- showing that
          they spring from Simon, the father of all heretics -- to exhibit both
          their doctrines and successions, and to set forth arguments against
          them all. Wherefore, since the conviction of these men and their
          exposure is in many points but one work, I have sent unto thee
          [certain] books, of which the first comprises the opinions of all
          these men, and exhibits their customs, and the character of their
          behaviour. In the second, again, their perverse teachings are cast
          down and overthrown, and, such as they really are, laid bare and open
          to view. But in this, the third book I shall adduce proofs from the
          Scriptures, so that I may come behind in nothing of what thou hast
          enjoined; yea, that over and above what thou didst reckon upon, thou
          mayest receive from me the means of combating and vanquishing those
          who, in whatever manner, are propagating falsehood. For the love of
          God, being rich and ungrudging, confers upon the suppliant more than
          he can ask from it. Call to mind then, the things which I have stated
          in the two preceding books, and, taking these in connection with them,
          thou shalt have from me a very copious refutation of all the heretics;
          and faithfully and strenuously shalt thou resist them in defence of
          the only true and life-giving faith, which the Church has received
          from the apostles and imparted to her sons. For the Lord of all gave
          to His apostles the power of the Gospel, through whom also we have
          known the truth, that is, the doctrine of the Son of God; to whom also
          did the Lord declare: |He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that
          despiseth you, despiseth Me, and Him that sent Me.|
