        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.563)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning,, April 3rd, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not
          come to him; and when he sent again, the second time, he would not
          come. Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
          mine, and he hath barley there: Go and set it on fire. And Absalom's
          servants set the field on fire. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom
          unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my
          field on fire?" -- 2 Samuel 14:29-31.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU REMEMBER the historical narrative. Absalom had fled from Jerusalem
          under fear of David's anger. He was after a time permitted to return;
          but he was not admitted into the presence of the king. Earnestly
          desiring to be restored to his former posts of honor and favor, he
          besought Joab to come to him, intending to request him to act as
          mediator. Joab, having lost much of his liking for the young prince,
          refused to come; and, though he was sent for repeatedly, he declined
          to attend at his desire. Absalom therefore thought of a most wicked,
          but most effective plan of bringing Joab into his company. He bade his
          servants set Joab's field of barley on fire. This brought Joab down in
          high wrath to ask the question, "Wherefore have thy servants set my
          field on fire?" This was all that Absalom wanted; he wished an
          interview, and he was not scrupulous as to the method by which he
          obtained it. The burning of the barley-field brought Joab into his
          presence, and Absalom's ends were accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Omitting the sin of the deed, we have here a picture of what is often
          done by our gracious God, with the wisest and best design. Often he
          sendeth for us, not for his profit, but for ours. He would have us
          come near to him and receive a blessing at his hands; but we are
          foolish and cold-hearted and wicked, and we will not come. He, knowing
          that we will not come by any other means, sendeth a serious trial: he
          sets our barley-field on fire; which he has a right to do, seeing our
          barley-fields are far more his than they are ours. In Absalom's case
          it was wrong; in God's case he has a right to do as he wills with his
          own. He takes away from us our most choice delight, upon which we have
          set our heart, and then we inquire at his hands, "Wherefore contendest
          thou with me? Why am I thus smitten with thy rod? What have I done to
          provoke thee to anger?" And thus we are brought into the presence of
          God, and we receive blessings of infinitely more value than those
          temporary mercies which the Lord had taken from us. You will see,
          then, how I intend to use my text this morning. As the pastor of so
          large a church as this, I am constantly brought into contact with all
          sorts of human sorrow. Frequently it is poverty, -- poverty too which
          is not brought on by idleness or vice, but real poverty and most
          distressing and afflicting poverty too, because it visits those who
          have fought well the battle of life, and have struggled hard for
          years, and yet in their old age scarce know where bread shall come
          from, except that they rest upon the promise -- "Thy bread shall be
          given thee, and thy water shall be sure." Messengers come to me
          sometimes as fast as they came to Job, bearing sad tidings concerning
          one and another of you. There comes one -- "I entreat your prayers for
          me, sir: God has been pleased to take away my wife with a stroke; she
          now lies in the cold grave." Another cries, "O sir, my wife is sore
          sick, and the physician saith that there is but little hope: pray for
          her, that she may be strengthened in the hour of her departure; and
          for me, that I may be enabled to kiss the Master's rod." Then comes
          another -- "My son is afflicted; he is to undergo a painful operation:
          pray that the surgeon's knife may not be his death, but that he may be
          enabled to bear up under it." And when I have sympathized with a
          company of sad complaints like these, another set of messengers will
          be waiting at the door. How few families are long without severe
          trials! hardly a person escapes for any long season without
          tribulation. With impartial hand sorrow knocks at the door of the
          palace and the cottage. Why all this? The Lord, we know, "Doth not
          afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men" for naught; why can
          it be that he employs so many frowning servants, and sendeth out so
          often his usher of the black rod? Wherefore can it be? Perhaps I may
          be able to give the fitting answer to this very proper inquiry, and it
          may be that I may be as serviceable to the afflicted as the jailer was
          to Paul and Silas when he washed their stripes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall use my text, first of all, in reference to believers; and
          then, with regard to the unconverted. Oh for help from above!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, brethren, let us use the text WITH REFERENCE TO
          BELIEVERS IN CHRIST.
        </p>
        <p>
          My beloved brethren and sisters in Jesus Christ, we cannot expect to
          avoid tribulation. If other men's barley-fields are not burned, ours
          will be. If the Father uses the rod nowhere else, he will surely make
          his true children smart. As Paul saith, and as our hymnster hath
          rhymed it --
        </p>
        <p>"Bastards may escape the rod,</p>
        <p>Sunk in earthly vain delight,</p>
        <p>But the true-born child of God,</p>
        <p>Must not -- would not if he might."</p>
        <p>
          Your Saviour hath left you a double legacy, "In the world ye shall
          have tribulation; but in me ye shall have peace." You enjoy peace; you
          must not expect that you shall escape without the privilege of the
          tribulation. All wheat must be threshed: and God's threshing-floor
          witnesses to the weight of the flail as much as any other. Gold must
          be tried in the fire; and truly the Lord hath a fire in Zion, and his
          furnace in Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you, beloved, have four very special comforts in all your trouble.
          You have, first, this sweet reflection, that there is no curse in your
          cross. Christ was made a curse for us, and we call his cross the
          accursed tree; but, truly, since Jesus hung upon it, it is most
          blessed; and I may now say concerning the cross of affliction,
          "Blessed is every man who hangeth on this tree." The cross may be very
          heavy, especially while it is green, and our shoulders unused to
          carrying it; but remember, though there may be a ton-weight of sorrow
          in it, there is not a single ounce of the curse in it. God doth never
          punish his children in the sense of avenging justice: he chastens as a
          father does his child, but he doth never punish his redeemed as a
          judge doth a criminal. It were unjust to exact punishment in their
          place and stead. How shall the Lord punish twice for one offence? If
          Christ took my sins and stood as my substitute, then there is no wrath
          of God for me; and though my cup may be bitter, yet there cannot be a
          single drop of the wormwood of Almighty wrath in it. I may have to
          smart, but it will never be beneath the lictor's rods of justice, but
          under the Parent's rod of wisdom. O Christian! how sweet this ought to
          be to you! There was a time when you were under conviction of sin, --
          when you thought you would rot in a dungeon or burn at the stake most
          cheerfully, if you could but get rid of the sense of God's wrath; and
          will you now become impatient? The wrath of God is the thunderbolt
          which scathes the soul; and now that you are delivered from that
          tremendous peril, you must not be overwhelmed with the few showers and
          gales which Providence sends you. A God of love inflicts our sorrows:
          he is as good when he chastens as when he caresses: there is no more
          wrath in his afflicting providences than in his deeds of bounty. God
          may seem unkind to unbelief, but faith can always see love in his
          heart. Oh! what a mercy that Sinai has ceased to thunder! Lord, let
          Jesus say what he will, so long as Moses is quieted forever. Strike,
          Lord, if thou wilt, now that thou hast heard the Saviour's plea and
          justified our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have, secondly, another ground of comfort; namely, that your
          troubles are all apportioned to you by divine wisdom and love. As for
          their number, if He appoint them ten, they never can be eleven. As for
          their weight, He who weigheth the mountains in scales and the hills in
          a balance, takes care to measure your troubles, and you shall not have
          a grain more than his infinite wisdom sees fit. The devil may seem to
          be turned loose upon you, but remember he is always a chained enemy.
          There is a tether to every trouble, and beyond that tether it can
          never stray. Nebuchadnezzar may heat the furnace seven times hotter
          than usual, but God's thermometer measures the exact degree of heat;
          and beyond it the flame cannot rage, even though a thousand
          Nebuchadnezzars should swear themselves out of breath in their fury.
          Consider everything that you have to suffer as the appointment of
          wisdom, ruled by love, and you will rejoice in all your tribulation,
          knowing that it shall reveal to you the loving-kindness and wisdom of
          your God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have a third consolation; namely, that under your cross you have
          many special comforts. There are cordials which God giveth to sick
          saints which he never putteth to the lips of those who are in health.
          Dark caverns keep not back the miners, if they know that diamonds are
          to be found there: you need not fear suffering, when you remember what
          riches it yields to your soul. There is no hearing the nightingale
          without night, and there are some promises which only sing to us in
          trouble. It is in the cellar of affliction that the good old wine of
          the kingdom is stored. You shall never see Christ's face so well as
          when all others turn their backs upon you. When you have come into
          such confusion that human wisdom is at a nonplus, then shall you see
          God's wisdom manifest and clear. Oh the love-visits which Christ
          payeth to his people when they are in the prison of their trouble!
          Then he layeth bare his very heart to them, and comforts them as a
          mother doth her child. They sleep daintily who have Jesus to make
          their beds. Suffering saints are generally the most flourishing
          saints; and well they may be, for they are Jesus' special care. If you
          would find a man whose lips drop with pearls, look for one who has
          been in the deep waters. We seldom learn much except as it is beaten
          into us by the rod in Christ's schoolhouse, under Madam Trouble. God's
          vines owe more to the pruning-knife than to any other tool in the
          garden; superfluous shoots are sad spoilers of the vines. But even
          while we carry it, the cross brings present comfort: it is a dear,
          dear cross, all hung with roses, and dripping with sweet-smelling
          myrrh. Rutherford seemed at times in doubt which he loved best, Christ
          or his cross; but then, good man, he only loved the cross for his
          Lord's sake. Humble souls count it a high honor to be thought worthy
          to suffer for Christ's sake. If ever heaven be opened at all to the
          gaze of mortals, the vision is granted to those who dwell in the
          Patmos of want and trouble. Furnace-joys glow quite as warmly as
          furnace-flames. Sweet are the uses of adversity, and sweet are its
          accompaniments when the Lord is with his people.
        </p>
        <p>"Mid the gloom the vivid lightnings</p>
        <p>With increasing brightness play;</p>
        <p>'Mid the thorn-brake beauteous flowrets</p>
        <p>Look more beautiful and gay.</p>
        <p>So, in darkest dispensations</p>
        <p>Doth my faithful Lord appear,</p>
        <p>With his richest consolations,</p>
        <p>To reanimate and cheer."</p>
        <p>
          But then, -- and this is the point to which my text brings me, and all
          I have already said is going astray from it, -- you have this comfort,
          that your trials work your lasting good by bringing you nearer and
          nearer to God. This point we will illustrate by the narrative before
          us. My dear friends in Christ Jesus, our heavenly Father often sends
          for us and we will not come. He sends for us to exercise a more simple
          faith in him. We have believed, and by faith we have passed from death
          unto life, but our faith sometimes staggers. We have not yet reached
          to Abraham's confidence in God; we do not leave our worldly cares with
          him, but, like Martha, we cumber ourselves with much serving. We have
          faith to lay hold upon little promises; but we are ofttimes afraid to
          open our mouths wide though God has promised to fill them. He
          therefore sendeth to us. "Come, my child," saith he; "come and trust
          me. The veil is rent: enter into my presence, and approach boldly to
          the throne of my grace. I am worthy of thy fullest confidence: cast
          thy cares on me. Come thou into the sunlight, and read thy title
          clear. Shake thyself from the dust of thy cares, and put on thy
          beautiful garment of faith. " But, alas! though called with tones of
          love to the blessed exercise of this comforting grace, we will not
          come. At another time he calls us to closer communion with himself. We
          have been sitting on the doorstep of God's house, and he bids us
          advance into the banqueting-hall and sup with him; but we decline the
          honor. He has admitted us into the inner chambers, but there are
          secret rooms not yet opened to us; he invites us to enter them, but we
          hold back. Jesus longs to have near communion with his people. This is
          that which gives him "to see of the travail of his soul, and to be
          satisfied." It must be a joy to a Christian to be with Christ; but it
          is also a joy to Jesus to be with his people, for it is written, "His
          delights were with the sons of men." Now, one would think that if
          Christ did but beckon with his finger and say to us, "Draw nigh, and
          commune with me," we should fly as though we had wings to our feet;
          but, instead thereof, we are cleaving to the dust: we have too much
          business; we have too many carking cares; and we forget to come,
          though it is our Beloved's voice which calls us to himself. Frequently
          the call is to more fervent prayer. Do you not feel in yourself, at
          certain seasons, an earnest longing for private prayer? You have felt
          as if you could not be at ease until you could draw near unto God and
          tell him your wants; and yet, may be, you have quenched the Spirit in
          that respect, and still have continued without nearness of access to
          God. Every day the Lord bids his people come to him and ask what they
          will, and it shall be done. He is a bounteous God, who sits upon the
          mercy-seat, and he delights to give to his people the largest desires
          of their hearts; and yet, shame upon us, we live without exercising
          this power of prayer, and we miss the plentitude of blessing which
          would come out of that cornucopia of grace, -- prevailing prayer with
          God. Ah, brethren, we are verily guilty here, the most of us. The
          Master sendeth to us to pray, and we will not come. Often, too, he
          calls us to a higher state of piety. From this pulpit I have labored
          to stir you up to nobler attainments; I have besought you to rest no
          longer satisfied with your dwarfish attainments, but to press forward
          to things more sublime and heavenly. Have I not cried unto you,
          beloved, and bid you
        </p>
        <p>"Forget the steps already trod,</p>
        <p>And onward urge your way."</p>
        <p>
          I am persuaded there are Christians as much in grace beyond ordinary
          Christians as ordinary Christians are beyond the profane. There are
          heights which common eyes have never seen, much less scaled. Oh! there
          are nests among the stars where God's own saints dwell, and yet how
          many of us are content to go creeping along like worms in the dust!
          Would that we had grace to cleave the clouds and mount into the pure
          blue sky of fellowship with Christ! We do not serve God as we should.
          We are cold as ice, when we should be like molten metal, burning our
          way through all opposition. We are like the barren Sahara, when we
          should be blooming like the garden of the Lord. We give to God pence,
          when he deserveth pounds; nay, deserveth our heart's blood to be
          coined in the service of his church and of his truth. Oh! we are but
          poor lovers of our sweet Lord Jesus; not fit to be his servants, much
          less to be his brides. If he had put us in the kitchen to be
          scullions, I fear we are scarce fit for the service; and yet he hath
          exalted us to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, married to
          him by a glorious marriage covenant. O brethren! God often calleth us
          to higher degrees of piety, and yet we will not come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, why is it that we permit the Lord to send for us so often,
          without going to him? Let your own heart give the reason, in a humble
          confession of your offenses. O my brethren, we never thought we should
          have been so bad as we are. If an angel had told us that we should be
          so indifferent towards Christ, we should have said, as Hazael did to
          Elisha, "Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" If
          any of us could have seen our own history written out by a prophet's
          pen, we should have said, "No; it cannot be. If Christ forgives me, I
          must love him; if he be pleased to make me his own brother, I must
          serve him; if I am the recipient of such splendid mercies, I must do
          something commensurate with his bounty." And yet, hitherto, here we
          have been ungrateful, unbelieving, and even refusing to listen to his
          call, or come at his bidding. He has said, "Seek ye my face;" and our
          heart did not say, "Lord, thy face will I seek." Because of all this,
          because we will not listen to the gentle call of God, there cometh
          trouble, just as there came the burning of the barley-field of Joab
          because he would not visit the young prince. Trouble comes in all
          sorts of shapes. Little doth it matter what form it cometh in, if it
          doth answer the purpose of making us obey the divine calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some Christians have their trial in the shape of sickness: they drag
          about with them a diseased body all their lives; or they are suddenly
          cast upon a bed of sickness, and they toss to and fro, by night and by
          day, in pain and weariness. This is God's medicine; and when God's
          children have it, let them not think it is sent to kill them, but to
          heal them. Much medicine which the physician gives makes the man ill
          for a time: he is worse with it than he would have been without it;
          but if he be a clever physician, he knows that this is the consequence
          of the medicine; and thus he is not at all alarmed by the pain of his
          patient, but he expects that all this will work for good, and hunt
          out, as it were, the original disease. When the Lord sends us sore
          sickness, it for a time perhaps makes our former spiritual infirmities
          grow worse; for sickness often provoketh impatience and murmurings
          against God, but in due time our proud spirits will be broken, and we
          shall cry for mercy. As a file takes off rust, so does sickness
          frequently remove our deadness of heart. The diamond hath much
          cutting, but its value is increased thereby; and so with the believer
          under the visitations of God. I have heard say of many ministers that
          they preach best after sickness, till their people have scarce
          regretted all the pains they have felt when they have found how savory
          and full of marrow have been their words. My brother, if you will not
          come to God without it, he will send you a sick-bed that you may be
          carried on it to him. If you will not come running, he will make you
          come limping. If you will not come while your eyes are bright and
          while your countenance is full of health, he will make you come when
          your eyes are dull and heavy, and your complexion is sallow and sad.
          But come you must; and if by no other means, sickness shall be the
          black chariot in which you shall ride.
        </p>

          Losses, too, are frequently the means God uses to fetch home his
          wandering sheep: like fierce dogs, they worry the wanderers back to
          the shepherd. There is no making lions tame if they are too well fed;
          they must be brought down from their great strength, and their
          stomachs must be lowered a bit, and then they will submit to the
          tamer's hand: and often have we seen the Christian rendered obedient
          to his Lord's will by straitness of bread and hard labor. When rich
          and increased in goods, many professors carry their heads much too
          loftily and speak much too boastfully. Like David, they boast, "My
          mountain standeth fast; it shall never be moved." When the Christian
          groweth wealthy, is in good repute, hath good health, and a happy
          family, he too often admits Mr. Carnal Security to feast at his table.
          If he be a true child of God, there is a rod preparing for him. Wait
          awhile, and it may be you will see his substance melt away as a dream.
          There goes a portion of his estate -- how soon the acres change hands!
          There goes a part of his business -- no profits will ever come to him
          again in that direction. That debt yonder, a dishonored bill over
          there -- how fast his losses come! where will they end? Now, as these
          embarrassments come in one after another, he begins to be distressed
          about them, and betakes himself to his God. O blessed waves, that wash
          the man on the rock of salvation! O blessed cords, though they may cut
          the flesh, if they draw us to Jesus! Losses in business are often
          sanctified to our soul's enriching. If you will not come to the Lord
          full-handed, you shall come empty. If God in his grace findeth no
          other means of making you to honor him among men -- if you cannot
          honor him on the pinnacle of riches -- he will bring you down to the
          valley of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bereavements, too, -- ah! what sharp cuts of the rod we get with
          these, my brethren! We know how the Lord sanctifies these to the
          bringing of his people near to himself. How glad we should be to think
          that Christ himself once suffered bereavements as we have done.
          Tacitus tells us that an amber ring was thought to be of no value
          among the Romans till the emperor took to wearing one, and then
          straightway an amber ring was held in high esteem. Bereavements might
          be looked upon as very sad things; but when we recollect that Jesus
          wept over his friend Lazarus, henceforth they are choice jewels, and
          special favors from God. Christ wore this ring: then I must not blush
          to wear it. Many a mother has been stirred up to a holier life by the
          death of her infant, -- many a husband has been led to give his heart
          more to Christ by the death of his wife. Do not departed spirits, like
          angels, beckon us up to heaven? "Come, come away," they say; "this is
          not your rest. I once could build upon the same tree, and sing upon
          the same bough; but now I am taken from you, -- now I rest in heaven.
          Come hither, thou who wast once my fond mate -- come hither, for all
          the trees where thou are building are marked for the axe; therefore
          come now, and dwell with me!" Yes, we must look upon our new-made
          graves in this light, and pray the Lord to dig our hearts with the
          funeral spade, and bury our sins as we bury our departed ones. Trials
          in your family, in your children, are another form of the burning
          barley-field. I do not know, brethren, but I think a living cross is
          much heavier to carry than a dead one. I know some among you who have
          not lost your children: I could have wished you had, for they have
          lived to be your grief and sorrow. Ah, young man! better that your
          mother should have seen you perish in the birth than that you should
          live to disgrace your father's name. Ah, man! it were better for you
          that the procession had gone winding through the streets, bearing your
          corpse down to the grave, than that you should live to blaspheme your
          mother's God, and laugh at the Book which is her treasure. It were
          better for you that you had never been born, and better for your
          parents too. Ah! but, dear friends, even these are meant to draw us
          nearer to Christ. We must not make idols of our children; and we dare
          not do it, when we see how manifestly God shows us that, like
          ourselves, they are by nature children of wrath. Sharper than an
          adder's tooth is an unthankful child; but the venom is turned to
          medicine in God's hand. God's birds would often keep down in the grass
          in their nests; but he fills their nests full of thorns, and then up
          they fly, and sing as a lark as they mount towards heaven. You must
          look upon these family trials as invitations from God -- sweet
          compulsion to make you seek his face. Many are afflicted in another
          way, which is perhaps as bad as anything else, -- by a deep depression
          of spirit. They are always melancholy; they know not why. There are no
          stars in the night for them, and the sun gives no light by day:
          melancholy has marked them for her own; but even this, I think, is
          often the means of keeping some of them nearer to God than they would
          be. You know there are some of our English plants which greatly affect
          damp, moist places under trees. If the sun were to shine in their
          faces they would die. Perhaps some minds are of the same order. Too
          many sweets make children sick, and bitters are a good tonic. A veil
          is needed for some delicate complexions, lest the sun look too
          fiercely on them: it may be, these mourners need the veil of sorrow.
          It is good that they have been afflicted, even with this heavy
          depression of spirit, because it keeps them near their God. Then there
          is that other affliction, the hiding of God's countenance -- how hard
          to bear, but how beneficial! If we will not keep near to our Lord, he
          is sure to hide his face. You have seen a mother walking out with her
          little child, when it has just learned to walk; and as she goes
          through the street, the little one is for running sometimes to the
          right, and sometimes to the left, and so the mother hides herself a
          moment; then the child looketh round for the mother, and begins to
          cry, and then out comes the mother. What is the effect? Why, it will
          not run away from the mother any more: it is sure to keep hold of her
          hand afterwards. So, when we get wandering from God, he hides his
          face, and then, since we have a love for him, we begin crying after
          him; and when he shows his face once more, we cling to him the more
          lovingly ever afterwards. So the Lord is pleased to bless our troubles
          to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Christian, what about all this? Why, just this. Are you under any
          sharp trouble now? Then I pray you go to God as Joab went to Absalom.
          "Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?" "Show me wherefore
          thou contendest with me." "Search me, O God, and know my heart; try
          me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me,
          and lead me in the way everlasting." Make this a special season of
          humbling and heart-searching. Now let every besetting sin be driven
          out. When God sweeps, do you search. When you are under the rod, it is
          yours to make a full confession of past offenses, and pray to be
          delivered from their power in the future. Or, have you no trial
          to-day, my brother? Then see if there be not something which may
          provoke God to send one, and begin now to purge yourself from all
          filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit by the Holy Ghost.
          Prevention is better than a cure; and sometimes a timely
          heart-searching may save us many a heart-smarting. Let us see to that,
          then. Or have we been afflicted, and is the affliction over now? Then,
          let us say with David, "Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now
          have I kept thy word." Let us bless God for all that he has done,
          saying "It is good for me that I have been afflicted;" let us join
          together in one common hymn of praise for all the loving-kindness
          which God has been pleased to show us in the sharp cuts of his rod. I
          have said enough, I think, to the Christian, to work out the little
          picture before us. God has burned your barley-field, dear friends: now
          go to him, and the closer you can approach to him, and the more firmly
          you can cling to him, the better for your soul's health and comfort
          all your life. At the last, you and I shall sing to the praise of our
          afflicting God.
        </p>
        <p>All I meet I find assists me</p>
        <p>In my path to heavenly joy;</p>
        <p>Where, though trials now attend me,</p>
        <p>Trials never more annoy.</p>
        <p>Blest there with a weight of glory,</p>
        <p>Still the path I'll ne'er forget,</p>
        <p>But, exulting, cry, It led me</p>
        <p>To my blessed Saviour's seat.</p>
        <p>
          II. A few words -- God make them mighty -- TO THE SINNER shall form
          the second part of our discourse. God also has sent for you. O
          unconverted man! God has often sent for you. Early in your childhood
          your mother's prayers sought to woo you to a Saviour's love, and your
          godly father's first instructions were as so many meshes of the net in
          which it was desired that you should be taken; but you have broken
          through all these, and lived to sin away early impressions and
          youthful promises. Since that you have often been called under the
          ministry. Our sermons have not been all shots wide of the mark, but
          sometimes a hot shot has burnt its way into your conscience and you
          have been made to tremble; but, alas! the trembling soon gave way
          before your old sins. Hitherto you have been called, but you refused.
          The hands of mercy have been stretched out, and you have not regarded
          them. You have had calls, too, from your Bible, from religious books,
          from Christian friends. Holy zeal is not altogether dead, and it shows
          itself by looking after your welfare. Young man, your shopmate has
          sometimes spoken to you; young woman, your companion has wept over
          you. There are some of you now present who have been called by the
          most loving of voices, in connection with our classes. Both in our
          Sunday-school and in the catechumenical classes there are men and
          women with deep love to the souls of those committed to them, --
          tender hearts, weeping eyes, -- and you have been wept over that you
          might come to Christ; but still all the agency that has been employed
          has been up to this moment without effect; you are a stranger to the
          God who made you, and an enemy to Christ the Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, if these gentle means will not do, God will employ other
          agencies. Perhaps he has tried them already. If not, -- if he
          intendeth in the divine decree your eternal salvation, -- he will, as
          sure as you are a living man, use stronger ways with you; and if a
          word will not do, he will come with a blow, though he loveth to try
          the power of the word first. You, too, my hearer unconverted and
          unsaved, have had your trials. You weep as well as Christians. You may
          not weep for sin, but sin shall make you weep. You may abhor
          repentance because of its sorrow, but you shall not escape sorrow,
          even if you escape repentance. you have had your sickness. Do you
          remember it, when in the silent night you heard the watch ticking out,
          as you thought, your last few minutes, and foretelling your doom? Do
          you remember those weary days, when you tossed from side to side, and
          did but shift the place and keep the pain? Man, can you recollect your
          vows, which you have lived to break, and your promises with which you
          lied unto the eternal God? Then the Sabbath would be your delight, you
          said, if you were spared, and the house of God and the people of God
          should be dear to you, and you would seek his face. But you have not
          done so: you have broken your covenant, and have despised your promise
          made to God. Or, what is it, have you had losses in business? You
          began life well and hopefully, but nothing has prospered with you. I
          am not sorry for it; for I remember it is the wicked who spreadeth
          himself like a green bay tree, and it is concerning the reprobate that
          it is written, "There are no bands in their death; but their strength
          is firm. They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they
          plagued like other men." I am glad that you are plagued. I would
          sooner see you whipped to heaven than coached to hell. Doubtless many
          go, like Agag, delicately to their hewing in pieces, while others go
          sorrowing to eternal glory. You have had losses: what are these but
          God's rough messengers to tell you that there is nothing beneath the
          sky worth living for, to wean you from the breasts of earth and cause
          you to look for something more substantial than worldly riches can
          afford you? And you, too, have lost friends; may I recall those
          graves, whose turf is yet so newly laid? May I remind you of children
          fair and beautiful in your eyes, taken away from you despite your
          tears? Shall I remind you of the parent who sleeps in Jesus? of a
          sweet sister who withered like a lily by early consumption? Shall I
          bring these thoughts back to you? I would not wish to make your wounds
          bleed afresh, but it is for your good that I bid you hearken to their
          solemn voice; for they say to you, "Come to your God. Be reconciled to
          him!" I do not think you ever will come to Jesus, unless the Holy
          Spirit shall employ trials to bring you. I find that the woman never
          found her piece of money till she swept the house. The prodigal never
          came back till he was hungry, and fain would have filled his belly
          with the husks which the swine did eat. I only hope that these
          troubles may be blessed to you. Besides this, you have had your
          depression of spirit. If I mistake not, I address some who are under
          such depressions now. You do not know how it is, but nothing is
          pleasant to you. You went to the theater last night. You wished you
          had not: it gave you no joy; and yet you have been as merry there as
          any, in former times. You go among your companions, and a day's
          pleasuring, as they call it, has become to you a very painful waste of
          time. You have lost the zest of life; and I am not sorry for it, if it
          should make you look for a better life, and trust in a world to come.
          My friends, again I say, this is the burning of your barley-fields.
          God has sent for you, and you would not come; and now he has sent
          messengers who are not so easily refused. He has sent these with
          sterner and rougher words, which speak to your flesh, if your spirit
          will not hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, now, what then? If God is sending these, are you listening to
          them? My hearer, if God has sent these, have you listened to them?
          There are some of you of whom I almost despair. God can save you, but
          I cannot tell you how he will do it. Certainly the Word does not seem
          likely to be blessed. You have been called and entreated; early and
          late we have entreated you. Our hearts have yearned with tenderness
          for you, but hitherto in vain. God knows I have been hammering away at
          the granite, and it has not yielded yet; I have smitten the flint, and
          it is not broken. Some of you all but break the plowshare: you are
          such rocks that it seems in vain to plow upon you. As for trouble, I
          do not see that that is likely to do you any good; for if you are
          smitten again, you will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick
          already, and the whole heart is faint. You have been beaten, till from
          the crown of the head to the sole of your foot there is nothing but
          wounds, bruises, and putrifying sores. You are poor -- perhaps your
          drunkenness has made you so; you have lost your wife -- perhaps your
          cruelty helped to kill her; you have lost your children, and you are
          left a penniless, friendless, helpless beggar, and yet you will not
          turn to God! What now is to be done unto you? O Ephraim! what shall I
          do unto thee? Shall I give thee up? How can I give thee up? "How shall
          I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim?" The heart of
          mercy still yearns after thee. Return thou! return thou! God help thee
          to return, even now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others of you have not suffered all this in the past, but are just now
          enduring a part of it. Let me entreat you, by the mercies of God and
          by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you despise not him who
          speaketh unto you. God doth not continue to send his messengers
          forever. After he hath labored with you for a time, he will leave you
          to cursing. Long-suffering lasts not forever. Mercy hath its day.
          Behold, the King runs up the white flag of comfort to-day, and he
          invites you to come unto him. To-morrow he may run up the red flag of
          threatening; and if that answereth not, if that red flag will not make
          you turn, he will run up the black flag of execution, and then there
          will be no hope. Beware! The black flag is not run up yet: the red
          flag is there now in trials and troubles, which are God's threatenings
          to you, bidding you open wide your heart that grace may enter; but if
          it cometh to this that the red flag fail, the black flag must come.
          Perhaps it has come! God help you with broken heart to cry unto him
          that you may be saved, before the candle is blown out and the sun is
          set, and the night of the dead is come on without the hope of another
          sun rising on a blessed resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the drift of all this? My drift is this: If, now, a word of
          mine could make you come to the King this morning -- I know it will
          not unless God the Holy Spirit compels you to do so by his
          irresistible power; but if he would bless it, I would rejoice as one
          who findeth great spoil. Wherefore do you stand out against God? If
          the Lord intendeth your eternal salvation, your resistance will be in
          vain; and how will you vex yourself in after years to think that you
          should have stood out so long! Wherefore dost thou resist? God's
          battering-ram is too mighty for the walls of your prejudice: he will
          make them fall yet. Why dost thou stand out against thy God, against
          him who loveth thee, who hath loved thee with an everlasting love, and
          redeemed thee by the blood of Christ? Why standest thou out against
          him who intends to lead thy captivity captive, and to make thee yet
          his rejoicing child? "Oh!" saith one, "if I thought there were such
          mercy as that, I would yield." If thou believest in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, this shall be an evidence that such mercy is ordained for
          thee. Oh that the Spirit of God would enable thee, sinner, to come
          just as thou art and put thy trust in Christ! If thou dost so, then it
          is certain that thy name is written in the Lamb's book of Life, that
          thou wast chosen of God and art precious to him, and that thy head is
          one on which the crown of immortality is to glitter forever. Oh that
          thou wouldst trust Christ! The joy and peace it works in the present
          is worth worlds; but oh the glory, the overwhelming glory which in
          worlds to come shall belong to those that trust in Jesus! God give you
          this morning to cast your souls upon the finished work of Jesus. His
          blood can cleanse; his righteousness can cover; his beauty can adorn;
          his prayer can preserve; his advent shall glorify; his heaven shall
          make you blessed. Trust him! God help you to trust him; and he shall
          have all the praise, both now and forever. Amen and amen.<br />
