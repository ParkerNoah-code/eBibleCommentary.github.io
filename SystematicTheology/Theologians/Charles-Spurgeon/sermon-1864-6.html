        <p>"He that endureth to the end shall be saved." -- Matthew 10:22.</p>
        <p>
          THIS PARTICULAR TEXT was originally addressed to the apostles when
          they were sent to teach and preach in the name of the Lord Jesus.
          Perhaps bright visions floated before their minds, of honor and esteem
          among men. It was no mean dignity to be among the twelve first heralds
          of salvation to the sons of Adam. Was a check needed to their high
          hopes? Perhaps so. Lest they should enter upon their work without
          having counted its cost, Christ gives them a very full description of
          the treatment which they might expect to receive, and reminds them
          that it was not the commencement of their ministry which would win
          them their reward, but "He that endureth to the end, the same shall be
          saved." It would be well if every youthful aspirant to the gospel
          ministry would remember this, if merely to put our hand to the plough
          proved us to be called of God, how many would he found so; but alas,
          too many look back and prove unworthy of the kingdom. The charge of
          Paul to Timothy, is a very necessary exhortation to every young
          minister: "Be thou faithful unto death." It is not to be faithful for
          a time, but to be "faithful unto death," which will enable a man to
          say, "I have fought a good fight." How many dangers surround the
          Christian minister! As the officers in an army are the chosen targets
          of the sharpshooters, so are the ministers of Christ. The king of
          Syria said to his servants, "Fight neither with small nor great, save
          only with the king of Israel;" even so the arch-fiend makes his main
          attack upon the ministers of God. From the first moment of his call to
          the work, the preacher of the Word will be familiar with temptation.
          While he is yet in his youth, there are multitudes of the softer
          temptations to turn the head and trip the feet of the youthful herald
          of the cross; and when the blandishments of early popularity have
          passed away, as soon they must, the harsh croak of slander, and the
          adder's tongue of ingratitude assail him, he finds himself stale and
          fiat where once he was flattered and admired; nay, the venom of malice
          succeeds to the honeyed morsels of adulation. Now, let him gird his
          loins and fight the good fight of faith. In his after days, to provide
          fresh matter Sabbath after Sabbath, to rule as in the sight of God, to
          watch over the souls of men, to weep with them who weep, to rejoice
          with those who do rejoice, to be a nursing father unto young converts,
          sternly to rebuke hypocrites, to deal faithfully with backsliders, to
          speak with solemn authority and paternal pathos to those who are in
          the first stages of spiritual decline, to carry about with him the
          care of the souls of hundreds, is enough to make him grow old while
          yet he is young, and to mar his visage with the lines of grief, till,
          like the Savior, at the age of thirty years, men shall count him
          nearly fifty. "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen
          Abraham?" said the adversaries of Christ to him when he was but
          thirty-two. If the minister should fall, my brethren; if, set upon a
          pinnacle, he should be cast down; if, standing in slippery places, he
          should falter; if the standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,
          what mischief is done to the Church, what shouts are heard among the
          adversaries, what dancings are seen among the daughters of Philistia!
          How hath God's banner been stained in the dust, and the name of Jesus
          cast into the mire! When the minister of Christ turns traitor, it is
          as if the pillars of the house did tremble; every stone in the
          structure feels the shock. If Satan can succeed in overturning the
          preachers of the Word, it is as if yon broad-spreading tree should
          suddenly fall beneath the axe; prone in the dust it lies to wither and
          to rot; but where are the birds of the air which made their nests
          among its boughs, and whither fly those beasts of the field which
          found a happy shadow beneath its branches? Dismay hath seized them,
          and they flee in affright. All who were comforted by the preacher's
          word, strengthened by his example, and edified by his teaching, are
          filled with humiliation and grief, crying, "Alas! my brother." By
          these our manifold dangers and weighty responsibilities, we may very
          justly appeal to you who feed under our ministry, and beseech you,
          "Brethren, pray for us." Well, we know that though our ministry be
          received of the Lord Jesus, if hitherto we have been kept faithful by
          the power of the Holy Ghost, yet it is only he who endureth to the end
          who shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my brethren, how glorious is the sight of the man who does endure
          to the end as a minister of Christ. I have photographed upon my heart
          just now, the portrait of one very, very dear to me, and I think I may
          venture to produce a rough sketch of him, as no mean example of how
          honorable it is to endure to the end. This man began while yet a youth
          to preach the Word. Sprung of ancestors who had loved the Lord and
          served his Church, he felt the glow of holy enthusiasm. Having proved
          his capabilities, he entered college, and after the close of its
          course, settled in a spot where for more than fifty years he continued
          his labors. In his early days, his sober earnestness and sound
          doctrine were owned of God in many conversions both at home and
          abroad. Assailed by slander and abuse, it was his privilege to live it
          all down. He outlived his enemies, and though he had buried a
          generation of his friends, yet he found many warm hearts clustering
          round him to the last. Visiting his flock, preaching in his own
          pulpit, and making very many journeys to other Churches, years
          followed one another so rapidly, that he found himself the head of a
          large tribe of children and grandchildren, most of them walking in the
          truth. At the age of fourscore years, he preached on still, until
          laden with infirmities, but yet as joyful and as cheerful as in the
          heyday of his youth, his time had come to die. He was able to say
          truthfully, when last he spake to me, "I do not know that my testimony
          for God has ever altered, as to the fundamental doctrines; I have
          grown in experience, but from the first day until now, I have had no
          new doctrines to teach my hearers. I have had to make no confessions
          of error on vital points, but have been held fast to the doctrines of
          grace, and can now say that I love them better than ever." Such an one
          was he, as Paul, the aged, longing to preach so long as his tottering
          knees could bear him to the pulpit. I am thankful that I had such a
          grandsire. He fell asleep in Christ but a few hours ago, and on his
          dying bed talked as cheerfully as men can do in the full vigor of
          their health. Most sweetly he talked of the preciousness of Christ,
          and chiefly of the security of the believer; the truthfulness of the
          promise; the immutability of the covenant; the faithfulness of God,
          and the infallibility of the divine decree. Among other things which
          he said at the last was this, which is, we think, worth your
          treasuring in your memories. "Dr Watts sings --
        </p>
        <p>'Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,</p>
        <p>My Lord, my hope, my trust.'</p>
        <p>
          What, Doctor, is it not firmer than that? Could you not find a better
          comparison? Why, the earth will give way beneath our feet one day or
          another, if we rest on it. The comparison will not do. The Doctor was
          much nearer the mark, when he said --
        </p>
        <p>"Firm as his throne his promise stands,</p>
        <p>And he can well secure</p>
        <p>What I've committed to his hands.</p>
        <p>'Till the decisive hour.'"</p>
        <p>
          "Firm as his throne," said he, "he must cease to be king before he can
          break his promise, or lose his people. Divine sovereignty makes us all
          secure." He fell asleep right quietly, for his day was over, and the
          night was come, what could he do better than go to rest in Jesus?
          Would God it may be our lot to preach the Word, so long as we breathe,
          standing fast unto the end in the truth of God; and if we see not our
          sons and grandsons testifying to those doctrines which are so dear to
          us, yet may we see our children walking in the truth. I know of
          nothing, dear friends, which I would choose to have, as the subject of
          my ambition for life, than to be kept faithful to my God to death,
          still to be a soul-winner, still to be a true herald of the cross, and
          testify the name of Jesus to the last hour. It is only such who in the
          ministry shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text, however, occurs again in the twenty-fourth chapter of
          Matthew, at the fourteenth verse, upon which occasion it was not
          addressed to the apostles, but to the disciples. The disciples,
          looking upon the huge stones which were used in the construction of
          the Temple, admired the edifice greatly, and expected their Lord to
          utter a few words of passing encomium; instead of which, he, who came
          not to be an admirer of architecture, but to hew living stones out of
          the quarry of nature, to build them up into a spiritual temple turned
          their remarks to practical account, by warning them of a time of
          affliction, in which there should be such trouble as had never been
          before, and he added, "No, nor ever shall be." He described false
          prophets as abounding, and the love of many as waxing cold, and warned
          them that "He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved." So
          that this solemn truth applies to every one of you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian man, though not called to the post of danger in
          witnessing publicly of the grace of God, is destined in his measure to
          testify concerning Jesus, and in his proper sphere and place, to be a
          burning and a shining light. He may not have the cares of a Church,
          but he hath far more, the cares of business: he is mixed up with the
          world; he is compelled to associate with the ungodly. To a great
          degree, he must, at least six days in the week, walk in an atmosphere
          uncongenial with his nature: he is compelled to hear words which will
          never provoke him to love and good works, and to behold actions whose
          example is obnoxious. He is exposed to temptations of every sort and
          size, for this is the lot of the followers of the Lamb. Satan knows
          how useful is a consistent follower of the Savior, and how much damage
          to Christ's cause an inconsistent professor may bring, and therefore
          he emptieth out all his arrows from his quiver that he may wound, even
          unto death, the soldier of the cross. My brethren, many of you have
          had a far longer experience than myself; you know how stern is the
          battle of the religious life, how you must contend, even unto blood,
          striving against sin. Your life is one continued scene of warfare,
          both without and within; perhaps even now you are crying with the
          apostle, "0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
          of this death?" A Christian's career is always fighting, never
          ceasing; always ploughing the stormy sea, and never resting till he
          reaches the port of glory. If my God shall preserve you, as preserve
          you he must, or else you are not his; if he shall keep you, as keep
          you he will if you have committed your souls to his faithful
          guardianship, what an honor awaits you! I have in my mind's eye, just
          now, one who has been for about sixty years associated with this
          Church, and who this week, full of years, and ripe for heaven, was
          carried by angels into the Savior's bosom. Called by divine grace,
          while yet young, he was united with the Christian Church early in
          life. By divine grace, he was enabled to maintain a consistent and
          honorable character for many years; as an officer of this Church, he
          was acceptable among his brethren, and useful both by his godly
          example and sound judgment; while in various parts of the Church of
          Christ, he earned unto himself a good degree. He went last Sabbath
          day, twice to the house of God where he was accustomed of late years
          to worship, enjoying the Word, and feasting at the Communion-table
          with much delight. He went to his bed without having any very serious
          illness upon him, having spent his last evening upon earth in cheerful
          conversation with his daughters. Ere the morning light, with his head
          leaning upon his hand, he had fallen asleep in Christ, having been
          admitted to the rest which remaineth for the people of God. As I think
          of my brother, though of late years I have seen but little of him, I
          can but rejoice in the grace which illuminated his pathway. When I saw
          him, the week before his departure, although full of years, there was
          little or no failure in mind. He was just the picture of an aged saint
          waiting for his Master, and willing to work in his cause while life
          remained. I refer, as most of you know, to Mr. Samuel Gale. Let us
          thank God and take courage -- thank God that he has preserved in this
          case, a Christian so many, many years, and take courage to hope that
          there will be found in this Church, many, at all periods, whose grey
          heads shall be crowns of glory. "He that endureth to the end," and
          only he "shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear friends, perseverance is not the lot of the few; it is not
          left to laborious preachers of the Word, or to consistent
          Church-officers, it is the common lot of every believer in the Church.
          It must be so, for only thus can they prove that they are believers.
          It must be so, for only by their perseverance can the promise be
          fulfilled, "He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved."
          Without perseverance, they cannot be saved; and, as saved they must
          be, persevere they shall through divine grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall now, with brevity and earnestness, as God enables me, speak
          upon our text thus: perseverance is the badge of saints -- the target
          of our foes -- the glory of Christ -- and the care of all believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, PERSEVERANCE IS THE BADGE OF TRUE SAINTS. It is their
          Scriptural mark. How am I to know a Christian? By his words? Well, to
          some degree, words betray the man; but a man's speech is not always
          the copy of his heart, for with smooth language many are able to
          deceive. What doth our Lord say? "Ye shall know them by their fruits."
          But how am I to know a man's fruits? By watching him one day? I may,
          perhaps, form a guess of his character by being with him for a single
          hour, but I could not confidently pronounce upon a man's true state
          even by being with him for a week. George Whitfield was asked what he
          thought of a certain person's character. "I have never lived with
          him," was his very proper answer. If we take the run of a man's life,
          say for ten, twenty, or thirty years, and, if by carefully watching,
          we see that he brings forth the fruits of grace through the Holy
          Spirit, our conclusion may be drawn very safely. As the truly
          magnetized needle in the compass, with many deflections, yet does
          really and naturally point to the pole; so, if I can see that despite
          infirmities, my friend sincerely and constantly aims at holiness, then
          I may conclude with something like certainty, that he is a child of
          God. Although works do not justify a man before God, they do justify a
          luau's profession before his fellows. I cannot tell whether you are
          justified in calling yourself a Christian except by your works; by
          your works, therefore, as James saith, shall ye be justified. You
          cannot by your words convince me that you are a Christian, much less
          by your experience, which I cannot see but must take on trust from
          you; but your actions will, unless you be an unmitigated hypocrite,
          speak the truth, and speak the truth loudly too. If your course is as
          the shining light which shineth more unto the perfect day, I know that
          yours is the path of the just. All other conclusions are only the
          judgment of charity such as we are bound to exercise; but this is as
          far as man can get it, the judgment of certainty when a man's life has
          been consistent through out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, analogy shows us that it is perseverance which must mark the
          Christian. How do I know the winner at the foot-race? There are the
          spectators, and there are the runners. What strong men! what
          magnificent muscles! what thews and sinews! Yonder is the goal, and
          there it is that I must judge who is the winner, not here, at the
          starting-point, for "They which run in a race run all, but one
          receiveth the prize." I may select this one, or that other person, as
          likely to win, but I cannot be absolutely sure until the race is over.
          There they fly! see how they press forward with straining muscles; but
          one has tripped, another faints, a third is out of breath, and others
          are far behind. One only wins -- and who is he? Why, he who continueth
          to the end, So I may gather from the analogy, which Paul constantly
          allows us, from the ancient games, that only he who continueth till he
          reaches the goal may be accounted a Christian at all. A ship starts on
          a voyage to Australia -- if it stops at Madeira, or returns after
          reaching the Cape, would you consider that it ought to be called an
          emigrant ship for New South Wales? It must go the whole voyage, or it
          does not deserve the name. A man has begun to build a house, and has
          erected one side of it -- do you consider him a builder if he stops
          there, and fails to cover it in or to finish the other walls? Do we
          give men praise for being warriors because they know how to make one
          desperate charge, but lose the campaign? Have we not, of late, smiled
          at the boasting despatches of commanders, in fights where both
          combatants fought with valor, and yet neither of them had the common
          sense to push on to reap the victory? What was the very strength of
          Wellington, but that when a triumph had been achieved, he knew how to
          reap the harvest which had been sown in blood? And he only is a true
          conqueror, and shall be crowned at the last, who continueth till war's
          trumpet is blown no more. It is with a Christian as it was with the
          great Napoleon: he said, "Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest
          must maintain me." So, under God, conquest has made you what you are,
          and conquest must sustain you. Your motto must be, "Excelsior;" or, if
          it be not, you know not the noble spirit of God's princes. But why do
          I multiply illustrations, when all the world rings with the praise of
          perseverance?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the common-sense judgment of mankind tells us, that those
          who merely begin and do not hold out, will not be saved. Why, if every
          man would be saved who began to follow Christ, who would be damned? In
          such a country as this, the most of men have at least one religious
          spasm in their lives. I suppose that there is not a person before me,
          who at some time or other did not determine to be a pilgrim. You, Mr.
          Pliable, were induced by a Christian friend, who had some influence
          with you, to go with him some short way, till you came to the Slough
          of Despond, and you thought yourself very wise when you scrambled out
          on that side which was nearest to your own home. And even you, Mr.
          Obstinate, are not always dogged; you have fits of thoughtfulness and
          intervals of tenderness. My hearer, how impressed you were at the
          prayer meeting! how excited you were at that revival service! When you
          heard a zealous brother preach at the theater what an impression was
          produced! Ah! yes; the shop was shut up for a Sunday or two; you did
          not swear or get drunk for nearly a month, but you could not hold on
          any longer. Now, if those who were to begin were saved, why you would
          be secure, though you are at the present time as far from anything
          like religion, as the darkness at midnight is from the blazing light
          of midday. Besides, common sense shows us, I say, that a man must hold
          on, or else he cannot be saved, because the very worst of men are
          those who begin and then give up. If you would turn over all the black
          pages of villany, to find the name of the son of perdition, where
          would you find it? Why, among the apostles. The man who had wrought
          miracles and preached the gospel, sold his Master for thirty pieces of
          silver -- Judas Iscariot, betrays the Son of Man with a kiss. Where is
          a worse name than that of Simon Magus? Simon "believed also," says the
          Scripture, and yet he offered the apostles money if they would sell to
          him the Holy Ghost. What an infamous notoriety Demas has obtained, who
          loved the present evil world! How much damage did Alexander the
          coppersmith do to Paul? "He did me much evil," said he, "the Lord
          reward him according to his works." And yet that Alexander was once
          foremost in danger, and even exposed his own person in the theater at
          Ephesus, that he might rescue the apostle. There are none so bad as
          those who once seemed to be good. "If the salt has lost its savor,
          wherewith shall it be seasoned?" That which is best when ripe, is
          worst when rotten; liquor which is sweetest in one stage, becomes
          sourest in another. Let not him that putteth on his armor boast as
          though he putteth it off; for even common sense teaches you, that it
          is not to begin, but to continue to the end which marks the time of
          the child of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we need not look to analogy and to mere common sense. Scripture is
          plain enough. What says John? "They went out from us." Why? Were they
          ever saints? Oh! no -- "They went out from us, because they were not
          of us, for if they had been of us, doubtless they would have continued
          with us, but they went out from us, that it might be manifest that
          they were not of us." They were no Christians, or else they had not
          thus apostatized. Peter saith, "It hath happened unto them according
          to the proverb, the dog hath returned to its vomit, and the sow that
          was washed to her wallowing in the mire," indicating at once most
          clearly that the dog, though it did vomit, always was a dog. When men
          disgorge their sins unwillingly, not giving them up because they
          dislike them, but because they cannot retain them; if a favorable time
          comes, they will return to swallow once more what they seemed to
          abandon. The sow that was washed -- ay, bring it into the parlour,
          introduce it among society; it was washed, and well-washed too;
          whoever saw so respectable a member of the honorable confraternity of
          swine before? Bring it in! Yes, but will you keep it there? Wait and
          see. Because you have not transformed it into a man, on the first
          occasion it will be found wallowing in the mire. Why? Because it was
          not a man, but a sow. And so we think we may learn from multitudes of
          other passages, if we had time to quote them, that those who go back
          into perdition are not saints at all, for perseverance is the badge of
          the righteous. "The righteous shalt hold on his way, and he that hath
          clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger." We not only get life by
          faith, but faith sustains it; "the just shall live by faith;" "but if
          any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
        </p>
        <p>
          What we have learned from Scripture, dear friends, has been abundantly
          confirmed by observation. Every day would I bless God that in so
          numerous a Church we have comparatively so few who have proved false;
          but I have seen enough, and the Lord knoweth, more than enough, to
          make me very jealous over you with a godly jealousy. I could tell of
          many an instance of men and women who did ran well. "What did hinder
          them that they should not obey the truth?" I remember a young man of
          whom I thought as favourably as of any of you, and I believe he did at
          that time deserve our favorable judgment. He walked among us, one of
          the most hopeful of our sons, and we hoped that God would make him
          serviceable to his cause. He fell into bad company. There was enough
          conscience left, after a long course of secret sin, to make him feel
          uncomfortable in his wickedness, though he did not give it up; and
          when at last his sin stared him in the face, and others knew it, so
          ashamed was he, that, though he bore the Christian name, he took
          poison that he might escape the shame which he had brought upon
          himself. He was rescued -- rescued by skill and the good providence of
          God; but where he is, and what he is, God only knoweth, for he had
          taken another poison more deadly still which made him the slave of his
          own lusts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not think it is the young alone, however. It is a very lamentable
          fact that there are, in proportion, more backslidings among the old
          than the young; and, if you want to find a great sinner in that
          respect, you will find him, surely, nine times out of ten, with grey
          hairs on his head. Have I not frequently mentioned that you do not
          find in Scripture, many cases of young people going astray. You do
          find believers sinning, but they were all getting old men. There is
          Noah -- no youth. There is Lot, when drunken -- no child. There is
          David with Bathsheba, -- no young man in the heat of passion. There is
          Peter denying his Lord -- no boy at the time. These were men of
          experience and knowledge and wisdom. "Let him that thinketh he
          standeth, take heed lest he fall."
        </p>
        <p>
          With sorrow do we remember one whom, years ago, we heard pray among
          us, and sweetly too; esteemed and trusted by us all. I remember a dear
          brother saying very kindly, but not too wisely, "If he is not a child
          of God, I am not." But what did be, my brethren, to our shame and
          sorrow, but go aside to the very worst and foulest of sins, and where
          is he now? Perhaps the ale-house may tell or worse places still. So
          have we seen, that earth's sun may be eclipsed, earth's stars may go
          out, and all human glory melt into shame. No true child of God
          perishes -- hold that fast; but this is the badge of a true child of
          God: that a man endures to the end; and if a man does not hold on, but
          slinks back to his old master, and once again fits on the old collar,
          and wears again the Satanic yoke, there is sure proof that he has
          never come out of the spiritual Egypt through Jesus Christ, his
          leader, and hath never obtained that eternal life which cannot die,
          because it is born of God. I have thus then, dear friends, said enough
          to prove, I think, beyond dispute, that the true badge of the
          Christian is perseverance, and that without it, no man has proved
          himself to be a child of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, PERSEVERANCE IS THEREFORE, THE TARGET OF ALL OUR
          SPIRITUAL ENEMIES.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have many adversaries. Look at the world! The world does not object
          to our being Christians for a time; it will cheerfully overlook all
          misdemeanors in that way, if we will now shake hands and be as we used
          to be. Your old companions who used to call you such good fellows,
          when you were bad fellows, would they not very readily forgive you for
          having been Christians, if you would just go back and be as in days
          gone by? Oh! certainly, they would look upon your religion as a freak
          of folly, but they would very easily overlook it, if you would give it
          up for the future. "O!" saith the world, "come back; come back to my
          arms once more; be enamored of me, and though thou hast spoken some
          hard words against me, and done some cruel deeds against me, I will
          cheerfully forgive thee." The world is always stabbing at the
          believer's perseverance. Sometimes she will bully him back; she will
          persecute him with her tongue -- cruel mockings shall be used; and at
          another time, she will cozen him, "Come thou back to me; O come thou
          back! Wherefore should we disagree? Thou art made for me, and I am
          made for thee!" And she beckons so gently and so sweetly, even as
          Solomon's harlot of old. This is the one thing with her, that thou
          shouldst cease to be a pilgrim, and settle down to buy and sell with
          her in Vanity Fair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your second enemy, the flesh. What is its aim? "Oh! " cries the flesh,
          "we have had enough of this; it is weary work being a pilgrim, come,
          give it up." Sloth says, "Sit still where thou art. Enough is as good
          as a feast, at least, of this tedious thing." Then, lust crieth, "Am I
          always to be mortified? Am I never to be indulged? Give me at least, a
          furlough from this constant warfare?" The flesh cares not how soft the
          chain, so that it does but hold us fast, and prevent our pressing on
          to glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes in the devil, and sometimes he beats the big drum, and
          cries with a thundering voice "There is no heaven; there is no God;
          you are a fool to persevere." Or, changing his tactics, he cries,
          "Come back! I will give thee a better treatment than thou hadst
          before. Thou thoughtest me a hard master, but that was
          misrepresentation; come and try me; I am a different devil from what I
          was ten years ago; I am respectable to what I was then. I do not want
          you to go back to the low theater or the casino; come with me, and be
          a respectable lover of pleasure. I tell thee, I can dress in broad
          cloth as well as in corderoy, and I can walk in the courts of kings,
          as well as in the courts and alleys of the beggar. O come back!" he
          saith, and make thyself one of mine." So that this hellish trinity,
          the world, tine flesh, and the devil, all stab at the Christian's
          perseverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          His perseverance in service they will frequently attack: "What profit
          is there is in serving God? The devil will say to me sometimes, as he
          did to Jonah, "Flee thou unto Tarshish, and do not stop in this
          Nineveh; they will not believe thy word, though thou speak in God's
          name?" To you he will say, "Why, you are so busy all the six days of
          the week, what is the good of spending your Sunday with a parcel of
          noisy brats in a Sunday School? Why go about with those tracts in the
          streets? Much good you will get from it. Would not you be better with
          having a little rest?" Ah! that word rest -- some of us are very fond
          of it; but we ought to recollect that we spoil it if we try to get it
          here, for rest is only beyond the grave. We shall have rest enough
          when once we come into the presence of our Lord. Perseverance in
          service, then, the devil would murder outright.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he cannot stay us in service, he will try to prevent our perse
          verance in suffering. "Why be patient any longer?" says he; "why sit
          on that dunghill, scraping your sores with a potsherd? -- curse God,
          and die. You have been always poor since you have been a Christian;
          your business does not prosper; you see, you cannot make money unless
          you do as others do. You must go with the times, or else you will not
          get on. Give it all up. Why be always suffering like this?" Thus the
          foul spirit tempts us. Or you may have espoused some good cause, and
          the moment you open your mouth, many laugh and try to put you down.
          "Well," says the devil, "be put down -- what is the use of it? Why
          make yourself singularly eccentric, and expose yourself to perpetual
          martyrdom? It is all very nice," saith he, "if you will be a martyr,
          to be burnt at once, and have done with it; but to hang, like Lord
          Cobham, to be roasted over a slow fire for days, is not comfortable.
          Why," saith the tempter, "why be always suffering -- give it up." You
          see, then, it is also perseverance in suffering which the devil
          shooteth at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, perhaps, it is perseverance in steadfastness. The love of many has
          waxed cold, but you remain zealous. "Well," saith he, "what is the
          good of your being so zealous? Other people are good enough people,
          you could not censure them: why do you want to be more righteous than
          they are? Why should you be pushing the Church before you, and
          dragging the world behind you? What need is there for you to go two
          marches in one day? Is not one enough? Do as the rest do; loiter as
          they do. Sleep as do others, and let your lamp go out as other virgins
          do." Thus is our perseverance in steadfastness frequently assailed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or else, it will be our doctrinal sentiments. "Why," says Satan, "do
          you hold to these denominational creeds? Sensible men are getting more
          liberal, they are giving away what does not belong to them -- God's
          truth; they are removing the old landmarks. Acts of uniformity are to
          be repealed, articles and creeds are to be laid aside as useless
          lumber, not necessary for this very enlightened age; fall in with
          this, and be an Anythingarian. Believe that black is white; hold that
          truth and a lie are very much akin to one another, and that it not
          does matter which we do believe, for we are all of us right, though we
          flatly contradict each other; that the Bible is a nose of wax to fit
          any face; that it does not teach anything material, but you may make
          it say anything you like. Do that," saith he, "and be no longer firm
          in your opinion."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have proved -- and need not waste more words about it --
          that perseverance is the target for all enemies. Wear your shield,
          Christian, therefore, close upon your armor, and cry mightily unto
          God, that by his Spirit you may endure to the end.
        </p>
        <p>III. Thirdly, brethren, PERSEVERANCE IS THE GLORY OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          That he makes all his people persevere to the end, is greatly to his
          honor. If they should fall away and perish, every office, and work,
          and attribute of Christ would be stained in the mire. If any one child
          of God should perish, where were Christ's covenant engagements? What
          is he worth as a mediator of the covenant and the surety of it, if he
          hath not made the promises sure to all the seed? My brethren, Christ
          is made a leader and commander of the people, to bring many souls into
          glory; but if he doth not bring them into glory, where is the
          captain's honor? Where is the efficacy of the precious blood, if it
          does not effectually redeem? If it only redeemeth for a time and then
          suffereth us to perish, where is its value? If it only blots out sin
          for a few weeks, and then perniits that sin to return and to remain
          upon us, where, I say, is the glory of Calvary, and where is the
          lustre of the wounds of Jesus? He lives, he lives to intercede, but
          how can I honor his intercession, if it be fruitless? Does he not
          pray, "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
          me where I am;" and if they be not finally brought to be with him
          where he is, where is the honor of his intercession? Hath not the
          Pleader failed, and the great Mediator been dismissed without success?
          Is he not at this day in union with his people? But what is the value
          of union to Christ, if that union does not insure salvation? Is he not
          to-day at the right hand of God, preparing a place for his saints; and
          will he prepare a place for them, and then lose them on the road? Oh!
          can it be that he procures the harp and the crown, and will not save
          souls to use them? My brethren, the perishing of one true child of
          God, would be such dishonor to Jesus, that I cannot think of it
          without considering it as blasphemy. One true believer in hell! Oh!
          what laughter in the pit -- what defiance, what unholy mirth! "Ah!
          Prince of life and glory," saith the prince of the pit, "I have
          defeated thee; I have snatched the prey from the mighty, and the
          lawful captive I have delivered; I have torn a jewel from thy crown.
          See, here it is! Thou didst redeem this soul with blood, and yet it is
          in hell." Hear what Satan cries -- "Christ suffered for this soul, and
          yet God makes it suffer for itself. Where is the justice of God?"
          Christ came from heaven to earth to save this soul, and failed in the
          attempt, and I have him here;" and as he plunges that soul into deeper
          waves of woe, the shout of triumph goes up more and more blasphemously
          -- "We have conquered heaven! We have rent the eternal covenant; we
          have foiled the purposes of God; we have defeated his decree; we have
          triumphed over the power of the Mediator, and cast his blood to the
          ground!" Shall it ever be? Atrocious question! It can never be. They
          who are in Christ are saved. They whom Jesus Christ hath really taken
          into union with himself, shall be with him where he is. But how are
          you to know whether you are in union with Christ? My brethren, you can
          only know it by obeying the apostle's words, "Give all diligence to
          make your calling and election sure."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I close, therefore, with but a hint on the last point,
          PERSEVERANCE SHOULD BE THE GREAT CARE OF EVERY CHRISTIAN -- his daily
          and his nightly care. O beloved! I conjure you by the love of God, and
          by the love of your own souls, be faithful unto death. Have you
          difficulties? You must conquer them. Hannibal crossed the Alps, for
          his heart was full of fury against Rome; and you must cross the Alps
          of difficulty, for I trust your heart is full of hatred of sin. When
          Mr. Smeaton had built the lighthouse upon the Eddystone, he looked out
          anxiously after a storm to see if the edifice was still there, and it
          was his great joy when he could see it still standing, for a former
          builder had constructed an edifice which he thought to be
          indestructible, and expressed a wish that he might be in it in the
          worst storm which ever blew, and he was so, and neither himself nor
          his lighthouse were ever seen afterwards. Now you have to be exposed
          to multitudes of storms; you must be in your lighthouse in the worst
          storm which ever blew; build firmly then on the Rock of Ages, and make
          sure work for eternity, for if you do these things, ye shall never
          fall. For this Church's sake, I pray you do it; for nothing can
          dishonor and weaken a Church so much as the falls of professors. A
          thousand rivers flow to the sea, and make rich the meadows, but no man
          heareth the sound thereof; but if there be one cataract, its roaring
          will be heard for miles, and every traveler will mark the fall. A
          thousand Christians can scarcely do such honor to their Master as one
          hypocrite can do dishonor to him. If you have ever tasted that the
          Lord is gracious, pray that your foot slip not. It would be infinitely
          better to bury you in the earth than see you buried in sin. If I must
          be lost, God grant it may not be as an apostate. If I must, after all,
          perish, were it not better never to have known the way of
          righteousness than after having known the theory of it, and something
          of the enjoyment of it, turn again to the beggarly elements of the
          world? Let your prayer be not against death, but against sin. For your
          own sake, for the Church's sake, for the name of Christ's sake, I pray
          you do this. But ye cannot persevere except by much watchfulness in
          the closet, much carefulness over every action, much dependance upon
          the strong hand of the Holy Spirit who alone can make you stand. Walk
          and live as in the sight of God, knowing where your great strength
          lieth, and depend upon it you shall yet sing that sweet doxology in
          Jude, "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
          present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
          joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion
          and power, both now and ever. Amen." A simple faith brings the soul to
          Christ, Christ keeps the faith alive; that faith enables the believer
          to persevere, and so he enters heaven. May that be your lot and mine
          for Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
