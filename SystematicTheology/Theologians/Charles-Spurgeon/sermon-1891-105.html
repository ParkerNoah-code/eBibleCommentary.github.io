          1. Vain, too, is [the effort of] Marcion and his followers when they
          [seek to] exclude Abraham from the inheritance, to whom the Spirit
          through many men, and now by Paul, bears witness, that "he believed
          God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness." And the Lord
          [also bears witness to him,] in the first place, indeed, by raising up
          children to him from the stones, and making his seed as the stars of
          heaven, saying, "They shall come from the east and from the west, from
          the north and from the south, and shall recline with Abraham, and
          Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;" and then again by saying
          to the Jews, "When ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all
          the prophets in the kingdom of heaven, but you yourselves cast out."
          This, then, is a clear point, that those who disallow his salvation,
          and frame the idea of another God besides Him who made the promise to
          Abraham, are outside the kingdom of God, and are disinherited from
          [the gift of] incorruption, setting at naught and blaspheming God, who
          introduces, through Jesus Christ, Abraham to the kingdom of heaven,
          and his seed, that is, the Church, upon which also is conferred the
          adoption and the inheritance promised to Abraham.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For the Lord vindicated Abraham's posterity by loosing them from
          bondage and calling them to salvation, as He did in the case of the
          woman whom He healed, saying openly to those who had not faith like
          Abraham, "Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the Sabbath-days
          loose his ox or his ass, and lead him away to watering? And ought not
          this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound these
          eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath-days?" It is
          clear therefore, that He loosed and vivified those who believe in Him
          as Abraham did, doing nothing contrary to the law when He healed upon
          the Sabbath-day. For the law did not prohibit men from being healed
          upon the Sabbaths; [on the contrary,] it even circumcised them upon
          that day, and gave command that the offices should be performed by the
          priests for the people; yea, it did not disallow the healing even of
          dumb animals. Both at Siloam and on frequent subsequent occasions, did
          He perform cures upon the Sabbath; and for this reason many used to
          resort to Him on the Sabbath-days. For the law commanded them to
          abstain from every servile work, that is, from all grasping after
          wealth which is procured by trading and by other worldly business; but
          it exhorted them to attend to the exercises of the soul, which consist
          in reflection, and to addresses of a beneficial kind for their
          neighbours' benefit. And therefore the Lord reproved those who
          unjustly blamed Him for having healed upon the Sabbath-days. For He
          did not make void, but fulfilled the law, by performing the offices of
          the high priest, propitiating God for men, and cleansing the lepers,
          healing the sick, and Himself suffering death, that exiled man might
          go forth from condemnation, and might return without fear to his own
          inheritance.

          3. And again, the law did not forbid those who were hungry on the
          Sabbath-days to take food lying ready at hand: it did, however, forbid
          them to reap and to gather into the barn. And therefore did the Lord
          say to those who were blaming His disciples because they plucked and
          ate the ears of corn, rubbing them in their hands, "Have ye not read
          this, what David did, when himself was an hungered; how he went into
          the house of God, and ate the shew-bread, and gave to those who were
          with him; which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests alone?"
          justifying His disciples by the words of the law, and pointing out
          that it was lawful for the priests to act freely. For David had been
          appointed a priest by God, although Saul persecuted him. For all the
          righteous possess the sacerdotal rank. And all the apostles of the
          Lord are priests, who do inherit here neither lands nor houses, but
          serve God and the altar continually. Of whom Moses also says in
          Deuteronomy, when blessing Levi, "Who said unto his father and to his
          mother, I have not known thee; neither did he acknowledge his
          brethren, and he disinherited his own sons: he kept Thy commandments,
          and observed Thy covenant." But who are they that have left father and
          mother, and have said adieu to all their neighbours, on account of the
          word of God and His covenant, unless the disciples of the Lord? Of
          whom again Moses says, "They shall have no inheritance, for the Lord
          Himself is their inheritance." And again, "The priests the Levites
          shall have no part in the whole tribe of Levi, nor substance with
          Israel; their substance is the offerings (fructifications) of the
          Lord: these shall they eat." Wherefore also Paul says, "I do not seek
          after a gift, but I seek after fruit." To His disciples He said, who
          had a priesthood of the Lord, to whom it was lawful when hungry to eat
          the ears of corn, "For the workman is worthy of his meat." And the
          priests in the temple profaned the Sabbath, and were blameless.
          Wherefore, then, were they blameless? Because when in the temple they
          were not engaged in secular affairs, but in the service of the Lord,
          fulfilling the law, but not going beyond it, as that man did, who of
          his own accord carried dry wood into the camp of God, and was justly
          stoned to death. "For every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit
          shall be hewn down, and cast into the fire;" and "whosoever shall
          defile the temple of God, him shall God defile." <br />
