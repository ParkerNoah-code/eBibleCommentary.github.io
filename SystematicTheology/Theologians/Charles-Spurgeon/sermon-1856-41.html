        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>No.95</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 10, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |This shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement
          for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.| --
          Leviticus 16:34.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews had many striking ceremonies which marvellously set forth the
          death of Jesus Christ as the great expiation of our guilt and the
          salvation of our souls. One of the chief of these was the day of
          atonement, which I believe was pre-eminently intended to typify that
          great day of vengeance of our God, which was also the great day of
          acceptance of our souls, when Jesus Christ |died, the just for the
          unjust, to bring us to God.| That day of atonement happened only once
          a year, to teach us that only once should Jesus Christ die; and that
          though he would come a second time, yet it would be without a sin
          offering unto salvation. The lambs were perpetually slaughtered;
          morning and evening they offered sacrifice to God, to remind the
          people that they always needed a sacrifice; but the day of atonement
          being the type of the one great propitiation, it was but once a year
          that the high priest entered within the vail with blood as the
          atonement for the sins of the people. And this was on a certain set
          and appointed time; it was not left to the choice of Moses, or to the
          convenience of Aaron, or to any other circumstance which might affect
          the date; it was appointed to be on a peculiar set day, as you find at
          the 29th verse: |In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month;|
          and at no other time was the day of atonement to be, to show us that
          God's great day of atonement was appointed and predestinated by
          himself. Christ's expiation occurred but once, and then not by any
          chance; God had settled it from before the foundation of the world;
          and at that hour when God had predestinated, on that very day that God
          had decreed that Christ should die, was he led like a lamb to the
          slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers he was dumb. It was but
          once a year, because the sacrifice should be once; it was at an
          appointed time in the year, because in the fulness of time Jesus
          Christ should come into the world to die for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall invite your attention to the ceremonies of this solemn
          day, taking the different parts in detail. First, we shall consider
          the person who made the atonement; secondly, the sacrifice whereby the
          atonement was typically made; thirdly, the effects of the atonement;
          and fourthly, our behaviour on the recollection of the atonement, as
          well set forth by the conduct prescribed to the Israelites on that
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE PERSON WHO WAS TO MAKE THE ATONEMENT. And at the outset,
          we remark that Aaron, the high priest, did it. |Thus shall Aaron come
          into the holy place; with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a
          ram for a burnt offering.| Inferior priests slaughtered lambs; other
          priests at other times did almost all the work of the sanctuary; but
          on this day nothing was done by any one, as a part of the business of
          the great day of atonement, except by the high priest. Old rabbinical
          traditions tell us that everything on that day was done by him, even
          the lighting of the candles, and the fires, and the incense, and all
          the offices that were required, and that, for a fortnight beforehand,
          he was obliged to go into the tabernacle to slaughter the bullocks and
          assist in the work of the priests and Levites, that he might be
          prepared to do the work which was unusual to him. All the labour was
          left to him. So, beloved, Jesus Christ, the High Priest, and he only,
          works the atonement. There are other priests, for |he hath made us
          priests and kings unto God.| Every Christian is a priest to offer
          sacrifice of prayer and praise unto God, but none save the High Priest
          must offer atonement; he, and he alone, must go within the vail; he
          must slaughter the goat and sprinkle the blood; for though
          thanksgiving is shared in by all Christ's elect body, atonement
          remains alone to him, the High Priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it is interesting to notice, that the high priest on this day was
          a humbled priest. You read in the 4th verse, |He shall put on the holy
          linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and
          shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with linen mitre shall he be
          attired: these are holy garments.| On other days he wore what the
          people were accustomed to call the golden garments; he had the mitre
          with a plate of pure gold around his brow, tied with brilliant blue;
          the splendid breastplate, studded with gems, adorned with pure gold
          and set with precious stones; the glorious ephod, the tinkling bells,
          and all the other ornaments, wherewith he came before the people as
          the accepted high priest. But on this day he had none of them. The
          golden mitre was laid aside, the embroidered vest was put away, the
          breastplate was taken off, and he came out simply with the holy linen
          coat, the linen breeches, the linen mitre, and girded with a linen
          girdle. On that day he humbled himself just as the people humbled
          themselves. Now, that is a notable circumstance. You will see sundry
          other passages in the references which will bear this out, that the
          priest's dress on this day was different. As Mayer tells us, he wore
          garments, and glorious ones, on other days, but on this day he wore
          four humble ones. Jesus Christ, then, when he made atonement, was a
          humbled priest. He did not make atonement arrayed in all the glories
          of his ancient throne in heaven. Upon his brow there was no diadem,
          save the crown of thorns; around him was cast no purple robe, save
          that which he wore for a time in mockery; on his head was no sceptre,
          save the reed which they thrust in cruel contempt upon him; he had no
          sandals of pure gold, neither was he dressed as king; he had none of
          those splendours about him which should make him mighty and
          distinguished among men; he came out in his simple body, ay, in his
          naked body, for they stripped off even the common robe from him, and
          made him hang before God's sun and God's universe, naked, to his
          shame, and to the disgrace of those who chose to do so cruel and
          dastardly a deed. Oh! my soul, adore thy Jesus, who when he made
          atonement, humbled himself and wrapped around him a garb of thine
          inferior clay. Oh! angels, ye can understand what were the glories
          that he laid aside. Oh! thrones, and principalities, and powers, ye
          can tell what was the diadem with which he dispensed, and what, the
          robes he laid aside to wrap himself in earthly garbs. But, men, ye can
          scarce tell how glorious is your High Priest now, and ye can scarce
          tell how glorious he was before. But oh! adore him, for on that day it
          was the simple clean linen of his own body, of his own humanity, in
          which he made atonement for your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, the high priest who offered the atonement must be a
          spotless high priest; and because there were none such to be found,
          Aaron being a sinner himself as well as the people, you will remark
          that Aaron had to sanctify himself and make atonement for his own sin
          before he could go in to make an atonement for the sins of the people.
          In the 3rd verse you read, |Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place:
          with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt
          offering.| These were for himself. In the 6th verse it is said, |And
          Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for
          himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.| Yea,
          more, before he went within the vail with the blood of the goat which
          was the atonement for the people, he had to go within the vail to make
          atonement there for himself. In the 11th, 12th, and 13th verses, it is
          said, |And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is
          for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his
          house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering, which is for
          himself. And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
          off the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense
          beaten small, and bring it within the vail. And he shall put the
          incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense
          may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not.|
          |And he shall take of the blood of the bullock (that is, the bullock
          that he killed for himself), and sprinkle it with his finger upon the
          mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of
          the blood with his finger seven times.| This was before he killed the
          goat, for it says, |Then shall he kill the goat.| Before he took the
          blood which was a type of Christ within the vail, he took the blood
          (which was a type of Christ in another sense), wherewith he purified
          himself. Aaron must not go within the vail until by the bullock his
          sins had been typically expiated, nor even then without the burning
          smoking incense before his face, lest God should look on him, and he
          should die, being an impure mortal. Moreover, the Jews tell us that
          Aaron had to wash himself, I think, five times in the day; and it is
          said in this chapter that he had to wash himself many times. We read
          in the 4th verse, |These are holy garments; therefore shall he wash
          his flesh in water, and so put them on.| And at the 24th verse, |He
          shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his
          garments.| So you see it was strictly provided for that Aaron on that
          day should be a spotless priest. He could not be so as to nature, but,
          ceremonially, care was taken that he should be clean. He was washed
          over and over again in the sacred bath. And besides that, there was
          the blood of the bullock and the smoke of the incense, that he might
          be acceptable before God. Ah! beloved, and we have a spotless High
          Priest; we have one who needed no washing, for he had no filth to wash
          away; we have one who needed no atonement for himself, for he, for
          ever, might have sat down at the right hand of God, and ne'er have
          come on earth at all. He was pure and spotless; he needed no incense
          to wave before the mercy seat to hide the angry face of justice; he
          needed nothing to hide and shelter him; he was all pure and clean. Oh!
          bow down and adore him, for if he had not been a holy High Priest, he
          could never have taken thy sins upon himself, and never have made
          intercession for thee. Oh! reverence him, that, spotless as he was, he
          should come into this world and say, |For this cause I sanctify
          myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.| Adore and
          love him, the spotless High Priest, who, on the day of atonement took
          away thy guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the atonement was made by a solitary high priest -- alone and
          unassisted. You read in the 17th verse, |And there shall be no man in
          the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an
          atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an
          atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the
          congregation of Israel.| No other man was to be present, so that the
          people might be quite certain that everything was done by the high
          priest alone. It is remarkable, as Matthew Henry observes, that no
          disciple died with Christ. When he was put to death, his disciples
          forsook him and fled; they crucified none of his followers with him,
          lest any should suppose that the disciple shared the honor of
          atonement. Thieves were crucified with him because none would suspect
          that they could assist him; but if a disciple had died, it might have
          been imagined that he had shared the atonement. God kept that holy
          circle of Calvary select to Christ, and none of his disciples must go
          to die there with him. O glorious High Priest, thou hast done it all
          alone. O, glorious antitype of Aaron, no son of thine stood with thee;
          no Eliezer, no Phineas, burned incense; there was no priest, no Levite
          save himself. |I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people
          there was none with me.| Then give all the glory unto his holy name,
          for alone and unassisted he made atonement for your guilt. The bath of
          his blood is your only washing; the stream of water from his side is
          your perfect purification. None but Jesus, none but Jesus, has wrought
          out the work of our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it was a laborious high priest who did the work on that day. It
          is astonishing how, after comparative rest, he should be so accustomed
          to his work as to be able to perform all that he had to do on that
          day. I have endeavoured to count up how many creatures he had to kill,
          and I find that there were fifteen beasts which he slaughtered at
          different times, besides the other offices, which were all left to
          him. In the first place, there were the two lambs, one offered in the
          morning, and the other in the evening; they were never omitted, being
          a perpetual ordinance. On this day the high priest killed those two
          lambs. Further, if you will turn to Numbers xxix.7-11, |And ye shall
          have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and
          ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work therein: But ye
          shall offer a burnt unto the Lord for a sweet savour; one young
          bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be
          unto you without blemish: And their meat offering shall be of flour
          mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals
          to one ram. A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven
          lambs: One kid of the goats for a sin offering: besides the sin
          offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meat
          offering of it, and their drink offerings.| Here, then, was one
          bullock, a ram, seven lambs, and a kid of the goats; making ten. The
          two lambs made twelve. And in the chapter we have been studying, it is
          said in the 3rd verse: |Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place:
          with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt
          offering;| which makes the number fourteen. Then, after that, we find
          there were two goats, but only one of them was killed, the other being
          allowed to go away. Thus, then, there were fifteen beasts to be
          slaughtered, besides the burnt offerings of thanksgiving which were
          offered by way of showing that the people now desired to dedicate
          themselves to the Lord from gratitude, that the atonement of sin
          offering had been accepted. He who was ordained priest in Jeshurun,
          for that day, toiled like a common Levite, worked as laboriously as
          priest could do, and far more so than on any ordinary day. Just so
          with our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, what a labour the atonement was to
          him! It was a work that all the hands of the universe could not have
          accomplished; yet he completed it alone. It was a work more laborious
          than the treading of the wine-press, and his frame, unless sustained
          by the divinity within, could scarce have borne such stupendous
          labour. There was the bloody sweat in Gethsemane; there was the
          watching all night, just as the high priest did for fear that
          uncleanness might touch him; there was the hooting and the scorn which
          he suffered every day before -- something like the continual offering
          of the Lamb; then there came the shame, the spitting, the cruel
          flagellations in Pilate's hall; then there was the via dolorosa
          through Jerusalem's sad streets; then came the hanging on the cross,
          with the weight of his people's sins on his shoulders. Ay, it was a
          Divine labour that our great High Priest did on that day -- a labour
          mightier than the making of the world: it was the new making of a
          world, the taking of its sins upon his Almighty shoulders and casting
          them into the depths of the sea. The atonement was made by a toilsome
          laborious High Priest, who worked, indeed, that day; and Jesus,
          thought he had toiled before, yet never worked as he did on that
          wondrous day of atonement.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus have I led you to consider the person who made the atonement:
          let us now consider for a moment or two THE MEANS WHEREBY THIS
          ATONEMENT WAS MADE. You read at the 5th verse, |And he shall take of
          the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a
          sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.| And at the 7th, 8th,
          9th, and 10th verses, |And he shall take the two goats, and present
          them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the
          congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot
          for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall
          bring the goat upon which the Lord's lot fell, and offer him for a sin
          offering. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat,
          shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with
          him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.| The first
          goat I considered to be the great type of Jesus Christ the atonement:
          such I do not consider the scapegoat to be. The first is a type of the
          means whereby the atonement was made, and we shall keep to that first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that this goat, of course, answered all the pre-requisites of
          every other thing that was sacrificed; it must be a perfect,
          unblemished goat of the first year. Even so was our Lord a perfect
          man, in the prime and vigour of his manhood. And further, this goat
          was an eminent type of Christ from the fact that it was taken of the
          congregation of the children of Israel, as we are told at the 5th
          verse. The public treasury furnished the goat. So, beloved, Jesus
          Christ was, first of all, purchased by the public treasury of the
          Jewish people before he died. Thirty pieces of silver they had valued
          him at, a goodly price; and as they had been accustomed to bring the
          goat, so they brought him to be offered: not, indeed, with the
          intention that he should be their sacrifice, but unwittingly they
          fulfilled this when they brought him to Pilate, and cried, |Crucify
          him, crucify him!| Oh, beloved! Indeed, Jesus Christ came out from the
          midst of the people, and the people brought him. Strange that it
          should be so! |He came unto his own, and his own received him not;|
          his own led him forth to slaughter; his own dragged him before the
          mercy seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, again, that though this goat, like the scapegoat, was brought by
          the people, God's decision was in it still. Mark, it is said, |Aaron
          shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the Lord, and the
          other lot for the scapegoat.| I conceive this mention of lots is to
          teach that although the Jews brought Jesus Christ of their own will to
          die, yet, Christ had been appointed to die; and even the very man who
          sold him was appointed to it -- so saith the Scripture. Christ's death
          was fore-ordained, and there was not only man's hand in it, but God's.
          |The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of
          the Lord.| So it is true that man put Christ to death, but it was of
          the Lord's disposal that Jesus Christ was slaughtered, |the just for
          the unjust, to bring us to God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, behold the goat that destiny has marked out to make the
          atonement. Come and see it die. The priest stabs it. Mark it in its
          agonies; behold it struggling for a moment; observe the blood as it
          gushes forth. Christians, ye have here your Saviour. See his Father's
          vengeful sword sheathed in his heart; behold his death agonies; see
          the clammy sweat upon his brow; mark his tongue cleaving to the roof
          of his mouth; hear his sighs and groans upon the cross; hark to his
          shriek, |Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,| and you have more now to think
          of than you could have if you only stood to see the death of a goat
          for your atonement. Mark the blood as from his wounded hands it flows,
          and from his feet it finds a channel to the earth; from his open side
          in one great river see it gush. As the blood of the goat made the
          atonement typically, so, Christian, thy Saviour dying for thee, made
          the great atonement for thy sins, and thou mayest go free.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mark, this goat's blood was not only shed for many for the
          remission of sins as a type of Christ, but that blood was taken within
          the vail, and there it was sprinkled. So with Jesus's blood,
          |Sprinkled now with blood the throne.| The blood of other beasts (save
          only of the bullock) was offered before the Lord, and was not brought
          into the most holy place; but this goat's blood was sprinkled on the
          mercy seat, and before the mercy seat, to make an atonement. So, O
          child of God, thy Saviour's blood has made atonement within the vail;
          he has taken it there himself; his own merits and his own agonies are
          now within the vail of glory, sprinkled now before the throne. O
          glorious sacrifice, as well as High Priest, we would adore thee, for
          by thy one offering hot hast made atonement for ever, even as this one
          slaughtered goat made atonement once in a year for the sins of all the
          people.
        </p>
        <p>III. We now come to the EFFECTS.</p>
        <p>
          One of the first effects of the death of this goat was sanctification
          of the holy things which had been made unholy. You read at the end of
          the 15th verse, |He shall sprinkle it upon the mercy seat: and he
          shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness
          of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all
          their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation,
          that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.| The holy
          place was made unholy by the people. Where God dwelt should be holy,
          but where man comes there must be some degree of unholiness. This
          blood of the goat made the unholy place holy. It was a sweet
          reflection to me as I came here this morning. I thought, |I am going
          to the house of God, and that house is a holy place;| but when I
          thought how many sinners had trodden its floors, how many unholy ones
          had joined in its songs, I thought, |Ah! it has been made defiled; but
          oh! there is no fear, for the blood of Jesus has made it holy again.|
          |Ah!| I thought, |there is our poor prayer that we shall offer: it is
          a holy prayer, for God the Holy Spirit dictates it, but then it is an
          unholy prayer, for we have uttered it, and that which cometh out of
          unholy lips like ours, must be tainted.| |But ah!| I thought again,
          |it is a prayer that has been sprinkled with blood, and therefore it
          must be a holy prayer.| And as I looked on all the harps of this
          sanctuary, typical of your praises, and on all the censers of this
          tabernacle, typical of your prayers, I thought within myself, |There
          is blood on them all; our holy service this day has been sprinkled
          with the blood of the great Jesus, and as such it will be accepted
          through him.| Oh! beloved, it is not sweet to reflect that our holy
          things are now really holy; that through sin is mixed with them all,
          and we think them defiled, yet they are not, for the blood has washed
          out every stain; and the service this day is as holy in God's sight as
          the service of the cherubim, and is acceptable as the psalms of the
          glorified; we have washed our worship in the blood of the Lamb, and it
          is accepted through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But observe, the second great fact was that their sins were taken
          away. This was set forth by the scapegoat. You read at the 20th, |And
          when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the
          tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live
          goat: And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
          goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of
          Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them
          upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a
          fit man into the wilderness: And the goat shall bear upon him all
          their iniquities unto a land not inhabited, and he shall let go the
          goat in the wilderness.| When that was done, you see, the great and
          wonderful atonement was finished, and the effects of it were set forth
          to the people. Now, I do not know how many opinions there are about
          this scapegoat. One of the most strange opinions to me is that which
          is held by a very large portion of learned men, and I see it is put in
          the margin of my Bible. Many learned men thing that this word
          scapegoat, Azazel, was the name of the devil who was worshipped by the
          heathen in the form of a goat; and they tell us that the first goat
          was offered to God as an atonement for sin, and the other went away to
          be tormented by the devil, and was called Azazel, just as Jesus was
          tormented by Satan in the wilderness. To this opinion, it is enough to
          object that it is difficult to conceive when the other goat was
          offered to God, this should be sent among demons. Indeed, the opinion
          is too gross for belief. It needs only to be mentioned to be refuted.
          Now the first goat is the Lord Jesus Christ making atonement by his
          death for the sins of the people; the second is sent away into the
          wilderness, and nothing is heard of it any more for ever; and here a
          difficulty suggests itself -- |Did Jesus Christ go where he was never
          heard of any more for ever?| That is what we have not to consider al
          all. The first goat was a type of the atonement; the second is the
          type of the effect of the atonement. The second goat went away, after
          the first was slaughtered, carrying the sins of the people on its
          head, and so it sets froth, as a scapegoat, how our sins are carried
          away into the depth of the wilderness. There was this year exhibited
          in the Art Union a fine picture of the scapegoat dying in the
          wilderness: it was represented with a burning sky above it, its feet
          sticking in the mire, surrounded by hundreds of skeletons, and there
          dying a doleful and miserable death. Now, that was just a piece of
          gratuitous nonsense, for there is nothing the Scripture that warrants
          it in the least degree. The rabbis tell us that this goat was taken by
          a man into the wilderness and here tumbled down a high rock to die;
          but, as an excellent commentator says, if the man did push it down the
          rock he more than God ever told him to do. God told him to take a goat
          and let it go: as to what became of it neither you nor I know
          anything; that is purposely left. Our Lord Jesus Christ has taken away
          our sins upon his head, just as the scapegoat, and he is gone from us
          -- that is all: the goat was not a type in its dying, or in regard to
          its subsequent fate. God has only told us that it should be taken by
          the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. The most correct account
          seems to be that of one Rabbi Jarchi, who says that they generally
          took the goat twelve miles out of Jerusalem, and at each mile there
          was a booth provided where the man who took it might refresh himself
          till he came to the tenth mile, when there was no more rest for him
          till he had seen the goat go. When he had come to the last mile he
          stood and looked at the goat till it was gone, and he could see it no
          more. Then the people's sins were all gone too. Now, what a fine type
          that is if you do not enquire any further! But if you will get
          meddling where God intended you to be in ignorance, you will get
          nothing by it. This scapegoat was not designed to show us the victim
          or the sacrifice, but simply what became of the sins. The sins of the
          people are confessed upon that head; the goat is going; the people
          lose sight of it; a fit man goes with it; the sins are going from
          them, and now the man has arrived at his destination; the man sees the
          goat in the distance skipping here and there overt the mountains, glad
          of its liberty; it is not quite gone; a little farther, and now it is
          lost to sight. The man returns, and says he can no longer see it; then
          the people clap their hands, for their sins are all gone too. Oh!
          soul; canst thou see thy sins all gone? We may have to take a long
          journey, and carry our sins with us; but oh! how we watch and watch
          till they are utterly cast into the depths of the wilderness of
          forgetfulness, where they shall never be found any more against us for
          ever. But mark, this goat did not sacrificially make the atonement; it
          was a type of the sins going away, and so it was a type of the
          atonement; for you know, since our sins are thereby lost, it is the
          fruit of the atonement; but the sacrifice is the means of making it.
          So we have this great and glorious thought before us, that by the
          death of Christ there was full, free, perfect remission for all those
          whose sins are laid upon his head. For I would have you notice that on
          this day all sins were laid on the scapegoat's head -- sins of
          presumption, sins of ignorance, sins of uncleanness, sins little and
          sins great, sins few and sins many, sins against the law, sins against
          morality, sins against ceremonies, sins of all kinds were taken away
          on that great day of atonement. Sinner, oh, that thou hadst a share in
          my Master's atonement! Oh! that thou couldst see him slaughtered on
          the cross! Then mightest thou see him go away leading captivity
          captive, and taking thy sins where they might ne'er be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have now an interesting fact to tell you, and I am sure you will
          think it worth mentioning. Turn to Leviticus xxv.9, and you will read:
          |Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the
          tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall yet make
          the trumpet sound throughout all your land.| So that one of the
          effects of the atonement was set forth to us in the fact that when the
          year of jubilee came, it was not on the first day of the year that it
          was proclaimed, but |on the tenth day of the seventh month.| Ay,
          methinks, that was the best part of it. The scapegoat is gone, and the
          sins are gone, and no sooner are they gone than the silver trumpet
          sounds,
        </p>
        <p>|The year of jubilee is to come,</p>
        <p>Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.|</p>
        <p>
          On that day sinners go free; on that day our poor mortgaged lands are
          liberated, and our poor estates which have been forfeited by our
          spiritual bankruptcy are all returned to us. So when Jesus dies,
          slaves win their liberty, and lost ones receive spiritual life again;
          when he dies, heaven, the long lost inheritance is ours. Blessed day!
          Atonement and jubilee ought to go together. Have you ever had a
          jubilee, my friends, in your hearts? If you have not, I can tell you
          it is because you have not had a day of atonement.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thought concerning the effects of this great day of
          atonement, and you will observe that it runs throughout the whole of
          the chapter -- entrance within the vail. Only on one day in the year
          might the high priest enter within the vail, and then it must be for
          the great purposes of the atonement. Now, beloved, the atonement is
          finished, and you may enter within the vail: |Having boldness,
          therefore, to enter into the holiest, let us come with boldness into
          the throne of the heavenly grace.| The vail of the temple is rent by
          the atonement of Christ, and access to the throne is now ours. O child
          of God, I know not of any privilege which thou hast, save fellowship
          with Christ, which is more valuable than access to the throne. Access
          to the mercy seat is one of the greatest blessings mortals can enjoy.
          Precious throne of grace! I never should have had any right to come
          there if it had not been for the day of atonement; I never should have
          been able to come there if the throne had not been sprinkled with the
          blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now we come to notice, in the fourth place, what is our PROPER
          BEHAVIOUR WHEN WE CONSIDER THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. You read at the 29th
          verse, |And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
          seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your
          souls.| That is one thing that we ought to do when we remember the
          atonement. Sure, sinner, there is nothing that move thee to repentance
          like the thought of that great sacrifice of Christ which is necessary
          to wash away thy guilt. |Law and terrors do but harden.| but methinks,
          the thought that Jesus died is enough to make us melt. It is well,
          when we hear the name of Calvary, always to shed a tear, for there is
          nothing that ought to make a sinner weep like the mention of the death
          of Jesus. On that day |ye shall afflict your souls.| And even you, ye
          Christians, when ye think that your Saviour died, should afflict your
          souls: ye should say,
        </p>
        <p>|Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?</p>
        <p>And did my Sov'reign die?</p>
        <p>Would he devote that sacred head</p>
        <p>For such a worm as I?|</p>
        <p>
          Drops of grief ought to flow, ay, streams of undissembled sympathy
          with him; to show our grief for what we did to pierce the Saviour.
          |Afflict your souls,| O ye children of Israel, for the day of
          atonement is come. Weep o'er your Jesus; weep for him that died; weep
          for him who was murdered by your sins, and |afflict your souls.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, better still, we are to |do not work at all,| as ye find the
          same verse, 29th. When we consider the atonement, we should rest, and
          |do no work at all.| Rest from your works as God did from his on the
          great Sabbath of the world; rest from your own righteousness; rest
          from your toilsome duties: rest in him. |We that believe do enter into
          rest.| As soon as thou seest the atonement finished, say, |it is done,
          it is done? Now will I serve my God with zeal, but now I will no
          longer seek to save myself, it is done, it is done for aye.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there was another thing which always happened. When the priest
          had made the atonement, it was usual for him, after he had washed
          himself, to come out again in his glorious garments. When the people
          saw him they attended him to his house with joy, and they offered
          burnt offerings of praise on that day: he being thankful that his life
          was spared, (having been allowed to go into the holy place and to come
          out of it) and they being thankful that the atonement was accepted;
          both of them offering burnt offerings as a type that they desired now
          to be |a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.| Beloved, let
          us go into our houses with joy; let us go into our gates with praise.
          The atonement is finished; the High Priest is gone within the vail;
          salvation is now complete. He has laid aside the linen garments, and
          he stands before you with his breastplate, and his mitre, and his
          embroidered vest, in all his glory. Hear how he rejoices over us, for
          he hath redeemed his people, and ransomed them out of the hands of his
          enemies. Come, let us go home with the High Priest; let us clap our
          hands with joy, for he liveth, he liveth; the atonement is accepted,
          and we are accepted too; the scapegoat is gone, our sins are gone with
          it. Let us then go to our houses with thankfulness, and let us come up
          to his gates with praise, for he hath loved his people, he hath
          blessed his children, and given unto us a day of atonement, and a day
          of acceptance, and a year of jubilee. Praise ye the Lord? Praise ye
          the Lord!<br />
