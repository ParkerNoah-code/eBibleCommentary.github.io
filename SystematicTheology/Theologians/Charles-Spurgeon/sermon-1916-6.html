        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
          mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord
          was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire, but the
          Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. And
          it was so. when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
          mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And
          behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here,
          Elijah?| -- 1 Kings 19:11-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          ELIJAH was a man of like passions with ourselves. We all know that
          when we have passed through any great excitement of high joy there
          almost always comes following, a corresponding reaction and
          depression. Elijah had gone to the top of Carmel and had pleaded his
          cause, and the rain floods had come in answer to his prayer He had
          taken the prophets of Baal, and had slain them, and gained a glorious
          victory for his God; and so full of excitement was he that he girded
          his loins as though he had been a young man, and ran before the
          chariot of Ahab, like the royal footmen. It was almost inevitable that
          after an excitement so high, and strong, that he should be desponding
          and depressed in spirits, and we find that he was so depressed. If the
          like should ever happen to any of you' my brethren and sisters, count
          it no strange thing, nor suppose that some extraordinary trial hath
          happened unto you. It is but a physical result from physical causes.
          The mind has operated upon the body. It has strung the bow too
          tightly, and now, unless the string be relaxed, there is a danger of
          its breaking altogether. Now as Elias was a man of like passions with
          us, we may conclude that the way in which God dealt with him is very
          much the way in which he would deal with us. With a similar case, and
          the same physician, we may look for the same treatment. As, therefore,
          the Lord spake to Elijah not by earthquake, nor wind, nor fire, but by
          the still small voice, so in all probability will he speak to us. It
          may be, it is just possible it may be, that here to-night there is
          some worker for God very much in the same condition as Elijah. You, my
          dear brother, have been working for God in a neighbourhood where you
          have met with little but opposition and disappointment, and you have
          almost resolved that you will go away from the place. |The soil is
          hard,| you say, |and breaks the ploughshare. Shall oxen plough upon a
          rock?| 'Tis in vain for you to continue your labour there, you. think,
          and you have come here to-night still with this thought uppermost --
          that you have laboured in vain, and spent your strength for nought.
          Hear you the word of the Lord this night. He speaks not to you by any
          earthquake of judgment with which he means to visit you, neither by
          any fiery word of severe rebuke; but perhaps through me, this evening,
          he may speak with a still small voice that shall just meet your case
          and send you back to your labour. Brother, will you play the Jonahs
          Will you refuse to go to tile great city -- to Nineveh? Remember there
          are worse places than Nineveh. He that goes out of the path that God
          marks for him may yet come to be at the bottom of the sea with Jonah,
          with the weeds wrapped about his head. You go at your own cost,
          remember, if you go away frown the post of duty, however arduous.
          Don't attempt the risk. But thus saith the Lord unto thee, |It may be
          thou hast not laboured in vain as thou hast supposed.| Elijah knew
          nothing of the seven thousand men that God had in reserve. You don't
          know what converts God has given you. There are scattered up and down
          the world -- perhaps some precious ones who owe their salvation
          instrumentally to you, and could they all stand before you -- you
          would blush with shame at the thought of leaving a harvest -- field
          that has really been so prolific, though not in your sight. Go back
          again to thy work, for the Lord has blessed thee. Play not the fool by
          deserting the post where he will give thee honour yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then the voice told Elijah also that God would punish the people
          who had treated him so ill; that he, would send Hazael with his sharp
          sword and Jehu, yet to mow the ground a second time. And oh! thou true
          servant of God, the Lord will not suffer thee to be rejected. If they
          have rejected thee, they have rejected thy God also. If thou hast been
          faithful to his truth, leave thou that matter to him -- go thou back
          to thy work. And one other word there was to Elijah. He was to go back
          to anoint his successor. If Elijah flees, and if Elijah at length is
          taken up to heaven, yet Elisha shall succeed him. Perhaps there may be
          a brother here who is in the state I have described who does not know
          what God has in store for him. You are to call into the Christian
          ministry a brother that shall do greater than you have, you shall
          light as greater candle shall your own. Oh! what joy Elijah must have
          had when he felt there would be someone to take up his work! You have
          not, my dear brother, yet called out for your master the man the Lord
          means to call. What a happy man he must have been who was the means of
          the conversion of Whitefield or Jonathan Edwards, or some great
          missionary of the cross. You may be that, in that little village -- in
          that back slum. Go thou back then. What doest thou hero Elijah? What
          doest thou here? With whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
          wilderness? The Master's voice speaks to thee. Go to thy closet, and
          get fresh strength from on high, and then go back to thy difficulties
          -- go back to thy self-denials, go back to all thy service with a good
          heart and true.|Fear not thou worm Jacob; I will help thee, saith the
          Lord.| Arise, thou worm, and thresh the mountain, for |I will make
          thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth.| I have delivered
          the message. It is to somebody, I know not to whom, in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now the drift, the great aim of the sermon at this time is to
          speak to the unconverted. With them I dealt also this morning. I feel
          persuaded God will bless it. Now, this evening, let us have another
          word with them. We will read the text again. |Behold, the Lord passed
          by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in
          pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind:
          and after the wind an earthquake. but the Lord was not in the
          earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in
          the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.| Our first
          observation is that: --
        </p>
        <p>I. POWERFUL MEANS MAY ALTOGETHER FAIL TO IMPRESS SOME MINDS</p>
        <p>
          Let us think a while. Terrible judgments appear as if they must
          convert sinners; yet there may be those here, and there certainly are
          those in many places who have passed through a whole series of
          judgments, and are rather hardened than softened by them. You may have
          been, dear friend in a storm of sin; you may have been just barely
          washed upon a rock, and escaped as with the skin of your teeth. You
          have also passed through a time of cholera. You have been in a city
          smitten with the plague. You have lived in a house where others have
          sickened and died; and at those times you did pause a little, and you
          made some good resolutions, but they all ended in smoke; and here you
          are still, a proof that God is not in the earthquake, nor yet in the
          wind, nor yet in the fire. It may be you have suffered a great deal of
          personal sickness. Do I not know some here present who have been laid
          very low with fever -- who have been the subjects of very frightful
          accidents, and brought to the borders of the grave? These things were
          loud voices to you, but you did not hear them. They were God's
          terrors, sent to fetch you to himself, but they failed to do it. You
          remained just where you were, perhaps worse instead of better; for
          when the sun shines on wax, it melts it, but if it shines on clay, it
          hardens it; and so God's judgments have had just that effect on you.
          You are hardened, instead of softened by them. Men are not converted
          by judgments. They may submit themselves in a false way, but power and
          displays of terror do not win the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we naturally expect that men will be converted during the times
          of earnest religious excitement. Some are brought in; but there are
          certain persons who do not seem to be affected by revivals. When
          others bow like the corn that waveth in the wind, they stand stiff and
          firm, and are altogether untouched. It is a solemn thing when a season
          of grace is not a season of grace to us. When we lie, like Gideon's
          fleece, all dry, while all around us is wet with the dew of heaven,
          yet with some it is just so -- gracious excitements and spiritual
          revivals do not touch them. The Lord is not in the wind, and the Lord
          is not in the earthquake, and the Lord is not in the fire-at least to
          them. The same is the case with powerful sermons. I do not mean by
          this |eloquent sermons,| so called. |Eloquent sermons| usually seem to
          me to be the least eloquent things in the world; for eloquence means
          speaking from the heart; and I cannot believe that the fine periods we
          sometimes hear read ever spring anywhere but from the head. But I mean
          when a sermon is full of gospel truth, when it is pertinently put,
          when it is pathetically urged, when the heart of the preacher is
          warmed, and his eyes o'erflow with tears; when you see a congregation
          melted, you say to yourself, |Surely that must touch so-and-so's
          heart.| And then there comes a passage in the sermon that seems so
          touching that the very rocks might weep, and the stones might break;
          but oh! when it is all over it is all over, and it is forgotten too;
          and to many a hearer the Lord is not in the wind, nor in the
          earthquake, nor in the fire. And so it is also in the dealing out of
          the judgments of God in the ministry. It is the duty of the Christian
          pastor, if he would make full proof of his ministry, to warn men of
          the results of sin -- to tell them that there is a judgment -- that
          for every idle word they speak they will have to account. We ought
          continually to declare that for every transgression there shall be a
          recompense of reward. But ah! dear hearer, though we have read books
          and heard sermons that were full of the terrors of the Lord, which we
          thought surely would move men, yet there are men who care nothing
          whatever about the wrath to come, nor the fire that is kindled for the
          wicked, nor the dreadful terrors of Divine Justice. The Lord is not in
          the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, so far as they are
          concerned. The means that appear to be powerful are powerless to them;
          and when you think they will surely turn and repent, they harden their
          necks and go on in their sin. This, abundant facts could prove.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the next observation shall be that sometimes a much gentler force
          effects what could not otherwise have been achieved. Many have been
          converted to God by the still small voice whom no wind, though it rose
          to a hurricane, no earthquake, though it rent the world to its centre,
          and no fire, though it licked up the forests, could ever move. A
          gentle word has done it. Sometimes that still small voice has come to
          us by apparently very, very inadequate means. It is astonishing what
          little things God will use when he pleases to do so. He wanted to
          soften the heart of that rough prophet Jonah, and he sent a worm and a
          gourd, and they did it. He would bring Peter to repentance, and he
          bade a cock to crow. It was a strange preacher, but it was as good as
          a dean of a cathedral to the Apostle. Means may seem to be absolutely
          ridiculous, yet God maketh use of the things that are not, as though
          they were. I remember to have heard the story of a man, a blasphemer,
          profane, an atheist, who was converted singularly by a sinful action
          of his. He had written on a piece of paper, |God is nowhere,| and bade
          his child read it, for he would make his child an atheist too. And the
          child spelt it, |God is n-o-w h-e-r-e-God is now here.| It was a
          truth, instead of a lie, and the arrow pierced the man's own heart. I
          remember one who had lived a life of gross iniquity who stepped into
          Exeter Hall and found Christ there. It was not my sermon, however,
          that God blessed: it was only this. I read the hymn, |Jesus, lover of
          my soul.| Just those words touched his heart. |Jesus, lover of my
          soul,| he said to himself. |Did Jesus love my soul? Then how is it
          that I could have lived as I have done?|; and that word broke him
          down. God works great results by little things. A little hymn learnt
          at the Sunday School is sung at home by a little prattler, and the
          heart of the father is softened by it. One little sentence uttered by
          a friendly visitor reaches a mother's conscience and impresses her
          heart. Ay, and God can use the quiet of the evening, or the stillness
          of the night, or a flash of lightning, or a peal of thunder, or a
          dewdrop, or a little flower -- he can use anything he wills to bring
          his banished. home. Often cloth the Spirit speak thus with a still
          small voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, beloved, the Holy Ghost also speaks to men without any
          means at all. With no outward agency whatever, the still small voice
          will come. Oh! how I wish it would come to-night to some sitting here
          listening to the preacher! I wish you could forget -- forget the
          congregation, and forget everything except yourself and your God. We
          have known persons who have been walking in the fields, thoughtless
          and careless. All around has been still, and they have suddenly
          thought, and thought is often the avenue to prayer. We have known some
          passing through a country churchyard, and though no text upon the tomb
          how touched them, yet the very sight of those green hillocks has been
          a sermon to them. Aye, and men have walked through orchards, and the
          leaves have said to them, |We all do fade as a leaf.| Or sitting in
          their chamber, or lying on their bed wakeful, the old times have come
          over again. The man that lives to be an old sinner recollects the
          little prayer he said at his mother's knee. The soldier that has been
          at battle recollects the teaching of the Sunday School, though he has
          passed now his fiftieth year; and he says, |I wish I could blot out
          all that which lies between my mother's kiss and this hour. It has
          been a dark, dark season.| Only the thought has done it. God's Spirit
          did but touch the secret spring, and the soul was moved aright. The
          still small voice has done it. Oh! how satisfied I should be if the
          Lord would not give me a single soul in this place by my preaching, if
          he would but do it himself! What matters it so long as they are saved?
          He does put honour upon his preached word, and he brings in the most
          of men thereby; but so long as they are brought in, and he gets glory,
          what will it signify as to the means he uses? May he still speak to
          you by his still small voice. I commend to him in my earnest prayer
          some of you who are very familiar with my voice, and to whom it is as
          useless as familiar. You will never be brought to Christ by me. God
          will never give me your souls I fear. For these many years have I
          laboured for them, and they have not been given me. Well, good Master,
          call them by some other means, only bring then; and grant that this
          very night, conscience may be aroused by thoughts which thou thyself
          shalt suggest, and they may come to thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, then, the first two points, that the most powerful means will
          often fail, and that the least means may be successful. Ay, and the
          Holy Ghost may work without means altogether. And now once again: --
        </p>
        <p>
          II. WHEN GOD SPEAKS TO MEN, HIS VOICE IS ALWAYS LINKED WITH PERSONAL
          ADDRESS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the text. What says the still small voice? |What doest thou
          here Elijah?| There was the man named. It was no general statement
          about prophets who proved faithless, or about believers who grew
          doubtful, or about men of courage that played the coward. Oh! no; it
          was, |What doest thou here, Elijah?| It is a mark of God's Spirit that
          when he speaks to men he speaks to them personally. Just take a case
          or two. You remember Jesus Christ going through Jericho, preaching as
          he went. He meant to call that rich publican who had climbed the tree.
          In what way did the effectual voice of grace do it? He says,
          |Zaccheus| It was not a general observation about people up in trees
          that were to come down; but |Zaccheus| -- that is the man. |Zaccheus,
          make haste and come down, for to-day I must abide in thy house.| The
          personal call did it. And Mary, when she did not know her Master, and
          was in the garden, and thought he was the gardener -- what was it that
          opened her eyes to know her Lord, and made her say, |Rabboni|? It was
          no word else except that he said unto her, |Mary.| The tone in which
          he said it, and the name -- the old familiar name, Mary -- that did
          the work. And when the Saviour meant to break Simon Peter's heart, and
          yet to assure him that he was forgiven, how did he speak to him? Three
          times he said to him, |Simon, son of Jonas. Simon, son of Jonas,
          lovest thou me?| This is how God speaks to men. And when out of the
          open heavens Jesus spake to the maddened persecutor who was on the
          road to Damascus, but whom he meant to make his elect apostle to the
          Gentiles, how did he speak but thus? |Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
          me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.| Now here I cannot
          speak except to the crowd and the congregation, and though one labours
          hard to make a description apt and plain, and to fit the cap to all
          wearers' heads, yet men slip through in the crowd; they will not take
          it to themselves, nor can we make them. But when the Holy Ghost speaks
          with the still small voice, it is always, |Thou art the man. Thou art
          the man. Thou art the sinner condemned. Thou art the sinner invited to
          mercy. Thou art the sinner that shall be received by grace.| Believe
          thou, and thou shalt be saved, for he loves thee and gave himself for
          thee. May the Lord send us such personal work as this. I know every
          Christian here, if he could state his experience, would tell you that
          the word never came with power to his soul until it came right to him
          as though he were the only sinner, and the gospel were meant for him
          above all others. Oh! for an arrow from the great archer's bow to go
          right into you, that, like a stag that is smitten by the archer, you
          might retire into the glades of the forest, to weep alone and die
          alone, unless the hand that sent in the dart shall gently draw it out
          and heal the wound that it has made! Oh! for this personal conviction!
          -- conviction of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment laid home to
          each man's heart. It must be so, or you cannot be saved. But now
          another truth is suggested by the text. It is this, that: --
        </p>

          III. WHEN GOD'S STILL SMALL VOICE SPEAKS TO MEN PERSONALLY, THE
          SUBJECT IS THEMSELVES AND THEIR ACTIONS.
        </p>
        <p>
          |What doest thou here, Elijah?| This was the voice of God. May the
          same voice come to-night to some here about their actions. Let me take
          the text and use it to you. What are you doing? What doest thou? What
          have you been doing? You are getting on in life. What have you done?
          Mischief I fear. What good have you done? You were made to glorify
          God, that was the end for which you were created. Have you glorified
          him? You have been fed by him, clothed by him. Have you made him any
          return? What have you done? No good -- much evil. What are you doing
          now? Sitting here and listening. Ay, but how are you treating the
          Word? Are you receiving it? Do you hear the voice of mercy, and do you
          reject it, or will you accept it? What are you going to do? What are
          you going to do to-night when you get out of this place? How will the
          last hours of the precious Sabbath be spent? And to-morrow, and the
          next day -- what are you planning? Is there anything holy in it,
          anything noble in it, anything that will be glorifying to God? Do you
          never take stock? Spiritual trader, do you never take stock? Mariner
          upon the sea of life, cost thou never consult thy chart? Dost thou
          never heave the lead, or take thy bearings? Art thou so mad as to sail
          on in the fog, and not care what becomes of so goodly a vessel as thy
          soul? Oh! pause. What hast thou done? What art thou doing? What wilt
          thou do? Especially what wilt thou do in the swellings of Jordan?
          Unsaved, what will you do when the death-sweat stands upon your brow
          -- when the cold beaded drops are there, and the marrow is frozen, and
          the strong man gathers up his feet in the bed for the last dread
          struggle -- what will you do without a Saviour? What will you do when
          the trumpet rings through heaven and earth, and sea, and men live
          again, and you, with them, stand before the judgment-seat, and amidst
          the rolling thunder the book is opened and your sins stand there
          unforgiven? What will you do? What will you do? Oh! that you may never
          be brought to this, but be brought to Christ to-night! Do you notice
          how the word was put? It was not, |What are you doing?| only, but
          |What doest thou -- thou, Elijah?| And there are some special persons
          whose sins receive an aggravation by the very fact that they are what
          they are. I know thee -- what thou west of old. What a sweet child.
          How his mother loved him, and loved to hear him sing, and pray, too,
          in his way. What happiness it was to the parents! Ah! they fell asleep
          and died, and 'tis a mercy they did, else perhaps your course would
          have brought them to the grave with grief. What doest thou, child of
          many prayers and many tears? What doest thou? Still to be an enemy to
          thy mother's God, and to blaspheme the name they father loved. You
          have been hearers of the gospel, some of you almost ever since you can
          recollect. Your mother carried you in her arms to God's house, and
          sometimes conscience has pricked you, and the word has gone through,
          and through, and through; but you have resisted it. What has led you,
          I pray you, to remain still what you are? What infernal power has
          helped you to steel your heart? In what fire has your soul been
          annealed to make it hard as adamant stone? O soul, soul, sinful soul,
          delaying, procrastinating soul! what doest thou in such a states after
          so much love and mercy? And I might speak to some that promised fair
          many times, and that have been almost persuaded to be Christians, and
          yet still are out of God, and out of Christ, and on the borders of
          destruction. What do you here? Perhaps there is someone who has come
          to London lately, that in the country was an observer of religion,
          apparently sincere, but oh! this wicked London! You have given up
          those good habits; you -- have got into bad company, and oh! I shall
          not tell what you have done; but I hope you will confess it to God in
          your own secrecy. But how dare you do it? How could you do its Oh! how
          could you do it? How could you be a prodigal? -- you, your fathers
          dearly beloved, taught so well, with so much light, with such a tender
          conscience -- how could you sin? Why the very tramps of the street
          might be ashamed of you, for they never knew much better. Those that
          go into foulest sin might condemn you, for with their bad street
          training, educated perhaps in the kennel, who wonders that they are
          what they are? But for you, it is a wonder. The angel Lucifer, son of
          the morning, fell down to the deeps of hell. You have fallen from the
          side of the pulpit, fallen from a Christian parent's side, and almost
          from inside the Church of God, and fallen into sin. Perhaps I speak to
          some that have belied their baptism, have given up the profession that
          they made when they there were buried with Christ, who have belied the
          sacramental table where they once sat, and professed to eat his bread
          and drink of his cup, and to be partakers of his body and of his
          blood. You have crucified the Lord afresh, and put him to an open
          shame. |What doest thou here, Elijah?| My, and you used to preach too;
          you used to preach to others, and now what are you? You were once, as
          it were, a priest at the altar of God, and now you are a priest at the
          altars of Baal. God have mercy upon you, and may his still small voice
          now speak in your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was one point in the question which was asked, which was this:
          |What doest thou here?| Each man, when he is called to search himself
          by the Spirit of God, must recollect his surroundings. I thank God, my
          brethren and my sisters, that you are hearers -- not to commend you
          that you may be Pharisees, because you happen to go to a place of
          worship. I do, nevertheless, praise God that you are here. When the
          sick lay round the Pool of Bethesda, there was some hope of their
          being healed. You are favoured in being where Christ is preached; but
          what doest thou here? Did you come to find a jest? Did you come to
          hear one who was much talked of in your hearing? Did you come from
          curiosity? Did you come from a worse motive? Well, never mind, but
          what are you doing now? Are you willing to listen to God's voice? Will
          you now yield? He round you now, as with the bands of a man, would
          cast the bands of his love, who was given for you, and to his altar
          bind you fast. 'Tis but to yield; and surely it must be hard to resist
          when it is divine mercy that plies you, and eternal love that
          persuades you. |Come unto me,| says Jesus; |come unto me all ye that
          labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.| Will you not
          come? |Whosoever will, let him come and take the water of life freely.
          | Will you not come? Oh! that your answer to the question, |What doest
          thou here? | might be to-night, | I am doing this here; I am laying my
          sins on Jesus; I am confessing the past; I am asking grace for the
          future; I am looking to the wounds of him that was cleft as a rock is
          cleft that I may shelter in him; I am saying, 'God be merciful to me a
          sinner.|' Thy God be praised if such is the case. But I must close
          with the last observation, and that is, that: --

          IV. WHERE THE LORD DOES SPEAK WITH A STILL SMALL VOICE TO MEN
          PERSONALLY ABOUT THEIR CONDUCT AND THEIR SIN, IT IS ALWAYS EFFECTUAL.
        </p>
        <p>
          You notice what Elijah did. He first wrapped his mantle about his face
          -- he became subdued and awe-stricken -- full of reverence. Oh! it is
          a great thing when a sinner is willing to wrap his face when he is
          confounded, and say, |I cannot defend my course; I am guilty.| We know
          that if at our judgment-seat a man pleads guilty, he is punished; but
          at the judgment-seat of the gospel whoever pleads guilty is forgiven.
          Wrap your face. Oh! but you thought that you were better than most;
          you went to church, and you went to the meeting-house, the chapel,
          regularly, and were you not better than others? Ah! wrap your face.
          Your church-goings and your chapel-goings have only increased your
          responsibilities if you have rejected the Saviour. Take the mantle of
          self humiliation, and wrap it about your face now. Say, with the
          leper, |Unclean! Unclean!| Where you are in the Tabernacle, where you
          are, never mind where you stand or sit, I commend to you the
          publican's prayer. Say it now, and God help you, |God be merciful to
          me a sinner.| Did you say it from your heart? Go home. You shall go
          home to your house justified, for he that humbleth himself shall be
          exalted.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you must notice that while Elijah thus wrapped his face in
          reverence, he stood still and listened. It was a still small voice,
          and the prophet was attending. No other sound was heard but this,
          |What doest thou here, Elijah?| But he stood. I doubt not that man of
          iron stood and wept, and seemed to say in his soul, |Speak, Lord, for
          thy servant heareth.| |He that bath earn to hear, let him hear.| Oh!
          be very attentive to the voice of God s Spirit! If you have only a
          half of a good thought, take care of it. It may be the beginning of
          another one. Oh! if you have only just got a little leaning, thank God
          for it. Remember Christ does not quench the smoking flax; don't quench
          it yourself. |Quench not the Spirit.| Oh! I have known times when I
          would have given my whole life to have had one tear of repentance. Can
          you repent now? Can you long after God now? Oh! cherish that longing!
          Yield to the Spirit of God. Don't be like iron to the fire that needs
          to have the blast-furnace on it before it will melt; but oh! be like
          wax to the flame, like cork on the water that moves up and down with
          every influence. God make you so. It wants a strong wind to shake the
          oak; but the fern that grows under it waves its branches at every
          breath of the zephyr. May you be just as sensitive as that. Bow before
          the Spirit's influence. The Lord make you to do it for his name's
          sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, best of all and last of all, the prophet was not only
          reverent, humble, and attentive, but he was obedient. God told him to
          go and do this and that. He never questioned, but away he went and
          executed the divine commission, and until the time when he was taken
          up in the chariot of fire Elijah never quailed again. The still small
          voice had made him twice a man, and steeled him once again to bear all
          that he had to endure in his chequered life. He was obedient to the
          heavenly vision. Will you be obedient to-night?| If ye be willing and
          obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.| May God make you to be
          obedient. But you say, |What is his command then? What is the work of
          God-this great work that God commands? This is the one gospel precept,
          |Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved|; or take
          it in the shape in which the Master put it, |He that believeth and is
          baptized, shall be saved.| To believe is to trust. To be baptized is
          to be immersed into Christ -- immersed in water upon profession of
          faith, for so it is put, and I dare not give you half the gospel. So
          it is put, |He that with his heart believeth, and with his mouth
          maketh confession of him, shall be saved.| Don't leave out any part of
          the divine command. Be obedient to the whole of it. |Believe and be
          baptized,| or as the Apostle put it, | Repent, and be baptized, every
          one of you.| May God grant that you may be obedient to this. The great
          command is, |Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. |Trust in him -- in his
          substitutionary work for sinners. He bore their guilt, and was
          punished in their stead, and whosoever trusts in what he did -- in a
          word, trusts in him, is saved. God grant you to do it. I leave it to
          his still small voice to work this blessed result. Amen.
