        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          (This was followed by a farewell address from his son, Thomas
          Spurgeon.)

          "But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night;
          who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser
          than the fowls of heaven?" -- Job 35:10-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          ELIHU PERCEIVED the great ones of the earth oppressing the needy, and
          he traced their domineering tyranny to their forgetfulness of God:
          "None saith, Where is God my Maker?" Surely, had they thought of God
          they could not have acted so unjustly. Worse still, if I understand
          Elihu aright, he complained that even among the oppressed there was
          the same departure in heart from the Lord: they cried out by reason of
          the arm of the mighty, but unhappily they did not cry unto God their
          Maker, though he waits to be gracious unto all such, and executeth
          righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. Both with great
          and small, with oppressors and oppressed, there is one common fault in
          our nature, which is described by the apostle in the Romans, "There is
          none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God." Until
          divine grace comes in and changes our nature there is none that saith,
          "Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night?" This is a very
          grave fault, about which we shall speak for a few minutes, and may the
          Holy Ghost bless the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And first, LET US THINK OVER THESE NEGLECTED QUESTIONS, beginning
          with "Where is God my Maker?" There are four questions in the text,
          each of which reminds us of the folly of forgetting it. First, Where
          is God? Above all things in the world we ought to think of him. Pope
          said, "The proper study of mankind is man"; but it is far more true
          that the proper study of mankind is God. Let man study man in the
          second place, but God first. It is a sad thing that God is all in all,
          that we owe everything to him, and are under allegiance to him, and
          yet we neglect him. Some men think of every person but God. They have
          a place for everything else, but no place in their heart for God. They
          are most exact in the discharge of other relative duties, and yet they
          forget their God. They would count themselves mean indeed if they did
          not pay every man his own, and yet they rob God. They rob him of his
          honor, to which they never give a thought they rob him of obedience,
          for his law has no hold on them; they rob him of his praise, for they
          are receiving daily at his hands, and yet they yield no gratitude to
          their great Benefactor. "None saith, Where is God?" My dear hearer, do
          you stand convicted of this? Have you been walking up and down in this
          great house, and never asked to see the King whose palace it is? Have
          you been rejoicing at this great feast, and have you never asked to
          see your Host? Have you gone abroad through the various fields of
          nature, and have you never wished to know him whose breath perfumes
          the flowers, whose pencil paints the clouds, whose smile makes
          sunlight, and whose frown is storm. Oh, it is a strange, sad fact --
          God so near us, and so necessary to us, and yet not sought for!
        </p>
        <p>
          The next point is, "None saith, Where is God my Maker?" Oh! unthinking
          man, God made you. He fashioned your curious framework, and put every
          bone into its place. He, as with needlework, embroidered each nerve,
          and vein, and sinew. He made this curious harp of twice ten thousand
          strings: wonderful it is that it has kept in tune so long: but only he
          could have maintained its harmony. He is your Maker. You are a mass of
          dust, and you would crumble back to dust at this moment if he withdrew
          his preserving power: he but speaks, and you dissolve into the earth
          on which you tread. Do you never think of your Maker? Have you no
          thought for him without whom you could not think at all? Oh, strange
          perversity and insanity that a man should find himself thus curiously
          made, and bearing within his own body that which will make him either
          a madman or a worshipper; and yet for all that he lives as if he had
          nothing to do with his Creator -- "None saith, Where is God my Maker?"
        </p>
        <p>
          There is great force in the next sentence: "Who giveth songs in the
          night." That is to say, God is our Comforter. Beloved friends, you
          that know God, I am sure you will bear witness that, though you have
          had very severe trials, you have always been sustained in them when
          God has been near you. Some of us have been sick -- nigh unto death,
          but we have almost loved our suffering chamber, and scarce wished to
          come out of it, so bright has the room become with the presence of
          God. Some of us here have known what it is to bury our dearest
          friends, and others have been short of bread, and forced to look up
          each morning for your daily manna; but when your heavenly Father has
          been with you -- speak, ye children of God -- have you not had joy and
          rejoicing, and light in your dwellings? When the night has been very
          dark, yet the fiery pillar has set the desert on a glow. No groans
          have made night hideous, but you have sung like nightingales amid the
          blackest shades when God has been with you. I can hardly tell you what
          joy, what confidence, what inward peace the presence of God gives to a
          man. It will make him bear and dare, rest and wrestle, yield and yet
          conquer, die and yet live. It will be very sad, therefore, if we poor
          sufferers forget our God, our Comforter, our song-giver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two little boys were once speaking together about Elijah riding to
          heaven in the chariot of fire. One of them said, "I think he had
          plenty of courage. I should have been afraid to ride in such a
          carriage as that." "Ah!" Ah!" said the other, "but I would not mind if
          God drove it." So do Christians say. They mind not if they are called
          to mount a chariot of fire if God drives it, We speak as honest men
          what we do know and feel, and we tell all our fellow-men that as long
          as God is present with us we have no choice of what happens to us,
          whether we sorrow or whether we rejoice. We have learned to glory in
          tribulations also when God's own presence cheers our souls, Why do not
          they also seek to know the Giver of songs?
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there is a fourth point. "None saith, Where is God my Maker,
          who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and make/h us wiser
          than the fowls of heaven?" Here we are reminded that God is our
          Instructor. God has given us intellect; it is not by accident, but by
          his gift, that we are distinguished from the beasts and the fowls.
          Now, if animals do not turn to God we do not wonder, but shall man
          forget? Strange to say, there has been no rebellion against God among
          the beasts or the birds. The beasts obey their God, and bow their
          necks to man. There are no sin-loving cattle or apostate fowls, but
          there are fallen men. Think, O man, it may have been better for thee
          if thou hadst been made a frog or a toad than to have lived a man if
          thou shouldst live and die without making peace with thy Maker. Thou
          gloriest that thou art not a beast: take heed that the beast do not
          condemn thee. Thou thinkest thyself vastly better than the sparrow
          which lights upon thy dwelling: take heed that thou do better and rise
          to nobler things. Methinks if there were a choice in birds, and souls
          dwelt in them, their minstrelsy would be as pure as now it is: they
          would scorn to sing loose and frivolous songs, as men do, but they
          would carol everlastingly sweet psalms of praise to God. Methinks if
          there were souls in any of the creatures, they would devote themselves
          to God. as surely as angels do. Why then, O man, why is it that thou
          with thy superior endowments must needs be the sole rebel, the only
          creature of earthly mould that forgets the creating and instructing
          Lord?
        </p>
        <p>
          Four points are then before us. Man does not ask after his God, his
          Maker, his Comforter, his Instructor: is he not filled with a fourfold
          madness? How can he excuse himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Supposing you do not ask these questions, let me remind you that
          THERE ARE QUESTIONS WHICH GOD WILL ASK OF YOU.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Adam had broken God's command he did not say, "Where is God my
          Maker?" but the Lord did not therefore leave him alone. No, the Lord
          came out, and a voice, silvery with grace, but yet terrible with
          justice, rang through the trees, "Adam, where art thou?" There will
          come such a voice to you who have neglected God. Your Judge will
          enquire, "Where art thou?" Though you hide in the top of Carmel, or
          dive with the crooked serpent into the depths of the sea, you will
          hear that voice, and you will be constrained to answer it. Your dust
          long scattered to the wind will come together, and your soul will
          enter into your body, and you will be obliged to answer, "Here am I,
          for thou didst call me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you will hear the second question, "Why didst thou live and die
          without me?" And such questions as these will come thick upon you,
          "What did I do that thou shouldst slight me? Did I not give you
          innumerable mercies? Why did you never think of me? Did I not put
          salvation before you? Did I not plead with you? Did I not entreat you
          to turn unto me? Why did you refuse me? "You will have no answer to
          those questions: and then there will come another question -- ah! how
          I wish it would come to you while there is time to answer it -- "How
          shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" To-night I put it
          to you that you may propose a way of escape, if your imagination is
          equal to the task. You will be baffled even in trying to invent an
          escape now, and how much more when your time of judgment really comes!
          If you neglect the salvation of God in Christ you cannot be saved. In
          the next world, how will you answer that question -- "How shall we
          escape?" You will ask the rocks to hide you, but they will refuse you
          that dread indulgence. You will beseech them to crush you, that you
          may no longer see the terrible face of the King upon the throne, but
          even that shall be denied you. Oh, be wise, and ere you dare the wrath
          of the King eternal and dash upon the bosses of his buckler, turn and
          repent, for why will ye die?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, if any seek an answer to the grave enquiries of the text,
          and do sincerely ask, "Where is God my Maker?" let us GIVE THE
          ANSWERS. Where is God? He is everywhere. He is all around you now. If
          you want him, here he is. He waits to be gracious to you. Where is God
          your Maker? He is within eye-sight of you. You cannot see him, but he
          sees you. He reads each thought and every motion of your spirit, and
          records it too. He is within ear-shot of you. Speak, and he will hear
          you. Ay, whisper -- nay, you need not even form the words with the
          lips, but let the thought be in the soul, and he is so near you -- for
          in him you live and move and have your being -- that he will know your
          heart before you know it yourself. Where is your Comforter? He is
          ready with his "songs in the night." Where is your Instructor? He
          waits to make you wise unto salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where, then, may I meet him?" says one. You cannot meet him -- you
          must not attempt it -- except through the Mediator. "There is one God
          and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." If you
          come to Jesus you have come to God. "God was in Christ reconciling the
          world unto himself; not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath
          committed unto us the word of reconciliation," which word we preach.
          Believe in Jesus Christ, and your God is with you. Trust your soul
          with Jesus Christ, and you have found your Creator, and you shall
          never again have to say, "Where is God my Maker?" for you shall live
          in him, and he shall live in you. You have found your Comforter and
          you shall joy in him, while he shall joy in you. You have also in
          Christ Jesus found your Instructor, who shall guide you through life,
          and bring you to perfection in yon bright world above.
        </p>

          May the Holy Ghost use this little sermon as a short sword to slay
          your indifference; for Christ's sake.
