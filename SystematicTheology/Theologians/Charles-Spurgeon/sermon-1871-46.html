        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1013)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, October 1st, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
          magnified." -- Psalm 70:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE WORDS OCCUR at least three times in the book of Psalms, and
          therefore we may regard them as especially important. When God speaks
          once, twice, thrice, he doth as it were awaken us to peculiar
          attention, and call for prompt obedience to what he saith. Let us not
          be deaf to the divine voice, but let each one say, "Speak Lord, for
          thy servant heareth."
        </p>
        <p>
          You will observe that in this, and in the fortieth Psalm, this holy
          saying is put in opposition to the ungodly speeches of persecutors.
          The wicked say, "Aha, aha," therefore let those who love God's
          salvation have a common watchword with which to silence the malicious
          mockeries of the ungodly; let them say, "LET GOD BE MAGNIFIED." The
          earnestness of the wicked should be a stimulus to the fervency of the
          righteous. Surely, if God's enemies do not spare blasphemy and
          profanity, if they are always upon the watch to find reasons for
          casting reproach upon the name and church of Christ, we ought to be
          more than equally vigilant and diligent in spreading abroad the
          knowledge of the gospel, which magnifies the name of the Lord. Would
          to God his church were half as earnest as the synagogue of Satan! Oh
          that we had, in our holy cause, a tithe of the indefatigable spirit of
          those Scribes and Pharisees, who compass sea and land to make one
          proselyte! Even the archfiend shames us by his preserving industry,
          for he goeth up and down in the earth seeking whom he may destroy!
        </p>
        <p>
          The clause which we have selected for our text also follows
          immediately after another which may be looked upon as a stepping-stone
          to it. Before we can love God's salvation, we must be seekers of it;
          hence we read, "Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in
          thee." There is a duty peculiar to seekers, let them see to it; and
          then there follows a further obligation peculiar to those who have
          found what they sought for. Let joy and rejoicing be first realised by
          the seeker through his receiving personally the grace of God, and then
          let us go on to a stage further. The fresh convert has his business
          mainly within; it will be well for him if his heart can, in sincerity,
          be glad in the Lord. When believers are young and feeble they are not
          fit for the battle; therefore, let them tarry at home awhile, and
          under their vine and fig-tree eat the sweet fruits of the gospel, none
          making them afraid. We do not send our children to hard service; we
          wait till their limbs are developed, and then appoint them their share
          in life's labors. Let the newly called be carried like lambs in the
          Savior's bosom, and borne as on eagles' wings. "Let all those that
          seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee." But when men have advanced
          beyond the earliest stage, when they are persuaded that Christ is
          theirs, and that they have been adopted into the family of God, then
          let them cheerfully accept active service. Let it not be now the main
          concern with them to possess a joyous experience on their own account,
          but let them studiously seek the good of their fellow creatures, and
          the glory of God. Strong men have strength given them that they may
          bear burdens and perform labors; light is this burden and blessed is
          this labor. Let them "say continually, Let God be magnified." I shall,
          therefore, hope that anything of earnest exhortation which shall be
          addressed to believers at this time, will come with double power to
          those of you who are advanced in the divine life. The more you know of
          God's salvation the more you will love it, and the more you love it
          the more are you bound to recognize the sacred duty and privilege of
          saying continually, "Let God be magnified." May each one of you here
          be willing to take up the obligation if you have enjoyed the benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may simplify our discourse this morning if we arrange it under
          three heads. Here is, first, the character: "They that love thy
          salvation. Here is secondly, the saying: "Let them say continually,
          Let God be magnified. And here is, thirdly, the wish, the wish of the
          psalmist and of the psalmist's master, that all who answer to the
          character shall use the watchword, and say continually, Let God be
          magnified."
        </p>
        <p>I. We will begin, then, by discriminating THE CHARACTER.</p>
        <p>
          The individuals here spoken of are those who love God's salvation.
          Then it is implied that they are persons who are saved, because it is
          not according to nature to love a salvation in which we have no part.
          We may admire the salvation which is preached, but we shall only love
          the salvation which is experienced. We may hold orthodox views as to
          salvation, though not ourselves saved; but we shall not have earnest
          affection towards it unless we are ourselves redeemed by it from the
          wrath to come. Saved ones, then, are meant here, and we may add that
          they are so saved as to be assured of it, and consequently to feel the
          warm glow of ardent, grateful love. They love God's salvation because
          they have grasped it; they possess it, they know they possess it, and,
          therefore, they prize it, and their hearts are wedded to it. Beloved,
          I hope that the large proportion of this congregation could say before
          the heart searching God, "We are saved; we have come all guilty and
          heavy laden to the foot of the cross; we have looked up, we have seen
          the flowing of the Savior's precious blood, we have trusted in him as
          our atoning sacrifice, and by faith we have received full pardon
          through his precious blood." Happy people who have this blessing and
          know it! May no doubts ever becloud your sky! May you clearly read
          your titles to the mansions in the skies, written legibly and
          indelibly in the precious blood of Jesus Christ your Savior. You are
          the persons to whom we speak to-day; you know, and therefore love the
          salvation of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, more than this, to sustain and bring to perfection in the renewed
          heart an ardent affection towards the divine salvation of a sort that
          will continue, and become practically fruitful, there must be an
          intelligent consideration, and an instructed apprehension as to the
          character of this salvation. It is a great pity that so many
          professors have only a religion of feeling, and are quite unable to
          explain and justify their faith. They live by passion, rather than by
          principle. Religion is in them a series of paroxysms, a succession of
          emotions. They were stirred up at a certain meeting, excited, and
          carried away, and let us hope they were really and sincerely
          converted: but they have failed to become to the fullest extent
          disciples or learners. They do not sit at Jesus' feet, they are not
          Bereans who search the Scriptures daily to see whether these things be
          so: they are content with the mere rudiments, the simple elements:
          they are still little children and have need to be fed with milk, for
          they cannot digest the strong meat of the kingdom. Such persons do not
          discern so many reasons for admiring and loving the salvation of God,
          as the intelligent enlightened Spirit-taught believer. I would to God
          that all of us, after we have received Christ, meditated much upon his
          blessed person, and the details of his work, and the various streams
          of blessings which leap forth from the central fount of Calvary's
          sacrifice. All Scripture is profitable, but especially those
          Scriptures which concern our salvation. Some things lose by
          observation, they are most wondered at when least understood; but the
          gospel gains by study: no man is ever wearied in meditating upon it,
          nor does he find his admiration diminished, but abundantly increased.
          Blessed is he who studies the gospel both day and night, and finds his
          heart's delight in it. Such a man will have a steadier and intenser
          affection for it, in proportion as he perceives its excellence and
          surpassing glory. The man who receives the gospel superficially, and
          holds it as a matter of impression and little more, being quite unable
          to give a reason for the hope that is in him, lacks that which would
          confirm and intensify his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let me show you, beloved, what it is in salvation that the
          thoughtful believer loves; and I may begin by saying that he loves,
          best of all, the Savior himself. Often our Lord is called Salvation,
          because he is the great worker of it, the author and finisher, the
          Alpha and the Omega of it. He who has Christ has salvation; and, as he
          is the essence of salvation, he is the center of the saved ones'
          affection. Have you, beloved, carefully considered that Jesus is
          divine, that he counts it not robbery to be equal with God, being our
          Creator and Preserver, as well as our Redeemer? Do you fully
          understand that our Lord is infinite, eternal, nothing less than God;
          and yet for our sakes he took upon himself our nature, was clothed in
          that nature with all its infirmities, sin alone excepted, and in that
          nature agonized, bled, and died, the just for the unjust, that he
          might bring us to God. Oh, marvel of marvels, miracle of miracles! The
          immortal Lord stoops to death; the Prince of glory bows to be spit
          upon. Shame and dishonor could not make him start back from his
          blessed purpose, but to the death of the cross he surrendered himself.
          O, you who are saved, do you not love Christ, who is your salvation ?
          Do you not feel a burning desire to behold him as he is ? Is not his
          presence, even now, a nether heaven to you ? Will not a face to face
          view of his glory be all the heaven that your utmost stretch of
          imagination can conceive ? I know it is so. Your heart is bound to
          Jesus, his name is set as a seal upon it; therefore, I charge you to
          say continually, "Let God be magnified." Glory be to the Father who
          gave his Son, to the Son who gave himself, to the Spirit who revealed
          all this to us. Triune God, be thou extolled for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you love not only the Savior's person, but I am sure you delight
          in the plan of salvation. What is that plan? It is summed up in a
          single word -- substitution.
        </p>
        <p>"He bore, that we might never bear,</p>
        <p>His Father's righteous ire."</p>
        <p>
          Sin was not pardoned absolutely, else justice had been dishonored; but
          sin was transferred from the guilty to the innocent One. "The Lord
          hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." When our iniquity was found
          upon the innocent Lamb of God, he was "smitten of God and afflicted,"
          as if he had been a sinner; he was made to suffer for transgressions
          not his own, as if they had been his own; and thus mercy and justice
          met together, righteousness and grace kissed each other. Alas! there
          are many who fight against this plan, but I rejoice that I am
          surrounded by warm hearts who love it, and would die for it. As for
          me, I know no other gospel, and let this tongue be dumb rather than it
          should ever preach any other. Substitution is the very marrow of the
          whole Bible, the soul of salvation, the essence of the gospel, we
          ought to saturate all our sermons with it, for it is the life-blood of
          a gospel ministry. We must daily show how God the Judge can be "just,
          and yet the justifier of him that believeth." We must declare that God
          has made the Redeemer's soul a sacrifice for sin, making him to be sin
          for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of
          God in him. Our plain testimony must be, that "he was made a curse for
          us;" that "he his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree;"
          that "he was once offered to bear the sins of many;" and that "he was
          numbered with the transgressors, and he bare the sin of many." About
          this we must never speak with bated breath, lest we be found
          unfaithful to our charge. And why, brethren, should we not joyfully
          proclaim this doctrine? for is it not the grandest, noblest, most
          divine, under heaven. The plan so adorns all the attributes of the
          Godhead, and furnishes such a safe footing for a trembling conscience
          to rest upon, such a fortress, castle, and high tower for faith to
          rejoice in, that we cannot do otherwise than love it. The very way and
          plan of it is dearer to our souls than life itself. Oh, then let us
          always say, "Let God be magnified," since he devised, arranged, and
          carried out this Godlike method of blending justice with mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, we also love God's salvation when we consider what was
          the object of it. The object of it towards us was to redeem unto
          Christ a people who should be zealous for good works. The sinner loves
          a salvation from hell, the saint loves a salvation from sin. Anybody
          would desire to be saved from the pit, but it is only a child of God
          who pants to be saved from every false way. We love the salvation of
          God because it saves us from selfishness, from pride, from lust, from
          worldliness, bitterness, malice, sloth, and uncleanness. When that
          salvation is completed in us we shall be "without spot or wrinkle or
          any such thing," and shall be renewed in holiness after the image of
          Christ Jesus our Lord. That its great aim is our perfection in
          holiness is the main beauty of salvation. We would be content to be
          poor, but we cannot be content to be sinful; we could be resigned to
          sickness, but we could not be satisfied to remain in alienation from
          God. We long for perfection and nothing short of it will content us,
          and, because this is guaranteed to the believer in the gospel of
          Christ, we love his salvation, and we would say continually, "Let God
          be magnified."
        </p>
        <p>
          I might thus enlarge upon every part of this salvation, and say that
          it endears itself to us under every aspect, and from every point of
          view.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love his salvation because of one or two characteristics in it
          which especially excite our delight. Foremost is the matchless love
          displayed in it. Why should the Lord have loved men, such
          insignificant creatures as they are, compared with the universe? Why
          should he set his heart upon such nothings? But more, how could he
          love rebellious men who have wantonly and arrogantly broken his laws?
          Why should he love them so much as to give up his only begotten? These
          are things we freely speak of, but who among us knows what is their
          weight.; "God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet
          sinners, Christ died for us." I believe that even in heaven, with
          enlarged faculties, it will be a subject of perpetual wonder to us
          that ever God could love and save us. And shall we not love the
          salvation which wells up from the deep fount of the Father's
          everlasting affection? O brethren, our hearts must be harder than
          adamant, and made of hell-hardened steel, if we can at once believe
          that we are saved and yet not love, intensely love the salvation which
          was devised by Jehovah's heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love his salvation, again, because, in addition to the display of
          wondrous love, it is so safe a salvation, so real, so true: we have
          not given heed to cunningly devised fables; we have not chanced our
          souls upon a fiction. We run no risk when we trust the Savior. Though
          one of our hymns puts it: --
        </p>
        <p>"Venture on Him, venture wholly,</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude."</p>
        <p>
          This is only a condescension to the feelings of trembling unbelievers,
          for there is no venture in it; it is sure and certain. Did God lay on
          Christ my sin? Was it really punished in him? Then there cannot exist
          a reason why I should be condemned, but there are ten thousand
          arguments why I should for ever be "accepted in the beloved." "Who
          shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
          justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
          rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
          also maketh intercession for us." Substitution is a basis for
          intelligent confidence; it satisfies both the demand of the law and
          the fears of conscience; and gives to believers a deep, settled,
          substantial peace, which cannot be broken. We love this salvation
          because we feel that it places a foundation of granite beneath our
          feet instead of the quicksand of human merit. Justice being satisfied
          is as much our friend as even mercy herself; in fact, all the
          attributes unite to guarantee our safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love God's salvation, too, because it is so complete. Nothing
          remains unfinished which is necessary to remove sin from the believer
          and give him righteousness before God. As far as atonement for sin is
          concerned, the expiation is most gloriously complete. Remember that
          remarkable expression of the apostle, where he describes the priests
          as continually standing at the altar, offering sacrifice year by year,
          and even day by day, because atonement by such means could never be
          finished. Such sacrifices could never take away sin; therefore must
          they be perpetually offered, and the priest must always stand at the
          altar. "But," saith the apostle, "this man (our great Melchisedec),
          after he had offered one sacrifice for sin for ever, sat down (for the
          work was accomplished), sat down at the right hand of God." Jesus has
          performed what the Aaronic priesthood, in long succession, had failed
          to do. Though streams of blood might flow from bullock, and from goat,
          like Kishon's mighty river, and though incense might smoke till the
          pile thereof was high as Lebanon, with all her goodly cedars, what was
          there in all this to make propitiation for sin? The work was but
          shadowed, the real expiation was not offered; it was a fair picture,
          but the substance itself was not there. But, when our Divine Lord went
          up to Calvary, and on the cross gave up his body, his soul, his
          spirit, a sacrifice for sin, he finished transgression, made an end of
          sin, and brought in everlasting righteousness. Herein, my brethren, we
          have strong consolation, the immutable things wherein it is impossible
          for God to lie, his word and oath, are our immovable security. By the
          atonement we are infallibly, effectually, eternally saved, for he has
          become the "author of eternal salvation, unto all them that obey him."
          How we love this salvation! Our inmost heart rejoines in it! I rejoice
          to preach it, brethren, and I delight to muse upon it, appropriating
          it to myself by faith in solitary thought. How it makes the tears
          stream down one's cheeks with joy, to think "He loved me, and gave
          himself for me: he took my sins, and he destroyed them, they have
          ceased to be, they are annihilated, they are blotted out like a cloud,
          and like a thick cloud have they vanished." Surely, we should have
          lost sanity, as well as grace, if we did not love this salvation,
          beyond the choicest joys of earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus I have described the character, and now, secondly, we will
          meditate on THE SAYING. Every nation has its idiom, every language has
          its shibboleth, almost every district has its proverb. Behold the
          idiom of gracious souls, listen to their household word, their common
          proverb, -- it is this, "Let God be magnified! Let God be magnified!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us proceed at once to the consideration of it, I trust it belongs
          to us, it certainly does if we love his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that this is a saying which is founded upon truth and justice.
          "Let God be magnified," for it is he that saved us, and not we
          ourselves. We trace our salvation not to our ministers, nor to any
          pretentious priesthood. None can divide the honors of grace, for the
          Lord alone hath turned our captivity. He decreed our salvation,
          planned it, arranged it, executed it, applied it, and secures it. From
          beginning to end salvation is of the Lord, therefore, let God be
          magnified. Moreover, the Lord wrought salvation that he might be
          magnified thereby. It was God's object in salvation to glorify his own
          name. "Not for your sakes do I this, O house of Israel." Truly we
          desire that the Lord's end and purpose should be fully subserved, for
          it is his well-deserved due. O thou who hast bled upon the cross, may
          thy throne be glorious! O thou who wast despised and rejected of men,
          be thou extolled, and be thou very high. Thou deservest all glory,
          great and merciful God. Such a gift, such a sacrifice, such a work;
          thou oughtest indeed to be lauded and had in honor by all the
          intelligent universe. The saying is settled deep in truth, and
          established in right.
        </p>
        <p>
          This saying is naturally suggested by love. It is because we love his
          salvation that we say, "The Lord be magnified." You cannot love God
          without desiring to magnify him, and I am sure that you cannot know
          that you are saved without loving him. For here is a wonder, a central
          wonder of wonders to many of us, that ever we in particular were
          saved. I do not think I could be so wonder-struck and amazed at the
          salvation of you all as at my own. I should know it to be infinite
          mercy that saved any one of you, or all of you, I say I should know
          it, but in my own case I feel it is an unspeakable and inconceivably
          great mercy which has saved me; and I suppose each brother here, each
          sister here will feel a special love to Christ from the fact of being
          himself or herself an object of his love. We never sing, I am sure,
          with warmer hearts any hymn in our hymn-book than that one --
        </p>
        <p>"What was there in us that could merit esteem,</p>
        <p>Or give the Creator delight?</p>
        <p>Twas even so Father, we ever must sing,</p>
        <p>For so it seemed good in thy sight."</p>
        <p>
          The Lord might have left as he has left others to carry out their own
          wills, and wilfully to reject the Savior, but since he has made us
          willing in the day of his power, we are for ever beyond measure under
          obligations to him. Let us say continually, "The Lord be magnified,
          which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servants."
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this saying of our text is deeply sincere and practical. I
          am sure David did not wish to see hypocrites multiplied; but such
          would be the case if men merely said, "Let God be magnified," and did
          not mean it. No doubt there is a great deal among professors of mere
          expression without meaning; it is sadly evident that much godly talk
          is only talk, but it ought not so to be. You know, how often charity
          is assumed, and men say to the naked and hungry, "Be ye warmed, and be
          ye filled;" but they give nothing to the poor, except vain words,
          which cannot profit them. So, too, often professors will sing: --
        </p>
        <p>"Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel,</p>
        <p>Win and conquer, never cease;</p>
        <p>May thy lasting wide dominion</p>
        <p>Multiply and still increase."</p>
        <p>
          and so on; but there it ends; they have said it, but they have done
          nothing for it. Now, as he is condemned as a hypocrite who merely
          utters words of charity without deeds, so is he who shall say, "Let
          God be magnified," but who does not put forth his hand and throw in
          all his energies to promote that which he professes to desire. The
          wish must be, and oh! if we are saved by grace, it will be sincere,
          intense, and fervent in every believing heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it must not only be sincere, but it must be paramount. I
          take it that there is nothing which a Christian man should say
          continually, except this, "Let God be magnified." That which a man may
          say continually is assuredly the master-thought of his mind. Listen to
          the cherubim and seraphim; they continually do cry, "Holy! Holy! Holy!
          Lord God of Hosts!" Why cry they thus continually? Is it not because
          it is their chief business, their highest delight? So should it be
          with us; our end and aim should ever be to glorify him who redeemed us
          by his most precious blood. You are a citizen, but you are more a
          Christian. You are a father, but you are more a child of God. You are
          a laborer, but you are most of all a servant of the Most High. You are
          wealthy, but yet more enriched by his covenant. You are poor, but you
          are most emphatically rich if Christ is yours. The first, chief,
          leading, lordly, master-thought within you must be this, "Let God be
          magnified."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, brethren, the text tells us this must be continual. How earnest
          you feel about the cause of Christ when you have heard an inspiriting
          sermon, but how long does it last? Ah, those old days of mission
          enterprise, when Exeter Hall used to be crowded because missionaries
          had interesting stories to tell of what God was doing -- what
          enthusiasm there used to be -- where is it now? Where is it now? Echo
          might well answer "where is it now?" To a great degree it has
          departed. The zeal of many rises and falls like a barometer. They are
          hot as fire, and cold as ice, in the shortest space; their fervor is
          as transient as the flame of thorns, and hence it is very hard to turn
          it to any practical account. Oh, for more of the deep-seated principle
          of intense love to God's salvation, steady and abiding, which shall
          make a man say continually, "Let God be magnified." We would desire to
          wake up in the morning with this on our lips. We would begin with the
          enquiry, "What can I do to magnify God this day?" We would be in
          business in the middle of the day, and yet never lose the one desire
          to magnify God. We would return to our family at night, urged by the
          same impulse, "How can I magnify God in my household?" If I lie sick,
          I would feel that I must magnify God by patience; if I rise from that
          bed, I would feel the sweet obligation to magnify him by gratitude; if
          I take a prominent position, I am doubly bound to magnify him who
          makes me a leader to his dock, and, if I be unknown and obscure in the
          church, I must with equal zeal magnify him by a conscientious
          discharge of the duties of my position. Oh, to have one end always
          before us, and to press forward towards it, neither turning to the
          right hand nor to the left. As though we were balls shot out of a
          rifled cannon we would rush on, never hesitating or turning aside, but
          flying with all speed towards the center of the target. May our
          spirits be impelled by a divine energy towards this one only thing.
          The Lord be magnified! whether I live or die, may God be glorified in
          me!
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the text, this saying should be universal among the
          saints. It should be the mark of all those that love God's salvation,
          pertaining not to a few who shall be chosen to minister in public, but
          to all those whom grace has renewed. All of us, women as well as men,
          illiterate as well as learned, poor as well as rich, silent as well as
          eloquent, should after our own ability say, "Let God be magnified."
          Oh, would to God we were all stirred up to this! Our churches seem to
          be half alive. It is a dreadful thing to read of the punishment
          practiced by ancient tyrants when they tied a living man to a corpse,
          and he had to go about with this corpse strapped to him, and rotting
          under his nostrils, and yet that is too often the condition of the
          living ones in our churches: they are bound by ties of church union to
          a portion of the church which is spiritually dead, though not so
          manifestly corrupt as to render it possible for us to cut it off. The
          tares, which we may not root up, hamper and dwarf the wheat. O God,
          the Holy Ghost, make the church alive right through, from the crown of
          its head to the sole of its foot, so that the whole church may cry
          continually, "Let God be magnified."
        </p>
        <p>
          You will notice that the cry is an absolute one. It does not say, let
          God be magnified by me if he will please to make me successful in
          business, and happy, and healthy, but it leaves it open. Only let God
          be magnified, and he may do what he wills with me. As a poor soldier
          in the regiment of Christ, I only care for this that HE may win the
          day, and if I see him riding on his white horse and know that he is
          conquering, though I lie bleeding and wounded in a ditch, I will clap
          my hands and say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord." Though I be poor,
          and despised, and reproached, this shall compensate for all, if I can
          only hear that "him hath God highly exalted, and given him a name that
          is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
          of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
          that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
          glory of God the Father." I would close my eyes in death, and say, my
          soul is satisfied with favor and hath all she wants if Jesus be
          exalted. Remember how David put it: when he had said "Let the whole
          earth be filled with his glory," he added, "Amen and amen. The prayers
          of David, the son of Jesse, are ended." He desired no more than that;
          that was the ultimatum of his wishes. Beloved, I trust it is the same
          with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is there any limit as to place or persons. My heart says, "Let God
          be magnified among the Wesleyans! The Lord be magnified among the
          Independents! The Lord be magnified among the Episcopalians! The Lord
          be magnified among the Baptists!" We pray very earnestly, "Let God be
          magnified in the Tabernacle," but we would not forget to cry, "Let God
          be magnified in all parts of London, in all counties of England, and
          Scotland, and Ireland." We desire no restriction as to race -- let God
          be magnified both in France and in Prussia; in Turkey and in Italy; in
          the United States and in Australia; among any and every people! So
          that God's name be magnified, what matters it how or where? We know no
          politics but this, "Let God be magnified." All nationalities sink
          before our relation to our God. Christians are cosmopolitan; we are
          burgesses of the New Jerusalem -- there is our citizenship; we are
          freemen of the entire new creation. What is all else to God's glory!
          So long as the Lord is glorified, let the empires go and the emperors
          with them; let nations rise or fall, so long as he comes whose right
          it is to reign; let ancient dynasties pass away, if his throne is but
          exalted. We would never dictate to the God of history; let him write
          out as he pleases the stanzas of his own august poem, but let this
          always be the close of every verse, "The Lord be magnified! The Lord
          be magnified! The Lord be magnified!" This is the continual saying of
          all them that love his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We had much to say under our second head, but time will not tarry
          for us; therefore we must proceed to the last, which is THE WISH. Holy
          David, and David's perfect Lord both wish that we may say, "Let God be
          magnified." This wish is promoted by an anxiety for God's glory; it is
          a most holy wish, and it ought to be fulfilled. I shall ask your
          attention only for a minute or two to the reasons of the wish. Why
          should it be wished?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because it always ought to be said, "Let God be magnified." It
          is only right, and according to the fitness of things, that God should
          be magnified in the world which he himself created. Such a handiwork
          deserves admiration from all who behold it. But when he new-made the
          world, and especially when he laid the foundation of his new palace in
          the fair colors of Jesus' blood, and adorned it with the sapphires of
          grace and truth; he had a double claim upon our praise. He gave his
          Son to redeem us, and for this let his praise be great and endless.
          Things are out of joint if God the Redeemer be not glorified. Surely
          the wheels of nature revolve amiss, if God the loving and gracious be
          not greatly magnified. As every right-hearted man desires to see right
          and justice done, therefore does he wish that those who love God's
          salvation may say continually, "Let God be magnified."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, we wish it next, because it always needs saying. The world is
          dull and sleepy, and utterly indifferent to the glory of God in the
          work of redemption. We need to tell it over and over and over again,
          that God is great in the salvation of his people. There are many, Who
          will rise up and deny God's Glory; revilers of all sorts abound in
          rage; but over and above their clamor, let the voice of truth be
          heard, "Let God be magnified." They cry, "the Bible is worn out." They
          doubt its inspiration, they question the deity of Christ, they set up
          new gods that have lately come up, that our fathers knew not. Let us
          confront them with the truth, let us oppose them with the gospel, let
          us overcome them through the blood of the Lamb, using this one only
          war-cry, "Let God be magnified." Everywhere in answer to all
          blasphemy, in direct conflict with profanity, let us lift up this
          voice with heart and soul. "Let God be magnified."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, again, we desire this, because the saying of this continually
          does good to the sayers. He who blesses God blesses himself. We cannot
          serve God with the heart without serving ourselves most practically.
          Nothing, brethren, is more for your benefit than to spend and be spent
          for the promotion of the divine honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, this promotes the welfare of God's creatures. We ought to
          desire to spread the knowledge of God, because the dark places of the
          earth will never cease to be the habitation of cruelty till they
          become the temple of the Lord of hosts. Myriads are dying, while we
          are sitting complacently here souls are passing into eternity
          unforgiven. The wrath of God is abiding still upon the sons of men,
          for they know not Christ. What stronger motive could there be for
          desiring that God's name should continually be magnified. I have been
          told, and I believe it is the general impression, that at this
          particular time there is a great cessation of the zealous spirit which
          once ruled among Christians. We have passed over the heroic age, the
          golden period of missions, and we have come to the time in which the
          church rests upon her oars, takes matters quietly, what if I say
          regards them hopelessly? Very few young men are now coming forward, at
          least in our denomination, to offer themselves for missionaries; the
          funds are barely sustained and nothing more. I fear there is among
          those who conduct the affairs of missions too little of faith, and too
          much of bastard prudence, which last had better be banished to the
          bottomless pit at once, for it has long been the clog upon the chariot
          wheels of the gospel. Faith is too much cast into the background, and
          the work is viewed in a mercantile light, as though it were a rule of
          three sum -- so much money and so many men, and then so many
          conversions, whereas it is not so. God worketh not according to
          arithmetical rules and calculations. There is, I fear, on the whole, a
          general backsliding from the right state; and what a sad thing it is
          that it should be so, since at our best we were never too zealous. Few
          can bring the charge of fanaticism against the English Baptists: we
          have been too solid, if not stolid, for that. I almost wish it were
          possible for us to err in that direction, for if an evil it would at
          any rate be a novelty, if not an improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this, and whence comes it? Years ago our fathers compassed this
          Jericho, they passed round it according to the Master's bidding, and
          are we about, after having done the same these many years, to
          relinquish the task, and lose the result? Do we fear that the walls
          will never fall to the ground? Brethren, I believe it is the duty of
          the Christian church to go on working quite as earnestly and zealously
          and believingly, if there be no conversions, as if half the world were
          transformed in a twelve month. Our business is not to create a harvest
          but to sow the seed; if the wheat does not come up, if we have sown it
          aright, our Master does not hold us responsible. If missions had been
          an utter failure it would be no sort of reason why we should give them
          up. There was a great failure when the hosts of Israel, on the first
          occasion, went round Jericho; a dreadful failure when they marched
          round the city twice, and the walls shook not; it was an aggravated
          failure when they had compassed it four times; it was a most
          discouraging defeat when they had tramped round it five times; and, on
          the whole, a breakdown, almost enough to drive them to despair, when
          they had performed the circuit six times and not a single brick had
          stirred in the wall. Yes; but then the seventh day made amends, when
          the people shouted and all the walls fell flat to the ground.
          Brethren, it is not yet time to shout, but we must continue marching
          and say, "Let God be magnified." The longer the walls stand, and the
          longer we wait, the louder will be our shout when they lie prostrate
          before us, as they shall; for, "Verily, verily, I say unto you there
          shall not be one stone left upon another that shall not be cast down."
          Remember the Greeks when they attacked old Troy: ye have the record in
          ancient story. They waited many years till their ships had well nigh
          rotted on the seas, but the prowess of Hector and the armed men of
          Troy kept back the "King of men," and all the hosts of the avengers.
          Suppose that after nine years had dragged along their weary length,
          the chiefs of the Greeks had said, "It is of no avail, the city is
          impregnable! O Pelasgi, back to your fair lands washed by the blue
          Aegean, you will never subdue the valor of Ilium." No.; but they
          persevered in the weary siege, with feats of strength and schemes of
          art, till at last they saw the city burned and heard the dire lament:
          "Troy was, but is no more"
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us still continue to attack the adversary. We are few, but
          strength lies not in numbers. The Eternal One has used the few where
          he has put aside the many. In our weakness lies part of our adaptation
          to the divine work; only let us gather up fresh faith, and renew our
          courage and industry, and we shall see greater things than these.
          "Pshaw," says one, "Protestant Christianity is in a miserable
          minority, it is ridiculous to suppose it will ever be the dominant
          religion of the world." We reply, that it is ridiculous, nay
          blasphemous, to doubt when God has sworn with an oath that "all flesh
          shall see the salvation of God." God's oath is better evidence than
          appearances; for, in a moment, if he wills it, he can give such an
          impetus to the Christian church, that she shall in her enthusiasm
          spread the gospel, and at the same time he can give such a turn to the
          human mind, that it shall be as ready to accept the gospel as the
          church is to spread it. Observe how the church grew during the first
          few centuries. After the apostles had died you do not find in the next
          century the name of any very remarkable man, but all Christians then
          were earnest, and the good cause advanced. They were mostly poor, they
          were generally illiterate, but they were all missionaries, they were
          all seeking to glorify God, and, consequently, before long, down went
          Jupiter, Saturn lost his throne, even Venus was abjured, and the
          cross, at least nominally, became supreme throughout all Europe. It
          shall be done again. In the name of the Eternal, let us set up our
          banners. Oh, ye that love the Lord and his salvation, vow it in your
          souls, determine it in your hearts, and, God the Holy Spirit being
          with you, if you have but faith in him, it will be no empty boast, no
          vain vaunting. God shall speak and it shall be done. The Lord of hosts
          is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge; and such being the case,
          nothing is impossible to us.

          May the Lord stir us up with these thoughts, and fling us like
          firebrands into the midst of his church and the world, to set both on
          a blaze with love through the love that burns in our hearts. "Let God
          be magnified." Amen and Amen.
