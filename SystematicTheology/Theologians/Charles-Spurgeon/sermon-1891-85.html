          1. But again, we allege the same against those who do not recognise
          Paul as an apostle: that they should either reject the other words of
          the Gospel which we have come to know through Luke alone, and not make
          use of them; or else, if they do receive all these, they must
          necessarily admit also that testimony concerning Paul, when he (Luke)
          tells us that the Lord spoke at first to him from heaven: "Saul, Saul,
          why persecutest thou Me? I am Jesus Christ, whom thou persecutest;"
          and then to Ananias, saying regarding him: "Go thy way; for he is a
          chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name among the Gentiles, and kings,
          and the children of Israel. For I will show him, from this time, how
          great things he must suffer for My name's sake." Those, therefore, who
          do not accept of him [as a teacher], who was chosen by God for this
          purpose, that he might boldly bear His name, as being sent to the
          forementioned nations, do despise the election of God, and separate
          themselves from the company of the apostles. For neither can they
          contend that Paul was no apostle, when he was chosen for this purpose;
          nor can they prove Luke guilty of falsehood, when he proclaims the
          truth to us with all diligence. It may be, indeed, that it was with
          this view that God set forth very many Gospel truths, through Luke's
          instrumentality, which all should esteem it necessary to use, in order
          that all persons, following his subsequent testimony, which treats
          upon the acts and the doctrine of the apostles, and holding the
          unadulterated rule of truth, may be saved. His testimony, therefore,
          is true, and the doctrine of the apostles is open and stedfast,
          holding nothing in reserve; nor did they teach one set of doctrines in
          private, and another in public.

          2. For this is the subterfuge of false persons, evil seducers, and
          hypocrites, as they act who are from Valentinus. These men discourse
          to the multitude about those who belong to the Church, whom they do
          themselves term "vulgar," and "ecclesiastic." By these words they
          entrap the more simple, and entice them, imitating our phraseology,
          that these [dupes] may listen to them the oftener; and then these are
          asked regarding us, how it is, that when they hold doctrines similar
          to ours, we, without cause, keep ourselves aloof from their company;
          and [how it is, that] when they say the same things, and hold the same
          doctrine, we call them heretics? When they have thus, by means of
          questions, overthrown the faith of any, and rendered them
          uncontradicting hearers of their own, they describe to them in private
          the unspeakable mystery of their Pleroma. But they are altogether
          deceived, who imagine that they may learn from the Scriptural texts
          adduced by heretics, that [doctrine] which their words plausibly
          teach. For error is plausible, and bears a resemblance to the truth,
          but requires to be disguised; while truth is without disguise, and
          therefore has been entrusted to children. And if any one of their
          auditors do indeed demand explanations, or start objections to them,
          they affirm that he is one not capable of receiving the truth, and not
          having from above the seed [derived] from their Mother; and thus
          really give him no reply, but simply declare that he is of the
          intermediate regions, that is, belongs to animal natures. But if any
          one do yield himself up to them like a little sheep, and follows out
          their practice, and their "redemption," such an one is puffed up to
          such an extent, that he thinks he is neither in heaven nor on earth,
          but that he has passed within the Pleroma; and having already embraced
          his angel, he walks with a strutting gait and a supercilious
          countenance, possessing all the pompous air of a cock. There are those
          among them who assert that that man who comes from above ought to
          follow a good course of conduct; wherefore they do also pretend a
          gravity [of demeanour] with a certain superciliousness. The majority,
          however, having become scoffers also, as if already perfect, and
          living without regard [to appearances], yea, in contempt [of that
          which is good], call themselves "the spiritual," and allege that they
          have already become acquainted with that place of refreshing which is
          within their Pleroma.

          3. But let us revert to the same line of argument [hitherto pursued].
          For when it has been manifestly declared, that they who were the
          preachers of the truth and the apostles of liberty termed no one else
          God, or named him Lord, except the only true God the Father, and His
          Word, who has the pre-eminence in all things; it shall then be clearly
          proved, that they (the apostles) confessed as the Lord God Him who was
          the Creator of heaven and earth, who also spoke with Moses, gave to
          him the dispensation of the law, and who called the fathers; and that
          they knew no other. The opinion of the apostles, therefore, and of
          those (Mark and Luke) who learned from their words, concerning God,
          has been made manifest.<br />
