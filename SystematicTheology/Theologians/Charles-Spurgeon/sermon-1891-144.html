          1. [In order to learn] that bodies did continue in existence for a
          lengthened period, as long as it was God's good pleasure that they
          should flourish, let [these heretics] read the Scriptures, and they
          will find that our predecessors advanced beyond seven hundred, eight
          hundred, and nine hundred years of age; and that their bodies kept
          pace with the protracted length of their days, and participated in
          life as long as God willed that they should live. But why do I refer
          to these men? For Enoch, when he pleased God, was translated in the
          same body in which he did please Him, thus pointing out by
          anticipation the translation of the just. Elijah, too, was caught up
          [when he was yet] in the substance of the [natural] form; thus
          exhibiting in prophecy the assumption of those who are spiritual, and
          that nothing stood in the way of their body being translated and
          caught up. For by means of the very same hands through which they were
          moulded at the beginning, did they receive this translation and
          assumption. For in Adam the hands of God had become accustomed to set
          in order, to rule, and to sustain His own workmanship, and to bring it
          and place it where they pleased. Where, then, was the first man
          placed? In paradise certainly, as the Scripture declares "And God
          planted a garden [paradisum] eastward in Eden, and there He placed the
          man whom He had formed." And then afterwards when [man] proved
          disobedient, he was cast out thence into this world. Wherefore also
          the elders who were disciples of the apostles tell us that those who
          were translated were transferred to that place (for paradise has been
          prepared for righteous men, such as have the Spirit; in which place
          also Paul the apostle, when he was caught up, heard words which are
          unspeakable as regards us in our present condition ), and that there
          shall they who have been translated remain until the consummation [of
          all things], as a prelude to immortality.
        </p>

          2. If, however, any one imagine it impossible that men should survive
          for such a length of time, and that Elias was not caught up in the
          flesh, but that his flesh was consumed in the fiery chariot, let him
          consider that Jonah, when he had been cast into the deep, and
          swallowed down into the whale's belly, was by the command of God again
          thrown out safe upon the land. And then, again, when Ananias, Azarias,
          and MisaÃ«l were cast into the furnace of fire sevenfold heated, they
          sustained no harm whatever, neither was the smell of fire perceived
          upon them. As, therefore, the hand of God was present with them,
          working out marvellous things in their case -- [things] impossible [to
          be accomplished] by man's nature -- what wonder was it, if also in the
          case of those who were translated it performed something wonderful,
          working in obedience to the will of God, even the Father? Now this is
          the Son of God, as the Scripture represents Nebuchadnezzar the king as
          having said, "Did not we cast three men bound into the furnace? and,
          lo, I do see four walking in the midst of the fire, and the fourth is
          like the Son of God." Neither the nature of any created thing,
          therefore, nor the weakness of the flesh, can prevail against the will
          of God. For God is not subject to created things, but created things
          to God; and all things yield obedience to His will. Wherefore also the
          Lord declares, "The things which are impossible with men, are possible
          with God." As, therefore, it might seem to the men of the present day,
          who are ignorant of God's appointment, to be a thing incredible and
          impossible that any man could live for such a number of years, yet
          those who were before us did live [to such an age], and those who were
          translated do live as an earnest of the future length of days; and [as
          it might also appear impossible] that from the whale's belly and from
          the fiery furnace men issued forth unhurt, yet they nevertheless did
          so, led forth as it were by the hand of God, for the purpose of
          declaring His power: so also now, although some, not knowing the power
          and promise of God, may oppose their own salvation, deeming it
          impossible for God, who raises up the dead; to have power to confer
          upon them eternal duration, yet the scepticism of men of this stamp
          shall not render the faithfulness of God of none effect.
