        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.152)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 20, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Things that accompany Salvation." -- Hebrews 6:9.</p>
        <p>
          I AM not quite certain that my text will warrant all I shall say upon
          it this day if read and understood in its connection. But I have taken
          the words rather by accommodation than otherwise, and shall make use
          of them as a kind of heading to the discourse which I hope to be
          enabled to deliver. I sat myself down, and I meditated on this subject
          -- "Things that accompany Salvation." And after some period of
          rumination, my thoughts assumed the form of an allegory; in which I
          hope to present them to you this morning. I compared Salvation to a
          rich and costly treasure, which God in his infinite love and mercy had
          determined to send into the world, and I remembered that our Lord
          Jesus was so much interested in the bringing of this Salvation to this
          earth, that he did send all that he had, and came himself to attend
          and to accompany this Salvation. I then pictured to myself a great
          march of bright ones through this land, carrying in their midst the
          sacred jewel of Salvation. I looked forward, and I saw a mighty
          van-guard, who already had attained the shores of Eternity. I looked
          around Salvation, and I saw it always in every case attended with
          divers graces and virtues which seemed to be like troops and soldiers
          to guard it in the ran, about its flanks, and in the rear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we begin, however, let us just make this caution. When the
          Apostle speaks of virtues and of graces, he calls them "things that
          accompany Salvation," not things which cause it. Our faith does not
          cause Salvation, nor our hope, nor our love, nor our good works; they
          are things which attend it as its guard of honor. The origin of
          Salvation lies alone in the sovereign will of God the Father; in the
          infinite efficacy of the blood of Jesus -- God the Son, and in the
          divine influence of God the Holy Spirit. There are, however, "things
          that accompany Salvation." Picture then to yourselves the march of
          some ancient monarch through his territory. We read stories of eastern
          monarchs in the olden time, that seem more like romance than reality;
          when they marched with thousands of flying banners and with all kinds
          of riches borne with them. Now you are to take that as the basis of my
          figure and suppose Salvation to be the sacred treasure which is being
          carried through the world, with guards before and guards behind, to
          accompany it on its journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will begin, then, with the advance-guard that has accompanied
          Salvation or rather gone before it. We shall then come to those who
          immediately precede it, and then we shall notice those who accompany
          it by its side, and conclude by noticing the rear guard attending upon
          this Salvation of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, IN THE MARCHES OF TROOPS AND ARMIES, THERE ARE SOME
          THAT ARE OUTRIDERS, AND GO FAR AHEAD OF THE OTHER TROOPS. So in the
          march of Salvation," which have far preceded it to clear the way. I
          will tell you the names of these stupendous Titans who have gone
          before. The first is Election, the second is Predestination, the third
          is Redemption and the Covenant is the captain of them all. Before
          Salvation came into this world, Election marched in the very
          forefront, and it had for its work the billeting of Salvation.
          Election went through the world and marked the houses to which
          Salvation should come and the hearts in which the treasure should be
          deposited. Election looked through all the race man, from Adam down to
          the last, and marked with sacred stamp those for whom Salvation was
          designed. "He must needs go through Samaria," said Election; and
          Salvation must go there. Then came Predestination. Predestination did
          not merely mark the house, but it mapped the road in which Salvation
          should travel to that house, Predestination ordained every step of the
          great army of Salvation, it ordained the time when the sinner should
          be brought to Christ, the manner how he should be saved, the means
          that should be employed; it marked the exact hour and moment, when God
          the Spirit should quicken the dead in sin, and when peace and pardon
          should be spoken through the blood of Jesus. Predestination marked the
          way so completely, that Salvation doth never overstep the bounds, and
          it is never at a loss for the road. In the everlasting decree of the
          Sovereign God, the footsteps of Mercy were every one of them ordained.
          As nothing in this world revolves by chance -- as even the foreknown
          station of a rush by the river is as fixed as the station of a king --
          it was not meet that Salvation should be left to chance; and therefore
          God has mapped the place where it should pitch its tent, the manner of
          its footsteps to that tent, and the time when it should arrive there.
          Then came Redemption. The way was rough; and though Election had
          marked the house, and Predestination had mapped the road, the way was
          so impeded that Salvation could not travel it until it had been
          cleared. Forth came Redemption, it had but one weapon; that weapon was
          the all-victorious cross of Christ. There stood the mountains of our
          sins; Redemption smote them, and they split in halves and left a
          valley for the Lord's redeemed to march through. There was the great
          gulph of God's offended wrath; Redemption bridged it with the cross,
          and so left an everlasting passage by which the armies of the Lord may
          cross. Redemption has tunnelled every mountain; it has dried up every
          sea, cut down every forest; it has levelled every high hill, and
          filled up the valleys, so that the road of Salvation is now plain and
          simple. God can be just, and yet the justifier of the ungodly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this sacred advance-guard carry for their banner the Eternal
          Covenant. Election, Predestination, and Redemption -- the things that
          have gone before, beyond the sight, are all rallied to the battle by
          this standard -- the Covenant, the Everlasting Covenant, ordered in
          all things and sure. We know and believe that before the morning star
          startled the shades of darkness, God had covenanted with his Son that
          he should die and pay a ransom price, and that, on God the Father's
          part, he would give to Jesus "a number whom no man could number," who
          should be purchased by his blood, and through that blood should be
          most securely saved. Now, when Election marches forward, it carries
          the Covenant. These are chosen in the Covenant of grace. When
          Predestination marcheth, and when it marketh out the way of Salvation,
          it proclaims the Covenant. "He marked out the places of the people
          according to the tribes of Israel." And Redemption also, pointing to
          the precious blood of Christ, claims Salvation for the blood-bought
          ones, because the Covenant hath decreed it to be theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear hearers, this advance-guard is so far ahead that you and
          I cannot see them. These are true doctrines, but very mysterious; they
          are beyond our sight, and if we wish to see Salvation, we must not
          stop until we see the van-guard, because they are so far off that only
          the eye of faith can reach them. We must have that sacred glass, that
          divine telescope of faith, or else we shall never have the evidence of
          things not seen. Let us rest certain, however, that if we have
          Salvation we have Election. He that believeth is elected whoever casts
          himself on Christ as a guilty sinner, is certainly God's chosen child.
          As sure as ever you believe on the Saviour, and go to him, you were
          predestinated to do so from all eternity, and your faith is the great
          mark and evidence that you are chosen of God, and precious in his
          esteem. Dost thou believe? Then Election is thine. Dost thou believe?
          Then Predestination is as surely thine as thou art alive. Dost thou
          trust alone in Jesus? Then fear not, Redemption was meant for thee. So
          then, we will not be struck with terror at that grand advance-guard
          that hath already gained the celestial hill, and have prepared the
          place where the elect shall for ever repose upon the bosom of their
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But mark, we are about to review THE ARMY THAT IMMEDIATELY
          PRECEDES SALVATION; and first, in the forefront of these, there
          marches one whose name we must pronounce with sacred awe. It is God,
          the Holy Spirit. Before anything can be done in our salvation, there
          must come that Third Person of the Sacred Trinity. Without him, faith,
          repentance, humility, love, are things quite impossible. Even the
          blood of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot save until it has been applied
          to the heart by God the Holy Spirit. Before we notice the grand army,
          then, that immediately precedes Salvation, let us be cautious that we
          do not forget Him who is the leader of them all. The great King,
          Immortal, invisible, the Divine person, called the Holy Ghost, the
          Holy Spirit: it is he that quickens the soul, or else it would lie
          dead for ever; it is he that makes it tender, or else it would never
          feel, it is he that imparts efficacy to the Word preached, or else it
          could never reach further than the ear; it is he who breaks the heart,
          it is he who makes it whole: he, from first to last, is the great
          worker of Salvation in us just as Jesus Christ was the author of
          Salvation for us. O soul, by this mayest thou know whether Salvation
          has come to thine house -- art thou a partaker of the Holy Spirit?
          Come now, answer thou this question -- hath he ever breathed on thee?
          Hath he ever breathed into thee? Canst thou say that thou hast been
          the subject of his supernatural influence? For, if not, remember
          except a man be born of the Spirit from above, he cannot see the
          kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; only that
          which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Thy best exertions will be all
          unavailing unless the Holy Ghost shall work in thee, to will and to do
          of God's good pleasure. The highest efforts of the flesh can never
          reach higher than the flesh, just as water of itself will never run
          higher than its source. You may be moral, you may be strictly upright,
          you may be much that is commendable, but unless you be partakers of
          the Holy Spirit, salvation is as impossible to you as it is even to
          the lost. We must be born again, and born again by that divine
          influence, or else it is all in vain. Remember, then, that the Spirit
          of God always accompanies Salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, close in the rear of the adorable Spirit follow the
          Thundering Legion. No sooner does God the Holy Ghost come into the
          soul, than he brings with him what I have called the Thundering
          Legion; and those of you that have been saved will not be at a loss to
          understand what I mean. This Thundering Legion are clad in mail, their
          helmets wave with horror; their speech is rough like men that come
          from a far country; their faces are terrible to look upon, for they
          are like unto lions, and do terribly affright the timid. Some of the
          men in this Thundering Legion bear with them swords; with these swords
          they are to slay the sinner. For before he can be made whole, he must
          be spiritually killed, the sword must pierce him, and must slay all
          his selfishness before he can be brought to the Lord Jesus. Then
          another body of them carry with them axes, with which they cut down
          the thick trees of our pride and abase the goodly cedars of our
          righteousness. There are with them those that fill up the wells with
          stones, and break up all the cisterns of our carnal sufficiency, until
          we are driven to despair, having all our hopes despoiled. Then come
          those who, with brazen trumpets, or with trumps of ram's horns -- like
          those who once razed Jericho level with the ground -- do blow a blast,
          so shrill and dread, that the sinner thinks that even the yells of
          hell itself could not be more terrible. Then come those who with
          lances pierce the spirit through and through; and in the rear are the
          ten great guns, the artillery of the law, which, perpetually fire upon
          the wounded spirit till it knows not what it is, nor what it does. My
          friend, has this Thundering Legion ever come to your house? Have they
          ever taken up their quarters in your heart? For, rest assured, these
          are some of the "things that accompany Salvation." What I have said is
          no allegory to those who have been converted, but it may be a mystery
          to those who know not the Lord. Understand, then, that the first work
          of God the Spirit in the soul is a terrible work. Before a man can be
          truly converted, he must suffer great agony of spirit; all our
          self-righteousness must be laid level with the ground, and trampled
          like the miry streets. Our carnal hopes must, every one of them, be
          cut in pieces, and our refuges of lies must be swept away with the
          hail of God's anger. The law of God will appear terrible to the sinner
          when he is first convinced of sin. "What have I done?" he will say. Or
          rather, "What have I undone? I have undone myself." See him when God
          the Spirit has first convinced him of sin; you would think him mad; he
          is thought to be mad by his worldly companions. He weeps lay and
          night, tears become his meat and his drink; he can scarcely sleep for
          the dreams of hell, and when he wakes he thinks he feels it already."
          Oh, the wrath to come, the wrath to come, the wrath to come!" that
          seems to be ever pressing on his heart. He is like John Bunyan's
          pilgrim, he has a heavy burden on his back, and he knows not how to
          get rid of it, he wrings his hands and cries "What shall I do? I am
          undone. I have rebelled against God, and God is angry with me." Ah, I
          tell you this Thundering Legion is a terrible thing indeed. God be
          praised, when once they go out of the heart there is some joy; but
          whilst they are billited in the conscience of man, I defy him to eat
          or drink with any mirth or joy. The poor town of Mansoul is hung with
          black all the time these rough soldiers are there. Hideous
          threatenings and doleful forebodings are the sinner's only company in
          such a case. He seeks to find a little hope and comfort in his own
          doings; down comes the hammer of the Law, and breaks all his doings to
          pieces. He thinks, well he will rest on the couch of Indifference and
          Sloth; forth comes the Law, ties him to the halberts, takes its
          ten-thonged whip and begins to lay on to him with all his might till
          his heart bleeds again. Then comes Conscience with its brine, and
          washes him all over; and he is exceedingly tormented, for even his bed
          is become a bed of spikes and thorns. This Thundering Legion always
          precedes Salvation. More or less of terrors every man must feel before
          he is converted. Some have less, some have more; but there must be
          some measure of this terrible law work in the soul, or else Salvation
          is not come to a man's house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, Thundering Legion, ye are gone; we hear their trumpets and the
          dying echoes still appal us. We can remember, brethren, those terrible
          days when they were in our house and in our heart. They are gone. What
          see we in the rear of them? Close in the rear there follows a broken
          heart. Look at it; do not despise it, God never despises it, do not
          thou. "A broken and a contrite heart O God thou wilt not despise." I
          see how this poor broken heart is broken; it is rent to its very eye
          and center; it is bathed in tears; it is overwhelmed with suffering.
          See its humility; it never talks about boasting now. Mark its
          repentance, the sins it loved before it hates now; it speaks not about
          self-salvation. Hear it, as the broken heart speaks out its broken
          language. Hear it -- "Lord have mercy upon me a sinner!" Do not fear
          to come and look at this broken heart; how sweetly is it perfumed! The
          sacred smell of a sacrifice which God approves rises from it. Hear it,
          as again it speaks -- "Lord, save, or I perish." See this poor broken
          heart when it is in the world and at its business; it interrupts its
          business with ejaculations like these -- "Oh that -- Ah, ah -- would
          that!" And when it can get alone, it pours out its heart before God,
          and cries,
        </p>
        <p>Unclean, unclean, and full of sin</p>
        <p>From first to last, O Lord I've been;</p>
        <p>Deceitful is my heart.'</p>
        <p>
          Oh wash my soul in Jesus' blood; forgive me all my guilt, and I will
          be thy servant for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear hearers, has this broken heart ever come to your house? Rest
          assured I am speaking God's own truth, that admits of no dispute --
          unless this broken heart has come within your bosom you cannot be made
          partakers of Christ. The heart must first be pounded in the mortar of
          conviction, and beaten in pieces with the pestle of the law, or else
          it never can receive the grace of the Comforter in all its plenitude.
          Are you broken-hearted to-day? Are you sorrowful at this very hour? Be
          of good cheer, Salvation is not far behind. When there is once a
          broken heart there is mercy very near. The broken heart is the prelude
          of healing. He that kills will make whole; he that woundeth will bind
          up; he that smote will cure. God is looking on thee with love, and
          will have mercy upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          But who are those that follow in the rear? Another troop, another
          legion, but these are far different from the rest. The silken legion
          follow, these are not clad in steel; they have no helmets of war upon
          their head; they have smiling looks and countenances that are full of
          joy. No weapons of war in their hands; no thunders do they utter, but
          they speak kind words of pity, and their hands are full of
          benedictions. Shall I tell you who this silken legion are? There is a
          troop of them who take the poor wounded heart, and wash it first in
          blood; they sprinkle on it the sacred blood of the Atonement; and it
          is amazing how the poor broken heart, though faint and sick, revives
          at the first drop of the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
          when well washed in blood, another of this legion steps forward and
          takes it and washes it in water -- for both water and blood flowed
          from the Saviour's heart.
        </p>
        <p>"Let the water and the blood,</p>
        <p>From thy wounded side which flow'd</p>
        <p>Be of sin the double cure,</p>
        <p>Cleanse me from its guilt and power"</p>
        <p>
          And oh, what a washing it is! The heart that was once black as the
          coals of hell, seems white as the snow of Lebanon. When it has once
          been bathed in the bath of the Saviour's blood and water, oh, how pure
          it becomes! He who was black as the tents of Kedar becomes fair as the
          curtains of Solomon. Then follow those who pour oil and wine into the
          wounds of this poor broken heart, so that where it smarted before, the
          wounds begin to sing. The sacred oil and wine of the precious promise
          is poured into every wound; and then follow those who with downy
          fingers bind up the heart with the sacred liniment of Promise till it
          seems no longer broken, but the broken heart rejoices. The whole heart
          sings for gladness; for God hath restored its strength and bound up
          all its wounds, according to his promise: "He healeth the broken in
          heart, and bindeth up their wounds." And then, since the work is not
          quite done, there come those who carry the King's ward-robe; and with
          the things out of this rich storehouse they array the soul from head
          to foot; they clothe it with everything that for lustre and for glory
          could adorn it, and make it bright as the spirits before the throne.
          And then the King's jewellers come in and complete the whole: they
          array the soul with ornaments, and bedeck it with precious stones. As
          the Father said, "Briny forth the best robe and put it on him, and put
          a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet," even so do this Silken
          Legion wash and heal and cleanse and glorify the once poor broken
          heart. Have these ever come to your house? It is an allegory, but it
          is all plain to him that understandeth it. Sinner, hast thou ever had
          the blood of Christ applied to thee?
        </p>
        <p>"Couldst thou look and see the flowing</p>
        <p>Of his soul's redeeming blood,</p>
        <p>With divine assurance knowing</p>
        <p>He hath made thy peace with God?"</p>
        <p>
          Dost thou this hour lay thine hand on the dear head of Christ; confess
          thy sin, and believe that he was punished for thee? Thou canst? Then,
          verily salvation is thine. And has thine heart been ever washed with
          water? Say, dost thou hate sin? Is thy guilt all cleansed, and is the
          power of guilt cut away, so that thou dost not love the ways of
          iniquity, nor seek to run in the paths of transgressors. Then thou art
          an heir of heaven. And say, poor sinner, hast thou ever been arrayed
          in the robe of Jesus' righteousness? Couldst thou ever fondly hope
          that thou wast accepted in the Beloved? Methinks I see thee with the
          tear in thine eye, and hear thee saying, I have sometimes sung with
          all my heart --
        </p>
        <p>Jesus, thy blood and righteousness</p>
        <p>My beauty are, my glorious dress;</p>
        <p>'Midst flaming worlds, in these array'd,</p>
        <p>With joy shall I lift my head.</p>
        <p>Bold shall I stand in that great day,</p>
        <p>For who aught to my charge shall lay?</p>
        <p>Fully absolved through Christ I am</p>
        <p>From sin's tremendous curse and shame."</p>
        <p>
          And now we have not yet come to a full conviction of Salvation. The
          Silken Legion are gone; their banners are still flying in the gale,
          and their trumpets of promise are still making the air glad with
          melody. What cometh next? Now come those that are the actual
          attendants upon Salvation -- or rather, that march in the rank
          immediately before it. There are four of these, called Repentance,
          Humility, Prayer and a tender Conscience. Just before the full
          assurance of Salvation there marches Humility. She is of a downcast
          look; she is not sad, but she hath no high looks; she scarcely dares
          to lift her eye to the place where God's honor dwelleth. She is often
          looking downwards, remembering her past estate thinking of all the
          bitterness and the guilt of her previous life. She never boast; of
          what God has done for her, she looks to the hole of the pit and the
          miry clay from whence she was digged. She knows she has been washed in
          the blood of the Saviour, but she remembers how black she was before
          she was washed, and oh, she laments the past although she rejoices in
          the present. She feels her own weakness, she dares not stand alone she
          leans on the arm of her Beloved, for she knows that she should fall to
          the ground unless he should constantly maintain her. Side by side with
          her, is her sister called Repentance, watering the ground with tears
          to lay the dust before the King. Wherever she goes she weeps and if
          you ask her why, she will tell you she does not weep because of a fear
          of hell -- that is all gone. The Silken Legion yonder, she tells you,
          have wiped all her fears away; but she weeps because she smote the
          Lord that loved her so well she beats her breast, and cries --
        </p>
        <p>"Twas you, my sins, my cruel sins,</p>
        <p>His chief tormentors were;</p>
        <p>Each of my crimes became a nail,</p>
        <p>And unbelief the spear."</p>
        <p>
          The more you tell her of her Salvation, the more she weeps to think
          she could have rebelled against such a Saviour. She is confident that
          her sins are blotted out; she knows her Master has forgiven her; but
          she never will forgive herself. Then side by side with Repentance is
          one called Prayer. He is a priest, and he waves in his hand a censer
          full of odoriferous incense, that the way for the King may be
          prepared, that wherever he marches there may be a sweet perfume.
          Prayer riseth by midnight to call upon God, its waking eyes salute the
          rising sun, that it may lift up its heart to Jehovah, and when the sun
          is setting, Prayer will not let his wheel be hidden beneath the
          horizon, until in his chariot he hath carried supplication. Then in
          this company is the fourth of those immediately attending upon
          Salvation, a tender Conscience. This tender Conscience is afraid to
          put one foot before the other, lest it should put its foot in the
          wrong place. Poor tender Conscience; some despise him; but he is dear
          to the King's heart. I would to God, my brethren, you and I knew more
          about him. I used to know a conscience so tender, that I would wish to
          feel it again. Then we questioned the lawfulness of every act before
          we committed it, and then, though it was lawful we would stop to see
          if it were expedient and if we thought it expedient, even then we
          would not do it, except we felt it would be abundantly honorable to
          the Lord our God. Every doctrine we used to scruple at, lest we should
          believe a lie; every ordinance we examined, lest we should commit
          idolatry; happy were the days when tender Conscience went with us. And
          now, my hearers, do you know anything about these four? Has Humility
          ever come to you? Has she ever abased your pride and taught you to lie
          in the dust before God? Has Repentance ever watered the floor of your
          hearts with tears? Have you ever been led to weep in secret for your
          sins, and to bewail your iniquities? Has Prayer ever entered your
          spirit? Remember, a prayerless soul is a Christless soul. Have you
          learned to pray, not with the parrot's cry, but with the heart's ever
          fresh expression. Have you ever learned to pray? And lastly are you
          tender of Conscience, for unless your conscience is made tender,
          salvation has not met you, for these are the immediate attendants upon
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now comes SALVATION IN ALL ITS FULLESS. The "things that
          accompany Salvation" make a glorious march in the forefront of it --
          from Election down to these precious opening buds of virtue in the
          sinner's heart. What a goodly array! Sure the angels do sometimes fly
          along in admiration, and see this long array that heralds Salvation to
          the heart. And now comes the precious casket set with gems and jewels.
          It is of God-like workmanship; no hammer was ever lifted on it, it was
          smitten out and fashioned upon the anvil of Eternal blight, and cast
          in the mould of Everlasting Wisdom; but no human hand hath ever
          defiled it, and it is set with jewels so unutterably precious, that if
          heaven and earth were sold they could never buy another Salvation! And
          who are those that are close around it? There are three sweet sisters
          that always have the custody of the treasure -- you know them, their
          names are common in Scripture -- Faith, Hope, and Love, the three
          divine sisters; these have Salvation in their bowels and do carry it
          about with them in their loins. Faith, who layeth hold on Christ, and
          trusteth all in him; that ventureth everything upon his blood and
          sacrifice, and hath no other trust. Hope, that with beaming eye looks
          up to Jesus Christ in glory, and expects him soon to come: looks
          downward, and when she sees grim Death in her way, expecting that she
          shall pass through with victory. And thou sweet Love, the sweetest of
          the three, she whose words are music and whose eyes are stars; Love,
          also looks to Christ and is enamoured of him; loves him in all his
          offices, adores his presence, reverences his words, and is prepared to
          bind her body to the stake and die for him, who bound his body to the
          cross to die for her. Sweet Love, God hath well chosen to commit to
          thee the custody of the sacred work. Faith, Hope, and Love -- say
          sinner, hast thou these three? Dost thou believe that Jesus is the Son
          of God? Dost thou hope that through the efficacy of his merits thou
          shalt see thy Maker's face with joy? Dost thou love him? Say, couldst
          thou repeat after me,
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus! I love thy charming name,</p>
        <p>'Tis music to my ear;</p>
        <p>Fain would I sound it out so loud</p>
        <p>That earth and heaven might hear.</p>
        <p>Yes, thou art precious to my soul,</p>
        <p>My transport and my trust;</p>
        <p>Jewels to thee are gaudy toys,</p>
        <p>And gold is sordid dust."</p>
        <p>
          Have you these three graces? If so, you have Salvation. Having that,
          you ere rich to all intents of bliss; for God in the Covenant is
          yours. Cast your eye forward; remember Election is yours,
          Predestination and Sovereign Decree are both yours; remember, the
          terrors of the law are past; the broken heart is mourning; the
          comforts of religion you have already received; the spiritual graces
          are already in the bud, you are an heir of immortality, and for you
          there is a glorious future. These are the "things that accompany
          Salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now you must have patience with me for just a few more minutes; I
          MUST BRING UP THE REAR GUARD. It is impossible that with such a van
          guard, grace should be unattended from behind. Now see those that
          follow Salvation. As there were fair bright cherubs that walked in
          front of it -- you remember still their names -- Humility, Repentance,
          Prayer, and a tender Conscience -- there are four that follow it, and
          march in solemn pomp into the sinner's heart. The first of these is
          Gratitude -- always singing, "Bless the Lord O my soul, and all that
          is within me bless his holy name." And then Gratitude lays hold upon
          its son's hand; the name of that son is Obedience. "O my master,
          "saith the hears, "thou hast done so much for me; I will obey thee" --
        </p>
        <p>"Help me to run in thy commands,</p>
        <p>'Tis a delightful road;</p>
        <p>Nor let my heart, nor hands, nor feet,</p>
        <p>Offend against my God."</p>
        <p>
          In company with this fair grace is one called Consecration -- a pure
          white spirit that hath no earthliness; from its head to its foot it is
          all God's, and all gold. Hear it speak --
        </p>
        <p>"All that I am and all I have</p>
        <p>Shall be for ever thine;</p>
        <p>What e'er my duty bids me give,</p>
        <p>My cheerful hands resign.</p>
        <p>And if I might make some reserve,</p>
        <p>And duty did not call,</p>
        <p>I love my God with zeal so great,</p>
        <p>That I would give him all."</p>
        <p>
          Linked to this bright one, is one with a face Serene and solemn,
          called Knowledge, "Then shall ye know when ye follow on to know the
          Lord." whose that are saved understand mysteries, they know the love
          of Christ; they "know him, whom to know is life eternal."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, have you these four? They are rather the successors of Salvation
          than the heralds of it. "Oh yes," the believer can say, "I trust I
          have Gratitude. Obedience, Consecration, and Knowledge." I will not
          weary you, but there are three shining ones that follow after these
          four, and I must not forget them, for they are the flower of them all.
          There is Zeal with eyes of fire, and heart of flame a tongue that
          burneth, a hand that never wearies and limbs that never tire. Zeal,
          that flies round the world with wings swifter than the lightning's
          flash, and finds even then he-wings too tardy for her wish. Zeal, ever
          ready to obey, resigning up itself for Christ, jealously affected
          always in a good thing. This Zeal always dwells near one that is
          called Communion. This, sure, is the goodliest of all the train; an
          angel spiritualised, an angel purified and made yet more angelic, is
          Communion. Communion calls in secret on its God; its God in secret
          sees. It is conformed to the image of Jesus; walks according to his
          footsteps, and lays its head perpetually on his bosom. And as a
          necessary consequence, on the other side of Communion -- which with
          one hand lays hold of Zeal, is Joy -- joy in the Spirit. Joy, that
          hath an eye more flashing than the world's merriment ever gave to
          mortal beauty, with light foot trips over hills of sorrow, singing in
          the roughest ways, of faithfulness and love. Joy, like the
          nightingale, sings in the dark, and can praise God in the tempest and
          shout his high praises in the storm. This is indeed a fitting cherub
          to be in the rear of Salvation. Do not forget these other three; they
          are after works of the Spirit, they are high attainments -- Zeal,
          Communion, and Joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have almost done. Just in the rear is Perseverance, final,
          certain and sure. Then there follows complete Sanctification, whereby
          the soul is purged from every sin, and made as white and pure as God
          himself. Now we have come to the very rear of the army; but remember
          as there was an advance guard so far ahead that we could not see them,
          so there is a rear guard so far behind that we cannot behold them now.
          Let us just try to see them with the eye of faith. We have seen the
          army; we have traced it from the Thundering Legion, guided by the Holy
          Spirit, till we have finished it by complete Sanctification. Hark, I
          hear the silver trumpet sound; there is a glorious array behind. A
          guard, far, far back are coming following the steps of the conquering
          heroes, that have already swept our Sills away. Do you not see in the
          fore part there is one, whom men paint a skeleton. Look at him, he is
          not the King's terrors. I know thee, Death, I know thee. Miserably men
          have belied thee. Thou art no spectre, thine hand bears no dart; thou
          art not gaunt and frightful. I know thee, thou bright cherub: thou
          hast not in thy hand a dart, but a golden key that unlocks the gates
          of Paradise. Thou art fair to look upon, thy wings are like the wings
          of doves, covered with silver and like yellow gold. Behold this angel
          Death, and his successor Resurrection. I see three bright things
          coming; one is called Confidence, see it! it looks at Death; no fear
          is in its eye, no palor on its brow. See holy Confidence marches with
          steady steps, the cold chill stream of Death doth not freeze its
          blood. See behind it its brother Victory; hear him, as he cries, "O
          Death, where is thy sting? O Grave where is thy victory?" The last
          word, "victory," is drowned amidst the shouts of angels. These bring
          up the rear. Angels bear the spirits of the redeemed into the bosom of
          the Saviour --
        </p>
        <p>"Far from a world of grief and sin,</p>
        <p>With God eternally shut in,</p>
        <p>They are for ever blest."</p>
        <p>
          And now follow everlasting songs -- "Praise him, praise him, King of
          kings and Lord of lords; he hath gotten him the victory. Hallelujah,
          hallelujah, hallelujah, world without end! Hallelujah, yet again!" Let
          the echoes of eternity perpetually cry, "Hallelujah! for"
        </p>
        <p>"THINGS THAT ACCOMPANY YOUR SALVATION."<br /></p>
