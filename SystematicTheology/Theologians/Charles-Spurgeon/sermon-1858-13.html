        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.177)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 14, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more then the
          hearts of the children of men?" -- Proverbs 15:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU HAVE OFTEN smiled at the ignorance of heathens who bow themselves
          before gods of wood and stone. You have quoted the words of Scripture,
          and you have said, "Eyes have they but they see not; ears have they,
          but they hear not." You have therefore argued that they could not be
          gods at all, because they could neither see nor hear, and you have
          smiled contemptuously at the men who could so debase their
          understandings as to make such things objects of adoration. May I ask
          you one question -- but one? Your God can both see and hear: would
          your conduct be in any respect different, if you had a god such as
          those that the heathen worship? Suppose for one minute, that Jehovah,
          who is nominally adored in this land, could be (though it is almost
          blasphemy to suppose it) smitten with such a blindness, that he could
          not see the works and know the thoughts of man: would you then become
          more careless concerning him than you are now? I trow not. In nine
          cases out of ten, and perhaps in a far larger and sadder proportion,
          the doctrine of Divine Omniscience, although it is received and
          believed, has no practical effect upon our lives at all. The mass of
          mankind forget God: whole nations who know his existence and believe
          that he beholds them, live as if they had no God at all. Merchants,
          farmers, men in their shops, and in their fields, husbands in their
          families, and wives in the midst of their households, live as if there
          were no God; no eye inspecting them; no ear listening to the voice of
          their lips, and no eternal mind always treasuring up the recollection
          of their acts. Ah! we are practical Atheists, the mass of us; yea, all
          but those that have been born again, and have passed from death unto
          life, be their creeds what they may, are Atheists, after all, in life;
          for if there were no God, and no hereafter, multitudes of men would
          never be affected by the change; they would live the same as they do
          now -- their lives being so full of disregard of God and his ways,
          that the absence of a God could not affect them in any great degree.
          Permit me, then, this morning, as God shall help me, to stir up your
          hearts; and may God grant that something I may say, may drive some of
          your practical Atheism out of you. I would endeavor to set before you,
          God, the all-seeing one, and press upon your solemn consideration the
          tremendous fact, that in all our acts, in all our ways, and in all our
          thoughts, we are continually under his observing eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have in our text, first of all, a great fact declared, -- "Hell and
          destruction are before the Lord ;" we have, secondly, a great fact
          inferred, -- "How much more then the hearts of the children of men?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We will begin with THE GREAT FACT WHICH IS DECLARED -- a fact which
          furnishes us with premises from which we deduce the practical
          conclusion of the second sentence -- "How much more then the hearts of
          the children of men?" The best interpretation that you can give of
          those two words, "hell" and "destruction," is, I think, comprehended
          in a sentence something like this, -- "Death and hell are before the
          Lord." The separate state of departed spirits, and destruction,
          Abaddon, as the Hebrew has it, the place of torment, are both of them,
          although solemnly mysterious to us, manifest enough to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, then, the word here translated "hell," might just as well be
          translated "death," or the state of departed spirits. Now, death, with
          all its solemn consequences, is visible before the Lord. Between us
          and the hereafter of departed spirits a great black cloud is hanging.
          Here and there, the Holy Spirit hath made chinks, as it were, in the
          black wall of separation, through which, by faith we can see; for he
          hath "revealed unto us by the Spirit" the things which "eye hath not
          seen nor ear heard," and which the human intellect could never
          compass. Yet, what we know is but very little. When men die, they pass
          beyond the realm of our knowledge: both in body and in soul, they go
          beyond our understandings. But God understands all the secrets of
          death. Let us divide these into several heads, and enumerate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          God knows the burial-places of all his people. He notes as well the
          resting-place of the man who is buried tombless and alone, as the man
          over whom a mighty mausoleum has been raised. The traveler who fell in
          the barren desert, whose body became the prey of the vulture, and
          whose bones were bleached in the sun -- the mariner, who was wrecked
          far out at sea, and over whose corpse no dirge was ever wailed, except
          the howling of the winds, and the murmuring of the wild waves -- the
          thousands who have perished in battle, unnumbered and unnoticed -- the
          many who have died alone, amid dreary forests, frozen seas, and
          devouring snow-storms -- all these, and the places of their sepulchre,
          are known to God. That silent grot within the sea, where pearls lie
          deep, where now the shipwrecked one is sleeping, is marked by God as
          the death-place of one of his redeemed; that place upon the
          mountain-side, the deep ravine into which the traveler fell and was
          buried in a snow-drift, is marked in the memory of God as the tomb of
          one of the human race. No body of man, however it may have been
          interred or uninterred, has passed beyond the range of God's
          knowledge. Blessed be his name, if I shall die, and lie where the rude
          forefathers of the hamlet sleep, in some neglected corner of the
          churchyard, I shall be known as well, and rise as well recognized by
          my glorious Father, as if interred in the cathedral, where forests of
          gothic pillars proudly stand erect, and where the songs of myriads
          perpetually salute high heaven. I shall be known as well as if I had
          been buried there in solemn pomp, and had been interred with music and
          with dread solemnities, and I shall be recognized as well as if the
          marble trophy and the famous pillar had been raised to my remembrance;
          for God knoweth no such thing as forgetfulness of the burying-places
          of his children. Moses sleeps in some spot that eye hath not seen. God
          kissed away his soul, and he buried him where Israel could never find
          him, though they may have searched for him. But God knoweth where
          Moses sleeps; and if he knows that, he understands where all his
          children are hidden. Ye cannot bell me where is the tomb of Adam; ye
          could not point out to me the sleeping place of Abel. Is any man able
          to discover the tomb of Methuselah and those long-lived dwellers in
          the time before the flood? Who shall tell where the once-treasured
          body of Joseph now sleeps in faith? Can any of you discover the tombs
          of the kings, and mark the exact spot where David and Solomon rest in
          solitary grandeur? No, those things have passed from human
          recollection, and we know not where the great and mighty of the past
          are buried; but God knoweth, for death and Hades are open before the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, further, not only does he know the place where they were
          buried, but he is cognizant of the history of all their bodies after
          sepulture or after death. It has often been asked by the infidel, "How
          can the body of man be restored, when it may have been eaten by the
          cannibal, or devoured by wild beasts?" Our simple reply is, that God
          can track every atom of it if he pleases. We do not think it necessary
          to resurrection that he should do so, but if he so willed it, he could
          bring every atom of every body that hath ever died: although it hath
          passed through the most complicated machinery of nature, and become
          entangled in its passage with plants and beasts, yea, and with the
          bodies of other men, God hath it still within the range of his
          knowledge to know where every atom is, and it is within the might of
          his Omnipotence to call every atom from its wandering, and restore it
          to its proper sphere, and rebuild the body of which it was a part. It
          is true, we could not track the dust that long since has moldered.
          Buried with exactest care, preserved with the most scrupulous
          reverence, years passed away, and the body of the monarch, which had
          long slept well guarded and protected, was at last reached by the
          careless hand. The coffin had moldered, and the metal was broken for
          the sake of its own value; a handful of dust was discovered, the last
          relics of one who was master of many nations. That dust by
          sacrilegious hand was cast in the aisle of the church, or thrown into
          the churchyard and blown by the winds into the neighboring field. It
          was impossible for ever to preserve it; the greatest care was
          defeated; and at last the monarch was on a level with his slave,
          "alike unknowing and unknown." But God knows where every particle of
          the handful of dust has gone: he has marked in his book the wandering
          of every one of its atoms. He hath death so open before his view, that
          he can bring all these together, bone to bone, and clothe them with
          the very flesh that robed them in the days of yore, and make them live
          again. Death is open before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the body, so the soul when separated from the body, is before
          the Lord. We look upon the countenance of our dying friend, and on a
          sudden a mysterious change passes over his frame. "His soul has fled,"
          we say. But have we any idea of what his soul is? Can we form even a
          conjecture of what the flying of that soul may be, and what the august
          presence into which it is ushered when it is disentangled from its
          earthly coil? Is it possible for us to guess what is that state where
          Spirits without bodies, perpetually blest, behold their God? It is
          possible for us to compass some imagination of what heaven is to be,
          when bodies and souls, reunited, shall before God's throne enjoy the
          highest bliss; but I do think, that so gross are our conceptions,
          whilst we are in our bodies, that it is almost, if not quite,
          impossible for any of us to form any idea whatever as to the position
          of souls, whilst in the disembodied state, between the hour of death
          and the time of resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>"This much, and this is all, we know;</p>
        <p>They are supremely blest:</p>
        <p>Have done with sin, and care, and woe,</p>
        <p>And with their Saviour rest."</p>
        <p>
          But the best of the saints can tell us nothing more than this. They
          are blest, and in paradise they are reigning with their Lord.
          Brethren, these things are known to God. The separate state of the
          dead, the heaven of disembodied spirits, is within the gaze of the
          Most High, and at this hour, if so he pleased, he could reveal to us
          the condition of every man that is dead -- whether he has mounted to
          Elysian fields, to dwell for ever in the sunlight of his Master's
          countenance, or has been plunged into hell, dragged down by iron
          chains, to wait in dreary woe the result of the awful trial, when
          "Depart ye cursed," must be the re-affirmation of a sentence once
          pronounced, and already in part endured. God understands the separate
          doom of every man's spirit before the great tribunal day -- before the
          last sentence shall have been pronounced, death is open before the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The next word, "destruction," signifies hell, or the place of the
          damned. That also is open before the Lord. Where hell is, and what its
          miseries, we know not; except "through a glass darkly," we have never
          seen the invisible things of horror. That land of terror is a land
          unknown. We have much reason to thank God that he has put it so far
          off from the habitations of living mortals, that the pains, the
          groans, the shrieks, the yells, are not to be heard here, or else
          earth itself would have become a hell, the solemn prelude and the
          ante-past of unutterable torment. God has put somewhere, far on the
          edge of his dominions, a tearful lake that burneth with fire and
          brimstone; into that he cast the rebel angels, who (though by a
          license they are now allowed to walk the earth) do carry a hell within
          their bosoms, and are by-and-by to be bound with chains, reserved in
          blackness and darkness for ever for them that kept not their first
          estate, but lifted the arm of their rebellion against God. Into that
          place we dare not look. Perhaps it would not be possible for any man
          to get a fair idea of the torments of the lost, without at once
          becoming mad. Reason would reel at such a sight of horror. One moment
          of listening to the shrill screams of spirits tortured, might forever
          drive us into the depths of despair, and make us only fit to be bound
          in chains whilst we lived on earth. Raving lunatics surely we must
          become. But whilst God has mercifully covered all these things from
          us, they are all known to him; he looks upon them; yea, it is his look
          that makes hell what it is. His eyes, full of fury, flash the
          lightnings that scathe his enemies; his lips, full of dreadful
          thunders, make the thunders that now Upright the wicked. O, could they
          escape the eye of God, could they shut out that dreary vision of the
          face of the incensed Majesty of heaven, then might hell be quenched;
          then might the wheels of Ixion stand still; then might doomed Tantalus
          quench his thirst and eat to his very full. But there, whilst they lie
          in their chains, they look upward, and they see ever that fearful
          vision of the Most High; the dreadful hands that grasp the
          thunderbolts, the dreadful lips that speak the thunders, and the
          fearful eyes that flash the flames that burn their souls, with horrors
          deeper than despair. Yes, hell, horrible as it is, and veiled in many
          clouds, and covered over with darkness, is naked before the vision of
          the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is the grand fact stated -- "Hell and destruction are before the
          Lord." After this the inference seems to be easy -- "How much more
          then the hearts of the children of men?"
        </p>
        <p>II. We now come to the GRAND FACT INFERRED.</p>
        <p>
          In briefly entering upon this second part I will discuss the subject
          thus: You notice there an argument -- "How much more then the hearts
          of the children of men?" I will therefore begin by asking, why does it
          follow that the hearts of men are seen by God?<br />Why -- how -- what
          -- when -- shall be four questions into which we shall divide what we
          have now to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Why is it so clear, that "if hell and destruction are open before
          the Lord," the hearts of men must be very plainly viewed by him?
        </p>
        <p>
          We answer, because the hearts of men are not so extensive as the
          realms of death and torment. What is man's heart? what is man's self?
          Is he not in Scripture compared to a grasshopper? Does not God declare
          that he "takes up the isles" -- whole islands full of men -- "as a
          very little thing; And the nations before him are but as the drop of a
          bucket?" If, then, the all-seeing eye of God takes in at one glance
          the wide regions of death -- and wide they are, wide enough to startle
          any man who shall try to range them through -- if, I say, with one
          glance God seeth death and seeth hell through, with all its bottomless
          depths, with all its boundlessness of misery, surely, then, he is
          quite able to behold all the actions of the little thing called man's
          heart. Suppose a man so wise is to be able to know the wants of a
          nation and to remember the feelings of myriads of men, you can not
          suppose it difficult for him to know the actions of his own family and
          to understand the emotions of his oven household. If the man is able
          to stretch his arm over a great sphere, and to say, "I am monarch of
          all this," surely he shall be able to control the less. He who in his
          wisdom can walk through centuries shall not say that he is ignorant of
          the history of a year; he who can dive into the depths of science, and
          understand the history of the whole world from its creation, is not to
          be alarmed by some small riddle that happens at his own door. No, the
          God who seeth death and hell seeth our hearth for they are far less
          extensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflect again, that they are far less aged too. Death is an ancient
          monarch; he is the only king whose dynasty stands fast. Ever since the
          days of Adam he has never been succeeded by another, and has never had
          an interregnum in his reign. His black ebon sceptre hath swept away
          generation after generation; his scythe hath mowed the fair fields of
          this earth a hundred times, and is sharp to mow us down, and when
          another crop shall succeed us he is still ready to devour the
          multitudes, and sweep the earth clean again. The regions of death are
          old domains; his pillars of black granite are ancient as the eternal
          hills. Death made his prey on earth long ere Adam was here. Those
          mighty creatures that made the deep hoary with their strength, and
          stirred the earth with their tramplings -- those elder born of natures
          sons, the mighty creatures that lived here long ere Adam walked in
          Eden -- death made them his prey: like a mighty hunter he speared the
          mighty lizard and laid it low, and now we dig it from the stony tomb,
          and wonder at it. He is our ancient monarch; but ancient as he is, his
          whole monarchy is in the records of God, and until death itself is
          dead, and swallowed up in victory, death shall be open before the
          Lord. How old, too, is death -- old as the first sin. In that day when
          Satan tempted the angels, and led astray the third part of the stars
          of heaven, then hell was digger; then was that bottomless pit first
          struck out of solid rocks of vengeance, that it might stand a
          marvelous record of what God's wrath can do. The fires of hell are not
          the kindlings of yesterday: they are ancient flames that burned long
          ere Vesuvius cast forth its lurid flame. Long ere the first charred
          ashes tell upon the plain from earth's red volcanoes, hell's flames
          we're burning; for "Tophet is prepared of old, the pile thereof is
          wood and much smoke; the breath of the Lord like a stream of
          brimstone, doth kindle it. If, then, the ancient things, these old
          ones, death and hell, have been observed by God, and if their total
          history is known to him, how much more then shall he know the history
          of those mere animalculae, those ephemera of an hour, that we call
          men! You are here to-day, and gone to-morrow; born yesterday -- the
          next hour shall see our tomb prepared, and another minute shall hear,
          "ashes to ashes, dust to dust," and the falling of the clod upon the
          coffin lid. We are the creatures of a day, and know nothing. We are
          scarcely here; we are only living and dead. "Gone!" is the greatest
          part of our history. Scarcely have we time enough to tell the story,
          ere it comes to its finis. Surely, then, God may easily understand the
          history of a beast, when he knows the history of the monarchies of
          death and hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the why. I need not give further arguments, though there be
          abundance deducible from the text. "How much more then the hearts of
          the children of men?"
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But now, how does God know the heart? I mean to what degree and to
          what extent does he understand and know that which is in man? I
          answer, Holy Scripture in divers places gives us most precise
          information. God knows the heart so well that he is said to "search"
          it. We all understand the figure of a search. There is a
          search-warrant out against some man who is supposed to be harboring a
          traitor in his house. The officer goes into the lower room, opens the
          door of every cupboard, looks into every closet, peers into every
          cranny, takes the key, descends into the cellar, turns over the coals,
          disturbs the wood, lest any one should be hidden there. Up stairs he
          goes: there is an old room that has not been open for years, -- it is
          opened. There is a huge chest: the lock is forced, and it is broken
          open. The very top of the house is searched, lest upon the slates or
          upon the tiles some one should be concealed. At last, when the search
          has been complete, the officer says, "It is impossible that there can
          be anybody here, for, from the tiles to the foundation, I have
          searched the house thoroughly through; I know the very spiders well,
          for I have seen the house completely." Now, it is just so that God
          knows our heart. He searches it -- searches into every nook, corner,
          crevice, and secret part; and the figure of the Lord is pushed further
          still. "The candle of the Lord," we are told, "searches the secret
          parts of the belly." As when we wish to find something, we take a
          candle, and look down upon the ground with great care, and turn up the
          dust. If it is some little piece of money we desire to find, we light
          a candle and sweep the house, and search diligently till we find it.
          Even so it is with God. He searches Jerusalem with candles, and pulls
          every thing to day-light. No partial search, like that of Laban, when
          he went into Rachel's tent to look for his idols. She put them in the
          camel's furniture, and sat upon them; but God looks into the camel's
          furniture, and all. "Can any hide himself in secret places, that I
          shall not see him? saith the Lord." His eye searches the heart, and
          looks into every part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another passage we are told that God tries the reins. That is even
          more than searching. The goldsmith when he takes gold, looks at it,
          and examines it carefully. "Ah!" says he, "but I don't understand this
          gold yet: I must try it." He thrusts it into the furnace; there coals
          are heaped upon it, and it is fused and melted, till he knows what
          there is of dross, and what there is of gold. Now, God knows to the
          very carat how much there is of sound gold in us, and how much of
          dross. There is no deceiving him. He has put our hearts into the
          furnace of his Omniscience; the furnace -- his knowledge -- tries us
          as completely as the goldsmith's crucible doth try the gold -- how
          much there is of hypocrisy, how much of truth -- how much of steam,
          how much of real -- how much of ignorance, how much of knowledge --
          how much of devotion, how much of blasphemy -- how much of
          carefulness, how much of carelessness. God knows the ingredients of
          the heart; he reduces the soul to its pristine metals; he divides it
          asunder -- so much of quartz, so much of gold, so much of dung, of
          dross, of wood, of hay, of stubble, so much of gold, silver, and
          precious stones. "The Lord trieth the hearts and searcheth the reins
          of the children of men."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is another description of God's knowledge of the heart. In one
          place of Sacred Writ -- (it will be well if you set your children to
          find out these places at home) -- God is said to ponder the heart.
          Now, you know, the Latin word ponder means weigh. The Lord weighs the
          heart. Old Master Quarles has got a picture of a great one putting a
          heart into one scale, and then putting the law, the Bible, into the
          other scale, to weigh it. This is what God does with men's hearts.
          They are often great, puffed-up, blown-out things, and people say,
          "What a great-hearted man that is!" But God does not judge by the
          appearance of a man's great heart nor the outside appearance of a good
          heart; but he puts it in the scales and weighs it -- puts his own Word
          in one scale and the heart in the other. He knows the exact weight --
          knows whether we have grace in the heart, which makes us good weight,
          or only pretence in the heart, which makes us weigh light weight when
          put into the scale. He searches the heart in every possible way, he
          puts it into the fire, and then thrusts it into the balances. Oh,
          might not God say of many of you, "I have searched your heart, and I
          have found vanity therein? Reprobate silver shall men call you; for
          God has put you in the furnace and rejected you." And then he might
          conclude his verdict by saying, "Mene, mene, tekel -- thou art weighed
          in the balances and found wanting." This, then, is the answer to the
          question, How?
        </p>
        <p>
          The next question was, What? What is it that God sees in man's heart?
          God sees in man's heart a great deal more than we think of God sees,
          and has seen in out hearts, lust, and blasphemy, and murder, and
          adultery, and malice and wrath, and all uncharitableness. The heart
          never can be painted too black, unless you daub it with something
          blacker than the devil himself. It is as base as it can be. You have
          never committed murder, but yet you have had murder in your heart; you
          may never have stained your hands with lusts and the aspersions of
          uncleanness, but still it is in the heart. Have you never imagined an
          evil thing? Has your soul never for a moment doted on a pleasure which
          you were too chaste to indulge in, but which for a moment you surveyed
          with at least some little complacency and delight? Has not imagination
          often pictured, even to the solitary monk in his cell, greater vice
          than men in public life have ever dreamed of? And may not even the
          divine in his closet be conscious that blasphemies, and murders, and
          lusts of the vilest class, can find a ready harbor even in the heart
          which he hopes is dedicated to God? Oh! beloved, it is a sight that no
          human eye could endure: the sight of a heart really laid bare before
          one's own inspection would startle us almost into insanity: but God
          sees the heart in all its bestial sensuousness, in all its wanderings
          and rebellions, in all its high mindedness and pride; God has searched
          and knows it altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          God sees all the heart's imaginations, and what they are let us not
          presume to tell. O children of God, these have made you cry and groan
          full many a time, and though the worldling groans not over them, yet
          he hath them. Oh, what a filthy stye of Stygian imaginations is the
          heart; all full of every thing that is hideous, when it once begins to
          dance and make carnival and revelry concerning sin. But God sees the
          heart's imaginations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, God sees the heart's devices. You, perhaps, O sinner, have
          determined to curse God; you have not done so, but you intend to do
          it. He knows your devices -- reads them all. You perhaps will not be
          permitted to run into the excess of riotousness into which you purpose
          to go; but your very purpose is now undergoing the inspection of the
          Most High. There is never a design forged in the fires of the heart,
          before it is beaten on the anvil of resolve, that is not known, and
          seen, and noted by Jehovah our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knows, next, the resolves of the heart. He knows, O sinner, how
          many times you have resolved to repent, and have resolved and
          re-resolved, and then have continued the same. He knows, O thou that
          hast been sick, how thou didst resolve to seek God, but how thou didst
          despise thine own resolution, when good health had put thee beyond the
          temporary danger. Thy resolves have been filed in heaven, and thy
          broken promises, and thy vows despised, shall be brought out in their
          order as swift witnesses for thy condemnation. All these things are
          known of God. We have often had very clear proof of God's knowing what
          is in man's heart, even in the ministry. Some months ago, whilst
          standing here preaching, I deliberately pointed to a man in the midst
          of the crowd, and said these words -- "There is a man sitting there
          that is a shoemaker, keeps his shop open on Sunday, had his shop open
          last Sabbath morning, took ninepence, and -there was fourpence profit
          out of it. His soul is sold to Satan for fourpence." A City
          Missionary, when going round the West end of the town, met with a poor
          man, of whom he asked this question: "Do you know Mr. Spurgeon?" He
          found him reading a sermon. "Yes," he said, "I have every reason to
          know him; I have been to hear him, and under God's grace I have become
          a new man. "But," said he, "shall I tell you how it was? I went to the
          Music Hall, and took my seat in the middle of the place, and the man
          looked at me as if he knew me, and deliberately told the congregation
          that I was a shoemaker, and that I sold shoes on a Sunday; and I did,
          sir. But, sir, I should not have minded that; but he said I took
          ninepence the Sunday before, and that there was fourpence profit; and
          so I did take ninepence, and fourpence was just the profit, and how he
          should know that I'm sure I can not tell. It struck me it was God had
          spoken to my soul through him; and I shut my shop last Sunday, and was
          afraid to open it and go there, lest he should split about me again."
          I could tell as many as a dozen authentic stories of cases that have
          happened in this Hall, where I have deliberately pointed at some body,
          without the slightest knowledge of the person, or ever having in the
          least degree any inkling or idea that what I said was right, except
          that I believed I was moved thereto by the Spirit; and so striking has
          been the description, that the persons have gone away and said, "Come,
          see a man that told me all things that ever I did: he was sent of God
          to my soul, beyond a doubt, or else he could not have painted my case
          so clearly."
        </p>
        <p>
          And not only so, but we have known cases in which the thoughts of men
          have been revealed from the pulpit. I have sometimes seen persons
          nudge with their elbows, because they have got a smart hit, and I have
          heard them say, when they went out, "That is just what I said to you
          when I went in at the door." "Ah!" says the other, "I was thinking of
          the very thing he said, and he told me of it." Now, if God thus proves
          his own Omniscience by helping his poor, ignorant servant, to state
          the very thing, thought and done, when he did not know it, then it
          must remain decisively proved that God does know everything that is
          secret, because we see he tells it to men, and enables them to tell it
          to others. Oh, ye may endeavor as much as ye can to hide your faults
          from God, but beyond a doubt he shall discover you. He discovers you
          this day. His Word is "a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the
          heart," and "pierces to the dividing asunder of the joints and of the
          marrow;" and in that last day, when the book shall be opened, and he
          shall give to every man his sentence, then shall it be seen how exact,
          how careful, how precious, how personal was God's knowledge of the
          heart of every man whom he had made.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And now the last question: When? When does God see us? The answer
          is, he sees us everywhere and in every place. O foolish man, who
          thinks to hide himself from the Most High! It is night! no human eye
          sees thee; the curtain is drawn, and thou art hidden. There are his
          eyes lowering at thee through the gloom. It is a far-off country; no
          one knows thee; parents and friends have been left behind, restraints
          are cast off. There is a Father near thee, who looks upon thee even
          now. It is a lone spot, and if the deed be done, no tongue shall tell
          it. There is a tongue in heaven that shall tell it; yea, the beam out
          of the wall, and the stones in the field, shall raise up themselves as
          witnesses against thee. Canst thou hide thyself anywhere where God
          shall not detect thee? Is not this whole world like a glass hive,
          wherein we put our bees? and does not God stand and see all our
          motions when we think we are hidden? Ah, it is but a glass
          hiding-place. He looketh from heaven, and through stone walls and
          rocks; yea, to the very centre itself, does his eye pierce, and in the
          thickest darkness he beholds our deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, then, let me make a personal application of the matter, and I
          have done. If this be true, hypocrite, what a fool thou art! If God
          can read the heart, O man, what a sorry, sorry thing thy fair pretense
          must be! Ah! ah! ah! what a change will come over some of you! This
          world is a masquerade, and ye, many of you, wear the mask of religion.
          Ye dance your giddy hours, and men think you to be the saints of God.
          How changed will you be, when, at the door of eternity, you must drop
          the visor, and must announce the theatricals in which you live! How
          you will blush when the paint is washed from off your cheek -- when
          you stand before God naked to your own shame, a hypocrite, unclean,
          diseased, covered up before with the gew-gaws and the trickery of
          pretended formality in religion, but now standing there, base, vile,
          and hideous! There is many a man that bears about him a cancer that
          would make one sick to see. Oh, how shall hypocrites look when their
          cancerous hearts are laid bare! Deacon! how you will tremble when your
          old heart is torn open, and your vile pretences rent away! Minister!
          how black you will look when your surplice is off, and when your grand
          pretensions are cast to the dogs! How will you tremble! There will be
          no sermonizing others then. You yourself will be preached to, and the
          sermon shall be from that text, "Depart ye cursed." O brethren, above
          all things shun hypocrisy. If ye mean to be damned, make up your minds
          to it, and be damned like honest men; but do not, I beseech you,
          pretend to go to heaven while all the time you are going to hell. If
          ye mean to make your abodes in torment forever, then serve the devil,
          and do not be ashamed of it; stand it right out, and let the world
          know what you are. But oh! never put on the cloak of religion. I
          beseech you, do not add to your eternal misery being a wolf in sheep's
          clothing. Show the cloven foot; do not hide it. If you mean to go to
          hell, say so. "If God be God, serve him. If Baal be God, serve him."
          Do not serve Baal and then pretend to be serving God.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other practical conclusion. If God sees and knows everything, how
          this ought to make you tremble -- you that have lived in sin for many
          years! I have known a man who was once stopped from an act of sin by
          the fact of there being a cat in the room. He could not bear even the
          eyes of that poor creature to see him. Oh, I would ye could carry
          about with you the recollection of those eyes that are always on you.
          Swearer! could you swear if you could see God's eye looking at you?
          Thief! drunkard! harlot! could ye indulge in your sins, if ye saw his
          eyes on you? Oh, methinks they would startle you and bid you pause,
          before ye did in God's own sight rebel against his law. There is a
          story told of the American War, that one of the prisoners taken by the
          Americans was subjected to a torture of the most refined character. He
          says, "I was put into a narrow dungeon; I was comfortably provided for
          with all I needed; but there was a round slit in the wall, and through
          that, both night and day, a soldier always looked at me." He says, "I
          could not rest, I could not eat nor drink, nor do anything in comfort,
          because there was always that eye -- an eye that seemed never to be
          turned away, and never shut -- always following me round that little
          apartment. Nothing ever hidden from it." Now take home that figure.
          Recollect that is your position; you are shut in by the narrow walls
          of time, when ye eat, and when ye drink, when ye rise, and when ye lie
          upon your beds; when ye walk the streets, or when ye sit at home, that
          eye is always fixed upon you. Go home now and sin against God, if ye
          dare; go home now and break his laws to his face, and despise him, and
          set him at nought! Rush on your own destruction; dash yourselves
          against the buckler of Jehovah, and destroy your selves upon his own
          sword! Nay, rather, "turn ye, turn ye." Turn ye, ye that have followed
          the ways of sin, turn ye to Christ, and live; and then the same
          Omniscience which is now your horror, shall be your pleasure. Sinner!
          if thou now dost pray, he seeth thee; if thou now dost weep he seeth
          thee. "When he was yet a great way off his father saw him, and ran,
          and fell on his neck and kissed him." It shall be even so with thee,
          if now thou turnest to God and dost believe in his Son Jesus Christ.
