<p align="justify">TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician for the sons of Korah, 
    Maschil</b>. The title is similar to the forty-second, and although this is 
    no proof that it is by the same author it makes it highly probable. No other 
    writer should be sought for to father any of the Psalms when David will 
    suffice, and therefore we are loathe to ascribe this sacred song to any but 
    the great psalmist—yet as we hardly know any period of his life which it 
    would fairly describe, we feel compelled to look elsewhere. </p>
<p align="justify">Some Israelitish patriot fallen on evil times, sings in 
    mingled faith and sorrow, his country's ancient glory and her present 
    griefs, her traditions of former favor and her experience of pressing ills. 
    By Christians it can best be understood if put into the mouth of the church 
    when persecution is peculiarly severe. </p>
<p align="justify">The last verses remind us of Milton's famous lines on the 
    massacre of the Protestants among the mountains of Piedmont. The song before 
    us is fitted for the voices of the saved by grace, the sons of Korah, and is 
    to them and to all others full of teaching, hence the title Maschil.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. From Verses 1-3, the Lord's mighty works for 
    Israel are rehearsed.</p>
<p align="justify">In remembrance of them faith in the Lord is expressed 
    Verses 4-8. </p>
<p align="justify">Then the notes of complaint are heard, Verses 9-16.</p>
<p align="justify">The fidelity of the people to their God is aroused, 
    Verses 17-22.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord is entreated to interpose, Verses 23-26.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. We have heard with our ears, O God.</p></b> Your 
    mighty acts have been the subjects of common conversation. Not alone in 
    books have we <i>read </i>your famous deeds, but in the ordinary talk of the 
    people we have <i>heard </i>of them. 
<p align="justify">Among the godly Israelites the biography of their nation 
    was preserved by oral tradition, with great diligence and accuracy. This 
    mode of preserving and transmitting history has its disadvantages, but it 
    certainly produces a more vivid impression on the mind than any other. To 
    hear with the ears affects us more sensitively than to read with the eyes. 
    We ought to note this, and seize every possible opportunity of telling 
    abroad the gospel of our Lord Jesus viva voce, since this is the most 
    telling mode of communication. </p>
<p align="justify">The expression, "<b>heard with our ears</b>," may denote 
    the pleasure with which they listened, the intensity of their interest, the 
    personality of their hearing, and the lively remembrance they had of the 
    romantic and soul-stirring narrative. </p>
<p align="justify">Too many have ears but hear not; happy are they who, 
    having ears, have learned to hear. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Our fathers have told us.</p></b> They could not have had 
    better informants. Schoolmasters are well enough, but godly fathers are, 
    both by the order of nature and grace, the best instructors of their sons, 
    nor can they delegate the sacred duty.
<p align="justify">It is to be feared that many children of professors could 
    plead very little before God of what their fathers have told them. When 
    fathers are tongue-tied religiously with their offspring, need they wonder 
    if their children's hearts remain sin-tied? </p>
<p align="justify">Just as in all free nations men delight to gather around 
    the hearth, and tell the deeds of valor of their sires "in the brave days of 
    old," so the people of God under the old dispensation made their families 
    cheerful around the table, be rehearsing the wondrous doings of the Lord 
    their God. </p>
<p align="justify">Religious conversation need not be dull, and indeed it 
    could not be if, as in this case, it dealt more with facts and less with 
    opinions. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What work you did in their days, in the times of old.</p></b> 
    They began with what their own eyes had witnessed, and then passed on to 
    what were the traditions of their youth. Note that the main point of the 
    history transmitted from father to son was the work of God; this is the core 
    of history, and therefore no man can write history aright who is a stranger 
    to the Lord's work. 
<p align="justify">It is delightful to see the footprints of the Lord on the 
    sea of changing events, to behold him riding on the whirlwind of war, 
    pestilence, and famine, and above all to see his unchanging care for his 
    chosen people. </p>
<p align="justify">Those who are taught to see God in history have learned a 
    good lesson from their fathers, and no son of believing parents should be 
    left in ignorance of so holy an are.</p>
<p align="justify">A nation tutored as Israel was in a history so marvelous 
    as their own, always had an available argument in pleading with God for aid 
    in trouble, since he who never changes gives in every deed of grace, a 
    pledge of mercy yet to come. The traditions of our past experience, are 
    powerful pleas for present help.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. How you drove out the heathen with your hand.
    </p></b>The destruction of the Canaanites from the promised land is the work 
    here brought to remembrance. A people numerous, warlike, gigantic and 
    courageous, firmly established and strongly fortified—were driven out by a 
    far feebler nation, because the Lord was against them in the fight. 
<p align="justify">It is clear from Scripture that God sent a plague (so 
    that the land ate up the inhabitants thereof), and also a visitation of 
    hornets against the Canaanites, and by other means dispirited them, so that 
    the easy victories of Joshua were but the results of God's having worked 
    beforehand against the idolatrous nation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And planted them.</p></b> The tribes of Israel were planted 
    in the places formerly occupied by the heathen. Hivites and Jebusites were 
    chased from their cities to make room for Ephraim and Judah. The Great 
    Wonder worker tore up by the roots the oaks of Bashan, that he might plant 
    instead thereof his own chosen "vineyard of red wine." 
<b>
<p align="justify">How you did afflict the people.</p></b> With judgments and 
    plagues the condemned nations were harassed, by fire and sword they were 
    hunted to the death, until they were all expelled, and the enemies of Israel 
    were banished far away.
<b>
<p align="justify">And made our fathers flourish.</p></b> He who troubled his 
    enemies, smiled on his friends; he meted out vengeance to the ungodly 
    nations, but he reserved of his mercy for the chosen tribes. How fair is 
    mercy, when she stands by the side of justice! Bright beams the star of 
    grace, amid the night of wrath! It is a solemn thought that the greatness of 
    divine love, has its counterpart in the greatness of his indignation. 
<p align="justify">The weight of mercy bestowed on Israel is balanced by the 
    tremendous vengeance which swept the thousands of Amorites and Hittites down 
    to Hell with the edge of the sword. Hell is as deep as Heaven is high, and 
    the flame of Tophet is as everlasting as the blaze of the celestial glory. 
    God's might, as shown in deeds both of mercy and justice, should be called 
    to mind in troublous times as a stay to our fainting faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. For they got not the land in possession by their 
    own sword.</p></b> Behold how the Lord alone was exalted in bringing his people 
    to the land which flows with milk and honey! He, in his distinguishing 
    grace, had put a difference between Canaan and Israel, and therefore, by his 
    own effectual power, he wrought for his chosen ones, and against their 
    adversaries. The tribes fought for their allotments, but their success was 
    wholly due to the Lord who wrought with them. The warriors of Israel were 
    not inactive, but their valor was secondary to that mysterious, divine 
    working by which Jericho's walls fell down, and the hearts of the heathen 
    failed them for fear. 
<p align="justify">The efforts of all the men at arms were employed, but as 
    these would have been futile without divine support, all the honor is 
    ascribed unto the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify">The passage may be viewed as a beautiful parable of the 
    work of salvation. Men are not saved without prayer, repentance, etc., but 
    none of those save a man, salvation is altogether of the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify">Canaan was not conquered <i>without </i>the armies of 
    Israel, but equally true is it that is was not conquered <i>by </i>them. The 
    Lord was the conqueror, and the people were but instruments in his hands.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Neither did their own arm save them.</p></b> They could not 
    ascribe their memorable victories to themselves; he who made sun and moon 
    stand still for them was worthy of all their praise. 
<p align="justify">A negative is put both upon their <i>weapons </i>and <i>
    themselves </i>as if to show us how ready men are to ascribe success to 
    second causes. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your 
    countenance.</p></b> The divine <i>hand </i>actively fought for them, the divine
    <i>arm </i>powerfully sustained them with more than human energy, and the 
    divine <i>smile </i>inspired them with dauntless courage. Who could not win 
    with such triple help, though earth, death, and Hell should rise in war 
    against him? 
<p align="justify">What did the tallness of the sons of Anak matter, or the 
    terror of their chariots of iron—they were as nothing when Jehovah arose for 
    the avenging of Israel. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Because you loved them. </p></b><i>Here is the fountain from 
    whence every stream of mercy flows. </i>The Lord's delight in his people, 
    his peculiar affection, his distinguishing regard—this is the mainspring 
    which moves every wheel of a gracious providence.
<p align="justify">Israel was a chosen nation, hence their victories and the 
    scattering of their foes. Just so, believers are an elect people, hence 
    their spiritual blessings and conquests. There was nothing in the people 
    themselves to secure them success, the Lord's favor alone did it, and it is 
    ever so in our case; <i>our hope of final glory must not rest on anything in 
    ourselves, but on the free and sovereign favor of the Lord Almighty.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. You are my King, O God.</p></b> Knowing right well 
    your power and grace, my heart is glad to own you for her sovereign prince. 
    Who among the mighty are so illustrious as you are? To whom, then, should I 
    yield my homage or turn for aid? God of my fathers in the olden time, you 
    are my soul's monarch and Lord. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Command deliverances for Jacob.</p></b> To whom should a 
    people look but to their king? he it is who, by virtue of his office, fights 
    their battles for them. In the case of our King, how easy it is for him to 
    scatter all our foes! O Lord, the King of kings, with what ease can you 
    rescue your people; a word of your can do it, give but the command and your 
    persecuted people shall be free. 
<p align="justify">Jacob's long life was crowded with trials and 
    deliverances, and his descendants are here called by his name, as if to 
    typify the similarity of their experience to that of their great forefather. 
    He who would win the blessings of Israel must share the sorrows of Jacob.
    </p>
<p align="justify">This verse contains a personal declaration and an 
    intercessory prayer. Those pray best who make most sure of their personal 
    interest in God, and those who have the fullest assurance that the Lord is
    <i>their </i>God should be the foremost to plead for the rest of the tried 
    family of the faithful.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Through you will we push down our enemies.</p></b> 
    The fight was very close, bows were of no avail, and swords failed to be of 
    service, it came to daggers drawing, and hand to hand wrestling, pushing and 
    tugging. Jacob's God was renewing in the seed of Jacob their father's 
    wrestling. And how fared it with faith then? Could she stand foot to foot 
    with her foe and hold her own? Yes, truly, she came forth victorious from 
    the encounter, for she is great at a close push, and overthrows all her 
    adversaries, the Lord being her helper.
<b>
<p align="justify">Through your name will we tread those down who rise up 
    against us.</p></b> The Lord's name served instead of weapons, and enabled those 
    who used it to leap on their foes and crush them with jubilant valor. In 
    union and communion with God, saints work wonders; if God be for us, who can 
    be against us? 
<p align="justify">Mark well that all the conquests of these believers are 
    said to be "through you," "through your name." Never let us forget this, 
    lest going a warfare at our own charges, we fail most ignominiously. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us not, however, fall into the equally dangerous sin 
    of distrust, for the Lord can make the weakest of us equal to any emergency. 
    Though today we are timid and defenseless as sheep, he can by his power make 
    us strong as the firstling of his bullock, and cause us to push as with the 
    horns of the wild ox, until those who rose up against us shall be so crushed 
    and battered as never to rise again.</p>
<p align="justify">Those who of themselves can scarcely keep their feet, but 
    like little babes totter and fall—are by divine assistance made to overthrow 
    their foes, and set their feet upon their necks. Read <i>Christian's </i>
    fight with Apollyon, and see how,</p>
<p align="justify">"The man so bravely played the man<br/>
 He made the fiend to fly."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my 
    sword save me.</p></b> Your people Israel, under your guidance, shouldered out 
    the heathen, and gained their land—not by skill of weapons or prowess of 
    arms, but by your power alone. Therefore will we renounce forever all 
    reliance upon outward confidences, of which other men make such boast, and 
    we will cast ourselves upon the omnipotence of our God.
<p align="justify">Bows having been newly introduced by king Saul, were 
    regarded as very formidable weapons in the early history of Israel, but they 
    are here laid aside together with the all conquering sword, in order that 
    there may be room for faith in the living God. </p>
<p align="justify">This verse, in the first person singular, may serve as 
    the confession of faith of every believer renouncing his own righteousness 
    and strength, and looking alone to the Lord Jesus. O for grace to stand to 
    this self-renunciation, for alas! our proud nature is all too apt to fix its 
    trust on the puffed up and supposed power of the creature. Arm of flesh, how 
    dare I trust you? How dare I bring upon myself the curse of those who rely 
    upon man?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. But you have saved us from our enemies. </p></b>In 
    ages past all our rescues have been due to you, O God. Never have you failed 
    us. Out of every danger you has brought us. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And have put them to shame that hated us.</p></b> With the 
    back of your saving hand you have given them a cuff which has made them hide 
    their faces. You have defeated them in such a manner as to make them ashamed 
    of themselves to be overthrown by such puny adversaries as they thought the 
    Israelites to be. 
<p align="justify">The double action of God in blessing his people and 
    confounding his enemies, is evermore to be observed. Pharaoh is drowned, 
    while Israel passes through the sea. Amalek is smitten, while the tribes 
    rejoice. The heathen are chased from their abodes, while the sons of Jacob 
    rest beneath their vine and fig tree.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. In God we boast all the day long. </p></b>We have 
    abundant reason for doing so while we recount his mighty acts. What blessed 
    boasting is this! it is the only sort of boasting that is bearable. 
<p align="justify">All other manna bred worms and stank except that which 
    was laid up before the Lord. Just so, all other boasting is loathsome save 
    this glorying in the Lord, which is laudable and pleasing. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And praise your name forever.</p></b> Praise should be 
    perpetual. If there were no new acts of love—yet ought the Lord to be 
    praised for what he has done for his people. High let the song be lifted up 
    as we bring to remembrance the eternal love which <i>chose </i>us, <i>
    predestined </i>us to be sons, <i>redeemed </i>us with a price, and then <i>
    enriched </i>us with all the fullness of God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> A pause comes in fitly here, when we are about 
    to descend from the highest to the lowest key. No longer are we to hear 
    Miriam's timbrel, but rather Rachel's weeping.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. But you have cast us off, and put us to shame.
    </p></b>Here the patriot bard begins to contrast the past glories of the 
    nation's history with its present sadness and distress; which he does not 
    ascribe to the death of some human champion, or to the accidents of war—but 
    solely and alone to the withdrawal of Israel's God. 
<p align="justify">It seemed to the mourner that Jehovah had grown weary of 
    his people and put them away in abhorrence, as men lay aside leprous 
    garments, loathing the sight of them. </p>
<p align="justify">To show his displeasure he had made his people to be 
    ridiculed by the heathen, whose easy victories over their largest armies 
    covered Israel with disgrace. Alas! for a church and people when the Lord in 
    the active energy of his Spirit withdraws from them, they want no greater 
    shame or sorrow. He will not cast away his people finally and totally, but 
    many a church has been left to defeat and disgrace on account of sin, and 
    therefore all churches should be exceedingly watchful lest the like should 
    happen to themselves. </p>
<p align="justify">Poverty and distress bring no shame on a people, but <i>
    the Lord's absence takes from a church everything which can exalt and 
    ennoble</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And go not forth with our armies. </p></b>If the Lord be not 
    the leader, of what avail are strong battalions? Vain are the combined 
    efforts of the most zealous workers if God's arm be not revealed. May none 
    of us in our churches have to mourn over the ministry, the Sabbath school, 
    the missionary work, the visiting, the street preaching—left to be carried 
    out without the divine aid. If our great ally will not go with us, our 
    defeat is inevitable.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. You make us to turn back from the enemy. </p></b>
    The humiliating consciousness that the Lord has left them, soon makes men 
    cowards. Flight closes the fight of those who have not the Lord in the van.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">And those who hate us plunder us.</p></b> After defeat and 
    retreat, comes plundering. The poor, vanquished nation paid a terrible 
    penalty for being overcome; plunder and murder desolated the conquered land, 
    and the invaders loaded themselves with every precious thing which they 
    could carry away. 
<p align="justify">In spiritual experience we know what it is to be 
    plundered by our enemies. Doubts and fears rob us of our comforts, and 
    terrible forebodings spoil us of our hopes; and all because the Lord, for 
    wise purposes, sees fit to leave us to ourselves. Alas! for the deserted 
    soul; no calamity can equal the sorrow of being left by God, though it be 
    but for a small moment.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. You have given us like sheep appointed to be 
    devoured. </p></b>As sheep are slaughtered for food, so were the people slain in 
    flocks, with ease, and frequency. Not with dignity of sacrifice, but with 
    the cruelty of the shambles, were they put to death. God appeared to give 
    them up like sheep allotted to the butcher, to abandon them as the hireling 
    abandons the flock to wolves. 
<p align="justify">The complaint is bitterly eloquent. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And have scattered us among the heathen.</p></b> Many were 
    carried into captivity, far off from the public worship of the temple of 
    God, to pine as exiles among idolaters. All this is ascribed to the Lord, as 
    being allowed by him, and even appointed by his decree.<i> It is well to 
    trace the hand of God in our sorrows, for it is surely there.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. You sell your people for nothing. </p></b>As men 
    sell merchandise to any one who cares to have it, so the Lord seemed to hand 
    over his people to any nation who might choose to make war upon them.
<p align="justify">Meanwhile no good result was perceptible from all the 
    miseries of Israel. So far as the psalmist could discover, the Lord's name 
    received no honor from the sorrows of his people. They were given away to 
    their foes as if they were so little valued as not to be worth the ordinary 
    price of slaves, and the Lord did not care to gain by them so long as they 
    did but suffer. </p>
<p align="justify">The woe expressed in this line is as vinegar mingled with 
    gall—the expression is worthy of the weeping prophet.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And do not increase your wealth by their price.</p></b> If 
    Jehovah had been glorified by all this wretchedness it could have been borne 
    patiently, but it was the reverse; the Lord's name had, through the nation's 
    calamities, been despised by the insulting heathen, who counted the 
    overthrow of Israel to be the defeat of Jehovah himself. It always lightens 
    a believer's trouble when he can see that God's great name will be honored 
    thereby, but it is a grievous aggravation of misery when we appear to be 
    tortured in vain. 
<p align="justify">For our comfort let us rest satisfied that in reality the 
    Lord is glorified, and when no revenue of glory is manifestly rendered to 
    him, he none the less accomplishes his own secret purposes, of which the 
    grand result will be revealed in due time. <i>We do not suffer for nothing, 
    nor are our griefs without result.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. You make us a reproach to our neighbors.</p></b> 
    Scorn is always an intensely bitter ingredient in the cup of the oppressed. 
    The taunts and jeers of the victors, pain the vanquished almost as much as 
    their swords and spears. It was a mystery indeed that God should allow his 
    royal nation, his peculiar people, to be taunted by all who dwelt near them.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</p></b> 
    The down trodden people had become a common jest; "as base as Israel" cried 
    the cruel tongue of the tyrant. So ordinary had the scorn become that the 
    neighboring nations, though perhaps equally oppressed, borrowed the language 
    of the conquerors, and joined in the common mockery. To be a derision to 
    both strong and weak, superiors, equals, and inferiors, is hard to bear. The 
    tooth of scoffing bites to the bone. 
<p align="justify">The psalmist sets forth the brutality of the enemy in 
    many words, in order to move the pity of the Lord, to whose just anger he 
    traced all the sorrows of his people. He used the very best of arguments, 
    for the sufferings of his chosen people touch the heart of God far more 
    readily than any other reasonings.</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed be his name, our great Advocate above knows how 
    to avail himself of this powerful plea, and if we are at this hour enduring 
    reproach for truth's sake, he will urge it before the eternal throne; and 
    shall not God avenge his own elect? A father will not long endure to see his 
    children despitefully entreated; he may put up with it for a little, but his 
    love will speedily arouse his anger, and then it will fare ill with the 
    persecutor and reviler!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. You make us a byword among the heathen, a 
    shaking of the head among the people. </p></b>The lamentation is here repeated. 
    They had sunk so low that none did them reverence, but universally and 
    publicly they were treated as infamous and despicable. 
<p align="justify">Those who reviled others dragged in Israel's name by the 
    way as a garnish to their insults, and if perhaps they saw one of the seed 
    of Jacob in the street they used lewd gestures to annoy him. Those whose 
    heads were emptiest wagged them at the separated people. They were the 
    common butts of every fool's arrow. Such has been the lot of the righteous 
    in ages past, such is their portion in a measure now, such may be yet again 
    their heritage in the worst sense. The world knows not its nobility, it has 
    no eye for true excellence<i>—it found a cross for the Master, and cannot be 
    expected to award crowns to his disciples</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. My confusion is continually before me.</p></b> The 
    poet makes himself the representative of his nation, and declares his own 
    constant distress of soul. He is a man of ill blood who is unconcerned for 
    the sorrows of the church of which he is a member, or the nation of which he 
    is a citizen; the better the heart the greater its sympathy.
<b>
<p align="justify">And the shame of my face has covered me.</p></b> One constant 
    blush, like a crimson mantle, covered him both before God and man; he felt 
    before God that the divine desertion was well deserved, and before man, that 
    he and his people were despicable indeed now that heavenly help was gone. <i>
    It is well for a nation when there still exist in it men who lay to heart 
    its sin and shame. </i>God will have pity on his chastened ones, and it is a 
    pledge thereof when he sends us choice ministers, men of tenderness, who 
    make the people's case their own.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. For the voice of him that reproaches and 
    blasphemes. </p></b>It seems that from mocking the people of God, the 
    adversaries advanced to reviling God himself, they proceeded from <i>
    persecution </i>to the sin which is next of kin, namely <i>blasphemy</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">By reason of the enemy and avenger. </p></b>The enemy boasted 
    of avenging the defeats of their forefathers; they took revenge for the 
    ancient victories of Israel, by insulting over the now fallen people. Here 
    was a sad plight for a nation to be placed in, but it was by no means a 
    hopeless case, for the Lord who brought all this evil upon them could with 
    equal ease release them from it. So long as Israel looked alone to her God, 
    and not to her own arm, no foe could retain her beneath his foot; she must 
    arise, for God was on her side.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. All this is come upon us; yet have we not 
    forgotten you.</p></b> Here the psalmist urges that Israel had not turned away 
    from her allegiance to Jehovah. When in the midst of many griefs we can 
    still cling to God in loving obedience, it must be well with us. 
<i>
<p align="justify">True fidelity can endure rough usage. </p></i>Those who 
    follow God for what they get, will leave him when persecution is stirred up, 
    but not so the sincere believer; he will not forget his God, even though the 
    worst come to the worst.
<b>
<p align="justify">Neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.</p></b> No 
    idol was set up, the ordained worship was not relinquished, God was still 
    nationally acknowledged, and therefore the psalmist is more earnest that the 
    Lord should interpose. 
<p align="justify">This and the succeeding verses are suitable for the lips 
    of martyrs; indeed the entire psalm might be called the martyr's complaint. 
    Not for sin but for righteousness did the saints suffer, not for falsehood 
    but for truth, not for forsaking the Lord, but for following hard after him. 
    Sufferings of such a sort may be very terrible, but they are exceedingly 
    honorable—and the comforts of the Lord shall sustain those who are accounted 
    worthy to suffer for Christ's sake.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. Our <i>heart </i>is not turned back, neither 
    have our <i>steps </i>declined from your way</p></b>. Heart and life were 
    agreed, and both were true to the Lord's way. Neither within nor without had 
    the godly sufferers offended; they were not absolutely perfect, but they 
    were sincerely free from all willful transgression. 
<p align="justify">It was a healthy sign for the nation that her prophet 
    poet could testify to her uprightness before God, both in heart and act; far 
    oftener the case would have worn quite another color, for the tribes were 
    all too apt to set up other gods and forsake the rock of their salvation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Though you have sore broken us in the place of 
    jackels.</p></b> Though utterly crushed and rendered desolate and driven as it 
    were to associate with creatures such as jackals, owls, serpents, which 
    haunt deserted ruins—yet Israel remained faithful.<i> To be true to a 
    smiting God, even when the blows lay our joys in ruinous heaps, is to be 
    such as the Lord delights in. </i>Better to be broken <i>by </i>God, than <i>
    from </i>God. Better to be in the place of jackels, than of deceivers.
<b>
<p align="justify">And covered us with the shadow of death.</p></b> The language 
    is very strong. The nation is described as completely enveloped in the dense 
    darkness of despair and death, covered up as though confined in 
    hopelessness. Yet the claim is made that they still remained mindful of 
    their God, and a glorious plea it is. Better death, than false of faith. 
    Those who are true to God, shall never find him false to them.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20.</p></b> An appeal is now made to the omniscience of 
    God; he is himself called in to bear witness that Israel had not set up 
    another God.
<b>
<p align="justify">If we have forgotten the name of our God. </p></b>This would 
    be the first step in apostasy; men first forget the true, and then adore the 
    false. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Or stretched out our hands to a strange God.</p></b> 
    Stretching out the hands was the symbol of adoration or of entreaty in 
    prayer; this they had not offered to any of the idols of the heathens.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. Shall not God search this out?</p></b> Could such 
    idolatry be concealed from him? Would he not with holy indignation have 
    detected unfaithfulness to itself, even had it been hidden in the heart and 
    unrevealed in the life? 
<b>
<p align="justify">For he knows the secrets of the heart. </p></b>He is 
    acquainted with the inner workings of the mind, and therefore this could not 
    have escaped him. Not the heart only which is secret, but the secrets of the 
    heart, which are secrets of the most secret <i>thing—are as open to God as a 
    book to a reader</i>. The reasoning is that the Lord himself knew the people 
    to be sincerely his followers, and therefore was not visiting them for sin; 
    hence, then, affliction evidently came from quite another cause.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. Yes</p></b>, that is, assuredly, certainly.
<b>
<p align="justify">For your sake</p></b>, not for our offences, but for obeying 
    you; the trials of these suppliants came upon them because they were loyal 
    to their God. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Are we killed all the day long. </p></b>Persecution never 
    ceased to hound them to the death, they had no respite and found no door of 
    escape; and all in God's behalf, because they would not forsake their 
    covenant God and King. 
<b>
<p align="justify">We are counted as sheep for the slaughter</p></b>; as if we 
    were only meant to be killed, and made on purpose to be victims; as if it 
    were as easy and as innocent a thing to slay us, as to slaughter sheep. 
<p align="justify">In this and following verses we clearly hear the martyr's 
    cry. From Piedmont and Smithfield, from St. Bartholomew's massacre and the 
    dragoonades of Claverhouse—this appeal goes up to Heaven, while the souls 
    under the altar continue their solemn cry for vengeance. Not long shall the 
    church plead in this fashion, her shame shall be recompensed, her triumph 
    shall dawn.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord.</p></b> God does 
    not sleep, but the psalmist puts it so, as if on no other theory he could 
    explain the divine inaction. He would gladly see the great Judge ending 
    oppression and giving peace to the holy, therefore does he cry "Awake!" he 
    cannot understand why the reign of tyranny and the oppression of virtue are 
    permitted, and therefore he inquires "Why sleep you?" 
<b>
<p align="justify">Arise.</p></b> This is all you need to do, one move of your 
    will save us. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Cast us not off forever.</p></b> Long enough have you 
    deserted us; the terrible effects of your absence are destroying us; end our 
    calamities, and let your anger be appeased. In persecuting times men are apt 
    to cry, Where is the God of Israel? At the thought of what the saints have 
    endured from their haughty enemies, we join our voices in the great martyr 
    cry and sing with the bard of Paradise:
<p align="justify">"Avenge, O Lord, your slaughtered saints, whose bones<br/>
    Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold;<br/>
    Even those who kept your truth so pure of old,<br/>
    When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones,<br/>
    Forget not: in your book record their groans<br/>
    Who were your sheep."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. Why do you hide your face, and forget our 
    affliction and our oppression? </p></b>Not petulantly, but piteously and 
    inquiringly, we may question the Lord when his dealings are mysterious. We 
    are permitted to order our case with arguments, and plead the right before 
    the face of the august Majesty.
<p align="justify">Why, Lord, do you become oblivious of your children's 
    woes? This question is far more easily asked than answered; it is hard, 
    indeed, in the midst of persecution to see the reason why we are left to 
    suffer so severely.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust.</p></b> Our 
    heart is low as low can be, as low as the dust beneath the soles of men's 
    feet. When the heart sinks, the man is down indeed. <i>Heart sorrow is the 
    very heart of sorrow</i>. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Our bodies cleave unto the earth. </p></b>The man is prone 
    upon the earth, and he is not only down, but fastened down on the earth and 
    glued to it. It is misery, indeed, when the heart cannot escape from itself, 
    is shut up in its own dejection, and bound with the cords of despondency.
<p align="justify">God's saints may be thus abject, they may be not only in 
    the dust, but on the dunghill with Job and Lazarus. But their day comes, and 
    their tide will turn, and they shall have a brave summer after their bitter 
    winter.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 26. Arise for our help. </p></b>A short, but sweet and 
    comprehensive prayer—much to the point, clear, simple, urgent, as all 
    prayers should be. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And redeem us for your mercies' sake. </p></b>Here is the 
    final plea. The favor is redemption, the plea is mercy; and this, too, in 
    the case of faithful sufferers who had not forgotten their God. Mercy is 
    always a safe plea, and never will any man find a better.
<p align="justify">"Were I a martyr at the stake.<br/>
    I would plead my Savior's name,<br/>
    Entreat a pardon for his sake,<br/>
    And urge no other claim."</p>
<p align="justify">Here ends this memorable Psalm, but in Heaven its power 
    ends not, but brings down deliverance for the tried people of God.</p>
