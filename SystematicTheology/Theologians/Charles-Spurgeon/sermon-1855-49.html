        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.52)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 2, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." -- John 5:40.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of the great guns of the Arminians, mounted upon the top
          of their walls, and often discharged with terrible noise against the
          poor Christians called Calvinists. I intend to spike the gun this
          morning, or, rather, to turn it on the enemy, for it was never theirs;
          it was never cast at their foundry at all, but was intended to teach
          the very opposite doctrine to that which they assert. Usually, when
          the text is taken, the divisions are: First, that man has a will.
          Secondly, that he is entirely free. Thirdly, that men must make
          themselves willing to come to Christ, otherwise they will not be
          saved. Now, we shall have no such divisions; but we will endeavour to
          take a more calm look at the text; and not, because there happen to be
          the words "will," or "will not" in it, run away with the conclusion
          that it teaches the doctrine of free-will. It has already been proved
          beyond all controversy that free-will is nonsense. Freedom cannot
          belong to will any more than ponderability can belong to electricity.
          They are altogether different things. Free agency we may believe in,
          but free-will is simply ridiculous. The will is well known by all to
          be directed by the understanding, to be moved by motives, to be guided
          by other parts of the soul, and to be a secondary thing. Philosophy
          and religion both discard at once the very thought of free-will; and I
          will go as far as Martin Luther, in that strong assertion of his,
          where he says, "If any man doth ascribe aught of salvation, even the
          very least, to the free-will of man, he knoweth nothing of grace, and
          he hath not learnt Jesus Christ aright." It may seem a harsh
          sentiment; but he who in his soul believes that man does of his own
          free-will turn to God, cannot have been taught of God, for that is one
          of the first principles taught us when God begins with us, that we
          have neither will nor power, but that he gives both; that he is "Alpha
          and Omega" in the salvation of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our four points, this morning, shall be: First -- that every man is
          dead, because it says: "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have
          life." Secondly -- that there is life in Jesus Christ: "Ye will not
          come to me, that ye might have life." Thirdly -- that there is life in
          Christ Jesus for every one that comes for it: "Ye will not come to me,
          that ye might have life;" implying that all who go will have life. And
          fourthly -- the gist of the text lies here, that no man by nature ever
          will come to Christ, for the text says, "Ye will not come to me, that
          ye might have life." So far from asserting that men of their own wills
          ever do such a thing, it boldly and flatly denies it, and says, "Ye
        </p>
        <p>WILL NOT</p>
        <p>WILL NOT</p>
        <p>I. First, then, our text implies THAT MEN BY NATURE ARE DEAD.</p>
        <p>
          No being needs to go after life if he has life in himself. The text
          speaks very strongly when it says, "Ye will not come unto me, that ye
          might have life." Though it saith it not in words, yet it doth in
          effect affirm that men need a life more than they have themselves. My
          hearers, we are all dead unless we have been begotten unto a lively
          hope. First, we are all of us, by nature, legally dead -- "In the day
          that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death," said God to Adam;
          and though Adam did not die in that moment naturally, he died legally;
          that is to say death was recorded against him. As soon as, at the Old
          Bailey, the judge puts on the black cap and pronounces the sentence,
          the man is reckoned to be dead at law. Though perhaps a month may
          intervene before he is brought on the scaffold to endure the sentence
          of the law, yet the law looks upon him as a dead man. It is impossible
          for him to transact anything. He cannot inherit, he cannot bequeath;
          he is nothing -- he is a dead man. The country considers him not as
          being alive in it at all. There is an election -- he is not asked for
          his vote because he is considered as dead. He is shut up in his
          condemned cell, and he is dead. Ah! and ye ungodly sinners who have
          never had life in Christ, ye are alive this morning, by reprieve, but
          do ye know that ye are legally dead; that God considers you as such,
          that in the day when your father Adam touched the fruit, and when you
          yourselves did sin, God, the Eternal Judge, put on the black cap and
          condemned you? You talk mightily of your own standing, and goodness,
          and morality -- where is it? Scripture saith, ye are "condemned
          already." Ye are not to wait to be condemned at the judgment-day --
          that will be the execution of the sentence -- ye are "condemned
          already." In the moment ye sinned; your names were all written in the
          black book of justice; every one was then sentenced by God to death,
          unless he found a substitute, in the person of Christ, for his sins.
          What would you think if you were to go into the Old Bailey, and see
          the condemned culprit sitting in his cell, laughing and merry? You
          would say, "The man is a fool, for he is condemned, and is to be
          executed; yet how merry he is." Ah! and how foolish is the worldly
          man, who, while sentence is recorded against him, lives in merriment
          and mirth! Do you think the sentence of God is of no effect? Thinkest
          thou that thy sin which is written with an iron pen on the rocks for
          ever hath no horrors in it? God hath said thou art condemned already.
          If thou wouldst but feel this, it would mingle bitters in thy sweet
          cups of joy; thy dances would be stopped, thy laughter quenched in
          sighing, if thou wouldst recollect that thou art condemned already. We
          ought all to weep, if we lay this to our souls: that by nature we have
          no life in God's sight; we are actually, positively condemned; death
          is recorded against us, and we are considered in ourselves now, in
          God's sight, as much dead as if we were actually cast into hell; we
          are condemned here by sin, we do not yet suffer the penalty of it, but
          it is written against us, and we are legally dead, nor can we find
          life unless we find legal life in the person of Christ, of which more
          by-and-by.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, besides being legally dead, we are also spiritually dead. For not
          only did the sentence pass in the book, but it passed in the heart; it
          entered the conscience; it operated on the soul, on the judgment, on
          the imagination, and on everything. "In the day that thou eatest
          thereof thou shalt surely die," was not only fulfilled by the sentence
          recorded, but by something which took place in Adam. Just as, in a
          certain moment, when this body shall die, the blood stops, the pulse
          ceases, the breath no longer comes from the lungs, so in the day that
          Adam did eat that fruit his soul died; his imagination lost its mighty
          power to climb into celestial things and see heaven, his will lost its
          power always to choose that which is good, his judgment lost all
          ability to judge between right and wrong decidedly and infallibly,
          though something was retained in conscience; his memory became
          tainted, liable to hold evil things, and let righteous things glide
          away; every power of him ceased as to its moral vitality. Goodness was
          the vitality of his powers -- that departed. Virtue, holiness,
          integrity, these were the life of man; but when these departed man
          became dead. And now, every man, so far as spiritual things are
          concerned, is "dead in trespasses and sins" spiritually. Nor is the
          soul less dead in a carnal man, than the body is when committed to the
          grave; it is actually and positively dead -- not by a metaphor, for
          Paul speaketh not in metaphor, when he affirms, "You hath he quickened
          who were dead in trespasses and sins." But my hearers, again, I would
          I could preach to your hearts concerning this subject. It was bad
          enough when I described death as having been recorded; but now I speak
          of it as having actually taken place in your hearts. Ye are not what
          ye once were; ye are not what ye were in Adam, not what ye were
          created. Man was made pure and holy. Ye are not the perfect creatures
          of which some boast; ye are altogether fallen, ye have gone out of the
          way, ye have become corrupt and filthy. Oh! listen not to the siren
          song of those who tell you of your moral dignity, and your mighty
          elevation in matters of salvation. Ye are not perfect; that great
          word, "ruin," is written on your heart; and death is stamped upon your
          spirit. Do not conceive, O moral man, that thou wilt be able to stand
          before God in thy morality, for thou art nothing but a carcass
          embalmed in legality, a corpse arrayed in some fine robes, but still
          corrupt in God's sight. And think not, O thou possessor of natural
          religion! that thou mayest by thine own might and power make thyself
          acceptable to God. Why, man! thou art dead! and thou mayest array the
          dead as gloriously as thou pleasest, but still it would be a solemn
          mockery. There lieth queen Cleopatra -- put the crown upon her head,
          deck her in royal robes, let her sit in state; but what a cold chill
          runs through you when you pass by her. She is fair now, even in her
          death -- but how horrible it is to stand by the side even of a dead
          queen, celebrated for her majestic beauty! So you may be glorious in
          your beauty, fair, and amiable, and lovely; you put the crown of
          honesty upon your head, and wear about you all the garments of
          uprightness, but unless God has quickened thee, O man! unless the
          Spirit has had dealings with thy soul, thou art in God's sight as
          obnoxious as the chilly corpse is to thyself. Thou wouldst not choose
          to live with a corpse sitting at thy table; nor doth God love that
          thou shouldst be in his sight. He is angry with thee every day, for
          thou art in sin -- thou art in death. Oh! believe this; take it to thy
          soul; appropriate it, for it is most true that thou art dead,
          spiritually as well as legally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third kind of death is the consummation of the other two. It is
          eternal death. It is the execution of the legal sentence; it is the
          consummation of the spiritual death. Eternal death is the death of the
          soul; it takes place after the body has been laid in the grave, after
          the soul has departed from it. If legal death be terrible, it is
          because of its consequences; and if spiritual death be dreadful, it is
          because of that which shall succeed it. The two deaths of which we
          have spoken are the roots, and that death which is to come is the
          flower thereof. Oh! had I words that I might this morning attempt to
          depict to you what eternal death is. The soul has come before its
          Maker; the book has been opened; the sentence has been uttered;
          "Depart ye cursed" has shaken the universe, and made the very spheres
          dim with the frown of the Creator; the soul has departed to the depths
          where it is to dwell with others in eternal death. Oh! how horrible is
          its position now. Its bed is a bed of flame; the sights it sees are
          murdering ones that affright its spirit;. the sounds it hears are
          shrieks, and wails, and moans, and groans; all that its body knows is
          the infliction of miserable pain! It has the possession of unutterable
          woe, of unmitigated misery. The soul looks up. Hope is extinct -- it
          is gone. It looks downward in dread and fear; remorse hath possessed
          its soul. It looks on the right hand -- and the adamantine walls of
          fate keep it within its limits of torture. It looks on the left -- and
          there the rampart of blazing fire forbids the scaling ladder of e'en a
          dreamy speculation of escape. It looks within and seeks for
          consolation there, but a gnawing worm hath entered into the soul. It
          looks about it -- it has no friends to aid, no comforters, but
          tormentors in abundance. It knoweth nought of hope of deliverance; it
          hath heard the everlasting key of destiny turning in its awful wards,
          and it hath seen God take that key and hurl it down into the depth of
          eternity never to be found again. It hopeth not; it knoweth no escape;
          it guesseth not of deliverance; it pants for death, but death is too
          much its foe to be there; it longs that non-existence would swallow it
          up, but this eternal death is worse than annihilation. It pants for
          extermination as the laborer for his Sabbath; it longs that it might
          be swallowed up in nothingness just as would the galley slave long for
          freedom, but it cometh not -- it is eternally dead. When eternity
          shall have rolled round multitudes of its everlasting cycles it shall
          still be dead. Forever knoweth no end; eternity cannot be spelled
          except in eternity. Still the soul seeth written o'er its head, "Thou
          art damned forever." It heareth howlings that are to be perpetual; it
          seeth flames which are unquenchable; it knoweth pains that are
          unmitigated; it hears a sentence that rolls not like the thunder of
          earth which soon is hushed -- but onward, onward, onward, shaking the
          echoes of eternity -- making thousands of years shake again with the
          horrid thunder of its dreadful sound -- "Depart! depart! depart! ye
          cursed!" This is the eternal death.
        </p>
        <p>II. Secondly, IN CHRIST JESUS THERE IS LIFE,</p>
        <p>
          for he says: "Ye will not come to me that ye might have life." There
          is no life in God the Father for a sinner; there is no life in God the
          Spirit for a sinner apart from Jesus. The life of a sinner is in
          Christ. If you take the Father apart from the Son, though he loves his
          elect, and decrees that they shall live, yet life is only in his Son.
          If you take God the Spirit apart from Jesus Christ, though it is the
          Spirit that gives us spiritual life, yet it is life in Christ, life in
          the Son. We dare not, and cannot apply in the first place, either to
          God the Father, or to God the Holy Ghost for spiritual life. The first
          thing we are led to do when God brings us out of Egypt is to eat the
          Passover -- the very first thing. The first means whereby we get life
          is by feeding upon the flesh and blood of the Son of God; living in
          him, trusting on him, believing in his grace and power. Our second
          thought was -- there is life in Christ. We will show you there are
          three kinds of life in Christ, as there are three kinds of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          First there is legal life in Christ. Just as every man by nature
          considered in Adam had a sentence of condemnation passed on him in the
          moment of Adam's sin, and more especially in the moment of his own
          first transgression, so I, if I be a believer, and you, if you trust
          in Christ, have had a legal sentence of acquittal passed on us through
          what Jesus Christ has done. O condemned sinner! Thou mayest be sitting
          this morning condemned like the prisoner in Newgate; but ere this day
          has passed away thou mayest be as clear from guilt as the angels
          above. There is such a thing as legal life in Christ, and, blessed be
          God! some of us enjoy it. We know our sins are pardoned because Christ
          suffered punishment for them; we know that we never can be punished
          ourselves, for Christ suffered in our stead. The Passover is slain for
          us; the lintel and door-post have been sprinkled, and the destroying
          angel can never touch us. For us there is no hell, although it blaze
          with terrible flame. Let Tophet be prepared of old, let its pile be
          wood and much smoke, we never can come there -- Christ died for us, in
          our stead. What if there be racks of horrid torture? What if there be
          a sentence producing most horrible reverberations of thundering
          sounds? Yet neither rack, nor dungeon, nor thunder, are for us! In
          Christ Jesus we are now delivered. "There is therefore
        </p>
        <p>NOW</p>
        <p>
          Sinner! Art thou legally condemned this morning? Dost thou feel that?
          Then, let me tell thee that faith in Christ will give thee a knowledge
          of thy legal acquittal. Beloved, it is no fancy that we are condemned
          for our sins, it is a reality. So, it is no fancy we are acquitted, it
          is a reality. A man about to be hanged, if he received a full pardon
          would feel it a great reality. He would say, "I have a full pardon; I
          cannot be touched now." That is just how I feel.
        </p>
        <p>"Now freed from sin I walk at large,</p>
        <p>The Saviour's blood's my full discharge,</p>
        <p>At his dear feet content I lay,</p>
        <p>A sinner saved, and homage pay."</p>
        <p>
          Brethren, we have gained legal life in Christ, and such legal life
          that we cannot lose it. The sentence has gone against us once -- now
          it has gone out for us. It is written, "
        </p>
        <p>THERE IS NOW NO CONDEMNATION</p>
        <p>
          Then, secondly, there is spiritual life in Christ Jesus. As the man is
          spiritually dead, God has spiritual life for him, for there is not a
          need which is not supplied by Jesus, there is not an emptiness in the
          heart which Christ cannot fill; there is not a desolation which he
          cannot people, there is not a desert which he cannot make to blossom
          as the rose. O ye dead sinners! spiritually dead, there is life in
          Christ Jesus, for we have seen -- yes! these eyes have seen -- the
          dead live again; we have known the man whose soul was utterly corrupt,
          by the power of God seek after righteousness; we have known the man
          whose views were carnal, whose lusts were mighty, whose passions were
          strong, suddenly, by irresistible might from heaven, consecrate
          himself to Christ, and become a child of Jesus. We know that there is
          life in Christ Jesus, of a spiritual order; yea, more, we ourselves,
          in our own persons, have felt that there is spiritual life. Well can
          we remember when we sat in the house of prayer, as dead as the very
          seat on which we sat. We had listened for a long, long while to the
          sound of the gospel, but no effect followed, when suddenly, as if our
          ears had been opened by the fingers of some mighty angel, a sound
          entered into our heart. We thought we heard Jesus saying, "He that
          hath ears to hear, let him hear." An irresistible hand put itself on
          our heart and crushed a prayer out of it. We never had a prayer before
          like that. We cried, "O God! have mercy upon me a sinner." Some of us
          for months felt a hand pressing us as if we had been grasped in a
          vice, and our souls bled drops of anguish. That misery was a sign of
          coming life. Persons when they are being drowned do not feel the pain
          so much as while they are being restored. Oh! we recollect those
          pains, those groans, that living strife that our soul had when it came
          to Christ. Ah! we can recollect the giving of our spiritual life as
          easily as could a man his restoration from the grave. We can suppose
          Lazarus to have remembered his resurrection, though not all the
          circumstances of it. So we, although we have forgotten a great deal,
          do recollect our giving ourselves to Christ. We can say to every
          sinner, however dead, there is life in Christ Jesus, though you may be
          rotten and corrupt in your grave. He who hath raised Lazarus hath
          raised us; and he can say, even to you, "Lazarus! come forth."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third place, there is eternal life in Christ Jesus. And, oh! if
          eternal death be terrible, eternal life is blessed; for he has said,
          "Where I am there shall my people be." "Father, I will that they also,
          whom thou hast given unto me, be with me where I am, that they may
          behold my glory." "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall
          never perish." Now, any Arminian that would preach from that text must
          buy a pair of India rubber lips, for I am sure he would need to
          stretch his mouth amazingly; he would never be able to speak the whole
          truth without winding about in a most mysterious manner. Eternal life
          -- not a life which they are to lose, but eternal life. If I lost life
          in Adam I gained it in Christ; if I lost myself for ever I find myself
          for ever in Jesus Christ. Eternal life! Oh blessed thought! Our eyes
          will sparkle with joy and our souls bum with ecstasy in the thought
          that we have eternal life. Be quenched ye stars! let God put his
          finger on you -- but my soul will live in bliss and joy. Put out thine
          eye O sun! -- but mine eye shall "see the king in his beauty" when
          thine eye shall no more make the green earth laugh. And moon, be thou
          turned into blood! -- but my blood shall ne'er be turned to
          nothingness; this spirit shall exist when thou hast ceased to be. And
          thou great world! thou mayest all subside, just as a moment's foam
          subsides upon the wave that bears it -- but I have eternal life. O
          time! thou mayest see giant mountains dead and hidden in their graves;
          thou mayest see the stars like figs too ripe, falling from the tree,
          but thou shalt never, never see my spirit dead.

          III. This brings us to the third point: that ETERNAL LIFE IS GIVEN TO
          ALL WHO COME FOR IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          There never was a man who came to Christ for eternal life, for legal
          life, for spiritual life, who had not already received it, in some
          sense, and it was manifested to him that he had received it soon after
          he came. Let us take one or two texts -- "He is able to save to the
          uttermost them that come unto him." Every man who comes to Christ will
          find that Christ is able to save him -- not able to save him a little,
          to deliver him from a little sin, to keep him from a little trial, to
          carry him a little way and then drop him -- but able to save him to
          the uttermost extent of his sin, unto the uttermost length of his
          trials, the uttermost depths of his sorrows, unto the uttermost
          duration of his existence. Christ says to every one who comes to him,
          "Come, poor sinner, thou needst not ask whether I have power to save.
          I will not ask thee how far thou hast gone into sin; I am able to save
          thee to the uttermost." And there is no one on earth can go beyond
          God's "uttermost."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now another text: "Him that cometh to me, [mark the promises are
          nearly always to the coming ones] I will in no wise cast out." Every
          man that comes shall find the door of Christ's house opened -- and the
          door of his heart too. Every man that comes -- I say it in the
          broadest sense -- shall find that Christ has mercy for him. The
          greatest absurdity in the world is to want to have a wider gospel than
          that recorded in Scripture. I preach that every man who believes shall
          be saved -- that every man who comes shall find mercy. People ask me,
          "But suppose a man should come who was not chosen, would he be saved?"
          You go and suppose nonsense and I am not going to give you an answer.
          If a man is not chosen he will never come. When he does come it is a
          sure proof that he was chosen. Says one, "Suppose any one should go to
          Christ who had not been called of the Spirit." Stop, my brother, that
          is a supposition thou hast no right to make, for such a thing cannot
          happen; you only say it to entangle me, and you will not do that just
          yet. I say every man who comes to Christ shall be saved. I can say
          that as a Calvinist, or as a hyper-Calvinist, as plainly as you can
          say it. I have no narrower gospel than you have; only my gospel is on
          a solid foundation, whereas yours is built upon nothing but sand and
          rottenness. "Every man that cometh shall be saved, for no man cometh
          to me except the Father draw him." "But," says one, "suppose all the
          world should come, would Christ receive them?" Certainly, if all came;
          but then they won't come. I tell you all that come -- aye, if they
          were as bad as devils, Christ would receive them; if they had all sin
          and filthiness running into their hearts as into a common sewer for
          the whole world, Christ would receive them. Another says, "I want to
          know about the rest of the people. May I go out and tell them -- Jesus
          Christ died for every one of you? May I say -- there is righteousness
          for everyone of you, there is life for every one of you?" No; you may
          not. You may say -- there is life for every man that comes. But if you
          say there is life for one of those that do not believe, you utter a
          dangerous lie. If you tell them Jesus Christ was punished for their
          sins, and yet they will be lost, you tell a wilful falsehood. To think
          that God could punish Christ and then punish them -- I wonder at your
          daring to have the impudence to say so! A good man was once preaching
          that there were harps and crowns in heaven for all his congregation;
          and then he wound up in a most solemn manner: "My dear friends, there
          are many for whom these things are prepared who will not get there."
          In fact, he made such a pitiful tale, as indeed he might do; but I
          tell you who he ought to have wept for -- he ought to have wept for
          the angels of heaven and all the saints, because that would spoil
          heaven thoroughly. You know when you meet at Christmas, if you have
          lost your brother David and his seat is empty, you say: "Well, we
          always enjoyed Christmas, but there is a drawback to it now -- poor
          David is dead and buried!" Think of the angels saying: "Ah! this is a
          beautiful heaven, but we don't like to see all those crowns up there
          with cobwebs on; we cannot endure that uninhabited street: we cannot
          behold yon empty thrones." And then, poor souls, they might begin
          talking to one another, and say, "we are none of us safe here for the
          promise was -- "I give unto my sheep eternal life," and there is a lot
          of them in hell that God gave eternal life to; there is a number that
          Christ shed his blood for burning in the pit, and if they may be sent
          there, so may we. If we cannot trust one promise we cannot another."
          So heaven would lose its foundation, and fall. Away with your
          nonsensical gospel! God gives us a safe and solid one, built on
          covenant doings and covenant relationship, on eternal purposes and
          sure fulfillments.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This brings us to the fourth point, THAT BY NATURE NO MAN WILL
          COME TO CHRIST,
        </p>
        <p>
          for the text says, "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."
          I assert on Scripture authority from my text, that ye will not come
          unto Christ, that ye might have life. I tell you, I might preach to
          you for ever, I might borrow the eloquence of Demosthenes or of
          Cicero, but ye will not come unto Christ. I might beg of you on my
          knees, with tears in my eyes, and show you the horrors of hell and the
          joys of heaven, the sufficiency of Christ, and your own lost
          condition, but you would none of you come unto Christ of yourselves
          unless the Spirit that rested on Christ should draw you. It is true of
          all men in their natural condition that they will not come unto
          Christ. But, methinks I hear another of these babblers asking a
          question: "But could they not come if they liked?" My friend, I will
          reply to thee another time. That is not the question this morning. I
          am talking about whether they will, not whether they can. You will
          notice whenever you talk about free-will, the poor Arminian, in two
          seconds begins to talk about power, and he mixes up two subjects that
          should be kept apart. We will not take two subjects at once; we
          decline fighting two at the same time, if you please. Another day we
          will preach from this text -- "No man can come except the Father draw
          him." But it is only the will we are talking of now; and it is certain
          that men will not come unto Christ, that they might have life. We
          might prove this from many texts of Scripture, but we will take one
          parable. You remember the parable where a certain king had a feast for
          his son, and bade a great number to come; the oxen and fatlings were
          killed, and he sent his messengers bidding many to the supper. Did
          they go to the feast? Ah, no; but they all, with one accord, began to
          make excuse. One said he had married a wife, and therefore he could
          not come, whereas he might have brought her with him. Another had
          bought a yoke of oxen, and went to prove them; but the feast was in
          the night-time, and he could not prove his oxen in the dark. Another
          had bought a piece of land, and wanted to see it; but I should not
          think he went to see it with a lantern. So they all made excuses and
          would not come. Well the king was determined to have the feast; so he
          said, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and" invite them -- stop!
          not invite -- "compel them to come in;" for even the ragged fellows in
          the hedges would never have come unless they were compelled. Take
          another parable: -- A certain man had a vineyard; at the appointed
          season he sent one of his servants for his rent. What did they do to
          him? They beat that servant. He sent another; and they stoned him. He
          sent another and they killed him. And, at last, he said, "I will send
          them my son, they will reverence him." But what did they do? They
          said, "This is the heir, let us kill him, and cast him out of the
          vineyard." So they did. It is the same with all men by nature. The Son
          of God came, yet men rejected him. "Ye will not come to me that ye
          might have life." It would take too much time to mention any more
          Scripture proofs. We will, however, refer to the great doctrine of the
          fall. Any one who believes that man's will is entirely free, and that
          he can be saved by it, does not believe the fall. As I sometimes tell
          you, few preachers of religion do believe thoroughly the doctrine of
          the fall, or else they think that when Adam fell down he broke his
          little finger, and did not break his neck and ruin his race. Why,
          beloved, the fall broke man up entirely. It did not leave one power
          unimpaired; they were all shattered, and debased, and tarnished; like
          some mighty temple, the pillars might be there, the shaft, and the
          column, and the pilaster might be there; but they were all broken,
          though some of them retain their form and position. The conscience of
          man sometimes retains much of its tenderness -- still it has fallen.
          The will, too, is not exempt. What though it is "the Lord Mayor of
          Mansoul," as Bunyan calls it? -- the Lord Mayor goes wrong. The Lord
          Will-be-will was continually doing wrong. Your fallen nature was put
          out of order; your will, amongst other things, has clean gone astray
          from God. But I tell you what will be the best proof of that; it is
          the great fact that you never did meet a Christian in your life who
          ever said he came to Christ without Christ coming to him. You have
          heard a great many Arminian sermons, I dare say; but you never heard
          an Arminian prayer -- for the saints in prayer appear as one in word,
          and deed and mind. An Arminian on his knees would pray desperately
          like a Calvinist. He cannot pray about free-will: there is no room for
          it. Fancy him praying, "Lord, I thank thee I am not like those poor
          presumptuous Calvinists. Lord, I was born with a glorious free-will; I
          was born with power by which I can turn to thee of myself; I have
          improved my grace. If everybody had done the same with their grace
          that I have, they might all have been saved. Lord, I know thou dost
          not make us willing if we are not willing ourselves. Thou givest grace
          to everybody; some do not improve it, but I do. There are many that
          will go to hell as much bought with the blood of Christ as I was; they
          had as much of the Holy Ghost given to them; they had as good a
          chance, and were as much blessed as I am. It was not thy grace that
          made us to differ; I know it did a great deal, still I turned the
          point; I made use of what was given me, and others did not -- that is
          the difference between me and them." That is a prayer for the devil,
          for nobody else would offer such a prayer as that. Ah! when they are
          preaching and talking very slowly, there may be wrong doctrine; but
          when they come to pray, the true thing slips out; they cannot help it.
          If a man talks very slowly, he may speak in a fine manner; but when he
          comes to talk fast, the old brogue of his country, where he was born,
          slips out. I ask you again, did you ever meet a Christian man who
          said, "I came to Christ without the power of the Spirit?" If you ever
          did meet such a man, you need have no hesitation in saying, "My dear
          sir, I quite believe it -- and I believe you went away again without
          the power of the Spirit, and that you know nothing about the matter,
          and are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity." Do I hear
          one Christian man saying, "I sought Jesus before he sought me; I went
          to the Spirit, and the Spirit did not come to me"? No, beloved; we are
          obliged, each one of us, to put our hands to our hearts and say --
        </p>
        <p>"Grace taught my soul to pray,</p>
        <p>And made my eyes to o'erflow;</p>
        <p>'Twas grace that kept me to this day,</p>
        <p>And will not let me go."</p>
        <p>
          Is there one here -- a solitary one -- man or woman, young or old, who
          can say, "I sought God before he sought me?" No; even you who are a
          little Arminian, will sing --
        </p>
        <p>"O yes! I do love Jesus --</p>
        <p>Because he first loved me."</p>
        <p>
          Then, one more question. Do we not find, even after we have come to
          Christ, our soul is not free, but is kept by Christ? Do we not find
          times, even now, when to will is not present with us? There is a law
          in our members, warring against the law of our minds. Now, if those
          who are spiritually alive feel that their will is contrary to God,
          what shall we say of the man who is "dead in trespasses and sins"? It
          would be a marvelous absurdity to put the two on a level; and it would
          be still more absurd to put the dead before the living. No; the text
          is true, experience has branded it into our hearts. "Ye will not come
          to me, that ye might have life."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we must tell you the reasons why men will not come unto Christ.
          The first is, because no man by nature thinks he wants Christ. By
          nature man conceives that he does not need Christ; he thinks that he
          has a robe of righteousness of his own, that he is well-dressed, that
          he is not naked, that he needs not Christ's blood to wash him, that he
          is not black or crimson, and needs no grace to purify him. No man
          knows his need until God shows it to him; and until the Holy Spirit
          reveals the necessity of pardon, no man will seek pardon. I may preach
          Christ for ever, but unless you feel you want Christ you will never
          come to him. A doctor may have a good shop, but nobody will buy his
          medicines until he feels he wants them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next reason is, because men do not like Christ's way of saving
          them. One says, "I do not like it because he makes me holy; I cannot
          drink or swear if he saved me." Another says, "It requires me to be so
          precise and puritanical, and I like a little more license." Another
          does not like it because it is so humbling; he does not like it
          because the "gate of heaven" is not quite high enough for his head,
          and he does not like stooping. That is the chief reason ye will not
          come to Christ, because ye cannot get to him with your heads straight
          up in the air; for Christ makes you stoop when you come. Another does
          not like it to be grace from first to last. "Oh!" he says, "If I might
          have a little honor." But when he hears it is all Christ or no Christ,
          a whole Christ or no Christ, he says, "I shall not come," and turns on
          his heel and goes away. Ah! proud sinners, ye will not come unto
          Christ. Ah! ignorant sinners, ye will not come unto Christ, because ye
          know nothing of him. And that is the third reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men do not know his worth, for if they did they would come unto him.
          Why did not sailors go to America before Columbus went? Because they
          did not believe there was an America. Columbus had faith, therefore he
          went. He who hath faith in Christ goes to him. But you don't know
          Jesus; many of you never saw his beauteous face; you never saw how
          applicable his blood is to a sinner, how great is his atonement; and
          how all-sufficient are his merits. Therefore, "ye will not come to
          him."
        </p>
        <p>
          And oh! my hearers, my last thought is a solemn one. I have preached
          that ye will not come. But some will say, "it is their sin that they
          do not come."
        </p>
        <p>IT IS SO.<br /></p>
