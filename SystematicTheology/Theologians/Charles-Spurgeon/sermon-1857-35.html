          |For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might
          be made the righteousness of God in him.| -- 2 Corinthians 5:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          A BOOK is the expression of the thoughts of the writer. The book of
          nature is an expression of the thoughts of God. We have God's terrible
          thoughts in the thunder and lightning; God's loving thoughts in the
          sunshine and the balmy breeze; God's bounteous, prudent, careful
          thoughts in the waving harvest and in the ripening meadow. We have
          God's brilliant thoughts in the wondrous scenes which are beheld from
          mountain-top and valley; and we have God's most sweet and pleasant
          thoughts of beauty in the little flowers that blossom at our feet. But
          you will remark that God has in nature given most prominence to those
          thoughts that needed to have the pre-eminence. He hath not given us
          broad acres overspread with flowers, for they were not needed in such
          abundance, but he hath spread the fields with corn, that thus the
          absolute necessities of life might be supplied. We needed most of the
          thoughts of his providence; and he hath quickened our industry, so
          that God's providential care may be read as we ride along the roads on
          every side. Now, God's book of grace is just like his book of nature;
          it is his thoughts written out. This great book, the Bible, this most
          precious volume is the heart of God made legible; it is the gold of
          God's love beaten out into leaf gold, so that therewith our thoughts
          might be plated, and we also might have golden, good, and holy
          thoughts concerning him. And you will mark that, as in nature so in
          grace, the most necessary is the most prominent. I see in God's word a
          rich abundance of flowers of glorious eloquence; often I find a
          prophet marshalling his words like armies for might, and like kings
          for majesty. But far more frequently I read simple declarations of the
          truth. I see here and there a brilliant thought of beauty, but I find
          whole fields of plain didactic doctrine, which is food for the soul;
          and I find whole chapters full of Christ which is divine manna,
          whereon the soul doth feed. I see starry words to make the Scriptures
          brilliant, sweet thoughts to make them fair, great thoughts to make
          them impressive, terrible thoughts to make them awful; but necessary
          thoughts, instructive thoughts, saving thoughts, are far more
          frequent, because far more necessary. Here and there a bed of flowers,
          but broad acres of living corn of the gospel of the grace of God. You
          must excuse me, then, if I very frequently dwell on the whole topic of
          salvation. But last Sabbath I brought you one shock of this wheat, in
          the fashion of Christ's promise, which saith, |He that calleth on the
          name of the Lord, shall be saved.| And then I sought to show how men
          might be saved. I bring you now another shock cut down in the self
          same field, teaching you the great philosophy of salvation, the hidden
          mystery, the great secret, the wonderful discovery which is brought to
          light by the gospel; how God is just, and yet the justifier of the
          ungodly. Let us read the text again, and then at once proceed to
          discuss it. I intend to do to-day, as I did last Sunday; I shall just
          be as simple as ever I can; and I shall not attempt one single flight
          of eloquence or oratory, even if I am capable of it; but just go along
          the ground, so that every simple soul may be able to understand. --
          |For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might
          be made the righteousness of God in him.|
        </p>
        <p>Note the doctrine; the use of it; the enjoyment of it.</p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE DOCTRINE. There are three persons mentioned here. |He
          (that is God) hath made him (that is Christ) who knew no sin, to be
          sin for us (sinners) that we might be made the righteousness of God in
          him.| Before we can understand the plan of salvation, it is necessary
          for us to know something about the three persons, and, certainly,
          unless we understand them in some measure, salvation is to us
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Here is first, GOD. Let every man know what God is. God is a very
          different Being from what some of you suppose. The God of heaven and
          of earth -- the Jehovah of Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, Creator and
          Preserver, the God of Holy Scripture, and the God of all grace, is not
          the God that some men make unto themselves, and worship. There be men
          in this so called Christian land, who worship a god who is no more God
          than Venus or Bacchus! A god made after their own hearts; a god not
          fashioned out of stone or wood, but fashioned from their own thoughts,
          out of baser stuff than ever heathen attempted to make a god of. The
          God of Scripture has three great attributes, and they are all three
          implied in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The God of Scripture is a sovereign God; that is, he is a God who has
          absolute authority, and absolute power to do exactly as he pleaseth.
          Over the head of God there is no law, upon his arm there is no
          necessity; he knoweth no rule but his own free and mighty will. And
          though he cannot be unjust, and cannot do anything but good, yet is
          his nature absolutely free; for goodness is the freedom of God's
          nature. God is not to be controlled by the will of man, nor the
          desires of man, nor by fate in which the superstitious believe; he is
          God, doing as he willeth in the armies of heaven, and in this lower
          world. He is a God, too, who giveth no account of his matters; he
          makes his creatures just what he chooses to make them, and does with
          them just as he wills. And if any of them resent his acts, he saith
          unto them: -- |Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
          Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made
          me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
          make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?| God is good;
          but God is sovereign, absolute, knowing, nothing that can control him.
          The monarchy of this world, is no constitutional and limited monarchy;
          it is not tyrannical, but it is absolutely in the hands of an all-wise
          God. But mark, it is in no hands but his; no cherubim, not seraphim
          can assist God in the dispensation of his government.
        </p>
        <p>|He sits on no precarious throne,</p>
        <p>Nor borrows leave to be.|</p>
        <p>
          He is the God of predestination; the God upon whose absolute will, the
          hinge of fate doth turn.
        </p>
        <p>|Chain'd to his throne, a volume lies,</p>
        <p>With all the fates of men,</p>
        <p>With every angel's form and size,</p>
        <p>Drawn by th' eternal pen.</p>
        <p>His providence unfolds the book,</p>
        <p>And makes his councils shine,</p>
        <p>Each opening leaf, and every stroke,</p>
        <p>Fulfils some deep design.|</p>
        <p>
          This is the God of the Bible, this is the God whom we adore; no weak,
          pusillanimous God, who is controlled by the will of men, who cannot
          steer the bark of providence; but a God unalterable, infinite,
          unerring. This is the God we worship; a God as infinitely above his
          creatures, as the highest thought an fly; and higher still than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, again, the God who is here mentioned, is a God of infinite
          justice. That he is a sovereign God, I prove from the words, that he
          hath made Christ to be sin. He could not have done it if he had not
          been sovereign. That he is a just God, I infer from my text; seeing
          that the way of salvation is a great plan of satisfying justice. And
          we now declare that the God of Holy Scripture is a God of inflexible
          justice; he is not the God whom some of you adore. You adore a god who
          winks at great sins; you believe in a god who calls your crimes
          peccadilloes and little faults. Some of you worship a god who does not
          punish sin; but who is so weakly merciful, and so mercilessly weak,
          that he passes by transgression and iniquity, and never enacts a
          punishment. You believe in a god, who, if man sins, does not demand
          punishment for his offense. You think that a few good works of your
          own will pacify him, that he is so weak a ruler, that a few good words
          uttered before him in prayer will win sufficient merit to reverse the
          sentence, if, indeed, you think he ever passes a sentence at all. Your
          god is no God; he is as much a false god as the god of the Greeks, or
          of ancient Nineveh. The God of Scripture is one who is inflexibly
          severe in justice, and will by no means clear the guilty. |The Lord is
          slow to anger, and great in power; and will not at all acquit the
          wicked.| The God of Scripture is a ruler, who, when his subjects
          rebel, marks their crime, and never forgives them until he has
          punished it, either upon them, or upon their substitute. He is not
          like the god of some sectaries, who believe in a god without an
          atonement, with only some little show upon the cross, which was not,
          as they say, a real suffering of sin. Their god, the god of the
          Socinian, just blots out sin without exacting any punishment; he is
          not the God of the Scriptures. The God of the Bible is as severe as if
          he were unmerciful, and as just as if he were not gracious; and yet he
          is as gracious and as merciful as if he were not just -- yea, more so.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one more thought here concerning God, or else we cannot establish
          our discourse upon a sure basis. The God who is here means, is a God
          of grace: think not that I am now contradicting myself. The God who is
          inflexibly severe, and never pardons sin without punishment, is yet a
          God of illimitable love. Although as a Ruler he will chastise, yet, as
          the Father-God, he loveth to bestow his blessing. |As I live, saith
          the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth; but had
          rather that he should turn unto me and live.| God is love in its
          highest degree. He is love rendered more than love. Love is not God,
          but God is love; he is full of grace, he is the plenitude of mercy, --
          he delighteth in mercy. As high as the heavens are above the earth, so
          high are his thoughts of love above our thoughts of despair; and his
          ways of grace above our ways of fear. This God, in whom these three
          great attributes harmonize -- illimitable sovereignty, inflexible
          justice, and unfathomable grace -- these three make up the main
          attributes of the one God of heaven and earth whom Christians worship.
          It is this God, before whom we must appear; it is he who has made
          Christ to be sin for us, though he knew no sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Thus, we have brought the first person before you. The second
          person of our text is the Son of God -- Christ, who knew no sin. He is
          the Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds: begotten,
          not made; being of the same substance with the Father, co-equal,
          co-eternal, and co-existent. Is the Father Almighty? So is the Son
          Almighty. Is the Father infinite? So is the Son infinite. He is very
          God of very God: having a dignity not inferior to the Father, but
          being equal to him in every respect, -- God over all, blessed for
          evermore. Jesus Christ also, is the son of Mary, a man like unto
          ourselves. A man subject to all the infirmities of human nature,
          except the infirmities of sin; a man of suffering and of woe; of pain
          and trouble; of anxiety and fear; of trouble and of doubt; of
          temptation and of trial; of weakness and death. He is a man just as we
          are, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. Now, the person we wish
          to introduce to you, is this complex being, God and man. Not God
          humanized, not man Deified; but God, purely, essentially God; man,
          purely man; man, not more than man; God, not less than God, -- the two
          standing in a sacred union together, the God-Man. Of this God in
          Christ, our text says that he knew no sin. It does not say that he did
          not sin; that we know: but it says more than that; he did not know
          sin; he knew not what sin was. He saw it in others, but he did not
          know it by experience. He was a perfect stranger to it. It is not
          barely said, that he did not take sin into his heart; but, he did not
          know it. It was no acquaintance of his. He was the acquaintance of
          grief; but he was not the acquaintance of sin. He knew no sin of any
          kind, -- no sin of thought, no sin of birth, no original, no actual
          transgression; no sin of lip, or of hand, did ever Christ commit. He
          was pure, perfect, spotless; like his own divinity, without spot or
          blemish, or any such thing. This gracious person, is he who is spoken
          of in the text. He was a person utterly incapable of committing
          anything that was wrong. It has been asserted lately, by some
          ill-judged one, that Christ was capable of sin. I think it was Irving
          who started some such idea, that if Christ was not capable of sinning,
          he could not have been capable of virtue. |For,| say they, |if a man
          must necessarily be good, there is no virtue in his goodness.| Out
          upon their ridiculous nonsense. Is not God necessarily good? And who
          dares deny that God is virtuous? Are not the glorified spirits in
          heaven necessarily pure? and yet are they not holy because of that
          very necessity? Are not the angels, now that they are confirmed,
          necessarily faultless? and shall any one dare to deny angelic virtue!
          The thing is not true; it needs no freedom in order to create virtue.
          Freedom and virtue generally go together; but necessity and virtue are
          as much brother and sister as freedom and virtue. Jesus Christ was not
          capable of sin; it was as utterly impossible for Christ to have
          sinned, as for fire to drown or for water to burn. I suppose both of
          these things might be possible under some peculiar circumstances; but
          it never could have been possible for Christ to have committed or to
          have endured the shadow of the commission of a sin. He did not know
          it. He knew no sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now I have to introduce the third person. We will not go far for
          him. The third person is the sinner. And where is he? Will you turn
          your eyes within you, and look for him, each one of you? He is not
          very far from you. He has been a drunkard: he has committed
          drunkenness and revelling and such like, and we know that the man who
          committeth these things, hath no inheritance in the kingdom of God.
          There is another, he has taken God's name in vain; he has sometimes,
          in his hot passion, asked God to do most fearful things against his
          limbs and against his soul. Ah! there is the sinner. Where is he? I
          hear that man, with tearful eye, and with sobbing voice exclaim, |Sir,
          he is here!| Methinks I see some woman here, in the midst of us, some
          of us have accused her perhaps, and she standeth alone trembling, and
          saith not a word for herself. Oh! that the Master might say, |neither
          do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.| I believe, I must believe,
          that somewhere amongst these many thousands, I hear some palpitating
          heart, and that heart, as it beats so hurriedly crieth, |Sin, sin,
          sin, wrath, wrath, wrath, how can I get deliverance?| Ah! thou art the
          man, a born rebel; born into the world a sinner, thou hast added to
          thy native guilt thine own transgressions. Thou hast broken the
          commandments of God, thou hast despised God's love, thou hast trampled
          on his grace, thou hast gone on hitherto until now, the arrow of the
          Lord is drinking up thy spirit; God hath made thee tremble, he hath
          made thee to confess thy guilt and thy transgression. Hear me, then,
          if your convictions are the work of God's Spirit, you are the person
          intended in the text, when it says, |He hath made him to be sin for
          us, who knew no sin, that we | -- that is you -- |might be made the
          righteousness of God in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I have introduced the persons, and now I must introduce you to a scene
          of a great exchange which is made according to the text. The third
          person whom we introduce is the prisoner at the bar. As a sinner, God,
          has called him before him, he is about to be tried for life or death.
          God is gracious, and he desires to save him; God is just, and he must
          punish him. The sinner is to be tried; if there be a verdict of guilty
          brought in against him, how will the two conflicting attributes work
          in God's mind? He is loving, he wants to save him; he is just, he must
          destroy him! How shall this mystery be solved, and the riddle be
          solved? Prisoner at the bar, canst thou plead |Not Guilty?| He stands
          speechless; or, if he speaks, he cries, |I am Guilty!|
        </p>
        <p>Shouldst thou smite my soul to hell,</p>
        <p>Thy righteous law approves it well.</p>
        <p>
          Then, you see, if he has pleaded guilty himself, there is no hope of
          there being any flaw in the evidence. And even if he had pleaded |not
          guilty,| yet the evidence is most clear, for God, the Judge, has seen
          his sin, and recorded all his iniquities; so that there would be no
          hope of his escaping. The prisoner is sure to be found guilty. How can
          he escape? Is there a flaw in the indictment? No! it is drawn up by
          infinite wisdom, and dictated by eternal justice; and there is no hope
          there. Can he turn king's evidence? Ah! if we could be saved by
          turning king's evidence, we should all of us be saved. There is an
          anomaly in our law which often allows the greater criminal to escape,
          whilst the lesser criminal is punished. If the one is dastard and
          coward enough by betraying his comrade he may save himself. If you
          turn to the Newgate Calendar -- if any of you have patience enough to
          read so vile a piece of literature -- you will see that the greatest
          of two murderers has escaped whilst the other has been hanged, because
          he turned king's evidence. You have told of your fellows; you have
          said, |Lord, I thank thee, I am not as other men; I am not as that
          adulterer, or even as that publican. I bless thee, I am not like my
          neighbor, who is an extortioner, a thief, and so on.| You are telling
          against your neighbor; you are joint sinners, and you are telling a
          tale against him. There is no hope for you; God's law knows of no such
          injustice as a man escaping by turning informer upon others. How then
          shall the prisoner at the bar escape? Is there any possibility? Oh!
          how did heaven wonder! how did the stars stand still with
          astonishment! and how did the angels stay their songs a moment, when
          for the first time, God showed how he might be just, and yet be
          gracious! Oh! I think I see heaven astonished, and silence in the
          courts of God for the space of an hour, when the Almighty said,
          |Sinner. I must and will punish thee on account of sin! But I love
          thee; the bowels of my love yearn over thee. How can I make thee as
          Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My justice says smite,' but my
          love stays my hand, and says, spare, spare the sinner!' Oh! sinner, my
          heart hath devised it; my Son, the pure and perfect shall stand in thy
          stead, and be accounted guilty, and thou, the guilty, shall stand in
          my Son's stead and be accounted righteous!| It would make us leap upon
          our feet in astonishment if we did but understand this thoroughly --
          the wonderful mystery of the transposition of Christ and the sinner.
          Let me put it so plainly that every one can understand: Christ was
          spotless; sinners were vile. Says Christ |My father, treat me as if I
          were a sinner; treat the sinner as if he were me. Smite as sternly as
          thou pleasest, for I will bear it, and thus the bowels of thy love may
          overflow with grace, and yet thy justice be unsullied, for the sinner
          is no sinner now.| He stands in Christ's stead, and with the Saviour's
          garments on, he is accepted.| Do you say that such an exchange as this
          is unjust? Will you say that God should not have made his Son a
          substitute for us, and have let us go? Let me remind you it was purely
          voluntary on the part of Christ. Christ was willing to stand in our
          stead; he had to drink the cup of our punishment, but he was quite
          willing to do it. And let me tell you yet one more unanswerable thing,
          the substitution of Christ was not an unlawful thing, because the
          sovereign God made him a substitute. We have read in history of a
          certain wife whose attachment to her husband was so great, that the
          wife has gone into the prison and exchanged clothes with him; and
          while the prisoner was escaping, the wife has remained in the
          prison-house; and so the prisoner has escaped by a kind of
          surreptitious substitution. In such a case there was a clear breach of
          law, and the prisoner escaping might have been pursued and again
          imprisoned. But in this case the substitution was made by the highest
          authority. The text says, God |hath made him to be sin for us;| and
          inasmuch as Christ did stand in my room, place, and stead, he did not
          make the exchange unlawfully. It was with the full determinate counsel
          of Almighty God, as well as with his own consent, that Christ stood in
          the sinner's place, as the sinner doth now in Christ's place. Old
          Martin Luther was a man for speaking a thing pretty plainly, and
          sometimes he spoke the truth so plainly that he made it look very much
          like a lie. In one of his sermons he said, |Christ was the greatest
          sinner that ever lived.| Now, Christ never was a sinner, but yet
          Martin was right. He meant to say, all the sins of Christ's people
          were taken off them and put on Christ's head, and so Christ stood in
          God's sight as if he had been the greatest sinner that ever lived. He
          never was a sinner; he never knew sin; but good Martin, in his zeal to
          make men understand what it was, said, |Sinner, you became Christ;
          Christ, you became a sinner!| It is not quite the truth; the sinner is
          treated as if he were Christ, and Christ is treated as if he were the
          sinner. That is what is meant by the text God |hath made him to be sin
          for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of
          God in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me just give you two illustrations of this. The first shall be
          taken from the Old Testament. When, of old, men did come before God
          with sin, God provided a sacrifice which should be the representative
          of Christ, inasmuch as the sacrifice died instead of the sinner. The
          law ran, |He that sins shall die.| When men had committed sin they
          brought a bullock or a sheep before the altar; they put their hand on
          the bullock's head and acknowledged their guilt; and by that deed
          their guilt was typically removed from themselves to the bullock.
          Then, the poor bullock, which had done no wrong, was slaughtered, and
          cast out as a sin offering, which God had rejected. That is what every
          sinner must do with Christ, if he is to be saved. A sinner, by faith,
          comes and puts his hand on Christ's head, and confessing all his sin,
          it is not his any longer, it is put on Christ. Christ hangs upon the
          tree; he bears the cross and endures the shame; and so the sin is all
          gone and cast into the depths of the sea. Take another illustration.
          We read in the New Testament, that |the Church (that is, the people of
          God) is Christ's bride.| We all know that, according to the law, the
          wife may have many debts; but no sooner is she married than her debts
          cease to be hers, and become her husband's at once. So that if a woman
          be overwhelmed with debt, so that she is in daily fear of the prison,
          let her but once stand up and give her hand to a man and become his
          wife, and there is none in the world can touch her; the husband is
          liable for all, and she says to her creditor, |Sir, I owe you nothing;
          my husband did not owe you anything; I incurred the debt; but,
          inasmuch as I have become his wife, my debts are taken off from me,
          and become his.| It is even so with the sinner and Christ. Christ
          marieth the sinner and putteth forth his hand, and taketh the Church
          to be his. She is in debt to God's justice immeasurably; she owes to
          God's vengeance an intolerable weight of wrath and punishment; Christ
          says, |Thou art my wife: I have chosen thee, and I will pay thy
          debts.| And he has paid them, and got his full discharge. Now,
          whosoever believeth in Christ Jesus hath peace with God, because |he
          hath made Christ to be sin for us, though he knew no sin, that we
          might be made the righteousness of God in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I shall have finished the explanation of the text, when I
          just bid you remember the consequences of this great substitution.
          Christ was made sin; we are made the righteousness of God. It was in
          the past, long further back than the memory of angels can reach -- it
          was in the dark past, before cherubim or seraphim had flapped the
          unnavigated ether -- when as yet worlds were not, and creation had not
          a name, God foresaw the sin of man, and planned his redemption. An
          eternal covenant was formed between the Father and the Son; wherein
          the Son did stipulate to suffer for his elect; and the Father on his
          part, did covenant to justify them through the Son. Oh, wondrous
          covenant, thou art the source of all the streams of atoning love.
          Eternity rolled on, time came, and with it soon came the fall, and
          then when many years had run their round the fullness of time arrived,
          and Jesus prepared to fulfill his solemn engagement. He came into the
          world, and was made a man From that moment, when he became a man; mark
          the change that was wrought in him. Before, he had been entirely
          happy; he had never been miserable never sad; but now as the effects
          of that terrible covenant, which he had made with God, his Father
          begins to pour wrath upon him. What, you say does God actually account
          his Son to be a sinner? Yes, he does; His Son agreed to be the
          substitute, to stand in the sinner's stead. God begins with him at his
          birth; he puts him in a manger. If he had considered him as a perfect
          man, he would have provided him a throne: but considering him as a
          sinner, he subjects him to woe and poverty from beginning to end. And
          now see him grown to manhood; see him -- griefs pursue him, sorrows
          follow him. Stop, griefs, why follow ye the perfect? why pursue ye the
          immaculate? Justice, why dost thou not drive these griefs away? --
          |the pure should be peaceful, and the immaculate should be happy.| The
          answer comes: |This man is pure in himself, but he has made himself
          impure by taking his people's sin.| Guilt is imputed to him, and the
          very imputation of guilt brings grief with all its reality. At last, I
          see death coming with more than its usual horrors; I see the grim
          skeleton with his dart well sharpened; I see behind him, Hell. I mark
          the grim prince of darkness, and all the avengers uprising from their
          place of torment; I see them all besetting the Saviour; I notice their
          terrible war upon him in the garden; I note him as he lies there
          wallowing in his blood in fearful soul-death. I see him as in grief
          and sorrow, he walks to Pilate's bar; I see him mocked and spit upon;
          I behold him tormented, maltreated, and blasphemed; I see him nailed
          to the cross; I behold the mocking continued, and the shame unabated;
          I mark him shrieking for water, and I hear him complaining of the
          forsakings of God! I am astonished. Can this be just that a perfect
          being should suffer thus? -- Oh, God, where art thou, that thou canst
          thus permit the oppression of the innocent? Hast thou ceased to be
          King of Justice, else why dost thou not shield the perfect One? The
          answer comes: Be still; he is perfect in himself, but he is the sinner
          now -- he stands in the sinner's stead; the sinner's guilt is on him,
          and, therefore it is right, it is just, it is what he hath himself
          agreed to, that he should be punished as if he were a sinner, that he
          should be frowned upon, that he should die, and that he should descend
          to Hades unblessed, uncomforted, unhelped, unhonored, and unowned.
          This was one of the effects of the great change which Christ made.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, now, take the other side of the question, and I have done with
          explanation. What was the effect on us? Do you see that sinner there
          dabbling his hand in lust, defiling his garments with every sin the
          flesh had ever indulged in? Do you hear him cursing God? Do you mark
          him breaking every ordinance that God hath rendered sacred? But do you
          see him in a little season pursuing his way to heaven? He has
          renounced these sins; he has been converted, and has forsaken them; he
          is going on the way to heaven. Justice, art thou asleep? That man has
          broken thy law; is he to go to heaven? Hark, how the fiends come
          rising from the pit and cry -- |That man deserves to be lost; he may
          not be now what he used to be, but his past sins, must have
          vengeance.| And, yet there he goes safely on his way to heaven, and I
          see him looking back on all the fiends that accuse him. He cries out,
          |Behold, who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect?| And when
          one would think all hell would be up in arms and accuse, the grim
          tyrant lieth still, and the fiends have nought to say; and I see him
          turning his face heavenward to the throne of God, and hear him cry
          |Who is he that condemneth?| as with unblushing countenance he
          challengeth the Judge. Oh! justice, where art thou? This man has been
          a sinner, a rebel; why not smite him to the dust for his impertinent
          presumption in thus challenging the justice of God? Nay, says Justice,
          he hath been a sinner, but I do not look upon him in that light now; I
          have punished Christ instead of him: that sinner is no sinner now --
          he is perfect. How? perfect! Perfect, because Christ was perfect, and
          I look upon him as if he were Christ. Though in himself all black as
          the gates of Kedar, I consider him to be fair as the curtains of
          Solomon. I make Christ the sinner, and I punish Christ; I make the
          sinner Christ, and I magnify and exalt him. And I will put a crown of
          pure gold upon his head, and by-and-bye, I will give him a place among
          them that are sanctified, where he shall, harp in hand, for ever
          praise the name of the Lord. This is the grand result to sinners of
          the great exchange. |For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew
          no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, I have to come towards the close, to my second point, upon
          which I shall be brief but laborious. WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS
          DOCTRINE? Turn to the Scriptures and you will see. |Now, then, we are
          ambassadors for God, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you
          in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God, for | -- here is our grand
          argument -- |He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin.| Men
          and brethren, I am about to pray to you; I am about to beseech and
          exhort you; may the Spirit of God help me to do it with all the
          earnestness which becomes me. You and I shall face each other soon
          before the bar of the great judge, and I shall be responsible in the
          day of account for all I preach to you; not for my style or talent, or
          want of talent, I shall only be responsible for my earnestness and
          zeal in this matter. And, now, before God I entreat you most earnestly
          to be reconciled to him, you are by nature at enmity with God; you
          hate him, you neglect him, your enmity shows itself in various ways. I
          beseech you now be reconciled to God. I might entreat you to be
          reconciled, because it would be a fearful thing to die with God for
          your enemy. Who among us can dwell with devouring fire? who can abide
          with the eternal burnings? It is a fearful thing to fall into the
          hands of the living God, for our God is a consuming fire. Beware, ye
          that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces and there be none to
          deliver. I beseech you therefore, be reconciled to God. I might on the
          other hand, use another argument, and remind you that those who are
          reconciled to God, are thereby proved to be the inheritors of the
          kingdom of heaven. There are crowns for God's friends; there are harps
          for them that love him; there is prepared a mansion for every one that
          seeketh unto him. Therefore, if thou wouldst be blessed throughout
          eternity, be reconciled to God. But I shall not urge that; I shall
          urge the reason of my text. I beseech thee, my hearer, be reconciled
          to God, because if thou repentest, it is proof that Christ has stood
          in thy stead. Oh, if this argument do not melt thee, there is none in
          heaven or earth that can. If thy heart melteth not at such an argument
          as this, then it is harder than the nether millstone, sure thou hast a
          soul of stone, and a heart of brass, if thou wilt not be reconciled to
          God who hath written this for thine encouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I beseech thee be reconciled to God, because in this there is proof
          that God is loving you. Thou thinkest God to be a God of wrath. Would
          he have given his own Son to be punished if he had hated thee? Sinner
          if God had anything but thoughts of love towards thee, I ask, would he
          have given up his Son to hang upon the cross? Think not my God a
          tyrant; think him not a wrathful God, destitute of mercy. His Son,
          torn from his bosom and given up to die, is the best proof of his
          love. Oh, sinner, I need not blame thee if thou didst hate thy enemy,
          but I must blame thee, call thee mad, if thou dost hate thy friend.
          Oh, I need not wonder if thou wouldst not be reconciled to one who
          would not be reconciled to thee; but, inasmuch as thou wilt not by
          nature be reconciled to the God who gave his own Son to die, I must
          marvel at the stupidity into which thine evil nature hath hurried
          thee. God is love; wilt thou be unreconciled to love? God is grace;
          wilt thou be unreconciled to grace. Oh, rebel that thou art of deepest
          dye if still thou art unreconciled. Remember, too, oh, soul, that the
          way is open for thy reconciliation, Thou needest not be punished; yea,
          thou shalt not be. If thou knowest thyself to be a sinner, by the
          Spirit's teaching, God will not punish thee to maintain His justice:
          that justice is sufficiently maintained by the punishment of Christ.
          He saith, |be reconciled.| The child runneth away from his father when
          he hath sinned, because he fears his father will punish him; but when
          his father burns the rod, and with a smiling face says, |child, come
          hither,| sure it must be an unloving child that would not run into
          such a father's arms. Sinner thou deservest the sword; God has snapped
          the sword across the knee of Christ's atonement, and now he says |Come
          to me.| You deserve infinite, eternal wrath, and the displeasure of
          God; God has quenched that wrath for all believers, and now he says,
          |Come to me and be reconciled.| Do you tell me that you are not
          sinners? I was not preaching to you. Do you tell me that you have
          never rebelled against God? I warn you that though you cannot find
          your own sins out, God will find them out. Do you say, |I need no
          reconciliation, except that which I can make myself?| Be warned that
          if thou rejectest Christ, thou rejectest thine only hope; for all that
          thou canst do is less than nothing and vanity. I was not preaching to
          thee, when I said, |Be reconciled.| I was preaching to thee, poor
          afflicted conscience; I was preaching to thee -- thou that hast been a
          great sinner and transgressor, thou that feelest thy guilt; to thee,
          thou adulterer, trembling now under the lash of conviction; to thee;
          thou blasphemer, quivering now from head to foot; I preach to thee
          thou thief, whose eye is now filled with the tear of penitence; thou
          feelest that hell must be thy portion, unless thou art saved through
          Christ; I preach to thee, thou that knowest thy guilt; I preach to
          thee and to every one such, and I beseech thee to be reconciled to
          God, for God is reconciled to thee. Oh, let not your heart stand out
          against this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot plead as I could wish. Oh! if I could I would plead with my
          heart, with my eyes, and my lips, that I might lead you to the
          Saviour. You need not rail at me and call this an Arminian style of
          preaching; I care not for your opinion, this style is Scriptural. |As
          though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's stead, be
          ye reconciled to God.| Poor broken-hearted sinner, God is as much
          preaching to you this morning, and bidding you be reconciled, as if he
          stood here himself in his own person; and though I be a mean and puny
          man by whom he speaketh, he speaketh now as much as if it were by the
          voice of angels, |Be reconciled to God.| Come, friend, turn not thine
          eye and head away from me; but give me thine hand and lend me thine
          heart whilst I weep over thine hand and cry over thine heart, and
          beseech thee not to despise thine own mercy, not to be a suicide to
          thine own soul, not to damn thyself. Now that God has awakened thee to
          feel that thou art an enemy, I beseech thee now to be his friend.
          Remember, if thou art now convinced of sin, there is no punishment for
          thee. He was punished in thy stead. Wilt thou believe this? Wilt thou
          trust in it, and so be at peace with God? If thou sayest, |No!| then I
          would have thee know that thou hast put away thine own mercy. If thou
          sayest, |I need no reconciliation,| thou hast thrust away the only
          hope thou canst ever have. Do it at thine own hazard; I wash my hands
          of thy blood. But, but, but, if thou knowest thyself to need a Saviour
          if thou wouldst escape the hellish pit, if thou wouldst walk among
          them that are sanctified, I again, in the name of him that will
          condemn thee at the last day, if thou rejectest this invitation,
          implore and beseech thee to be reconciled to God. I am his ambassador.
          When I have done this sermon, I shall go back to court. Sinner, what
          shall I say of thee. Shall I go back and tell my Master that thou
          intendest to be his enemy for ever? Shall I go back and tell him,
          |They heard me, but they regarded not?| they said in their hearts, |we
          will go away to our sins and our follies, and we will not serve your
          God, neither fear him!| Shall I tell him such a message as that? Must
          I be driven to go back to his palace with such a fearful story? I
          beseech thee, send me not back so, lest my Master's wrath wax hot, and
          he say,
        </p>
        <p>|They that despised my promised rest,</p>
        <p>Shall have no portion there|</p>
        <p>
          But oh! may I not go back to court to-day, and tell the Monarch on my
          knees, |There be some my Lord, that have been great rebels, but when
          they saw themselves rebels, they threw themselves at the foot of the
          cross, and asked for pardon. They had strangely revolted, but I heard
          them say, If he will forgive me I will turn from my evil ways, if he
          will enable me!' They were gross transgressors, and they confessed it;
          but I heard them say, Jesus, thy blood and righteousness are my only
          trust.'| Happy ambassador, I will go back to my Master with a gladsome
          countenance, and tell him that peace is made between many a soul and
          the great God. But miserable ambassador who has to go back and say,
          |There is no peace made.| How shall it be? The Lord decide it! May
          many hearts give way to Omnipotent grace now, and may enemies of grace
          be changed into friends, that God's elect may be gathered in, and his
          eternal purpose accomplished.
        </p>

          III. And now, I close up by noticing the SWEET ENJOYMENT which this
          doctrine brings to a believer. Mourning Christian! dry up your tears.
          Are you weeping on account of sin? Why weepest thou? Weep because of
          thy sin, but weep not through any fear of punishment. Has the evil one
          told thee that thou shalt be condemned? Tell him to his face that he
          lies. Ah! poor distressed believer; art thou mourning over thine own
          corruptions? Look to thy perfect Lord, and remember, thou art complete
          in him, thou art in God's sight as perfect as if thou hadst never
          sinned; nay, more than that, the Lord our righteousness hath put a
          divine garment upon thee, so that thou hast more than the
          righteousness of man -- thou hast the righteousness of God. Oh! thou
          that art mourning by reason of in-bred sin and depravity, remember,
          none of thy sins an condemn thee. Thou hast learned to hate sin; but
          thou hast learned to know that sin is not thine -- it is put on
          Christ's head. Come, be of good cheer: thy standing is not in thyself
          -- it is in Christ; thine acceptance is not in thyself, but in thy
          Lord; with all thy sin, thou art as much accepted to-day as in thy
          sanctification; thou art as much accepted of God to-day, with all
          thine iniquities, as thou wilt be when thou standest before his
          throne, rendered free from all corruption. Oh! I beseech thee, lay
          hold on this precious thought, perfection in Christ! For thou art
          perfect in Christ Jesus. With thy Saviour's garment on, thou art holy
          as the holy ones; thou art now justified by faith; thou hast now peace
          with God. Be of good cheer; do not fear to die; death has nothing
          terrible in it to thee; Christ hath extracted all the gall from the
          sting of death. Tremble not at judgment; judgment will not bring thee
          another acquital, to add to the acquital already given in thy cause.
        </p>
        <p>Bold shalt thou stand at that great day,</p>
        <p>For who aught to thy charge can lay</p>
        <p>Fully absolved by Christ thou art,</p>
        <p>From sin's tremendous guilt and smart.</p>
        <p>
          Ah, when thou comest to die, thou shalt challenge God; for thou shalt
          say, |My God, thou canst not condemn me, for thou hast condemned
          Christ for me, thou hast punished Christ in my stead. Who is he that
          condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again,
          who also sitteth on the right hand of God and maketh intercession for
          us:'| Christian, be glad; let thy head lack no oil, and thy face no
          ointment; |go thy way; eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with
          a merry heart, for God hath accepted thy works.| Do as Solomon bids us
          do; live happily all the days of thy life; for thou art accepted in
          the beloved -- thou art pardoned through the blood, and justified
          through the righteousness of Christ. What hast thou to fear? Let thy
          face ever wear a smile; let thine eyes sparkle with gladness; live
          near thy Master; live in the suburbs of the celestial city, as
          by-and-by when thy time has come thou shalt borrow better wings than
          angels ever wore, and out soar the cherubim, and rise up where thy
          Jesus sits -- sit at his right hand, even as he has overcome and has
          sat down upon his Father's right hand; and all this because the divine
          Lord, |was made to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
          made the righteousness of God in him.|<br />
