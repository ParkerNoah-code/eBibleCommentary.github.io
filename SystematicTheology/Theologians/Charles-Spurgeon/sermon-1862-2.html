          "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but
          of God that showeth mercy." -- Romans 9:16

        <p>
          The great controversy which for many ages has divided the Christian
          Church has hinged upon the difficult question of "the will." I need
          not say of that conflict that it has done much mischief to the
          Christian Church, undoubtedly it has; but I will rather say, that it
          has been fraught with incalculable usefulness; for it has thrust
          forward before the minds of Christians, precious truths, which but for
          it, might have been kept in the shade. I believe that the two great
          doctrines of human responsibility and divine sovereignty have both
          been brought out the more prominently in the Christian Church by the
          fact that there is a class of strong-minded hard-headed men who
          magnify sovereignty at the expense of responsibility; and another
          earnest and useful class who uphold and maintain human responsibility
          oftentimes at the expense of divine sovereignty. I believe there is a
          needs-be for this in the finite character of the human mind, while the
          natural lethargy of the Church requires a kind of healthy irritation
          to arouse her powers and to stimulate her exertions. The pebbles in
          the living stream of truth are worn smooth and round by friction. Who
          among us would wish to suspend a law of nature whose effects on the
          whole are good? I glory in that which at the present day is so much
          spoken against -- sectarianism, for "sectarianism" is the cant phrase
          which our enemies use for all firm religious belief. I find it applied
          to all sorts of Christians; no matter what views he may hold, if a man
          be but earnest, he is a sectarian at once. Success to sectarianism,
          let it live and flourish. When that is done with, farewell to the
          power of godliness. When we cease, each of us, to maintain our own
          views of truth, and to maintain those views firmly and strenuously,
          then truth shall fly out of hand, and error alone shall reign: this,
          indeed, is the object of our foes: under the cover of attacking sects,
          they attack true religion, and would drive it, if they could, from off
          the face of the earth. In the controversy which has raged, -- a
          controversy which, I again say, I believe to have been really healthy,
          and which has done us all a vast amount of good -- mistakes have
          arisen from two reasons. Some brethren have altogether forgotten one
          order of truths, and then, in the next place, they have gone too far
          with others. We all have one blind eye, and too often we are like
          Nelson in the battle, we put the telescope to that blind eye, and then
          protest that we cannot see. I have heard of one man who said he had
          read the Bible through thirty-four times on his knees, but could not
          see a word about election in it; I think it very likely that he could
          not; kneeling is a very uncomfortable posture for reading, and
          possibly the superstition which would make the poor man perform this
          penance would disqualify him for using his reason: moreover, to get
          through the Book thirty-four times, he probably read in such a hurry
          that he did not know what he was reading, and might as well have been
          dreaming over "Robinson Crusoe" as the Bible. He put the telescope to
          the blind eye. Many of us do that; we do not want to see a truth, and
          therefore we say we cannot see it. On the other hand, there are others
          who push a truth too far. "This is good; oh! this is precious!" say
          they, and then they think it is good for everything; that in fact it
          is the only truth in the world. You know how often things are injured
          by over-praise; how a good medicine, which really was a great boon for
          a certain disease, comes to be despised utterly by the physician,
          because a certain quack has praised it up as being a universal cure;
          so puffery in doctrine leads to dishonor. Truth has thus suffered on
          all sides; on the one hand brethren would not see the truth, and on
          the other hand they magnified out of proportion that which they did
          see. You have seen those mirrors, those globes that are sometimes hung
          in gardens; you walk up to them and you see your head ten times as
          large as your body, or you walk away and put yourself in another
          position, a then your feet are monstrous and the rest of your body is
          small; this is an ingenious toy, but I am sorry to say that many go to
          work with God's truth upon the model of this toy; they magnify one
          capital truth till it becomes monstrous; they minify and speak little
          of another truth till it becomes altogether forgotten. In what I shall
          be able say this morning you will probably detect the failing to which
          I allude, the common fault of humanity, and suspect that I also am
          magnifying one truth at the expense of another; but I will say this,
          before I proceed further, that it shall not be the case if I can help
          it, but I will endeavor honestly to bring out the truth as I have
          learned it, and if in ought ye see that I teach you what is contrary
          to the Word of God, reject it; but mark you, if it be according to
          God's Word, reject it at your peril; for when I have once delivered it
          to you, if ye receive it not the responsibility lies with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two things, then, this morning I shall have to talk about.
          The first is, that the work of salvation rests upon the will of God,
          and not upon the will of man; and secondly, the equally sure doctrine,
          that the will of man has its proper position in the work of salvation,
          and is not to be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, SALVATION HINGES UPON THE WILL OF GOD AND NOT UPON THE
          WILL OF MAN. So saith out text -- "It is not of him that willeth nor
          of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy;" by which is
          clearly meant that the reason why any man is saved is not because he
          wills it, but because God willed, accord to that other passage, "Ye
          have not chosen me, but I have chosen you." The whole scheme of
          salvation, we aver, from the first to the last, hinges and turns, and
          is dependent upon the absolute will of God, and not upon the will of
          the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, we think, we can show in two or three ways; and first, we think
          that analogy furnishes us with a rather strong argument. There is a
          certain likeness between all God's works; if a painter shall paint
          three pictures, there is a certain identity of style about all the
          three which leads you to know that they are from the same hand. Or, if
          an author shall write three works upon three different subjects, yet
          there are qualities running through the whole, which lead you to
          assert, "That is the same man's writing, I am certain, in the whole of
          the three books." Now what we find in the works of nature, we
          generally find to be correct with regard to the work of providence;
          and what is true of nature and of providence, is usually true with
          regard to the greater work of grace. Turn your thoughts, then, to the
          works of creation. There was a time when these works had no existence;
          the sun was not born; the young moon had not begun to fill her horns;
          the stars were not; not even the illimitable void of space was then in
          existence. God dwelt alone without a creature. I ask you, with whom
          did he then take counsel? Who instructed him? Who had a voice in the
          counsel by which the wisdom of God was directed? Did it not rest with
          his own will whether he would make or not? Was not creation itself,
          when it lay in embryo in his thoughts entirely, in his keeping, so
          that he would or would not just as he pleased? And when he willed to
          create, did he not still exercise his own discretion and will as to
          what and how he would make? If he hath made the stars spheres, what
          reason was there for this but his own will? If he hath chosen that
          they should move in the circle rather than in any other orbit, is it
          not God's own fiat that hath made them do so? And when this round
          world, this green earth on which we dwell, leaped from his molding
          hand into its sunlit track, was not this also according to the divine
          will? Who ordained, save the Lord, that there the Himalayas should
          lift up their heads and pierce the clouds, and that there the deep
          cavernous recesses of the sea should pierce earth's bowels of rock?
          Who, save himself, ordained that yon Sahara should be brown and
          sterile, and that yonder isle should laugh in the midst of the sea
          with joy over her verdure? Who, I say, ordained this, save God? You
          see running through creation, from the tiniest animalcule up to the
          tall archangel who stands before the throne, this working of God's own
          will. Milton was nobly right when he represents the Eternal One as
          saying,
        </p>
        <p>My goodness is most free</p>
        <p>To act or not: Necessity and Chance</p>
        <p>Approach not me, and what I will is fate.</p>
        <p>
          He created as it pleased him; he made them as he chose; the potter
          exercised power over his clay to make his vessels as he willed, and to
          make them for what purposes he pleased. Think you that he has
          abdicated the throne of grace? Does he reign in creation and not in
          grace? Is he absolute king over nature and not over the greater works
          of the new nature? Is he Lord over the things which his hand made at
          first, and not King over the great regeneration, the new-making
          wherein he maketh all things new?
        </p>
        <p>
          But take the works of Providence. I suppose there will be no dispute
          amongst us that in providential matters God ordereth all things
          according to the counsel of his own will. If we should, however, be
          troubled with doubts about the matter, we might hear the striking
          words of Nebuchadnezzar when, taught by God, he had repented of his
          pride -- "All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; he
          doth according to his will in the armies of heaven and among the
          inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
          What doest thou." From the first moment of human history even to the
          last, God's will shall be done. What though it be a catastrophe or a
          crime -- there may be the second causes and the action of human evil,
          but the great first cause is in all. If we could imagine that one
          human action had eluded the prescience or the predestination of God,
          we could suppose that the whole might have done so, and all things
          might drift to sea, anchorless, rudderless, a sport to every wave, the
          victim of tempest and hurricane. One leak in the ship of Providence
          would sink her, one hour in which Omnipotence relaxed its grasp and
          she would fall to atoms. But it is the comfortable conviction of all
          God's people that "all things work together for good to them that love
          God;" and that God ruleth and overruleth, and reigneth in all acts of
          men and in all events that transpire; from seeming evil still
          producing good, and better still, and better still in infinite
          progression, still ordering all things according the counsel of his
          will. And think you that he reigns in Providence and is King there,
          and not in grace? Has he given up the blood-bought land to be ruled by
          man, while common Providence is left as a lonely providence to be his
          only heritage? He hath not let slip the reins of the great chariot of
          Providence, and think you that when Christ goeth forth in the chariot
          of his grace it is with steeds unguided, or driven only by chance, or
          by the fickle will of man? Oh, no brethren. As surely as God's will is
          the axle of the universe, as certainly as God's will is the great
          heart of providence sending its pulsings through even the most distant
          limbs of human act, so in grace let us rest assured that he is King,
          willing to do as he pleases, having mercy on whom he will have mercy,
          calling whom he chooses to call, quickening whom he wills, and
          fulfilling, despite man's hardness of heart, despite man's willful
          rejection of Christ, his own purposes, his won decrees, without one of
          them falling to the ground. We think, then, that analogy helps to
          strengthen us in the declaration of e text, that salvation is not left
          with man's will.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But, secondly, we believe that the difficulties which surround the
          opposite theory are tremendous. In fact, we cannot bear to look them
          in the face. If there be difficulties about ours, there are ten times
          more about the opposite. We think that the difficulties which surround
          our belief that salvation depends upon the will of God, arise from our
          ignorance in not understanding enough of God to be able to judge of
          them; but that the difficulties in the other case do not arise from
          that cause, but from certain great truths, clearly revealed, which
          stand in manifest opposition to the figment which our opponents have
          espoused. According to their theory -- that salvation depends upon our
          own will -- you have first of all this difficulty to meet, that you
          have made the purpose of God in the great plan of salvation entirely
          contingent. You have the put an "if" upon everything. Christ may die,
          but it is not certain according to that theory that he will redeem a
          great multitude; nay, not certain that he will redeem any, since the
          efficacy of the redemption according to that plan, rests not in its
          own intrinsic power, but in the will of man accepting that redemption.
          Hence if man be, as we aver he always is, if he be a bond-slave as to
          his will, and will not yield to the invitation of God's grace, then in
          such a case the atonement of Christ would be valueless, useless, and
          altogether in vain, for not a soul would be saved by it; and even when
          souls are saved by it, according to that theory, the efficacy, I say,
          lies not in the blood itself, but in the will of man which gives it
          efficacy. Redemption is therefore made contingent; the cross shakes,
          the blood falls powerless on the ground, and atonement is a matter of
          perhaps. There is a heaven provided, but there may no souls who will
          ever come there if their coming is to be of themselves. There is a
          fountain filled with blood, but there may be none who will ever wash
          in it unless divine purpose and power shall constrain them to come.
          You may look at any one promise of grace, but you cannot say over it,
          "This is the sure mercy of David;" for there is an "if," and a "but;"
          a "perhaps," and a "peradventure." In fact, the reigns are gone out of
          God's hands; the linch-pin is taken away from the wheels of the
          creation; you have left the whole economy of grace and mercy to be the
          gathering together of fortuitous atoms impelled by man's own will, and
          what may become of it at the end nobody can know. We cannot tell on
          that theory whether God will be gloried or sin will triumph. Oh! how
          happy are we when come back to the old fashioned doctrines, and cast
          our anchor where it can get its grip in the eternal purpose and
          counsel of God, who worketh all things to the good pleasure of his
          will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then another difficulty comes in; not only is everything made
          contingent, but it does seem to us as if man were thus made to be the
          supreme being in the universe. According to the freewill scheme the
          Lord intends good, but he must win like a lackey on his own creature
          to know what his intention is; God willeth good and would do it, but
          he cannot, because he has an unwilling man who will not have God's
          good thing carried into effect. What do ye, sirs, but drag the Eternal
          from his throne, and lift up into it that fallen creature, man: for
          man, according to that theory nods, and his nod is destiny. You must
          have a destiny somewhere; it must either be as God wills or as man
          wills . If it be as God wills , then Jehovah sits as sovereign upon
          his throne of glory, and all hosts obey him, and the world is safe; if
          not God, then you put man there, to say. "I will" or "I will not; if I
          will it I will enter heaven; if I will it I will despise the grace of
          God; if I will it I will conquer the Holy Sprit, for I am stronger
          than God, and stronger than omnipotence; if I will it I will make the
          blood of Christ of no effect, for I am mightier than that blood,
          mightier than the blood of the Son of God himself; though God make his
          purpose, yet will I laugh at his purpose; it shall be my purpose that
          shall make his purpose stand, or make it fall." Why, sirs, if this be
          not Atheism, it is idolatry; it is putting man where God should be,
          and I shrink with solemn awe and horror from that doctrine which makes
          the grandest of God's works -- the salvation man -- to be dependent
          upon the will of his creature whether it shall be accomplished or not.
          Glory I can and must in my text in its fullest sense. "It is not of
          him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
          mercy."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We think that the known condition of man is a very strong argument
          against the supposition that salvation depends upon his own will; and
          hence is a great confirmation of the truth that it depends upon the
          will of God; that it is God that chooses, and not man, -- God who
          takes the first step, and not the creature. Sirs, on the theory that
          man comes to Christ of his own will, what do you with texts of
          Scripture which say that he is dead? "And you hath he quickened who
          were dead in trespasses and sins;" you will say that is a figure. I
          grant it, but what is the meaning of it? You say the meaning is, he is
          spiritually dead. Well, then I ask you, how can he perform the
          spiritual act of willing that which is right? He is alive enough to
          will that which is evil, only evil and that continually, but he is not
          alive to will that which is spiritually good. Do you not know, to turn
          to another Scripture, that he cannot even discern that which is
          spiritual? for the natural man knoweth not the things which be of God,
          seeing they are spiritual and must be spiritually discerned. Why, he
          has not a "spirit" with which to discern them; he has only a soul and
          body, but the third principle, implanted in regeneration, which is
          called in the Word of God, "the spirit," he knows nothing of and he is
          therefore incapable, seeing he is dead and is without the vitalizing
          spirit, of doing what you say he does. Then again, what make you of
          the words of our Saviour where he said to those who had heard even
          him, "Ye will not come to me that ye might have life?" Where is
          free-will after such a text as that? When Christ affirms that they
          will not, who dare say they will? "Ah, but," you say, "they could if
          they would." Dear sir, I am not talking about that; I am talking about
          if they would, the question is "will they?" and we say "no," they
          never will by nature. Man is so depraved, so set on mischief, and the
          way of salvation is so obnoxious to his pride, so hateful to his
          lusts, that he cannot like it, and will not like it, unless he who
          ordained the plan shall change his nature, and subdue his will. Mark,
          this stubborn will of man is his sin; he is not to be excused for it;
          he is guilty because he will not come; he is condemned because he will
          not come; because he will not believe in Christ, therefore is
          condemnation resting upon him, but still the fact does not alter for
          all that, that he will not come by nature if left to himself. Well,
          then, if man will not, how shall he be saved unless God shall make him
          will? -- unless, in some mysterious way, he who made heart shall touch
          its mainspring so that it shall move in a direction opposite to that
          which it naturally follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But there is another argument which will come closer home to us. It
          is consistent with the universal experience of all God's people that
          salvation is of God's will. You will say, "I have not had a very long
          life, I have not, but I have had a very extensive acquaintance with
          all sections of the Christian Church, and I solemnly protest before
          you, that I have never yet met with a man professing to be a
          Christian, let alone his really being so, who ever said that his
          coming to God was the result of his unassisted nature. Universally, I
          believe, without exception, the people of God will say it was the Holy
          Spirit that made them what they are; that they should have refused to
          come as others do unless God's grace had sweetly influenced their
          wills. There are some hymns in Mr. Wesley's hymn-book which are
          stronger upon this point than I could ever venture to be, for he puts
          prayer into the lips of the sinner in which God is even asked to force
          him to be saved by grace. Of course I can take no objection to a term
          so strong, but it goes to prove this, that among all sections of
          Christians, whether Arminian or Calvinistic, whatever their doctrinal
          sentiments may be, their experimental sentiments are the same. I do
          not think they would any of them refuse to join in the verse --
        </p>
        <p>Oh! yes, I do love Jesus,</p>
        <p>Because he first loved me.</p>
        <p>Nor would they find fault with our own hymn,</p>
        <p>'Twas the same love that spread the feast,</p>
        <p>That sweetly forced us in;</p>
        <p>Else we had still refused to taste,</p>
        <p>And perished in our sin.</p>
        <p>
          We bring out the crown and say, "On whose head shall we put it? Who
          ruled at the turning-point? Who decided this case?" and the universal
          Church of God, throwing away their creeds, would say. "Crown him;
          crown him, put it on his head, for he is worthy; he has made us to
          differ; he has done it, and unto him be the praise for ever and ever."
          What staggers me is, that men can believe dogmas contrary to their own
          experience, -- that they can hug that to their hearts as precious to
          which their own inward convictions must give the lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But, lastly, in the way of argument. and to bring our great
          battering-ram at the last. It is not, after all, arguments from
          analogy, nor reasons from the difficulties of the opposite position,
          nor inferences from the know feebleness of human nature, nor even
          deductions from experience, that will settle this question once for
          all. To the law and to the testimony, if they speak not accord to this
          word, it is because there is no light in them. Do me the pleasure,
          then, to use your Bibles for a moment or two, and let us see what
          Scripture saith on this main point. First, with regard to the matter
          of God's preparation, and his plan with regard to salvation. We turn
          to the apostle's words in the epistle to the Ephesians, and we find in
          the first chapter and the third verse, "Blessed be the God and Father
          of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual
          blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us
          in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
          without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the
          adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good
          pleasure of his will" -- a double word you notice -- it is according
          to the will of his will. No expression could be stronger in the
          original to show the entire absoluteness of this thing as depending on
          the will God. It seems, then, that the choice of his people their
          adoption is according to his will. So far we are satisfied, indeed,
          with the testimony of the apostle. Then in the ninth verse, "Having
          made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good
          pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that in the dispensation
          of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in
          Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth; even in him."
          So, then, it seems that the grand result of the gathering together of
          all the saved in Christ, as well as the primitive purpose, is
          according to the counsel of his will. What stronger proof can there be
          that salvation depends upon the will of God? Moreover, it says in the
          eleventh verse -- "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
          predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
          after the counsel of his own will:" a stronger expression than "of his
          will" -- "of his own will," his free unbiased will, his will alone. As
          for redemption as well as for the eternal purpose -- redemption is
          according to the will of God. You remember that verse in Hebrews,
          tenth chapter, ninth verse: "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He
          taketh away the first, that he might establish the second. By the
          which will we are sanctified." So that the redemption offered up on
          Calvary, like the election made before the foundation of the world, is
          the result of the divine will. There will be little controversy here:
          the main point is about our new birth, and here we cannot allow of any
          diversity of opinion. Turn to the Gospel according to John, the first
          chapter and thirteenth verse. It is utterly impossible that human
          language could have put a stronger negative on the vainglorious claims
          of the human will than this passage does: "Born not of blood, nor of
          the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." A passage
          equally clear is to be found in the Epistle of James, at the first
          chapter, and the eighteenth verse: "Of his own will begat he us with
          the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his
          creatures." In these passages -- and they are not the only ones -- the
          new birth is peremptorily and in the strongest language put down as
          being the fruit and effect of the will and purpose of God. As to the
          sanctification which is the result and outgrowth of the new birth,
          that also is according to God's holy will. In the first of
          Thessalonians, fourteenth chapter, and third verse, we have, "This is
          the will of God, even your sanctification." One more passage I shall
          need you to refer to, the sixteenth chapter, and thirty-ninth verse.
          Here we find that the preservation, the perseverance, the
          resurrection, and the eternal glory of God's people, rests upon his
          will. "And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all
          which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up
          again at the last day; and this is the will of him that sent me that
          every one which seeth the Son and believeth on him, may have
          everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day." And indeed
          this is why the saints go to heaven at all, because in the seventeenth
          chapter of John, Christ is recorded as praying, "Father, I will that
          they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am." We close,
          then, by noticing that according to Scripture there is not a single
          blessing in the new covenant which is not conferred upon us according
          to the will of God, and that as the vessel hangs upon the nail, so
          every blessing, we receive hangs upon the absolute will and counsel of
          God, who gives these mercies even as he gives the gifts of the Spirit
          according as he wills. We shall now leave that point, and take the
          second great truth, and speak a little while upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. MAN'S WILL HAS ITS PROPER PLACE IN THE MATTER OF SALVATION.
          "Whosoever will let him come and take the water of life freely."
          According to this and many other texts the Scripture where man is
          addressed as a being having a will, it appears clear enough that men
          are not saved by compulsion. When a man receives the grace of Christ,
          he does not receive it against his will. No man shall be pardoned
          while he abhors the though forgiveness. No man shall have joy in the
          Lord if he says, "I do not wish to rejoice in the Lord." Do not think
          that anybody shall have the angels pushing them behind into the gates
          of heaven. They must go there freely or else they will never go there
          at all. We are not saved against our will; nor again, mark you, is the
          will taken away; for God does not come and convert the intelligent
          free-agent into a machine. When he turns the slave into a child, it is
          not by plucking out of him the will which he possesses. We are as free
          under grace as ever we were under sin; nay, we were slaves when we
          were under sin, and when the Son makes us free we are free indeed, and
          we are never free before. Erskine, in speaking of his own conversion,
          says he ran to Christ "with full consent against his will," by which
          he meant it was against his old will; against his will as it was till
          Christ came, but when Christ came, then he came to Christ with full
          consent, and was as willing to be saved -- no, that is a cold word --
          as delighted, as pleased, as transported to receive Christ as if grace
          had not constrained him. But we do hold and teach that though the will
          of man is not ignored, and men are not saved against their wills, that
          the work of the Spirit, which is the effect of the will of God, is to
          change the human will, and so make men willing in the day of God's
          power, working in them to will to do of his own good pleasure. The
          work of the Spirit is consistent with the original laws and
          constitution of human nature. Ignorant men talk grossly and carnally
          about the work of the Spirit in the heart as if the heart were a lump
          of flesh, and the Holy Spirit turned it round mechanically. Now,
          brethren, how is your heart and my heart changed in any matter? Why,
          the instrument generally is persuasion. A friend sets before us a
          truth we did not know before; pleads with us; puts it in a new light,
          and then we say, "Now I see that," and then our hearts are changed
          towards the thing. Now, although no man's heart is changed by moral
          suasion in itself, yet the way in which the Spirit works in his heart,
          as far as we can detect it, is instrumentally by a blessed persuasion
          of the mind. I say not that men are saved by moral suasion, or that
          this is the first cause, but I think it is frequently the visible
          means. As to the secret work, who knows how the Spirit works? "The
          wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but
          thou canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth: so is every
          one that is born of the Spirit;" but yet, as far as we can see, the
          Spirit makes a revelation of truth to the soul, whereby it seeth
          things in a different light from what it ever did before, and then the
          will cheerfully bows that neck which once was stiff as iron, and wears
          the yoke which once it despised, and wears it gladly, cheerfully, and
          joyfully. Yet, mark, the will is not gone; the will is treated as it
          should be treated; man is not acted upon as a machine, he is not
          polished like a piece of marble; he is not planed and smoothed like a
          plank of deal; but his mind is acted upon by the Spirit of God, in a
          manner quite consistent with mental laws. Man is thus made a new
          creature in Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and his own will is
          blessedly and sweetly made to yield.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, mark you, -- and this is a point which I want to put into the
          thoughts of any who are troubled about these things, -- this gives the
          renewed soul a most blessed sign of grace, insomuch that if any man
          wills to be saved by Christ, if he wills to have sin forgiven through
          the precious blood, if he wills to live by a holy life resting upon
          the atonement of Christ, and in the power of the Spirit, that will is
          one of the most blessed signs of the mysterious working of the Spirit
          of God in his heart; such a sign is it that if it be real willingness,
          I will venture to assert that that man is not far from the kingdom. I
          say not that he is so saved that he himself may conclude he is, but
          there is a work begun, which has the germ of salvation in it. If thou
          art willing, depend upon it that God is willing. Soul, if thou art
          anxious after Christ, he is more anxious after thee. If thou hast only
          one spark of true desire after him, that spark is a spark from the
          fire of his love to thee. He has drawn thee, or else thou wouldest
          never run after him. If you are saying, "Come to me, Jesus," it is
          because he has come to you, though you do not know it. He has sought
          you as a lost sheep, and therefore you have sought him like a
          returning prodigal. He has swept the house to find you, as the woman
          swept for the lost piece of money, and now you seek him as a lost
          child would seek a father's face. Let your willingness to come to
          Christ be a hopeful sign and symptom.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once more, and let me have the ear of the anxious yet again. It
          appears that when you have a willingness to come to Christ, there is a
          special promise for you. You know, my dear hearers, that we are not
          accustomed in this house of prayer to preach one side of truth, but we
          try if we can to preach it all. There are some brethren with small
          heads, who, when they have heard a strong doctrinal sermon, grow into
          hyper-Calvinists, and then when we preach an inviting sermon to poor
          sinners, they cannot understand it, and say it is a yea and nay
          gospel. Believe me, it is not yea and nay, but yea and yea. We give
          your yea to all truth, and our nay we give to no doctrine of God. Can
          a sinner be saved when he wills to come to Christ? Yea. And if he does
          come, does he come because God brings him? Yea. We have no nays in our
          theology for any revealed truth. We do not shut the door on one word
          and open it to another. Those are the yea and nay people who have a
          nay for the poor sinner, when they profess to preach the gospel. As
          soon as a man has any willingness given to him, he has a special
          promise. Before he had the willingness he had an invitation. Before he
          had any willingness, it was his duty to believe in Christ, for it is
          not man's condition that gives him a right to believe. Men are to
          believe in obedience to God's command. God commandeth all men
          everywhere to repent, and this is his great command, "Believe in the
          Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." "This is the commandment,
          that ye believe in Jesus Christ whom he has sent." Hense your right
          and your duty to believe; but once you have got the willingness, then
          you have a special promise -- "Whosoever will let him come." That is a
          sort of extraordinary invitation. Methinks this is the utterance of
          the special call. You know how John Bunyan describes the special call
          in words to this effect. "The hen goes clucking about the farm-yard
          all day long; that is the general call of the gospel; but she sees a
          hawk up in the sky, and she gives a sharp cry for her little ones to
          come and hide under her wings; that is the special call; they come and
          are safe." My text is a special call to some of you. Poor soul! are
          you willing to be saved? "O, sir, willing, willing indeed; I cannot
          use that word; I would give all I have if I might but be saved." Do
          you mean you would give it all in order to purchase it? "Oh no, sir, I
          do not mean that; I know I cannot purchase it; I know it is God's
          gift, but still, if I could be but saved, I would ask nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>Lord, deny me what thou wilt,</p>
        <p>Only ease me of my guilt;</p>
        <p>Suppliant at thy feet I lie,</p>
        <p>Give me Christ, or else I die.</p>
        <p>
          Why, then the Lord speaks to you this morning, to you if not to any
          other man in the chapel, he speaks to you and says -- "Whosoever will
          let him come." You cannot say this does not mean you. When we give the
          general invitation, you may exempt yourself perhaps in some way or
          other, but you cannot now. You are willing, then come and take the
          water of life freely. "Had not I better pray?" It does not say so; it
          says, take the water of life. "But had not I better go home and get
          better?" No, take the water of life, and take the water of life now.
          You are standing by the fountain outside there, and the water is
          flowing and you are willing to drink; you are picked out of a crowd
          who are standing round about, and you are specially invited by the
          person who built the fountain. He says, "Here is a special invitation
          for you; you are willing; come and drink." "Sir," you say, "I must go
          home and wash my pitcher." "No," says he, "come and drink." "But, sir,
          I want to go home and write a petition to you." "I do not want it," he
          says, "drink now, drink now." What would you do? If you were dying of
          thirst, you would just put your lips down and drink. Soul, do that
          now. Believe that Jesus Christ is able to save thee now. Trust thy
          soul in his hands now. No preparation is wanted. Whosoever will let
          him come; let him come at once and take the water of life freely. To
          take that water is simply to trust Christ; to repose on him; to take
          him to be your all in all. Oh that thou wouldest do it now! Thou are
          willing; God has made thee willing. When the crusaders heard the voice
          of Peter the hermit, as he bade them go to Jerusalem to take it from
          the hands of the invaders, they cried out at once, "Deus vult; God
          wills it; God wills it;" and every man plucked his sword from its
          scabbard, and set out to reach the holy sepulchre, for God willed it.
          So come and drink, sinner; God wills it. Trust Jesus; God wills it. If
          you will it, that is the sign that God wills it. "Father, thy will be
          done on earth even as it is in heaven." As sinners, humbly stoop to
          drink from the flowing crystal which streams from the sacred fountain
          which Jesus opened for his people; let it be said in heaven, "God's
          will is done; hallelujah, hallelujah!" "It is not of him that willeth,
          nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy;" yet
          "Whosoever will let him come and take the water of life freely."<br />
