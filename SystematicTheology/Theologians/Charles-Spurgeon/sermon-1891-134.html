          1. This expression [of our Lord], "How often would I have gathered thy
          children together, and thou wouldest not," set forth the ancient law
          of human liberty, because God made man a free [agent] from the
          beginning, possessing his own power, even as he does his own soul, to
          obey the behests (ad utendum sententia) of God voluntarily, and not by
          compulsion of God. For there is no coercion with God, but a good will
          [towards us] is present with Him continually. And therefore does He
          give good counsel to all. And in man, as well as in angels, He has
          placed the power of choice (for angels are rational beings), so that
          those who had yielded obedience might justly possess what is good,
          given indeed by God, but preserved by themselves. On the other hand,
          they who have not obeyed shall, with justice, be not found in
          possession of the good, and shall receive condign punishment: for God
          did kindly bestow on them what was good; but they themselves did not
          diligently keep it, nor deem it something precious, but poured
          contempt upon His super-eminent goodness. Rejecting therefore the
          good, and as it were spuing it out, they shall all deservedly incur
          the just judgment of God, which also the Apostle Paul testifies in his
          Epistle to the Romans, where he says, "But dost thou despise the
          riches of His goodness, and patience, and long-suffering, being
          ignorant that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But
          according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest to
          thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the
          righteous judgment of God." "But glory and honour," he says, "to every
          one that doeth good." God therefore has given that which is good, as
          the apostle tells us in this Epistle, and they who work it shall
          receive glory and honour, because they have done that which is good
          when they had it in their power not to do it; but those who do it not
          shall receive the just judgment of God, because they did not work good
          when they had it in their power so to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But if some had been made by nature bad, and others good, these
          latter would not be deserving of praise for being good, for such were
          they created; nor would the former be reprehensible, for thus they
          were made [originally]. But since all men are of the same nature, able
          both to hold fast and to do what is good; and, on the other hand,
          having also the power to cast it from them and not to do it, -- some
          do justly receive praise even among men who are under the control of
          good laws (and much more from God), and obtain deserved testimony of
          their choice of good in general, and of persevering therein; but the
          others are blamed, and receive a just condemnation, because of their
          rejection of what is fair and good. And therefore the prophets used to
          exhort men to what was good, to act justly and to work righteousness,
          as I have so largely demonstrated, because it is in our power so to
          do, and because by excessive negligence we might become forgetful, and
          thus stand in need of that good counsel which the good God has given
          us to know by means of the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For this reason the Lord also said, "Let your light so shine before
          men, that they may see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is
          in heaven." And, "Take heed to yourselves, lest perchance your hearts
          be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and worldly cares."
          And, "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning, and ye
          like unto men that wait for their Lord, when He returns from the
          wedding, that when He cometh and knocketh, they may open to Him.
          Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so
          doing." And again, "The servant who knows his Lord's will, and does it
          not, shall be beaten with many stripes." And, "Why call ye me, Lord,
          Lord, and do not the things which I say?" And again, "But if the
          servant say in his heart, The Lord delayeth, and begin to beat his
          fellow-servants, and to eat, and drink, and to be drunken, his Lord
          will come in a day on which he does not expect Him, and shall cut him
          in sunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites." All such
          passages demonstrate the independent will of man, and at the same time
          the counsel which God conveys to him, by which He exhorts us to submit
          ourselves to Him, and seeks to turn us away from [the sin of] unbelief
          against Him, without, however, in any way coercing us.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. No doubt, if any one is unwilling to follow the Gospel itself, it
          is in his power [to reject it], but it is not expedient. For it is in
          man's power to disobey God, and to forfeit what is good; but [such
          conduct] brings no small amount of injury and mischief. And on this
          account Paul says, "All things are lawful to me, but all things are
          not expedient;" referring both to the liberty of man, in which respect
          "all things are lawful," God exercising no compulsion in regard to
          him; and [by the expression] "not expedient" pointing out that we
          "should not use our liberty as a cloak of maliciousness," for this is
          not expedient. And again he says, "Speak ye every man truth with his
          neighbour." And, "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your
          mouth, neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor scurrility, which
          are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks." And, "For ye were
          sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord; walk honestly as
          children of the light, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in
          chambering and wantonness, not in anger and jealousy. And such were
          some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified in
          the name of our Lord." If then it were not in our power to do or not
          to do these things, what reason had the apostle, and much more the
          Lord Himself, to give us counsel to do some things, and to abstain
          from others? But because man is possessed of free will from the
          beginning, and God is possessed of free will, in whose likeness man
          was created, advice is always given to him to keep fast the good,
          which thing is done by means of obedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And not merely in works, but also in faith, has God preserved the
          will of man free and under his own control, saying, "According to thy
          faith be it unto thee;" thus showing that there is a faith specially
          belonging to man, since he has an opinion specially his own. And
          again, "All things are possible to him that believeth;" and, "Go thy
          way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee." Now all such
          expressions demonstrate that man is in his own power with respect to
          faith. And for this reason, "he that believeth in Him has eternal life
          while he who believeth not the Son hath not eternal life, but the
          wrath of God shall remain upon him." In the same manner therefore the
          Lord, both showing His own goodness, and indicating that man is in his
          own free will and his own power, said to Jerusalem, "How often have I
          wished to gather thy children together, as a hen [gathereth] her
          chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Wherefore your house shall
          be left unto you desolate."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Those, again, who maintain the opposite to these [conclusions], do
          themselves present the Lord as destitute of power, as if, forsooth, He
          were unable to accomplish what He willed; or, on the other hand, as
          being ignorant that they were by nature "material," as these men
          express it, and such as cannot receive His immortality. "But He should
          not," say they, "have created angels of such a nature that they were
          capable of transgression, nor men who immediately proved ungrateful
          towards Him; for they were made rational beings, endowed with the
          power of examining and judging, and were not [formed] as things
          irrational or of a [merely] animal nature, which can do nothing of
          their own will, but are drawn by necessity and compulsion to what is
          good, in which things there is one mind and one usage, working
          mechanically in one groove (inflexibiles et sine judicio), who are
          incapable of being anything else except just what they had been
          created." But upon this supposition, neither would what is good be
          grateful to them, nor communion with God be precious, nor would the
          good be very much to be sought after, which would present itself
          without their own proper endeavour, care, or study, but would be
          implanted of its own accord and without their concern. Thus it would
          come to pass, that their being good would be of no consequence,
          because they were so by nature rather than by will, and are possessors
          of good spontaneously, not by choice; and for this reason they would
          not understand this fact, that good is a comely thing, nor would they
          take pleasure in it. For how can those who are ignorant of good enjoy
          it? Or what credit is it to those who have not aimed at it? And what
          crown is it to those who have not followed in pursuit of it, like
          those victorious in the contest?
        </p>
        <p>
          7. On this account, too, did the Lord assert that the kingdom of
          heaven was the portion of "the violent;" and He says, "The violent
          take it by force;" that is, those who by strength and earnest striving
          are on the watch to snatch it away on the moment. On this account also
          Paul the Apostle says to the Corinthians, "Know ye not, that they who
          run in a racecourse, do all indeed run, but one receiveth the prize?
          So run, that ye may obtain. Every one also who engages in the contest
          is temperate in all things: now these men [do it] that they may obtain
          a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. But I so run, not as
          uncertainty; I fight, not as one beating the air; but I make my body
          livid, and bring it into subjection, lest by any means, when preaching
          to others, I may myself be rendered a castaway." This able wrestler,
          therefore, exhorts us to the struggle for immortality, that we may be
          crowned, and may deem the crown precious, namely, that which is
          acquired by our struggle, but which does not encircle us of its own
          accord (sed non ultro coalitam). And the harder we strive, so much is
          it the more valuable; while so much the more valuable it is, so much
          the more should we esteem it. And indeed those things are not esteemed
          so highly which come spontaneously, as those which are reached by much
          anxious care. Since, then, this power has been conferred upon us, both
          the Lord has taught and the apostle has enjoined us the more to love
          God, that we may reach this [prize] for ourselves by striving after
          it. For otherwise, no doubt, this our good would be [virtually]
          irrational, because not the result of trial. Moreover, the faculty of
          seeing would not appear to be so desirable, unless we had known what a
          loss it were to be devoid of sight; and health, too, is rendered all
          the more estimable by an acquaintance with disease; light, also, by
          contrasting it with darkness; and life with death. Just in the same
          way is the heavenly kingdom honourable to those who have known the
          earthly one. But in proportion as it is more honourable, so much the
          more do we prize it; and if we have prized it more, we shall be the
          more glorious in the presence of God. The Lord has therefore endured
          all these things on our behalf, in order that we, having been
          instructed by means of them all, may be in all respects circumspect
          for the time to come, and that, having been rationally taught to love
          God, we may continue in His perfect love: for God has displayed
          long-suffering in the case of man's apostasy; while man has been
          instructed by means of it, as also the prophet says, "Thine own
          apostasy shall heal thee;" God thus determining all things beforehand
          for the bringing of man to perfection, for his edification, and for
          the revelation of His dispensations, that goodness may both be made
          apparent, and righteousness perfected, and that the Church may be
          fashioned after the image of His Son, and that man may finally be
          brought to maturity at some future time, becoming ripe through such
          privileges to see and comprehend God. <br />
