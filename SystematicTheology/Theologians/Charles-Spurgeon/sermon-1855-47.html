        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.50)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 18, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into
          all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall
          hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come." --
          John 16:13.

          THIS GENERATION hath gradually, and almost imperceptibly, become to a
          great extent a godless generation. One of the diseases of the present
          generation of mankind, is their secret but deep-seated godlessness, by
          which they have so far departed from the knowledge of God. Science has
          discovered to us second causes; and hence, many have too much
          forgotten the first Great Cause, the Author of all: they have been
          able so far to pry into secrets, that the great axiom of the existence
          of a God, has been too much neglected. Even among professing
          Christians, while there is a great amount of religion, there is too
          little godliness: there is much external formalism, but too little
          inward acknowledgment of God, too little living on God, living with
          God, and relying upon God. Hence arises the sad fact that when you
          enter many of our places of worship you will certainly hear the name
          of God mentioned; but except in the benediction, you would scarcely
          know there was a Trinity. In many places dedicated to Jehovah the name
          of Jesus is too often kept in the background; the Holy Spirit is
          almost entirely neglected; and very little is said concerning his
          sacred influence. Even religious men have become to a large degree
          godless in this age. We sadly require more preaching regarding God;
          more preaching of those things which look not so much at the creature
          to be saved, as at God the Great One to be extolled. My firm
          conviction is, that in proportion as we have more regard for the
          sacred godhead, the wondrous Trinity in Unity, shall we see a greater
          display of God's power, and a more glorious manifestation of his might
          in our churches. May God send us a Christ-exalting, Spirit-loving
          ministry -- men who shall proclaim God the Holy Ghost in all his
          offices and shall extol God the Saviour as the author and finisher of
          our faith, not neglecting that Great God, the Father of his people,
          who, before all worlds, elected us in Christ his Son, justified us
          through his righteousness, and will inevitably preserve us and gather
          us together in one, in the consummation of all things at the last
          great day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text has regard to God the Holy Spirit; of Him we shall speak and
          Him only, if His sweet influence shall rest upon us.

          The disciples had been instructed by Christ concerning certain
          elementary doctrines but Jesus did not teach his disciples more than
          what we should call the A B C of religion. He gives his reasons for
          this in the 12th verse: "I have yet many things to say unto you, but
          you cannot bear them now." His disciples were not possessors of the
          Spirit. They had the Spirit so far as the work of conversion was
          concerned, but not as to the matters of bright illumination, profound
          instruction, prophecy, and inspiration. He says, "I am now about to
          depart, and when I go from you I will send the Comforter unto you. Ye
          cannot bear these things now howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth is
          come, he will guide you into all truth." The same promise that he made
          to his apostles, stands good to all his children; and in reviewing it,
          we shall take it as our portion and heritage, and shall not consider
          ourselves intruders upon the manor of the apostles, or upon their
          exclusive rights and prerogatives; for we conceive that Jesus says
          even to us, "When he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you
          into all truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dwelling exclusively upon our text, we have five things. First of all,
          here is an attainment mentioned -- a knowledge of all truth; secondly,
          here is a difficulty suggested -- which is, that we need guidance into
          all truth; thirdly, here is a person provided -- "when he, the Spirit
          shall come, he shall guide you into all truth; "fourthly, here is a
          manner hinted at -- "he shall guide you into all truth;" fifthly here
          is a sign given as to the working of the Spirit -- we may know whether
          he works, by his "guiding us into all truth," -- into all of one
          thing; not truths, but truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Here is AN ATTAINMENT MENTIONED, which is a knowledge of all truth.
          We know that some conceive doctrinal knowledge to be of very little
          importance, and of no practical use. We do not think so. We believe
          the science of Christ crucified and a judgment of the teachings of
          Scripture to be exceedingly valuable; we think it is right, that the
          Christian ministry should not only be arousing but instructing; not
          merely awakening, but enlightening: that it should appeal not only to
          the passions but to the understanding. We are far from thinking
          doctrinal knowledge to be of secondary importance; we believe it to be
          one of the first things in the Christian life, to know the truth, and
          then to practice it. We scarcely need this morning tell you how
          desirable it is for us to be well taught in things of the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, nature itself, (when it has been sanctified by grace,)
          gives us a strong desire to know all truth. The natural man separateth
          himself and intermeddleth with all knowledge. God has put an instinct
          in him by which he is rendered unsatisfied if he cannot probe mystery
          to its bottom; he can never be content until he can unriddle secrets.
          What we call curiosity is something given us of God impelling us to
          search into the knowledge of natural things; that curiosity,
          sanctified by the Spirit, is also brought to bear in matters of
          heavenly science and celestial wisdom. "Bless the Lord," said David,
          "O my soul, and all that is within me bless his holy name!" If there
          is a curiosity within us, it ought to be employed and developed in a
          search after truth. "All that is within me," sanctified by the Spirit
          should he developed, And, verily, the Christian man feels an intense
          longing to bury his ignorance and receive wisdom. If he, when in his
          natural estate panted for terrestrial knowledge, how much more ardent
          is the wish to unravel, if possible, the sacred mysteries of God's
          Word! A true Christian is always intently reading and searching the
          Scripture that he may be able to certify himself as to its main and
          cardinal truths. I do not think much of that man who does not wish to
          understand doctrines; I cannot conceive him to be in a right position
          when he thinks it is no matter whether he believes a lie or truth,
          whether he is heretic or orthodox, whether he received the Word of God
          as it is written, or as it is diluted and misconstrued by man. God's
          Word will ever be to a Christian a source of great anxiety; a sacred
          instinct within will lead him to pry into it; he will seek to
          understand it. Oh! there are some who forget this, men who purposely
          abstain from mentioning what are called high doctrines, because they
          think if they should mention high doctrines they would be dangerous;
          so they keep them back. Foolish men! they do not know anything of
          human nature; for if they did understand a grain's worth of humanity,
          they would know that the hiding of these things impels men to search
          them out. From the fact that they do not mention them, they drive men
          to places where these and these only, are preached. They say, "If I
          preach election, and predestination and these dark things, people will
          all go straight away, and become Antinomians." I am not so sure if
          they were to be called Antinomians it would hurt them much; but hear
          me, oh, ye ministers that conceal these truths, that is the way to
          make them Antinomians, by silencing these doctrines. Curiosity is
          strong; if you tell them they must not pluck the truth, they will be
          sure to do it; but if you give it to them as you find it in God's
          Word, they will not seek to "wrest" it. Enlightened men will have the
          truth, and if they see election in Scripture they will say, "it is
          there, and I will find it out. If I cannot get it in one place, I will
          get it in another." The true Christian has an inward longing and
          anxiety after it; he is hungry and thirsty after the word of
          righteousness, and he must and will feed on this bread of heaven, or
          at all hazards he will leave the husks which unsound divines would
          offer him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only is this attainment to be desired because nature teaches us
          so, but a knowledge of all truth is very essential for our comfort. I
          do believe that many persons have been distressed half their lives
          from the fact that they had not clear views of truth. Many poor souls,
          for instance, under conviction, abide three or four times as long in
          sorrow of mind as they would require to do if they had some one to
          instruct them in the great matter of justification. So there are
          believers who are often troubling themselves about falling away; but
          if they knew in their soul the great consolation that we are kept by
          the grace of God through faith unto salvation, they would be no more
          troubled about it. So have I found some distressed about the
          unpardonable sin; but if God instructs us in that doctrine, and shows
          us that no conscience that is really awakened ever can commit that
          sin, but that when it is committed God gives us up to a scared
          conscience, so that we never fear or tremble afterwards, all that
          distress would be alleviated. Depend on this, the more you know of
          God's truth -- all things else being equal -- the more comfortable you
          will be as a Christian. Nothing can give a greater light on your path
          than a clear understanding of divine things. It is a mingle-mangled
          gospel too commonly preached, which causes the downcast faces of
          Christians. Give me the congregation whose faces are bright with joy,
          let their eyes glisten at the sound of the gospel, then will I believe
          that it is God's own words they are receiving. Instead thereof you
          will often see melancholy congregations whose visages are not much
          different from the bitter countenance of poor creatures swallowing
          medicine, because the word spoken terrifies them by its legality,
          instead of comforting them by its grace. We love a cheerful gospel,
          and we think "all the truth" will tend to comfort the Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Comfort again?" says another, "always comfort." Ah, but there is
          another reason why we prize truth, because we believe that a true
          knowledge of all the truth will keep us very much out of danger. No
          doctrine is so calculated to preserve a man from sin as the doctrine
          of the grace of God. Those who have called it a licentious doctrine
          did not know anything at all about it. Poor ignorant things, they
          little knew that their own vile stuff was the most licentious doctrine
          under heaven. If they knew the grace of God in truth, they would soon
          see that there was no preservative from lying like a knowledge that we
          are elect of God from the foundation of the world. There is nothing
          like a belief in my eternal perseverance, and the immutability of my
          Father's affection, which can keep me near to him from a motive of
          simple gratitude. Nothing makes a man so virtuous as belief of truth.
          A lying doctrine will soon beget a lying practice. A man cannot have
          an erroneous belief without by-and-bye having an erroneous life. I
          believe the one thing naturally begets the other. Keep near God's
          truth; keep near his word; keep the head right, and especially keep
          your heart right with regard to truth, and your feet will not go far
          astray.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I hold also that this attainment to the knowledge of all truth
          is very desirable for the usefulness which it will give us in the
          world at large. We should not be selfish: we should always consider
          whether a thing will be beneficial to others. A knowledge of all truth
          will make us very serviceable in this world. We shall be skillful
          physicians who know how to take the poor distressed soul aside, to put
          the finger on his eye, and take the scale off for him, that heaven's
          light may comfort him. There will be no character, however perplexing
          may be its peculiar phase, but we shall be able to speak to it and
          comfort it. He who holds the truth, is usually the most useful man. As
          a good Presbyterian brother said to me the other day: "I know God has
          blessed you exceedingly in gathering in souls, but it is an
          extraordinary fact that nearly all the men I know -- with scarcely an
          exception -- who have been made useful in gathering in souls, have
          held the great doctrines of the grace of God." Almost every man whom
          God has blessed to the building up of the church in prosperity, and
          around whom the people have rallied, has been a man who has held
          firmly free grace from first to last, through the finished salvation
          of Christ. Do not you think you need have errors in your doctrine to
          make you useful. We have some who preach Calvinism all the first part
          of the sermon, and finish up with Arminianism, because they think that
          will make them useful. Useful nonsense! -- That is all it is. A man if
          he cannot be useful with the truth, cannot be useful with an error.
          There is enough in the pure doctrine of God, without introducing
          heresies to preach to sinners. As far as I know, I never felt hampered
          or cramped in addressing the ungodly in my life. I can speak with as
          much fervency, and yet not in the same style as those who hold the
          contrary views of God's truth. Those who hold God's word, never need
          add something untrue in speaking to men. The sturdy truth of God
          touches every chord in every man's heart. If we can, by God's grace,
          put our hand inside man's heart, we want nothing but that whole truth
          to move him thoroughly, and to stir him up. There is nothing like the
          real truth and the whole truth, to make a man useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, again, here is a DIFFICULTY SUGGESTED, and that is -- that we
          require a guide to conduct us into all truth. The difficulty is that
          truth is not so easy to discover. There is no man born in this world
          by nature who has the truth in his heart. There is no creature that
          ever was fashioned, since the fall, who has a knowledge of truth
          innate and natural. It has been disputed by many philosophers whether
          there are such things as innate ideas at all; but is of no use
          disputing as to whether there are any innate ideas of truth. There are
          none such. There are ideas of everything that is wrong and evil; but
          in us -- that is our flesh -- there dwelleth no good thing, we are
          born in sin, and shapened in iniquity; in sin did our mother conceive
          us. There is nothing in us good, and no tendency to righteousness.
          Then since we are not born with the truth, we have the task of
          searching for it. If we are to be blest by being eminently useful as
          Christian men, we must be well instructed in matters of revelation;
          but here is the difficulty -- that we cannot follow without a guide
          the winding paths of truth. Why this?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because of the very great intricacy of truth itself. Truth
          itself is no easy thing to discover. Those who fancy they know
          everything and constantly dogmatise with the spirit of "We are the
          men, and wisdom will die with us," of course see no difficulties
          whatever in the system they hold; but I believe, the most earnest
          student of Scripture will find things in the Bible which puzzle him;
          however earnestly he reads it, he will see some mysteries too deep for
          him to understand. He will cry out "Truth! I cannot find thee; I know
          not where thou art, thou art beyond me; I cannot fully view thee."
          Truth is a path so narrow that two can scarce walk together in it; we
          usually tread the narrow way in single file, two men can seldom walk
          arm in arm in the truth. We believe the same truth in the main but we
          cannot walk together in the path, it is too narrow. The way of truth
          is very difficult. If you step an inch aside on the right you are in a
          dangerous error, and if you swerve a little to the left you are
          equally in the mire. On the one hand there is a huge precipice, and on
          the other a deep morass; and unless you keep to the true line, to the
          breadth of a hair, you will go astray. Truth is a narrow path indeed.
          It is a path the eagle's eye hath not seen, and a depth the diver hath
          not visited. It is like the veins of metal in a mine, it is often of
          excessive thinness, and moreover it runneth not in one continued
          layer. Lose it once, and you may dig for miles and not discover it
          again; the eye must watch perpetually the direction of the lode.
          Grains of truth are like the grains of gold in the rivers of Australia
          -- they must be shaken by the hand of patience, and washed in the
          stream of honesty, or the fine gold will be mingled with sand. Truth
          is often mingled with error, and it is hard to distinguish it; but we
          bless God it is said, "When the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide
          you into all truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why we need a guide is, the invidiousness of error. It
          busily steals upon us, and, if I may so describe our position, we are
          often like we were on Thursday night in that tremendous fog. Most of
          us were feeling for ourselves, and wondering where on earth we were.
          We could scarcely see an inch before us. We came to a place where
          there were three turnings. We thought we knew the old spot. There was
          the lamp-post, and now we must take a sharp turn to the left; but not
          so. We ought to have gone a little to the right. We have been so often
          to the same place, that we think we know every flag-stone -- and
          there's our friend's shop over the way. It is dark, but we think we
          must be quite right, and all the while we are quite wrong, and find
          ourselves half-a-mile out of the way. So -- it is with matters of
          truth. We think, surely this is the right path; and the voice of the
          evil one whispers, "that is the way, walk ye in it." You do so, and
          you find to your great dismay, that instead of the path of truth, you
          have been walking in the paths of unrighteousness and erroneous
          doctrines. The way of life is a labyrinth; the grassiest paths and the
          most bewitching, are the farthest away from right; the most enticing,
          are those which are garnished with wrested truths I believe there is
          not a counterfeit coin in the world so much like a genuine one, as
          some errors are like the truth. One is base metal, the other is true
          gold; still in externals they differ very little.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also need a guide, because we are so prone to go astray. Why, if
          the path of heaven were as straight as Bunyan pictures it, with no
          turning to the right hand or left -- and no doubt it is, -- we are so
          prone to go astray, that we should go to the right hand to the
          Mountains of Destruction, or to the left in the dark Wood of
          Desolation. David says, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep." That
          means very often: for if a sheep is put into a field twenty times, if
          it does not get out twenty-one times, it will be because it cannot;
          because the place is hurdled up, and it cannot find a hole in the
          hedge. If grace did not guide a man, he would go astray, though there
          were hand-posts all the way to heaven. Let it be written, "Miklat,
          Miklat, the way to refuge," he would turn aside, and the avenger of
          blood would overtake him, if some guide did not, like the angels in
          Sodom, put his hand on his shoulders, and cry, "Escape, escape, for
          thy life! look not behind thee; stay not in all the plain." These,
          then, are the reasons why we need a guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, here is A PERSON PROVIDED. This is none other
          than God, and this God is none other than a person. This person is
          "he, the Spirit," the "Spirit of truth;" not an influence or an
          emanation, but actually a person. "when the Spirit of truth is come,
          he shall guide you into all truth." Now, we wish you to look at this
          guide to consider how adapted he is to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, he is infallible; he knows everything and cannot
          lead us astray. If I pin my sleeve to another man's coat, he may lead
          me part of the way rightly, but by-and-bye he will go wrong himself,
          and I shall be led astray with him; but if I give myself to the Holy
          Ghost and ask his guidance, there is no fear of my wandering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we rejoice in this Spirit because he is ever-present. We fall
          into a difficulty sometimes; we say, "Oh, if I could take this to my
          minister, he would explain it; but I live so far off, and am not able
          to see him." That perplexes us, and we turn the text round and round
          and cannot make anything out of it. We look at the commentators. We
          take down pious Thomas Scott, and, as usual he says nothing about it
          if it be a dark passage. Then we go to holy Matthew Henry, and if it
          is an easy Scripture, he is sure to explain it; but if it is a text
          hard to be understood, it is likely enough, of course, left in his own
          gloom; and even Dr. Gill himself, the most consistent of commentators,
          when he comes to a hard passage, manifestly avoids it in some degree.
          But when we have no commentator or minister, we have still the Holy
          Spirit; and let me tell you a little secret: whenever you cannot
          understand a text, open your Bible, bend your knee, and pray over that
          text; and if it does not split into atoms and open itself, try again.
          If prayer does not explain it, it is one of the things God did not
          intend you to know, and you may be content to be ignorant of it.
          Prayer is the key that openeth the cabinets of mystery. Prayer and
          faith are sacred picklocks that can open secrets, and obtain great
          treasures. There is no college for holy education like that of the
          blessed Spirit, for he is an ever-present tutor, to whom we have only
          to bend the knee, and he is at our side, the great expositor of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one thing about the suitability of this guide which is
          remarkable. I do not know whether it has struck you -- the Holy Spirit
          can "guide us into a truth." Now, man can guide us to a truth, but it
          is only the Holy Spirit who can "guide us into a truth." "When he, the
          Spirit of truth, shall come, he shall guide you into" -- mark that
          word -- "all truth." Now, for instance, it is a long while before you
          can lead some people to election; but when you have made them see its
          correctness, you have not led them "into" it. You may show them that
          it is plainly stated in Scripture, but they will turn away and hate
          it. You take them to another great truth, but they have been brought
          up in a different fashion, and though they cannot answer your
          arguments, they say, "The man is right, perhaps," and they whisper --
          but so low that conscience itself cannot hear -- "but it is so
          contrary to my prejudices, that I cannot receive it." After you have
          led them to the truth, and they see it is true, how hard it is to lead
          them into it! There are many of my hearers who are brought to the
          truth of their depravity, but they are not brought into it, and made
          to feel it. Some of you are brought to know the truth that God keeps
          us from day to day; but you rarely get into it, so as to live in
          continual dependence upon God the Holy Ghost, and draw fresh supplies
          from him. The thing is -- to get inside it. A Christian should do with
          truth as a snail does with his shell -- live inside it, as well as
          carry it on his back, and bear it perpetually about with him. The Holy
          Ghost, it is said, shall lead us into all truth. You may be brought to
          a chamber where there is an abundance of gold and silver, but you will
          be no richer unless you effect an entrance. It is the Spirit's work to
          unbar the two leaved gates, and bring us into a truth, so that we may
          get inside it, and, as dear old Rowland Hill said, "Not only hold the
          truth, but have the truth hold us."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Fourthly, here is; METHOD SUGGESTED: "He shall guide you into all
          truth." Now I must have an illustration. I must compare truth to some
          cave or grotto that you have heard of, with wondrous stalactites
          hanging from the roof, and others starting from the floor; a cavern,
          glittering with spar and abounding in marvels. Before entering the
          cavern you inquire for a guide, who comes with his lighted flambeau.
          He conducts you down to a considerable depth, and you find yourself in
          the midst of the cave. He leads you through different chambers. Here
          he points to a little stream rushing from amid the rocks, and
          indicates its rise and progress; there he points to some peculiar rock
          and tells you its name; then takes you into a large natural hall,
          tells you how many persons once feasted in it; and so on. Truth is a
          grand series of caverns, it is our glory to have so great and wise a
          conductor. Imagine that we are coming to the darkness of it. He is a
          light shining in the midst of us to guide us; and by the light he
          shows us wondrous things. In three ways the Holy Ghost teaches us: by
          suggestion, direction, and illumination.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he guides us into all truth by suggesting it. There are
          thoughts that dwell in our minds that were not born there, but which
          were exotics brought from heaven and put there by the spirit. It is
          not a fancy that angels whisper into our ears, and that devils do the
          same: both good and evil spirits hold converse with men; and some of
          us have known it. We have had strange thoughts which were not the
          offspring of our souls, but which came from angelic visitants; and
          direct temptations and evil insinuations have we had which were not
          brewed in our own souls, but which came from the pestilential cauldron
          of hell. So the Spirit doth speak in men's ears, sometimes in the
          darkness of the night. In ages gone by he spoke in dreams and visions,
          but now he speaketh by his Word. Have you not at times had
          unaccountably in the middle of your business a thought concerning God
          and heavenly things, and could not tell whence it came? Have you not
          been reading or studying the Scripture, but a text came across your
          mind, and you could not help it; though you even put it down it was
          like cork in water, and would swim up again to the top of your mind.
          Well, that good thought was put there by the Spirit; he often guides
          his people into all truth by suggesting, just as the guide in the
          grotto does with his flambeau. He does not say a word, perhaps, but he
          walks into a passage himself, and you follow him, so the Spirit
          suggests a thought, and your heart follows it up. Well can I remember
          the manner in which I learned the doctrines of grace in a single
          instant. Born, as all of us are by nature, an Arminian, I still
          believed the old things I had heard continually from the pulpit, and
          did not see the grace of God. I remember sitting one day in the house
          of God and hearing a sermon as dry as possible, and as worthless as
          all such sermons are, when a thought struck my mind -- how came I to
          be converted? I prayed, thought I. Then I thought how came I to pray?
          I was induced to pray by reading the Scriptures. How came I to read
          the Scriptures? Why -- I did read them, and what led me to that? And
          then, in a moment, I saw that God was at the bottom of all, and that
          he was the author of faith; and then the whole doctrine opened up to
          me, from which I have not departed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But sometimes he leads us by direction. The guide points and says --
          "There, gentlemen, go along that particular path, that is the way." So
          the Spirit gives a direction and tendency to our thoughts; not
          suggesting a new one but letting a particular thought when it starts
          take such-and-such a direction; not so much putting a boat on the
          stream as steering it when it is there. When our thoughts are
          considering sacred things he leads us into a more excellent channel
          from that in which we started. Time after time have you commenced a
          meditation on a certain doctrine and, unaccountably, you were
          gradually led away into another, and you saw how one doctrine leaned
          on another, as is the case with the stones in the arch of a bridge,
          all hanging on the keystone of Jesus Christ crucified. You were
          brought to see these things not by a new idea suggested, but by
          direction given to your thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps the best way in which the Holy Ghost leads us into all
          truth is by illumination. He illuminates the Bible. Now, have any of
          you an illuminated Bible at home? "No," says one, "I have a morocco
          Bible; I have a Polyglot Bible; I have a marginal reference Bible."
          Ah! that is all very well but have you an illuminated Bible? "Yes, I
          have a large family Bible with pictures in it." There is a picture of
          John the Baptist baptizing Christ by pouring water on his head and
          many other nonsensical things; but that is not what I mean: have you
          an illuminated Bible? "Yes, I have a Bible with splendid engravings in
          it." Yes; I know you may have; but have you an illuminated Bible? "I
          don't understand what you mean by an illuminated Bible." Well, it is
          the Christian man who has an illuminated Bible. He does not buy it
          illuminated originally, but when he reads it
        </p>
        <p>"A glory gilds the sacred page,</p>
        <p>Majestic like the sun</p>
        <p>Which gives a light to every age, --</p>
        <p>It gives, but burrows none."</p>
        <p>
          There is nothing like reading an illuminated Bible, beloved. You may
          read to all eternity, and never learn anything by it, unless it is
          illuminated by the Spirit; and then the words shine forth like stars.
          The book seems made of gold leaf; every single letter glitters like a
          diamond. Oh, it is a blessed thing to read an illuminated Bible lit up
          by the radiance of the Holy Ghost. Hast thou read the Bible and
          studied it, my brother, and yet have thine eyes been unenlightened? Go
          and say, "O Lord gild the Bible for me. I want an expounded Bible.
          Illuminate it; shine upon it; for I cannot read it to profit, unless
          thou enlightenest me." Blind men may read the Bible with their
          fingers, but blind souls cannot. We want a light to read the Bible by,
          there is no reading it in the dark. Thus the Holy Spirit leads us into
          all truth, by suggesting ideas, by directing our thoughts, and by
          illuminating the Scriptures when we read them.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The last thing is AN EVIDENCE. The question arises, How may I know
          whether I am enlightened by the Spirit's influence, and led into all
          truth?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you may know the Spirit's influence by its unity -- he guides
          us into all truth: secondly, by its universality -- he guides us into
          all truth. First, if you are judging a minister, whether he has the
          Holy Ghost in him or not, you may know him in the first place, by the
          constant unity of his testimony. A man cannot be enlightened by the
          Holy Spirit, who preaches yea and nay. The Spirit never says one thing
          at one time and another thing at another time. There are indeed many
          good men who say both yea and nay, but still their contrary
          testimonies are not both from God the Spirit, for God the Spirit
          cannot witness to black and white, to a falsehood and truth. It has
          been always held as a first principle, that truth is one thing; but
          some persons say, "I find one thing in one part of the Bible and
          another thing in another and though it contradicts itself I must
          believe it." All quite right, brother, if it did contradict itself;
          but the fault is not in the wood but in the carpenter. Many carpenters
          do not understand dovetailing, so there are many preachers who do not
          understand dove-tailing. It is very nice work, and it is not easily
          learnt, it takes some apprenticeship to make all doctrines square
          together. Some preachers preach very good Calvinism for half-an-hour,
          and the next quarter-of-an hour Arminianism. If they are Calvinists,
          let them stick to it; if they are Arminians, let them stick to it, let
          their preaching be all of a piece. Don't let them pile up things only
          to kick them all down again; let us have one thing woven from the top
          throughout, and let us not rend it. How did Solomon know the true
          mother of the child. "Cut it in halves," said he. The woman who was
          not the mother, did not care so long as the other did not get the
          whole, and she consented. "Ah," said the true mother, "give her the
          living child. Let her have it, rather than cut it in halves "So the
          true child of God would say "I give it up, let my opponent conquer; I
          do not went to have the truth cut in halves. I would rather be all
          wrong, than have the word altered to my taste. "We do not want to have
          a divided Bible. No, we claim the whole living child or none at all.
          We may rest assured of this, that until we get rid of our
          linsey-wolsey doctrine, and cease to sow mingled seed, we shall not
          have a blessing. An enlightened mind cannot believe a gospel which
          denies itself; it must be one thing or the other. One thing cannot
          contradict another, and yet it and its opposite be equally true. You
          may know the Spirit's influence then, by the unity of its testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you may know it by its universality. The true child of God will
          not be led into some truth but into all truth. When first he starts he
          will not know half the truth, he will believe it but not understand
          it; he will have the germ of it but not the sum total in all its
          breadth and length. There is nothing like learning by experience. A
          man cannot set up for a theologian in a week. Certain doctrines take
          years to develop themselves. Like the aloe that taketh a hundred years
          to be dressed, there be some truths that must lie long in the heart
          before they really come out and make themselves appear so that we can
          speak of them as that we do know; and testify of that which we have
          seen. The Spirit will gradually lead us into all truth. For instance
          if it be true that Jesus Christ is to reign upon the earth personally
          for a thousand years, as I am inclined to believe it is, if I be under
          the Spirit, that will be more and more opened to me, until I with
          confidence declare it. Some men begin very timidly. A man says, at
          first, "I know we are justified by faith, and have peace with God, but
          so many have cried out against eternal justification, that I am afraid
          of it." But he is gradually enlightened, and led to see that in the
          same hour when all his debts were paid, a full discharge was given;
          that in the moment when its sin was cancelled, every elect soul was
          justified in God's mind, though they were not; justified in their own
          minds till afterwards. The Spirit shall lead you into all truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what are the practical inferences from this great doctrine? The
          first is with reference to the Christian who is afraid of his own
          ignorance. How many are there who are just enlightened and have tasted
          of heavenly things, who are afraid they are too ignorant to be saved!
          Beloved, God the Holy Spirit can teach any one, however illiterate,
          however uninstructed. I have known some men who were almost idiots
          before conversion, but they afterwards had their faculties wonderfully
          developed. Some time ago there was a man who was so ignorant that he
          could not read, and he never spoke anything like grammar in his life,
          unless by mistake; and moreover, he was considered to be what the
          people in his neighborhood called "daft." But when he was converted,
          the first thing he did was to pray He stammered out a few words, and
          in a little time his powers of speaking began to develop themselves.
          Then he thought he would like to read the Scriptures, and after long,
          long months of labor, he learned to read; and what was the next thing?
          He thought he could preach; and he did preach a little in his own
          homely way, in his house. Then he thought "I must read a few more
          books." And so his mind expanded, until, I believe he is at the
          present day, a useful minister, settled in a country village, laboring
          for God. It needs but little intellect to be taught of God. If you
          feel your ignorance do not despair. Go to the Spirit -- the great
          Teacher -- and ask his sacred influence, and it shall come to pass
          that he "shall guide you into all truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another inference is this whenever any of our brethren do not
          understand the truth let us take a hint as to the best way of dealing
          with them. Do not let us controvert with them. I have heard many
          controversies, but never heard of any good from one of them. We have
          had controversies with certain men called Secularists, and very strong
          arguments have been brought against them; but I believe that the day
          of judgment shall declare that a very small amount of good was ever
          done by contending with these men. Better let them alone, where no
          fuel is the fire goeth out; and he that debateth with them puts wood
          upon the fire. So with regard to Baptism. It is of no avail to quarrel
          with our Paedo-baptist friends. If we simply pray for them that the
          God of truth may lead them to see the true doctrine, they will come to
          it far more easily than by discussions. Few men are taught by
          controversy, for
        </p>
        <p>"A man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still."</p>
        <p>
          Pray for them that the Spirit of truth may lead them "into all truth."
          Do not be angry with your brother, but pray for him; cry, "Lord! open
          thou his eyes that he may behold wondrous things out of thy law."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we speak to some of you who know nothing about the Spirit of
          truth, nor about the truth itself. It may be that some of you are
          saying, "We care not much which of you are right, we are happily
          indifferent to it." Ah! but, poor sinner, if thou knewest the gift of
          God, and who it was that spake the truth, thou wouldst not say, "I
          care not for it;" if thou didst know how essential the truth is to thy
          salvation, thou wouldst not talk so; if thou didst know that the truth
          of God is -- that thou art a worthless sinner, but if thou believest,
          then God from all eternity, apart from all thy merits, loved thee, and
          bought thee with the Redeemer's blood, and justified thee in the forum
          of heaven, and will by-and-bye justify thee in the forum of thy
          conscience through the Holy Ghost by faith; if thou didst know that
          there is a heaven for thee beyond the chance of a failure, a crown for
          thee, the lustre of which can never be dimmed; -- then thou wouldst
          say, "Indeed the truth is precious to my soul!" Why, my ungodly
          hearers, these men of error want to take away the truth, which alone
          can save you, the only gospel that can deliver you from hell; they
          deny the great truths of free-grace, those fundamental doctrines which
          alone can snatch a sinner from hell; and even though you do not feel
          interest in them now, I still would say, you ought to desire to see
          them promoted. May God give you to know the truth in your hearts! May
          the Spirit "guide you into all truth!" For if you do not know the
          truth here, recollect there will be a sorrowful learning of it in the
          dark chambers of the pit, where the only light shall be the flames of
          hell! May you here know the truth! And the truth shall make you free:
          and if the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed, for he
          says, "I am the way, the truth, the life." Believe on Jesus thou chief
          of sinners; trust his love and mercy, and thou art saved, for God the
          Spirit giveth faith and eternal life.<br />
