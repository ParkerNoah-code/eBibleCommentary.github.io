          1. For since there are real men, so must there also be a real
          establishment (plantationem), that they vanish not away among
          non-existent things, but progress among those which have an actual
          existence. For neither is the substance nor the essence of the
          creation annihilated (for faithful and true is He who has established
          it), but "the fashion of the world passeth away;" that is, those
          things among which transgression has occurred, since man has grown old
          in them. And therefore this [present] fashion has been formed
          temporary, God foreknowing all things; as I have pointed out in the
          preceding book, and have also shown, as far as was possible, the cause
          of the creation of this world of temporal things. But when this
          [present] fashion [of things] passes away, and man has been renewed,
          and flourishes in an incorruptible state, so as to preclude the
          possibility of becoming old, [then] there shall be the new heaven and
          the new earth, in which the new man shall remain [continually], always
          holding fresh converse with God. And since (or, that) these things
          shall ever continue without end, Isaiah declares, "For as the new
          heavens and the new earth which I do make, continue in my sight, saith
          the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain." And as the
          presbyters say, Then those who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven
          shall go there, others shall enjoy the delights of paradise, and
          others shall possess the splendour of the city; for everywhere the
          Saviour shall be seen according as they who see Him shall be worthy.

          2. [They say, moreover], that there is this distinction between the
          habitation of those who produce an hundred-fold, and that of those who
          produce sixty-fold, and that of those who produce thirty-fold: for the
          first will be taken up into the heavens, the second will dwell in
          paradise, the last will inhabit the city; and that was on this account
          the Lord declared, "In My Father's house are many mansions." For all
          things belong to God, who supplies all with a suitable dwelling-place;
          even as His Word says, that a share is allotted to all by the Father,
          according as each person is or shall be worthy. And this is the couch
          on which the guests shall recline, having been invited to the wedding.
          The presbyters, the disciples of the apostles, affirm that this is the
          gradation and arrangement of those who are saved, and that they
          advance through steps of this nature; also that they ascend through
          the Spirit to the Son, and through the Son to the Father, and that in
          due time the Son will yield up His work to the Father, even as it is
          said by the apostle, "For He must reign till He hath put all enemies
          under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." For
          in the times of the kingdom, the righteous man who is upon the earth
          shall then forget to die. "But when He saith, All things shall be
          subdued unto Him, it is manifest that He is excepted who did put all
          things under Him. And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then
          shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him who put all things
          under Him, that God may be all in all."

          3. John, therefore, did distinctly foresee the first "resurrection of
          the just," and the inheritance in the kingdom of the earth; and what
          the prophets have prophesied concerning it harmonize [with his
          vision]. For the Lord also taught these things, when He promised that
          He would have the mixed cup new with His disciples in the kingdom. The
          apostle, too, has confessed that the creation shall be free from the
          bondage of corruption, [so as to pass] into the liberty of the sons of
          God. And in all these things, and by them all, the same God the Father
          is manifested, who fashioned man, and gave promise of the inheritance
          of the earth to the fathers, who brought it (the creature) forth [from
          bondage] at the resurrection of the just, and fulfils the promises for
          the kingdom of His Son; subsequently bestowing in a paternal manner
          those things which neither the eye has seen, nor the ear has heard,
          nor has [thought concerning them] arisen within the heart of man, For
          there is the one Son, who accomplished His Father's will; and one
          human race also in which the mysteries of God are wrought, "which the
          angels desire to look into;" and they are not able to search out the
          wisdom of God, by means of which His handiwork, confirmed and
          incorporated with His Son, is brought to perfection; that His
          offspring, the First-begotten Word, should descend to the creature
          (facturam), that is, to what had been moulded (plasma), and that it
          should be contained by Him; and, on the other hand, the creature
          should contain the Word, and ascend to Him, passing beyond the angels,
          and be made after the image and likeness of God.
