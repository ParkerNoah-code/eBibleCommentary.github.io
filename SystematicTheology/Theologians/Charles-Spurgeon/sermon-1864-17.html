        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.581)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, July 24th, 1864, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them:
          and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw
          it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little
          children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the
          kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the
          kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he
          took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them"
          -- Mark 10:13-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          MY attention has been specially directed to this passage by the fact
          that it has been quoted against me by most of the authors of those
          sermons and letters which are, by a stretch of imagination, called
          "replies" to my sermon upon "Baptismal Regeneration." Replies they
          certainly are not, except to one another. I marvel that a Church so
          learned as the Anglican, cannot produce something a little more worthy
          of the point in hand. The various authors may possibly have read my
          discourse, but by reason of mental absorption in other meditations, or
          perhaps through the natural disturbance of mind caused by guilty
          consciences, they have talked with confusion of words, and have only
          been successful in refuting themselves, and answering one another.
          They must have been aiming at something far removed from my sermon, or
          else I must give them credit for being the worst shots that ever
          practiced with polemical artillery. They do not so much as touch the
          target in its extreme corners, much less in its centre. The whole
          question is, Do you believe that baptism regenerates? If so -- prove
          that your belief is Scriptural! Do you believe that baptism does not
          regenerate? Then justify your swearing that it does? Who will reply to
          this? He shall merit and bear the palm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture before us is by several of the champions on the other
          side exhibited to the people as a rebuke to me. Their reasoning is
          rather ingenious than forcible: forsooth, because the disciples
          incurred the displeasure of Jesus Christ by keeping back the little
          children from coming to Him, therefore Jesus Christ is greatly
          displeased with me, and with all others like me, for keeping children
          from the font, and the performance there enacted; and specially
          displeased with me for exposing the Anglican doctrine of Baptismal
          Regeneration! Observe the reasoning -- because Jesus was much
          displeased with disciples for hindering parents from seeking a
          blessing upon their children, therefore he is much displeased with us
          who do not believe in godfathers and godmothers, or the signing of the
          cross on the infant brow. I must say at the outset that this is rather
          a leap of argument, and would not ordinarily be thought conclusive,
          but this we may readily overlook, since we have long ceased to hope
          for reasonable arguments from those who support a cause based upon
          absurdity. My brethren, I concluded that there must be something
          forcible in such a text as this, or my opponents would not be so eager
          to secure it; I have therefore carefully looked at it, and as I have
          viewed it, it has opened up to me with a sacred splendour of grace. In
          this incident the very heart of Christ is published to poor sinners,
          and we may clearly perceive the freeness and the fulness of the mighty
          grace of the Redeemer of men, who is willing to receive the youngest
          child as well as the oldest man; and is greatly displeased with any
          who would keep back seeking souls from coming to him, or loving hearts
          from bringing others to receive his blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In handling this text in what I believe to be its true light, I
          shall commence, first of all, by observing that THIS TEXT HAS NOT THE
          SHADOW OF THE SHADE OF THE GHOST OF A CONNECTION WITH BAPTISM. There
          is no line of connection so substantial as a spider's web between this
          incident and baptism, or at least my imagination is not vivid enough
          to conceive one. This I will prove to you, if you will follow me for a
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very clear, Dear Friends, that these young children were not
          brought to Jesus Christ by their friends to be baptized. "They brought
          young children to him, that he should touch them," says Mark. Matthew
          describes the children as being brought "that he would put his hands
          on them and pray," but there is not a hint about their being baptized;
          no godfathers or godmothers had been provided, and no sign of the
          cross was requested. Surely the parents themselves knew tolerably well
          what it was they desired, and they would not have expressed themselves
          so dubiously as to ask him to touch them, when they meant that he
          should baptize them. The parents evidently had no thought of
          regeneration by baptism, and brought the children for quite another
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, if they brought the children to Jesus Christ to be
          baptized, they brought them to the wrong person; for the Evangelist,
          John, in the fourth chapter, and the second verse, expressly assures
          us that Jesus Christ baptized not, but his disciples: this settles the
          question once for all, and proves beyond all dispute that there is no
          connection between this incident and baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will say, "Perhaps they brought the children to be baptized by
          the disciples?" Brethren, the disciples were not in the habit of
          baptizing infants, and this is clear from the case in hand. If they
          had been in the habit of baptizing infants, would they have rebuked
          the parents for bringing them? If it had been a customary thing for
          parents to bring children with such an object, would the disciples who
          had been in the constant habit of performing the ceremony, have
          rebuked them for attending to it? Would any Church clergyman rebuke
          parents for bringing their children to be baptized? If he did so, he
          would act absurdly contrary to his own views and practice; and we
          cannot therefore imagine that if infant baptism had been the accepted
          practice, the disciples could have acted so absurdly as to rebuke the
          parents for bringing their little ones. It is obvious that such could
          not have been the practice of the disciples who were rebuked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, and here is an argument which seems to me to have great
          force in it, when Jesus Christ rebuked his disciples, then was the
          time if ever in his life, to have openly spoken concerning infant
          baptism, godfathers and godmothers, and the whole affair. If he wished
          to rebuke his disciples most effectually, how could he have done it
          better than by saying, "Wherefore keep ye these children back? I have
          ordained that they shall be baptized; I have expressly commanded that
          they shall be regenerated and made members of my body in baptism; how
          dare you then, in opposition to my will, keep them back?" But no, dear
          friends, our Saviour never said a word about "the laver of
          regeneration," or, "the quickening dew," when he rebuked them -- not a
          single sentence. Had he done so, the season would have been most
          appropriate if it had been his intention to teach the practice; in the
          whole of his life, there is no period in which a discourse upon infant
          regeneration in baptism could have been more appropriate than on this
          occasion, and yet not a single sentence about it comes from the
          Saviour's lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          To close all, Jesus Christ did not baptize the children. Our
          Evangelist does not inform us that he exclaimed, "Where are the
          godfathers and godmothers?" Is it not recorded that he called for a
          font, or a Prayer Book? No; but "He took them up in his arms, put his
          hands upon them, and blessed them," and dismissed them without a drop
          of the purifying element. Now, if this event had any connection with
          baptism whatever, it was the most appropriate occasion for infant
          baptism to have been practiced. Why, it would have ended for ever the
          controversy. There may be some men in the world who would have raised
          the question of engrafting infants into the body of Christ's Church by
          baptism after all this, but I am certain no honest man would have done
          so who reverently accepted Christ as his spiritual leader. I, my
          brethren, would sooner be dumb than speak a single word against an
          ordinance which Christ himself instituted and practiced; and if on
          this occasion he had but sprinkled one of these infants, given him a
          Christian name, signed him with a cross, accepted the vows of his
          godparents, and thanked God for his regeneration, then the question
          would have been settled for ever, and some of us would have been saved
          a world of abuse, besides escaping no end of mistakes, for which we
          are condemned, in the judgment of many good people, for whom we have
          some affection, though for their judgment we have no respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you see the parents did not ask baptismal regeneration; Christ did
          not personally baptize; the disciples were not in the habit of
          baptizing infants, or else they would not have rebuked the parents;
          Christ did not speak about baptism on the occasion, and he did not
          baptize the little ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will put a case to you which may exhibit the weakness of my
          opponents' position. Suppose a denomination should rise up which
          should teach that babes should be allowed to partake at the Lord's
          Table. Such teaching could plead precedents of great antiquity, for
          you are aware that at one period, infant communion was allowed, and
          logically too; for if an infant has a right to baptism, it has a right
          to come to the Lord's Table. For years children were brought to the
          Lord's Table, but rather inconvenient accidents occurred, and
          therefore the thing was dropped as being unseemly. But if someone
          should revive the error, and try to prove that infants are to come to
          the Lord's Supper, he might prove it from this passage quite as
          clearly as our friends can prove infant baptism from it. Moreover do
          not forget that even if infant baptism could be proved from this text,
          the ceremony prescribed in the Prayer Book is quite as far from being
          established. Whether the baptism of infants may or may not be proved
          from other Scriptures I cannot now stay to enquire, but even if it can
          be, what are we to say for godfathers or godmothers, or the assertion
          that in baptism children are made "members of Christ, children of God,
          and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven?" Truly I might as well prove
          vaccination from the text before me, as the performance which the
          Prayer Book calls "infant baptism." I do not hesitate to say that I
          could prove any earthly thing, if I might but have such reasoning
          granted to me as that which proved infant baptism from this passage.
          There is no possible connection between the two. The teaching of the
          passage is very plain and very clear, and baptism has been imported
          into it, and not found in it. As a quaint writer has well said, "These
          doctrines are raised from the text as our collectors raise a tax upon
          indigent, nonsolvent people, by coming armed with the law and a
          constable to distrain for that which is not to be had. Certainly never
          was text so strained and distrained to pay what it never owed; never
          man so racked to confess what he never thought; never was a pumice
          stone so squeezed for water which it never held." Still hundreds will
          catch at this straw, and cry, "Did not Jesus say, Suffer the little
          children to come unto me?'" To these we give this one word, see that
          ye read the Word as it is written, and you will find no water in it
          but Jesus only. Are the water and Christ the same thing? Is bringing a
          child to a font bringing the child to Christ? Nay, here is a wide
          difference, as wide as between Rome and Jerusalem, as wide as between
          Anti-christ and Christ, between false doctrine and the gospel of our
          Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, for our second and much more pleasing task, WHY THEN WAS
          JESUS CHRIST DISPLEASED?
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the passage and at once the answer comes to you. He was
          displeased with his disciples for two reasons: first, because they
          discouraged those who would bring others to him; and secondly, because
          they discouraged those who themselves were anxious to come to him.
          They did not discourage those who were coming to a font, they
          discouraged those who were coming to Jesus. There is a mighty
          distinction ever to be held between the font and Christ, between the
          sprinkling of the priest and living faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, his disciples discouraged those who would bring others to him.
          This is a great sin, and wherever it is committed Jesus Christ is
          greatly displeased, for a true desire to see others saved is wrought
          in the believer by God the Holy Spirit, who thus renders the called
          ones the means of bringing wandering sheep into the fold. In this case
          they discouraged those who would bring children to him to be blessed.
          How can we bring children to Jesus Christ to be blessed? We cannot do
          it in a corporeal sense, for Jesus is not here, "he is risen;" but we
          can bring our children in a true, real, and spiritual sense. We take
          them up in the arms of our prayer. I hope many of us, so soon as our
          children saw the light, if not before, presented them to God with this
          anxious prayer, that they might sooner die than live to disgrace their
          father's God. We only desired children that we might in them live over
          again another life of service to God; and when we looked into their
          young faces, we never asked wealth for them, nor fame, nor anything
          else, but that they might be dear unto God, and that their names might
          be written in the Lamb's Book of Life. We did then bring our children
          to Christ as far as we could do it, by presenting them before God, by
          earnest prayer on their behalf. And have we ceased to bring them to
          Christ? Nay, I hope we seldom bow the knee without praying for our
          children. Our daily cry is, "O, that they might live before thee!" God
          knows that nothing would give us more joy than to see evidence of
          their conversion; our souls would almost leap out of our bodies with
          joy, if we should but know that they were the children of the living
          God. Nor has this privilege been denied to us, for there are some here
          who can rejoice in a converted household. Truly we can say with the
          apostle Paul, "I have no greater joy than this, that my children walk
          in the truth." We continue, therefore, to bring them to Christ by
          daily, constant, earnest prayer on their behalf. So soon as they
          become of years capable of understanding the things of God, we
          endeavour to bring them to Christ by teaching them the truth. Hence
          our Sabbath-schools, hence the use of the Bible and family prayer, and
          catechizing at home. Any person who shall forbid us to pray for our
          children, will incur Christ's high displeasure; and any who shall say,
          "Do not teach your children; they will be converted in God's own time
          if it be his purpose, therefore leave them to run wild in the
          streets," will certainly both "sin against the child" and the Lord
          Jesus. We might as well say, "If that piece of ground is to grow a
          harvest, it will do so if it be God's good pleasure; therefore leave
          it, and let the weeds spring up and cover it; do not endeavour for a
          moment to kill the weeds, or to sow the good seed." Why, such
          reasoning as this would be not only cruel to our children, but
          grievously displeasing to Christ. Parents! I do hope you are all
          endeavouring to bring your children to Christ by teaching them the
          things of God. Let them not be strangers to the plan of salvation.
          Never let it be said that a child of yours reached years in which his
          conscience could act, and he could judge between good and evil,
          without knowing the doctrine of the atonement, without understanding
          the great substitutionary work of Christ. Set before your child life
          and death, hell and heaven, judgment and mercy, his own sin, and
          Christ's most precious blood; and as you set these before him, labour
          with him, persuade him, as the apostle did his congregation, with
          tears and weeping, to turn unto the Lord; and your prayers and
          supplications shall be heard so that the Spirit of God shall bring
          them to Jesus. How much more like the Scripture will such labours be
          than if you were to sing the following very pretty verse which
          disfigures Roundell Palmer's "Book of Praise!" --
        </p>
        <p>"Though thy conception was in sin,</p>
        <p>A sacred bathing thou hast had;</p>
        <p>And though thy birth unclean has been,</p>
        <p>A blameless babe thou now art made.</p>
        <p>Sweet baby, then forbear to weep;</p>
        <p>Be still, my dear, sweet baby, sleep."</p>
        <p>
          I cannot tell you how much I owe to the solemn words of my good
          mother. It was the custom on Sunday evenings, while we were yet little
          children, for her to stay at home with us, and then we sat round the
          table and read verse by verse, and she explained the Scripture to us.
          After that was done, then came the time of pleading; there was a
          little piece of "Alleyn's Alarm," or of Baxter's "Call to the
          Unconverted," and this was read with pointed observations made to each
          of us as we sat round the table; and the question was asked how long
          it would be before we would think about our state, how long before we
          would seek the Lord. Then came a mother's prayer, and some of the
          words of a mother's prayer we shall never forget, even when our hair
          is grey. I remember on one occasion her praying thus: "Now, Lord, if
          my children go on in their sins, it will not be from ignorance that
          they perish, and my soul must bear a swift witness against them at the
          day of judgment if they lay not hold of Christ." That thought of a
          mother's bearing swift witness against me, pierced my conscience and
          stirred my heart. This pleading with them for God and with God for
          them is the true way to bring children to Christ. Sunday-school
          teachers! you have a high and noble work, press forward in it. In our
          schools you do not try to bring children to the baptistry for
          regeneration, you point them away from ceremonies; if I know the
          teachers of this school aright, I know you are trying to bring your
          classes to Christ. Let Christ be the sum and substance of your
          teaching in the school. Young men and young women, in your classes
          lift up Christ, lift him up on high; and if anybody shall say to you,
          "Why do you thus talk to the children?" you can say, "Because my soul
          yearns towards them, and I pant for their conversion;" and if any
          should afterwards object, you can remember that Jesus is greatly
          displeased with them, and not with you, for you only obey the
          injunction, "Feed my lambs."
        </p>
        <p>
          The case in our text is that of children, but objectors rise up who
          disapprove of endeavours to bring any sort of people to Christ by
          faith and prayer. There are some who spend their nights in the streets
          seeking after the poor harlot, and I have heard many harsh
          observations made about their work; some will say it is ridiculous to
          expect that any of those who have spent their days in debauchery
          should be converted. We are told that the most of those who are taken
          into the refuges go back and become as depraved as ever; I believe
          that to be a very sad and solemn truth; but I believe, if I or anyone
          else shall urge that or anything else as a reason why my brethren
          should not seek the harlot, that Jesus would be greatly displeased;
          for any man who stands between a soul-seeker and the divine object of
          getting a blessing for the sinner's soul, excites the wrath of Christ.
          Some have hopes of our convicts and criminals; but every now and then
          there is an outcry against those who even believe it possible for a
          transport or a ticket-of-leave man to be converted. But Jesus is
          greatly displeased with any who shall say about the work, "It is too
          hard; it is impossible." My brethren in Christ, labour for souls of
          all sorts: for your children and for those who are past the threescore
          years and ten. Seek out the drunkard; go after the thief; despise not
          the poor down-trodden slave; let every race, let every colour, let
          every age, let every profession, let every nation, be the object of
          your soul's prayers. You live in this world, I hope, to bring souls to
          Jesus; you are Christ's magnets with which through his Holy Spirit he
          will attract hearts of steel; you are his heralds, you are to invite
          wanderers to come to the banquet; you are his messengers, you are to
          compel them to come in that his house may be filled; and if the devil
          tells you you will not succeed, and if the world tells you that you
          are too feeble and have not talent enough, never mind, Jesus would be
          greatly displeased with you if you should take any heed to them; and
          meanwhile he is greatly displeased with your adversaries for
          endeavouring to stop you. Beloved, this is why Jesus Christ was
          greatly displeased.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second ground of displeasure must be noticed. These children, it
          strikes me, and I think there is good reason for the belief,
          themselves desired to come to Christ to obtain a blessing. They are
          called "little children," which term does not necessarily involve
          their being infants of six months or a year; indeed, it is clear, as I
          will show in a moment, that they were not such little children as to
          be unconscious babes. They were "infants," according to our version of
          Luke, but then you know the English word "infant" includes a
          considerable range of age, for every person in his minority is legally
          considered to be an infant, though he may be able to talk to any
          amount. We do not, however, desire to translate the text with so great
          a license. There is no necessity in the language used that these
          should have been anything but what they are said to be -- "little
          children." It is evident they could walk, because in Luke it is said,
          "Jesus called them;" the gender of the Greek pronoun used there refers
          it to the children, not to the persons, nor to the disciples. Jesus
          called them, he called the children, which he would hardly have done
          if they could not comprehend his call: and he said, "Suffer the little
          children to come," which implies that they could come, and doubtless
          they did come, with cheerful faces, expecting to get the blessing.
          These perhaps may have been some of those very children, who, a short
          time after, pulled down branches from the trees and strewed them in
          the way, and cried, "Hosanna," when the Saviour said, "Out of the
          mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength." Now Christ
          was greatly displeased with his disciples for pushing back these boys
          and girls. They did, as some old folks do now-a-days, who cry out --
          "Stand back, you boys and girls! we do not want you here; we do not
          want children to fill up the place; we only want grown-up people."
          They pushed them back; they thought that Christ would have too much to
          do, if he attended to the juveniles. Here comes out this principle,
          that we must expect Christ's displeasure, if we attempt to keep
          anybody back from coming to Christ, even though it be the youngest
          child. You ask how persons can come to Christ now? They cannot come
          corporeally, but they can come by simple prayer and humble faith.
          Faith is the way to Jesus, baptism is not. When Jesus says, "Come unto
          me all ye that labour and are heavy laden," he did not mean, "be
          baptized," did he? No; and so when he said, "Suffer the little
          children to come unto me," he did not mean, "Baptize them," did he?
          Coming to Jesus Christ is quite a different thing from coming to a
          font. Coming to Christ means laying hold upon Christ with the hand of
          faith; looking to him for my life, my pardon, my salvation, my
          everything. If there be a poor little child here who is saying in her
          little heart, or his little heart, "I would like to come to Christ, O
          that I might be pardoned while I am yet a little one" -- come, little
          lamb; come, and welcome. Did I hear your cry? Was it this?
        </p>
        <p>"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,</p>
        <p>Look upon a little child;</p>
        <p>Pity my simplicity,</p>
        <p>Suffer me to come to thee."</p>
        <p>
          Dear little one, Jesus will not despise your lispings, nor will his
          servant keep you back. Jesus calls you, come and receive his blessing.
          If any of you say a word to keep the young heart back, Jesus will be
          displeased with you. Now I am afraid some do that; those, for
          instance, who think that the gospel is not for little children. Many
          of my brethren, I am sorry to say, preach in such a way that there is
          no hope of children ever getting any good by their preaching. I cannot
          glory in learning or eloquence, but in this one thing I may rejoice,
          that there is always a number of happy children here, who are quite as
          attentive as any of my audience. I do love to think that the gospel is
          suitable to little children. There are boys and girls in many of our
          Sabbath-school classes down below stairs who are as truly converted to
          God as any of us. Nay, and if you were to speak with them about the
          things of God, though you should get to the knotty points of election
          and predestination, you would find those boys and girls well taught in
          the things of the kingdom: they know free will from free grace, and
          you cannot puzzle them when you come to talk about the work of Jesus
          and the work of the Spirit, for they can discern between things which
          differ. But a minister who preaches as though he never wanted to bring
          children to Christ, and shoots right over the little one's heads, I do
          think Jesus is displeased with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there are others who doubt whether children ever will be
          converted. They do not look upon it as a thing likely to happen, and
          whenever they hear of a believing child, they hold up their hands at
          the prodigy, and say, "What a wonder of grace!" It ought to be, and in
          those Churches where the gospel is simply preached, it is as common a
          thing for children to be converted as for grown-up people to be
          brought to Christ. Others begin to doubt the truth of juvenile
          conversions. They say, "They are very young, can they understand the
          gospel? Is it not merely an infantile emotion, a mere profession?" My
          brethren, you have no more right to suspect the sincerity of the
          young, than to mistrust the grey-headed; you ought to receive them
          with the same open-breasted confidence with which you receive others
          when they profess to have found the Saviour. Do, I pray you, whenever
          you see the faintest desire in your children, go down on your knees,
          as your servant does, when the fire is almost out, and blow the spark
          with your own breath -- seek by prayer to fan that spark to a flame.
          Do not despise any godly remark the child may make. Do not puff the
          child up on account of the goodness of the remark, lest you make him
          vain and so injure him, but do encourage him; let his first little
          prayers be noticed by you; though you may not like to teach him a form
          of prayer -- I shall not care if you do not -- yet teach him what
          prayer is; tell him to express his desires in his own words, and when
          he does so, join ye in it and plead with God on his behalf, that your
          little one may speedily find true peace in a Saviour's blood. You must
          not, unless you would displease my Master, keep back the smallest
          child that longs to come to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here let us observe that the principle is of general application; you
          must not hinder any awakened soul from seeking the Saviour. O my
          brethren and sisters, I hope we have such a love for souls, such an
          instinct within us to desire to see the travail of Christ's soul, that
          instead of putting stumbling-blocks in the way, we would do the best
          we could to gather out the stones. On Sabbath days I have laboured to
          clear up the doubts and fears which afflict coming sinners; I have
          entreated God the Holy Spirit to enable me so to speak, that those
          things which hindered you from coming to the Saviour might be removed;
          but how sad must be the case of those who delight themselves in
          putting stumbling-blocks in men's way. The doctrine of election for
          instance, a great and glorious truth, full of comfort to God's people;
          how often is that made to frighten sinners from Jesus! There is a way
          of preaching that with a drawn sword, and say, "You must not come
          unless you know you are one of God's elect." That is not the way to
          preach the doctrine. The true way of preaching it is, "God has a
          chosen people, and I hope you are one of them; come, lay hold on
          Jesus, put your trust in him." Then there be others who preach up
          frames and feelings as a preparation for Christ. They do in effect
          say, "Unless you have felt so much depression of spirit, or
          experienced a certain quantity of brokenness of heart, you must not
          come to Christ," instead of declaring, that whosoever will is
          permitted to come, and that the true way of coming to Christ is not
          with a qualification of frames and feeling and mental depressions, but
          just as you are. Oh! it is my soul's delight to preach a gospel which
          has an open door to it, to preach a mercy-seat which has no veil
          before it; the veil is rent in twain, and now the biggest sinner out
          of hell who desires to come, is welcome. You who are eighty years of
          age, and have hated Christ all the time, if now the Spirit of God
          makes you willing to come, Christ seems to say, "Suffer the grey-
          headed to come unto me, and forbid them not:" while to you little
          children, he stretches out his arms in the same manner, "Suffer the
          little children to come unto me." O my beloved, see to it that your
          heart longs to come to Christ, and not to ceremonies! I stand here
          this day to cry, "Come ye to the cross, not to the font." When I
          forget to lift up the Lord Jesus, and to cast down the forms of man's
          devising, "let my right hand forget her cunning," and "let my tongue
          cleave to the roof of my mouth" --
        </p>
        <p>None but Jesus, none but Jesus,</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good;"</p>
        <p>
          The font is a mockery and an imposition if it be put before Christ. If
          you have baptism after you have come to Christ, well and good, but to
          point you to it either as being Christ, or as being inevitably
          connected with Christ, or as being the place to find Christ, is
          nothing better than to go back to the beggarly elements of the old
          Romish harlot, instead of standing in the "liberty wherewith Christ
          hath made us free," and bidding the sinner to come as a sinner to
          Christ Jesus, and to Christ Jesus alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third and last place, let us also gather from our text,
          that WHEN WE DISCOURAGE ANY, WE ALWAYS GO UPON WRONG GROUNDS. Here was
          the case of children. I suppose that the grounds upon which the
          apostles kept back the children would be one of these -- either that
          the children could not receive a blessing, or else that they could not
          receive it worthily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did they imagine that these little children could not receive the
          blessing? Perhaps so, for they thought them too young. Now, brethren,
          that was a wrong ground to go upon, for these children could receive
          the blessing and they did receive it, for Jesus took them in his arms
          and blessed them. If I keep back a child from coming to Christ on the
          ground that he is too young, I do it in the face of facts; because
          there have been children brought to Christ at an extremely early
          period. You who are acquainted with Janeway's "Tokens for Children,"
          have noticed very many beautiful instances of early conversion. Our
          dear friend, Mrs. Rogers, in that book of hers, "The Folded Lamb,"
          gave a very sweet picture of a little son of hers, soon folded in the
          Saviour's bosom above, who, as early as two or three years of age,
          rejoiced and knew the Saviour. I do not doubt at all, I cannot doubt
          it, because one has seen such cases, that children of two or three
          years of age may have precocity of knowledge, and of grace; a
          forwardness which in almost every case has betokened early death, but
          which has been perfectly marvellous to those who have talked with
          them. The fact is that we do not all at the same age arrive at that
          degree of mental stature which is necessary for understanding the
          things of God. Children have been reported as reading Latin, Greek,
          and other languages, at five or six years of age. I do not know that
          such early scholarship is any great blessing, it is better not to
          reach that point so soon; but some children are all that their minds
          ever will be at three or four, and then they go home to heaven; and so
          long as the mind has been brought up to such a condition that it is
          capable of understanding, it is also capable of faith, if the Holy
          Spirit shall implant it. To suppose that he ever did give faith to an
          unconscious babe is ridiculous; that there can be any faith in a child
          that knows nothing whatever I must always take ground to doubt, for
          "How shall they believe without a preacher?" And yet they are brought
          up to make a profession in their long-clothes, when they have never
          heard a sermon in their lives. But those dear children to whom I have
          before referred, have understood the preacher, have understood the
          truth, have rejoiced in the truth, and their first young lispings have
          been as full of grace as those glorious expressions of aged saints in
          their triumphant departures. Children are capable, then, of receiving
          the grace of God. Do mark by the way, that all those champions who
          have come out against me so valiantly, have made a mistake; they have
          said that we deny that little infants may be regenerated; we do not
          deny that God can regenerate them if he pleases; we do not know
          anything about what may or may not happen to unconscious babes; but we
          did say that little children were not regenerated by their godparents
          telling lies at a font -- we did say that, and we say it again, that
          little children are not regenerated, nor made members of Christ, nor
          children of God, nor inheritors of the kingdom of heaven, by solemn
          mockery, in which godfathers and godmothers promise to do for them
          what they cannot do for themselves, much less for their children. That
          is the point; and if they will please to meet it, we will answer them
          again, but till such time as that, we shall probably let them talk on
          till God gives them grace to know better.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other ground upon which the apostles put back the children would
          be, that although the children might receive the blessing, they might
          not be able to receive it worthily. The Lord Jesus in effect assures
          them that so far from the way in which a little child enters into the
          kingdom of heaven being exceptional, it is the rule; and the very way
          in which a child enters the kingdom, is the way in which everybody
          must enter it. How does a child enter the kingdom of heaven? Why, its
          faith is very simple; it does not understand mysteries and
          controversies, but it believes what it is told upon the authority of
          God's Word, and it comes to God's Word without previous prejudice. It
          has its natural sinfulness, but grace overcomes it, and the child
          receives the Word as it finds it. You will notice in boyish and
          girlish conversions, a peculiar simplicity of belief: they believe
          just what Christ says, exactly what he says. If they pray, they
          believe Christ will hear them: if they talk about Jesus, it is as of a
          person near at hand. They do not, as we do, get into the making of
          these things into mysteries and shadows, but little children have a
          realizing power. Then they have great rejoicing. The most cheerful
          Christians we have are young believers; and the most cheerful old
          Christians are those who were converted when they were young. Why, see
          the joy of a child that finds a Saviour! "Mother," he says, "I have
          sought Jesus Christ, and I have trusted him, and I am saved." He does
          not say, "I hope," and "I trust," but "I am;" and then he is ready to
          leap for joy because he is saved. Of the many boys and girls whom we
          have received into Church-fellowship, I can say of them all, they have
          all gladdened my heart, and I have never received any with greater
          confidence than I have these: this I have noticed about them, they
          have greater joy and rejoicing than any others; and I take it, it is
          because they do not ask so many questions as others do, but take Jesus
          Christ's word as they find it, and believe in it. Well now, just the
          very way in which a child receives Christ, is the way in which you
          must receive Christ if you would be saved. You who know so much that
          you know too much; you who have big brains; you who are always
          thinking, and have tendency to criticism, and perhaps to scepticism,
          you must come and receive the gospel as a little child. You will never
          get a hold of my Lord and Master while you are wearing that quizzing
          cap; no, you must take it off, and by the power of the Holy Spirit you
          must come trusting Jesus, simply trusting him, for this is the right
          way to receive the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here, let me say, the principle which holds good in little
          children holds good in all other cases as well. Take for instance the
          case of very great sinners, men who have been gross offenders against
          the laws of their country. Some would say they cannot be saved; they
          can be for some of them have been. Others would say they never receive
          the truth as it is in Jesus in the right manner; ay, but they do. How
          do great sinners receive Christ? There are some here who have been
          reclaimed from drunkenness, and I know not what. My brethren, how did
          you receive Christ? Why in this way. You said, "All unholy, all
          unclean, I am nothing else but sin; but if I am saved, it will be
          grace, grace, grace." Why, when you and I stood up, black, and foul,
          and filthy, and yet dared to believe in Christ, we said, "If we are
          saved, we shall be prodigies of divine mercy, and we will sing of his
          love for ever." Well but, my dear friends, you must all receive Jesus
          Christ in that very way. That which would raise an objection to the
          salvation of the big sinner is thrown back upon you, for Christ might
          well say, "Except ye receive these things as the chief of sinners, ye
          cannot enter the kingdom." I will prove my point by the instance of
          the apostle Paul. He has been held by some to be an exception to the
          rule, but Paul did not think so, for he says that God in him showed
          forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them that believe, and made
          him as it were a type of all conversions; so that instead of being an
          exception his was to be the rule. You see what I am driving at. The
          case of the children looks exceptional, but it is not; it has, on the
          contrary, all the features about it which must be found in every true
          conversion. It is of such that the kingdom of heaven is composed, and
          if we are not such we cannot enter it. Let this induce all of us who
          love the Lord, to pray for the conversion both of children and of all
          sorts of men. Let our compassion expand, let us shut out none from the
          plea of our heart; in prayer and in faith let us bring all who come
          under our range, hoping and believing that some of them will be found
          in the election of grace, that some of them will be washed in the
          Saviour's blood, and that some of them will shine as stars in the
          firmament of God for ever. Let us, on no consideration, believe that
          the salvation of any man or child is beyond the range of possibility,
          for the Lord saveth whom he wills. Let no difficulties which seem to
          surround the case hinder our efforts; let us, on the contrary, push
          with greater eagerness forward, believing that where there seems to be
          some special difficulty, there will be manifested, as in the
          children's case, some special privilege. O labour for souls, my dear
          friends! I beseech you live to win souls. This is the best rampart
          against error, a rampart built of living stones -- converted men and
          women. This is the way to push back the advances of Popery, by
          imploring the Lord to work conversions. I do not think that mere
          controversial preaching will do much, though it must be used; it is
          grace-work we want; it is bringing you to Christ, it is getting you to
          lay hold of him -- it is this which shall put the devil to a nonplus
          and expand the kingdom of Christ. O that my God would bring some of
          you to Jesus! If he is displeased with those who would keep you back,
          then see how willing he is to receive you. Is there in your soul any
          desire towards him? Come and welcome, sinner, come. Do you feel now
          that you must have Christ or die? Come and have him, he is to be had
          for the asking. Has the Lord taught you your need of Jesus? Ye thirsty
          ones, come and drink; ye hungry ones, come and eat. Yea, this is the
          proclamation of the gospel to-day, "The Spirit and the bride say,
          Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst
          come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." I do
          trust there may be encouragement in this to some of you. I pray my
          Master make you feel it. If he be angry with those who keep you back,
          then he must be willing to receive you, glad to receive you; and if
          you come to him he will in no wise cast you out. May the Lord add his
          blessing on these words for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
