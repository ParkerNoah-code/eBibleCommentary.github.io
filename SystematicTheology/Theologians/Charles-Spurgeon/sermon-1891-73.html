          1. It is within the power of all, therefore, in every Church, who may
          wish to see the truth, to contemplate clearly the tradition of the
          apostles manifested throughout the whole world; and we are in a
          position to reckon up those who were by the apostles instituted
          bishops in the Churches, and [to demonstrate] the succession of these
          men to our own times; those who neither taught nor knew of anything
          like what these [heretics] rave about. For if the apostles had known
          hidden mysteries, which they were in the habit of imparting to "the
          perfect" apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered
          them especially to those to whom they were also committing the
          Churches themselves. For they were desirous that these men should be
          very perfect and blameless in all things, whom also they were leaving
          behind as their successors, delivering up their own place of
          government to these men; which men, if they discharged their functions
          honestly, would be a great boon [to the Church], but if they should
          fall away, the direst calamity.

          2. Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this,
          to reckon up the successions of all the Churches, we do put to
          confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil
          self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion,
          assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating
          that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very great, the very
          ancient, and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome by
          the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing
          out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means
          of the successions of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity
          that every Church should agree with this Church, on account of its
          pre- eminent authority, that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as
          the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those
          [faithful men] who exist everywhere.

          3. The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church,
          committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of
          this Linus, Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy. To him
          succeeded Anacletus; and after him, in the third place from the
          apostles, Clement was allotted the bishopric. This man, as he had seen
          the blessed apostles, and had been conversant with them, might be said
          to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing [in his ears], and
          their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in this], for
          there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the
          apostles. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having
          occurred among the brethren at Corinth, the Church in Rome despatched
          a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace,
          renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition which it had lately
          received from the apostles, proclaiming the one God, omnipotent, the
          Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of man, who brought on the
          deluge, and called Abraham, who led the people from the land of Egypt,
          spake with Moses, set forth the law, sent the prophets, and who has
          prepared fire for the devil and his angels. From this document,
          whosoever chooses to do so, may learn that He, the Father of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, was preached by the Churches, and may also understand
          the apostolical tradition of the Church, since this Epistle is of
          older date than these men who are now propagating falsehood, and who
          conjure into existence another god beyond the Creator and the Maker of
          all existing things. To this Clement there succeeded Evaristus.
          Alexander followed Evaristus; then, sixth from the apostles, Sixtus
          was appointed; after him, Telesphorus, who was gloriously martyred;
          then Hyginus; after him, Pius; then after him, Anicetus. Soter having
          succeeded Anicetus, Eleutherius does now, in the twelfth place from
          the apostles, hold the inheritance of the episcopate. In this order,
          and by this succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the
          apostles, and the preaching of the truth, have come down to us. And
          this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying
          faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the apostles until
          now, and handed down in truth.

          4. But Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and
          conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in
          Asia, appointed bishop of the Church in Smyrna, whom I also saw in my
          early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a very long time, and, when a
          very old man, gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom, departed
          this life, having always taught the things which he had learned from
          the apostles, and which the Church has handed down, and which alone
          are true. To these things all the Asiatic Churches testify, as do also
          those men who have succeeded Polycarp down to the present time, -- a
          man who was of much greater weight, and a more stedfast witness of
          truth, than Valentinus, and Marcion, and the rest of the heretics. He
          it was who, coming to Rome in the time of Anicetus caused many to turn
          away from the aforesaid heretics to the Church of God, proclaiming
          that he had received this one and sole truth from the apostles, --
          that, namely, which is handed down by the Church. There are also those
          who heard from him that John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe
          at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed out of the
          bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, "Let us fly, lest even the
          bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is
          within." And Polycarp himself replied to Marcion, who met him on one
          occasion, and said, "Dost thou know me?" "I do know thee, the
          first-born of Satan." Such was the horror which the apostles and their
          disciples had against holding even verbal communication with any
          corrupters of the truth; as Paul also says, "A man that is an heretic,
          after the first and second admonition, reject; knowing that he that is
          such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself." There is
          also a very powerful Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians,
          from which those who choose to do so, and are anxious about their
          salvation, can learn the character of his faith, and the preaching of
          the truth. Then, again, the Church in Ephesus, founded by Paul, and
          having John remaining among them permanently until the times of
          Trajan, is a true witness of the tradition of the apostles.<br />
