          1. It is therefore in the highest degree irrational, that we should
          take no account of Him who is truly God, and who receives testimony
          from all, while we inquire whether there is above Him that [other
          being] who really has no existence, and has never been proclaimed by
          any one. For that nothing has been clearly spoken regarding Him, they
          themselves furnish testimony; for since they, with wretched success,
          transfer to that being who has been conceived of by them, those
          parables [of Scripture] which, whatever the form in which they have
          been spoken, are sought after [for this purpose], it is manifest that
          they now generate another [god], who was never previously sought
          after. For by the fact that they thus endeavour to explain ambiguous
          passages of Scripture (ambiguous, however, not as if referring to
          another god, but as regards the dispensations of [the true] God), they
          have constructed another god, weaving, as I said before, ropes of
          sand, and affixing a more important to a less important question. For
          no question can be solved by means of another which itself awaits
          solution; nor, in the opinion of those possessed of sense, can an
          ambiguity be explained by means of another ambiguity, or enigmas by
          means of another greater enigma, but things of such character receive
          their solution from those which are manifest, and consistent and
          clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But these [heretics], while striving to explain passages of
          Scripture and parables, bring forward another more important, and
          indeed impious question, to this effect, "Whether there be really
          another god above that God who was the Creator of the world?" They are
          not in the way of solving the questions [which they propose]; for how
          could they find means of doing so? But they append an important
          question to one of less consequence, and thus insert [in their
          speculations] a difficulty incapable of solution. For in order that
          they may know "knowledge" itself (yet not learning this fact, that the
          Lord, when thirty years old, came to the baptism of truth), they do
          impiously despise that God who was the Creator, and who sent Him for
          the salvation of men. And that they may be deemed capable of informing
          us whence is the substance of matter, while they believe not that God,
          according to His pleasure, in the exercise of His own will and power,
          formed all things (so that those things which now are should have an
          existence) out of what did not previously exist, they have collected
          [a multitude of] vain discourses. They thus truly reveal their
          infidelity; they do not believe in that which really exists, and they
          have fallen away into [the belief of] that which has, in fact, no
          existence.
        </p>

          3. For, when they tell us that all moist substance proceeded from the
          tears of Achamoth, all lucid substance from her smile, all solid
          substance from her sadness, all mobile substance from her terror, and
          that thus they have sublime knowledge on account of which they are
          superior to others, -- how can these things fail to be regarded as
          worthy of contempt, and truly ridiculous? They do not believe that God
          (being powerful, and rich in all resources) created matter itself,
          inasmuch as they know not how much a spiritual and divine essence can
          accomplish. But they do believe that their Mother, whom they style a
          female from a female, produced from her passions aforesaid the so vast
          material substance of creation. They inquire, too, whence the
          substance of creation was supplied to the Creator; but they do not
          inquire whence [were supplied] to their Mother (whom they call the
          Enthymesis and impulse of the Æon that went astray) so great an amount
          of tears, or perspiration, or sadness, or that which produced the
          remainder of matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. For, to attribute the substance of created things to the power and
          will of Him who is God of all, is worthy both of credit and
          acceptance. It is also agreeable [to reason], and there may be well
          said regarding such a belief, that "the things which are impossible
          with men are possible with God." While men, indeed, cannot make
          anything out of nothing, but only out of matter already existing, yet
          God is in this point pre-eminently superior to men, that He Himself
          called into being the substance of His creation, when previously it
          had no existence. But the assertion that matter was produced from the
          Enthymesis of an Æon going astray, and that the Æon [referred to] was
          far separated from her Enthymesis, and that, again, her passion and
          feeling, apart from herself, became matter -- is incredible,
          infatuated, impossible, and untenable.<br />
