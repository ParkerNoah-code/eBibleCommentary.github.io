        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.971)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, January 22nd, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David
          and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for<br />uncleanness.|
          -- Zechariah 13:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE DO NOT GRUDGE to the seed of Israel after the flesh the first
          application of this very precious promise. There will be a day when
          those who have so long refused to acknowledge Jesus as the Messias
          shall discern the marks of his mission, and shall mourn that they have
          pierced him. When the tribes of Israel shall lament their sin with
          holy earnestness, there shall be no mourning to exceed it, they shall
          weep even as in the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo,
          when the wellbeloved Josiah was slain. Discovering that their nation
          rejected the Son of God, when they crucified Jesus of Nazareth their
          deeply religious spirit shall be filled with the utmost bitterness of
          repentance, and each man and each woman shall cry for pardon to the
          Lord of mercy. Then, close upon the heels of the weeping shall come
          the full and complete forgiveness; the transgression of the tribes
          shall be put away in one day; they shall perceive that the very side
          which they pierced has yielded a fountain to cleanse them from their
          sin; joyfully shall they behold on Calvary the brazen serpent lifted
          up for their healing, the Paschal Lamb slain for their redemption, the
          sin-offering sacrificed in their stead. What a blessed day will that
          be when |all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come
          out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from
          Jacob.| O that you and I might live to see that happy era when all the
          Jewish race shall behold their Messiahs; for then shall the fullness
          of the Gentiles be gathered in. Our history is wrapped up with theirs.
          |Through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles. Now if the
          fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them
          the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?|
        </p>
        <p>|Wake, harp of Zion, wake again,</p>
        <p>Upon thine ancient hill,</p>
        <p>On Jordan's long deserted plain,</p>
        <p>By Kedron's lowly rill.</p>
        <p>The hymn shall yet in Zion swell</p>
        <p>That sounds Messiah's praise,</p>
        <p>And thy loved name, Immanuel!</p>
        <p>As once in ancient days.</p>
        <p>For Israel yet shall own her King,</p>
        <p>For her salvation waits,</p>
        <p>And hill and dale shall sweetly sing</p>
        <p>With praise in all her gates.|</p>
        <p>
          Having said thus much, however, we shall now take our text as
          belonging to ourselves in common with Israel, for in the gospel no
          promise is now set about with a hedge, and reserved for any race
          peculiarly; there is now |neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond
          nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
          Christ Jesus.| This promise is our joy at this hour. O that I might be
          able so to speak of it that many anxious hearts might now see its
          meaning and appropriate its blessedness!
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to explain the text we shall dwell upon three notes; if these
          three be clearly sounded we shall understand the passage -- a fountain
          -- opened -- still open.
        </p>
        <p>I. A FOUNTAIN.</p>
        <p>
          What is this fountain which is said to be opened, and when and how was
          it opened? It is a fountain opened to the house of David, and the
          inhabitants of, for sin and for uncleanness. We observe, therefore,
          that the blessing here spoken of deals with the greatest evils to
          which mankind is subject -- sin and uncleanness. We have all fallen;
          we have all proved our fall by our sinful practice. Sin has separated
          us from God and brought upon us the divine wrath; uncleanness, which
          is a tendency still to sin, a defilement of our nature, prevents our
          returning to our heavenly Father, and entering into renewed fellowship
          with aim. This great evil in its double form is, according to the
          text, distinctly recognized by God; it is not winked at, it is not
          treated as a trifle that may remain, and yet man may be beloved of God
          and be happy; no, but the evil being there, preparation is made for
          its removal. The text says, not that the filthiness is concealed, that
          the transgression is excused, but that there is a fountain opened for
          the effectual removal of sin and uncleanness. In the gospel God never
          trifles with human sin. We proclaim full, free, immediate forgiveness
          to the very chief of sinners, but it is not in a way which makes men
          think that sin is trivial in God's esteem, for there is coupled with
          the declaration of pardon a description of the way in which God by the
          sacrifice of his Son renders it possible for him to be merciful
          without being unjust. In the substitution of Christ Jesus we see
          justice and mercy peacefully embracing, and conferring double honor
          upon each other. I repeat the word, the uncleanness is not concealed,
          the sin is not winked at, but there is a fountain prepared for the
          purging away of the defilement, and it is opened to the house of
          David, for the great and mighty, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
          -- the poor, common people of every class. Hear this, ye who feel
          yourselves sinners, God has provided means for delivering you from
          your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text recalls to your notice the double nature of the evil of sin,
          and the character of the provision which meets the double evil. The
          fountain is opened for sin, that refers, no doubt, to the guilt of
          sin, to sin as offending God and deserving punishment. There is a
          fountain opened in the atonement, by which the offense rendered to
          God's honor and dignity is put away. What if we have sinned, yet the
          Lord has punished that sin in the person of his own Son, he has thus
          fulfilled his threatening, and proven the truth of his word. In Jesus
          Christ, therefore, the guilt of those for whom he was a substitute is
          put away consistently with the righteousness of the great Lawgiver.
          God is just and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. But
          this would not be enough; there is a second mischief, namely, that our
          nature has become unclean and consequently estranged from God. Through
          our natural corruption and the effect of our past sin, we are diseased
          morally and spiritually, our mind is in itself biassed towards evil
          and averse from good. God does not pardon sin and leave the sinner as
          he was in other respects, but wherever forgiveness of the guilt is
          bestowed a renewal of the nature is wrought; the fountain opened for
          pardon is also opened for purification. The washing which takes away
          the offense before heaven removes also the love of offending. Herein
          is double joy, for does not every true penitent feel that mere pardon
          would be a poor boon to him if it allowed him to continue in sin? My
          God, deliver me from sin itself, for this is the great burden of my
          soul. Oh, could I have the past forgiven, and yet live an enemy to my
          God, enslaved by evil and a stranger to holiness -- then were I still
          accursed! What if God ceases to punish wickedness, yet sin in itself
          is a curse; to love the wrong is the beginning of hell. Blessed be the
          Lord, when he opened the fountain to cleanse his sinful people, he
          made it |of sin the double cure,| that it might at the same time
          cleanse us from its guilt and power. For our double need there is,
          according to the text, one only supply; no mention is made of two
          fountains, neither are there two methods for the putting away of sin.
          But the one method is divine, God himself has devised, ordained, and
          prepared it. Wouldst thou have sin forgiven thee? Wash, for there is a
          fountain opened. Wouldst thou have sin eradicated from thy nature, and
          thy heart made pure? Wash, for heaven declares that the fountain is
          opened for this also. Imagine not that God has proposed an ineffectual
          means of purgation. His arrangements are never failures. Man may
          through his poverty provide a feast which is so bare as to mock the
          hunger of those invited; his starveling hospitality may be an insult
          to the greatness of human necessity; but it is never so with God. For
          his banquet of mercy oxen and fatlings are killed, milk and wine run
          in rivers, fat things full of marrow are heaped up; no stint is found
          at Jehovah's board. When God appoints a supply for any need, we may be
          assured that it is a real and sufficient provision. O penitent souls,
          rest assured that in Jesus' sacrifice there is an effectual provision
          for the forgiveness of sin, and an infallible means for the purging of
          your nature from its tendency to sin. God in the covenant of grace
          provides no seeming, superficial semblance, but in very deed he
          satisfies the longing soul O men and women, there is provided for your
          sin and your uncleanness that which exactly meets your need.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the verse before us this provision is inexhaustible.
          There is a fountain opened; not a cistern nor a reservoir, but a
          fountain. A fountain continues still to bubble up, and is as full
          after fifty years as at the first; and even so the provision and the
          mercy of God for the forgiveness and the justification of our souls
          continually flows and overflows. There is a supply so large that when
          thousands of the sons of Adam come they find that there is enough for
          their demands, and as new generations continue still to come all along
          the centuries, they shall find that the supply has not in any degree
          been diminished. For the sin of Adam and Abel the atonement was
          sufficient, but it shall be equally so for the last repenting sinner.
          David saw the cleansing flood, and washed away his crimson sins, but
          he left the fountain undefiled, and it is as effectual for you and for
          me as it was for him. For sinners in the last days the fountain is as
          full, as cleansing, and as free, as for sinners in the first ages of
          the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have testified to you that for the great necessity of men in
          this double form, there is a divinely appointed and inexhaustible
          supply, and it is intended for high and low, rich and poor, for the
          royal and the ragged, the prince and the pauper.
        </p>
        <p>
          When was this fountain opened? When was this divine and inexhaustible
          supply revealed to men? The answer may be given thus. The fountain was
          opened for sin and for uncleanness when the Lord Jesus died. God, the
          everlasting Word, was made flesh and dwelt among us, and in fullness
          of time the weight of human sin was laid on him. In order to put that
          sin away he must die, for death was the penalty for guilt; up to the
          cross he went through agonies unspeakable, and at the last he yielded
          up his soul; and when he did so sin was put away, and the fountain for
          the cleansing of sin was effectually opened. When the soldier with the
          spear pierced his side, and forthwith there came forth blood and
          water, then was it proven that this was he who came not with water
          only, but by water and by blood, a Savior who takes away the offense
          of sin as touching God, and the defilement of sin in human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the fountain may be said to be opened to each one of us
          when the gospel is preached to us. |In that day there shall be a
          fountain opened,| means secondarily, that whenever the gospel of Jesus
          Christ is fully and faithfully preached, then the cleansing efficacy
          of the atonement of Jesus which aforetime was as a sealed fountain, is
          opened to those who hear. And best of all, according to the connection
          of the text, this fountain is opened in the day when men repent of
          sin. Doth it not say that they shall mourn each family apart, and
          their wives apart, and in that day shall there be a fountain opened!
          The sinner does not find a Savior until he bewails his sin; when he
          sees his own filthiness then it is that the way to have that
          filthiness removed is made clear to him. God is always willing to
          forgive, but we are not always willing to be forgiven. The fountain is
          experimentally opened to each one of us when we spiritually discern
          it, believe in it, and are made partners of its cleansing power. Years
          ago a German prince who was entertained by the French Government, was
          taken to the galleys of Toulon, where a number of men were held as
          convicts on account of their crimes. The commandant decreed that in
          honor of the prince's visit, some prisoner whom he might choose should
          be set at liberty. The prince went round amongst the prisoners, and
          talked with them, they all knowing that he had the power to liberate
          some one of them. He found that according to their talk they were
          nearly all innocent, and had been condemned by mistake, or by flagrant
          injustice. He passed them all by, and spoke with one who talked in
          another style. He was guilty upon his own confession. |I certainly,|
          said he, |have no reason to complain of my hard work in the galleys,
          for if I had my due I should have been put to death for my crimes.| He
          went on to acknowledge with much humility the former evils of his
          life, and the justice of his sentence. The prince set him free, and
          said, |This is the only man in the whole of this place who is fit to
          be pardoned; he has a sense of his transgressions, he may be trusted
          in society.| So too, the pardoning mercy of God passes by those who
          say each one in their souls, |I am not guilty, I have not been more
          sinful than other people, I see nothing very remarkable in my case,
          and if I were sent to hell the sentence would be too severe.| Although
          there is a fountain for sin and uncleanness by Jesus Christ, it is not
          opened personally to your experience, you cannot see it, do not
          appreciate it, and will not participate in its benefits unless you
          know yourself to be a sinner; but if there be here one really guilty,
          one who feels his sin to be deserving the wrath of God, then this day
          I have authority from the Most High to say to him, there is a fountain
          opened for sin and uncleanness. You mourn your sin, you confess your
          guilt, you wish you could mourn it more, you feel yourself undeserving
          and unworthy -- then you are the man to whom the mercy of heaven is
          this day freely proclaimed. Jesus has come forth on purpose to bind up
          the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
          opening of the prison to them that are bound. The time for the actual
          opening of the cleansing fountain to us is the time when the heart
          confesses its guilt, and desires pardon of the Most High. Dear friend,
          has this time come to you? I pray you as you love your soul consider
          your ways, acknowledge your transgressions, and rest not till the
          blood of atonement has made you clear from guilt. Need the subject be
          pressed upon you? Surely your own reason should lead you to be anxious
          upon a matter so vital to your soul's eternal interests. How sad it
          will be if there be a fountain and yet you die unwashed! If there be a
          Savior, and you perish for ever, what wretchedness it will be!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. My chief business, this morning, is to sound forth the second note
          of my text -- it is a fountain OPEN.
        </p>
        <p>
          The means by which sin and sinfulness can be put away are at this
          moment accessible to the sons of men. The atonement is not a fountain
          hid and concealed, and closed and barred and bolted, it is a fountain
          open. The doctrine I have to teach is very simple and plain; there is
          no room here for oratory and elocution, and polished periods; it is
          the plainest gospel doctrine in the world, and yet I am very, very
          happy to have to speak it to you, for I do trust God may bless it to
          many, that they may find the pardon of their sin, and the removal of
          their uncleanness. I would sooner tell you the good news from heaven
          in broken accents than anything else with the tongue of an angel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fountain which God has provided is open at this day. Now what is
          meant by this? It means partly that the gospel is so preached that you
          can understand it; the gospel at this day is not concealed in Latin,
          as it was before the days of Luther, it is not wrapped up in types and
          shadows, as it was in the old dispensation; the gospel is preached in
          many places in this country as plainly as words could deliver it, so
          plainly that he that runs may read it. I will tell it to you again.
          God must punish sin, but he has laid the punishment on Christ, and
          whosoever believeth in Christ Jesus is forgiven. Why do not men accept
          the Savior? Why do they not come and trust him? for when they trust
          him they are saved at once. Ah! my hearers, if any of you do not wash
          from your uncleanness it is not because you do not know how; if our
          gospel be hid it is not our fault, it is hid to them that are lost, in
          whom the God of this world hath blinded their eyes. God is our
          witness, we have never sought after excellency of speech, nor the
          gaudiness or elegance of language, but as of simplicity, we have set
          before your souls this fact that Jesus Christ is the substitute for
          sinners, and that you must simply trust in him and you shall be saved.
          At your own peril be it if you reject the gospel; but if you do so, at
          least bear us this witness, that we have set forth Christ visibly
          crucified among you, not hanging up veils of human speculation of our
          own spinning, or curtains embroidered with curious devices of logic
          and theology, or of ceremony and ritual. We have cried aloud in plain
          words --
        </p>
        <p>|There is life in a look at the Crucified One.|</p>
        <p>
          We have bidden you look to Jesus, and have told you, in God's name,
          that as you look to the Crucified you shall find eternal life. Blessed
          are the people that know the joyful sound; more blessed still if they
          yield obedience thereto.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, it is meant that the provision made in Jesus is
          accessible to you all, and there is no barrier on account of
          uncircumcision or natural descent. When first Peter began to preach
          the gospel, if he had heard that there was a Gentile in the
          congregation I am afraid he would have put in a question as to whether
          a Gentile could be saved; it took some time to bring Peter's mind
          round to the belief that to the Gentiles also the gospel was to be
          preached. Paul seemed far more readily to imbibe that idea; but now to
          me, a Gentile preaching to you Gentiles, this difficulty does not
          arise, but how thankful we ought to be that it does not! |Is he the
          God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of
          the Gentiles also.| Our Lord Jesus, by his death, has rent the veil,
          and pulled down every wall of separation, so that the same Messiah who
          was sent to the seed of Abraham after the flesh is sent to us also who
          were sinners of the Gentiles, but who become of the seed of Abraham
          when we believe in Christ, for Abraham was the |father of the
          faithful.| The fountain is open then in the removal of the barrier
          which divided the natural Israel from the rest of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, at this day, when we read that the provision made for the
          removal of sin and sinfulness is open, we learn that it is personally
          approachable by us. Certain fanatics in our day will have it that
          grace comes to us through priests; there is the fountain, but you must
          not touch a drop of the purifying stream yourself; that venerable
          gentleman in white, or black, or blue, or scarlet, or violet, as the
          day of the month or the change of the moon may be, must stand at the
          fountain head and catch the water as it flows, and then after he has
          practiced upon it sundry manipulations you may drink from his hand,
          but you who are unordained must not go to the fountain for yourselves.
          Ah, my brethren, but we know better than to make gods of men, or
          saviours of sinners like ourselves. We dispense with priests, for we
          know that the fountain of salvation is open for us to come personally,
          and directly, and without any intervention. There is one Mediator
          between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, but no other mediator is
          there. One of our colporteurs, some years ago abroad, was selling his
          Testaments, when the cure of a parish said to him, |Your books say a
          very great deal about pardon, but I do not see much in them about
          confession.| The colporteur was about to reply, when a public notary,
          who was present, taking up the Testament, said to the priest, |Ah, my
          dear sir, what you say is very true, the New Testament does not say
          much about confession to priests; do you not remember that Jesus
          Christ saved the dying thief without the help of a priest, and that
          St. Stephen, when he was stoned was not shriven by a confessor, but
          entered glory without a priest!| |Ah,| said the cur, -- |but the rules
          of the church were very different in those days from what they are
          now.| Full surely they were! We will go back however to the primitive
          times, and as the dying thief said, |Lord, remember me,| so will we
          turn our eyes to that once crucified Savior, sitting in the highest
          heaven, and breathe the selfsame prayer, |Lord, remember me:| and as
          Stephen looked up directly into heaven, and found peace even amidst
          that stony shower, so on our dying bed, our glance shall be to the
          Christ in the open heaven; and we shall find rest in our last hours.
          Blessed be God, the doctrine of justification by faith is now so
          openly declared that priestcraft cannot hold us captives. The nations
          no longer need to crouch at the feet of shaveling impostors. Now that
          there is a fountain open, we can say, |Begone, ye priests, the whole
          herd of you, to whichever church ye belong; we who have believed are
          truly priests every one of us, and ye are mere pretenders. We have
          done with you; a plague and curse to humanity have ye been too long,
          and the gospel ends your detestable trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text yet further signifies that the fountain is not marred by any
          amount of sin which we have already committed. If there be a fountain
          opened on purpose to remove filth, that man must be insane who shall
          say that his need of washing is a barrier to prevent his using it.
          Shall I stand outside the bath and say, |I am prevented from bathing
          because I am filthy|? everyone detects at once my illogical talk. If
          the fountain is open for sin, then sin is a qualification for washing
          in it. If Christ be a Savior for sinners, then no man may say that on
          the ground of sin Jesus cannot be his Savior; rather might he say,
          |The more truly I am a sinner the more surely is Christ Jesus suited
          to me.| The exceeding heinousness of my sin, though I had been guilty
          of adultery, of murder, of crimes innumerable, cannot be a
          preventative to my being washed in the fount of atonement, because on
          account of my sin that fountain is provided, on purpose to put it away
          that cleansing flood was poured forth. Yet it ever is of the nature of
          sin, when the soul begins to know the bitterness of it, to make us
          fear that sin is a disqualification for mercy, and a reason why we
          should not believe in Christ Jesus the great propitiation for sin. O
          sinner, do not believe that sin unfits thee for a Savior, but believe
          that the Redeemer is come on purpose to save such as thou art. Some
          little time ago an earnest lady seeking the good of others, met with a
          poor girl some twenty years of age, who had most fearfully fallen and
          become a gross sinner, though still so young. She talked with her
          frequently, and at last saw in her tokens of repentance, but the poor
          girl's complaint was, |I can never be restored, I am so bad, nobody
          would ever take notice of me.| |Have you not a mother?| |No,| said the
          girl, |she died years ago.| |Have you not a father?| |Yes, but I have
          not heard of him for years.| |Does he know where you are?| |No, I do
          not want he should.| |Do not you think he would receive you back into
          his house?| |No, that I know he would not, I could not expect him to
          do so; if I were in his place I would not receive such a one as I am.|
          |Have you ever written to him since you have gone astray?| |No, I have
          kept out of the way of everybody that knew me; I do not want anybody
          to know what I am.| |Have you tried your father whether he will
          receive you?| |No, I knew it was no good, pray do not mention it.|
          |But,| said the good sister, |who can tell? I think I will try and see
          if your father will receive you now that you are truly penitent for
          the past.| |Oh, yes, I hate the sin, but my father would not receive
          me, it is of no use to ask him.| |Well,| said the visitor, |I will
          try;| and so she wrote a note to the father, giving him the daughter's
          address, telling him about her repentance, and entreating that she
          might be forgiven. What do you suppose was the reply? The next post
          brought the penitent girl a letter, on the envelope of which was
          written in large letters, |IMMEDIATE;| and when she opened it -- well,
          I cannot tell you all her father said, but it just came to this, |Come
          and welcome, I am ready to forgive you; I have been praying night and
          day that you might be restored to me.| Now, just what that father was
          to his poor lost girl, in tenderness and readiness to forgive, God is
          to sinners; if there be any unwillingness it is not on his part, it is
          all in their hearts, for the answer to every prayer for mercy is, God
          is ready, nay, he waiteth to be gracious, his heart yearneth over his
          erring ones. |How shall I give thee up?| saith he; |How shall I make
          thee as Adam how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned
          within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not return to
          destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man.| Our guilt therefore is no
          legitimate reason why we should not avail ourselves of the provisions
          of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither is there any effectual barrier in the consideration of our
          inward sinfulness. If you say, |I could not be a Christian, I have
          such a bad disposition, I could not become holy it is impossible.|
          This is true so far as you are concerned, but things impossible with
          men are possible with God. There is a fountain open for this very
          reason that this uncleanness of yours might be put away. Christ's
          blood will prove more than a match for the evil of your heart; his
          Spirit can renew you, make you a new creature, and from this day
          forward the things you hated you shall love, and the evil things you
          have delighted in shall become detestable to you. Is it not written,
          |Behold, I make all things new|?
        </p>
        <p>
          The fountain of cleansing is not sealed by any demands in the gospel
          requiring one to prepare yourself for it before you come. The fountain
          is open, and if you are filthy, you are welcome to come to it. All
          that is asked of you is that you believe in Jesus; this he gives you,
          it is his own work in you. You must also repent and hate the sin which
          you have committed; this also he works in you, causing you by his
          Spirit to loathe the sin which aforetime you delighted in. Had there
          been a sort of purgatorial preparation, had there been a kind of
          quarantine through which the sinner had to pass before he could be
          renewed and forgiven, then were not the fountain completely open; but
          between you, a sinner, and acceptation before God, there need not be
          even a step of delay; believe now, and by believing you shall obtain
          the perfect pardon and the renewal of your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is there any other real barrier to shut up the fountain from the
          sinner. Some will say, |Perhaps I am not elected.| My friend, read the
          text, the fountain is open; open for all ranks, |the house of David
          and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.| The doctrine of election, true as
          it is, does not make my text a falsehood, or close the fount of grace
          upon any seeking soul. Can you think of any other doctrine? Does any
          other truth discourage you? Whatever it is I need only quote the text
          in order to answer your suspicion: The fountain is open for sin and
          for uncleanness, who dares say it is shut? If any theologian should
          say so, methinks I would push him into the fountain to make way for
          the sinner to come. There cannot be anything in theology, nor in
          nature, nor in heaven, nor earth, nor hell, which can shut what God
          declares to be open. If thou wiliest to be saved, if thou comest to
          Christ believing in him, there is nothing to shut up the fountain of
          life or prevent thee from being cleansed and healed. If there be any
          shutting and forbidding it is thy heart that is closed, and thy pride
          which forbids. No difficulties remain save only difficulties of thine
          own creating, there is none with God. There is a fountain opened by
          him for sin and for uncleanness, and thou hast enough of both,
          therefore come with them even as thou art. |I believe in the
          forgiveness of sins;| dost thou? It is an old doctrine of the
          Christian church -- dost thou believe it? Methinks I hear thee say, |I
          believe in the forgiveness of everybody's sin but mine own.| Brother,
          I believe in the forgiveness of thy sins. There was a time when it
          would not have troubled me to believe for thee, but it troubled me to
          believe for myself; now, can I believe for myself and for thee also.
          If thou desires forgiveness, take it; if thou desires a new heart and
          a right spirit, Jesus will give them to thee; the fountain is open,
          and none shall dare to deny access to the anxious heart. Jesus says,
          |Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.| Would God that
          some were drawn of the Holy Spirit to come to-day and partake of the
          mercy which is so richly provided and so freely presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We have a rich consolation in the last point. The fountain is
          OPEN STILL.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text says the fountain is opened, and I do not upon the closest
          inspection discover that it declares that it was afterwards shut; I
          find no intimation that the opening was for an occasion only; on the
          contrary, the opening is left as a fact accomplished. What a blessing
          is this to every child of God here; the fountain is still open for sin
          and uncleanness! What a comfort it is to that young man who but lately
          believed. Some little time after conversion there usually comes a
          period of surprising discoveries. The heart has believed in Jesus and
          found rest, and it has deluded itself into the idea that it is now so
          clean delivered from sin that it will never fall into it any more; but
          on a sudden it is tempted, it is overtaken in a fault, and then the
          devil cries, |You! Why, you are not saved, you are not a believer, see
          where you are now.| Many remind me of a little girl who I trust was
          converted to God she in her simplicity quoted that sweet little hymn
          to her teacher, and said, |Teacher, I laid my sins on Jesus,' and now
          I love him so much that I never mean to do any more sins to lay on
          him.| That is just what we thought when we were first pardoned; we did
          not quite say so, but we thought so. |All the past? Yes, that is all
          on him; now for the love we bear his name we will never sin again.| So
          we thought; but, alas! we soon found that we were in the body still.
          When sin is seen to be still within us, how sweetly does the text ring
          out, like a silver bell, glad tidings of great joy -- there is a
          fountain opened! You went at first to Jesus, young believer, go again.
          The fountain is not shut; you have washed in it once, it is not closed
          nor dried up, wash again; the same Christ you wanted when you first
          believed is there now as ready and willing as ever. His blood is
          equally efficacious, go, thou surprised one, and wash again: --
        </p>
        <p>|This fountain from guilt not only makes pure,</p>
        <p>And gives, soon as felt, infallible cure;</p>
        <p>But if guilt removed return, and remain,</p>
        <p>Its power may be proved again and again.|</p>
        <p>
          It will happen as we grow older and make progress in the Christian
          life, that we shall discover every day some fresh degree of defilement
          acquired by our pilgrimage through a sinful world. Do you ever go to
          rest a single night without feeling that you have been in many places
          during the day, and that there is fresh dust upon the garment, new
          soil upon the feet? Ah! bethink thee every night there is a fountain
          opened. To-day's sins can be as easily put away as yesterday's sins;
          and to-day's sinfulness, which I feel unconquerable for the moment,
          can be conquered still. I can go to Christ again and say, |Let thy
          blood kill this sin of mine, and soften my heart into tenderness and
          holiness once more.| The fountain is still open, and no man can shut
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that you in business, coming into contact with the world, must
          sometimes encounter some very trying circumstances. When perhaps you
          thought all would be plain sailing you meet with terrible storms.
          Though minded to live in peace, you fall into a sort of wrestling
          match with ungodly men; you are obliged to stand up for your own, and
          you try to do so with moderation of temper, yet your spirit becomes
          ruffled; and you have to say afterwards, when undergoing
          self-examination, |I do not know that I did exactly what I ought to
          have done; besides, my quiet walk with Christ has been broken by this
          strife with the sons of men; woe is me that I dwell in Mesech and
          tabernacle in the tents of Kedar.| Beloved, there is a fountain open,
          go again by simple faith and look to Jesus once again and you will
          find fresh pardon, and the grace which restores the heart to its
          repose in Jesus. Your inner life will be again refreshed as you wash
          in the life-restoring fount prepared for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are at all like me you will at times feel your inner life to be
          sadly declining. I am ashamed to confess it, but even when I seek to
          live nearest to God, I feel an evil heart of unbelief struggling
          within me. There may come times when you will anxiously enquire, |Can
          I be a child of God at all? I cannot arouse my feelings towards God,
          my passions will not stir; even in holy duties I lack the living
          power; there is the wood, but where is the fire for the burnt
          offering? I would fain be zealous, earnest, intense, fervent, but I am
          sluggish, a very dolt in the Master's cause.| At such times we are apt
          to say, |I must try to make myself somewhat better than this by some
          means, before I dare again to hope in God;| and then we go off to our
          own selves and our own works, and we sink in the deep mire where there
          is no standing. It is a happy thing if at such moments we turn again
          to Christ, end say, |O my Master, unworthy as I am to be thy follower,
          though vilest of all those those names are written on thy roll, yet I
          do believe in thee still. To thy cross I will cling, I will never let
          go my hope, for thou hast come to save sinners even such as I am, and
          on thee I will continue to trust. |My dear brethren, you will find
          that while this restores your peace, it at the same time excites you
          to seek after higher degrees of holiness. It is the idea of the
          worldling that if sin be pardoned so easily men will live in it, but
          it is not so; to the spiritual mind the great love displayed in the
          pardon of sin is the very highest motive for overcoming every
          unhallowed propensity. A sense of blood-bought pardon seals the
          death-warrant of the most favored sin. Ever shall we find our safest
          mode of battling with sin to be a new resort to the cross. Happy is it
          for us that the blood cleanseth from all sin; that is, it continues to
          do so every day. I should die in despair if it were not for this
          truth, that there is a fountain open still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of us may have a long time to live possibly, but we shall never
          outlive that open fountain. Others may die soon, but, dear brother, in
          the last moment your eye may glance at the open fountain, and if the
          sins of all your life should rise before you, if in grim procession
          your transgressions should pass before your eyes each one accusing
          you, you may fly to the open fountain and they will disappear; and if
          the old Adam should rise even at the last, and some strong corruption
          should seek to prevail, there is the fountain open which will purge
          away the corruption of the flesh, and work in you the new nature yet
          more mightily, and preserve you to the Lord's eternal kingdom and
          glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I desire to close this sermon, all too poverty-stricken, with this
          thought. See here what our work is as a church. We have not to provide
          an atonement for the sinners round about us, but we have to point them
          to the fountain which is already opened. I want every one of you
          church members to be always telling others of the way of salvation.
          |It is so simple,| you say; well, then you have no excuse if you do
          not tell it. Make your neighbors know the way of salvation, din it
          into their ears, constrain them to know it, so that if they die it
          shall not be for want of knowing the way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to remind you as a church of one most important fact. Here is
          our preparation for the season of revival which I hope God is about to
          give us. The fountain open for the sinner is also open for the child
          of God. Let us all wash again. Have you grown cold? Come and get your
          spiritual life revived. Do any of you fear that you are becoming
          worldly and carnal? Come to Jesus, for where you first found life
          there you shall find it more abundantly. Come and wash again. I desire
          as your pastor to receive another baptism in the sacred atoning flood,
          and then to come and preach to you in its heavenly power. I pray God,
          that my dear brethren, the deacons and elders, may each one
          individually apart confess his sin, and apart receive the washing. And
          then I want every member, every Sunday-school teacher, and every
          worker, to prepare to serve God by receiving another of these blessed
          cleansings. In the old tabernacle there was a laver, and the priests
          washed their feet and their hands in it, which had to be filled up
          every now and then, because it was exhausted or foul; now we have not
          a brazen laver, but we have a fountain which never can be dried, and
          never becomes defiled. If you wash your feet in a little pool, the
          water is muddy directly, but if you wash in a running stream, as I
          have often done when climbing the Alps, or in a living fountain, you
          may wash, hundreds of you, and the water bears all defilement away and
          is just as bright as if it had never been touched by your feet. So
          there is here for all the church members a blessed flowing fountain;
          come and wash, I beseech you, even now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pray God backsliders may come hither, that those who have gone
          farther astray than in heart, and have wandered into outward actions
          of rebellion, may come to the fountain which is still open, and be
          cleansed anew. What sin it will be on our part if we neglect what God
          has provided! Though we have often come before, let us come again. I
          should like to suggest that this afternoon we each of us should spend
          a season alone, and pray for a renewed application of that blood which
          speaketh better things than that of Abel. The Master, after the last
          Supper, took a towel and girded himself, and went round with a basin
          and washed all his disciples' feet, and when he had done it said, |And
          ye are clean every whit.| That is what I want him to do to all the
          members of this my beloved church now. You cannot serve God while you
          are defiled; you need fresh cleansing for successful service. O may he
          take the towel now in his infinite condescension, and visit each one
          and wash you one by one. Pastors, deacons, elders, members, may we all
          avail ourselves of the open fountain at this hour. O that the Holy
          Spirit might give to each one of us that cleansing which shall make us
          fit for service, O that we shall be useful during the coming months in
          the ingathering of his poor lost ones, to his praise and glory. May
