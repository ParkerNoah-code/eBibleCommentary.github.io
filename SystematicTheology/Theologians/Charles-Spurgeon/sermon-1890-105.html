          Some of these heretics, forsooth, laid an information against Symeon
          the son of Clopas, as being of the family of David, and a Christian.
          And on these charges he suffered martyrdom when he was 120 years old,
          in the reign of Trajan Cæsar, when Atticus was consular legate in
          Syria. And it so happened, says the same writer, that, while inquiry
          was then being made for those belonging to the royal tribe of the
          Jews, the accusers themselves were convicted of belonging to it. With
          show of reason could it be said that Symeon was one of those who
          actually saw and heard the Lord, on the ground of his great age, and
          also because the Scripture of the Gospels makes mention of Mary the
          daughter of Clopas, who, as our narrative has shown already, was his
          father.
        </p>

          The same historian mentions others also, of the family of one of the
          reputed brothers of the Saviour, named Judas, as having survived until
          this same reign, after the testimony they bore for the faith of Christ
          in the time of Domitian, as already recorded.

          He writes as follows: They came, then, and took the presidency of
          every church, as witnesses for Christ, and as being of the kindred of
          the Lord. And, after profound peace had been established in every
          church, they remained down to the reign of Trajan Cæsar: that is,
          until the time when he who was sprung from an uncle of the Lord, the
          aforementioned Symeon son of Clopas, was informed against by the
          various heresies, and subjected to an accusation like the rest, and
          for the same cause, before the legate Atticus; and, while suffering
          outrage during many days, he bore testimony for Christ: so that all,
          including the legate himself, were astonished above measure that a man
          120 years old should have been able to endure such torments. He was
          finally condemned to be crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...Up to that period the Church had remained like a virgin pure and
          uncorrupted: for, if there were any persons who were disposed to
          tamper with the wholesome rule of the preaching of salvation, they
          still lurked in some dark place of concealment or other. But, when the
          sacred band of apostles had in various ways closed their lives, and
          that generation of men to whom it had been vouchsafed to listen to the
          Godlike Wisdom with their own ears had passed away, then did the
          confederacy of godless error take its rise through the treachery of
          false teachers, who, seeing that none of the apostles any longer
          survived, at length attempted with bare and uplifted head to oppose
          the preaching of the truth by preaching |knowledge falsely so
          called.|<br />
