        <p align="justify">
          The <i>delightful study of the Psalms </i>has yielded me boundless
          profit and ever-growing pleasure; common gratitude constrains me to
          communicate to others a portion of the benefit, with the prayer that
          it may induce them to search further for themselves. That I have
          nothing better of my own to offer upon this peerless book, is to me
          matter of deepest regret; that I have anything whatever to present, is
          subject for devout gratitude to the Lord of grace. I have done my
          best, but, conscious of many defects, I heartily wish I could have
          done far better.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Exposition here given is my own. I consulted a few authors before
          penning it, to aid me in interpretation and arouse my thoughts; but,
          still I can claim originality for my comments, at least so I honestly
          think. Whether they are better or worse for that, I know not; at least
          I know I have sought heavenly guidance while writing them, and
          therefore I look for a blessing on the printing of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The collection of quotations was an after-thought. In fact, matter
          grew upon me which I thought too good to throw away. It seemed to me
          that it might prove serviceable to others, if I reserved portions of
          my reading upon the various Psalms; those reserves soon acquired
          considerable bulk, so much so that even in this volume only
          <i>specimens </i> are given and not the bulk.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One thing the reader will please clearly to understand, and I beg him
          to bear it in mind; "I am far from endorsing all that I have quoted".
          I am neither responsible for the scholarship or orthodoxy of the
          writers. The names are given that each author may bear his own burden;
          and a variety of writers have been quoted that the thoughts of many
          minds might be before the reader. Still I trust nothing evil has been
          admitted — if it be so it is an oversight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The research expended on this volume would have occupied far too much
          of my time, had not my friend and amanuensis Mr. John L. Keys, most
          diligently aided me in investigations at the British Museum, Dr.
          William's Library, and other treasuries of theological lore. With his
          help I have ransacked books by the hundred, often without finding a
          memorable line as a reward, but at other times with the most
          satisfactory result. Readers little know how great labor the finding
          of but one pertinent extract may involve; labor certainly I have not
          spared — my earnest prayer is that some measure of good may come of it
          to my brethren in the ministry and to the church at large.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The <i>Hints to the Village Preacher </i>are very simple, and an
          apology is due to my ministerial readers for inserting them, but I
          humbly hope they may render assistance to those for whom alone they
          are designed, namely, lay preachers whose time is much occupied, and
          whose attainments are slender.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Should this first volume meet with the approbation of the judicious, I
          shall hope by God's grace to continue the work as rapidly as I can,
          consistently with the research demanded and my incessant pastoral
          duties. Another volume will follow in all probability in twelve
          months' time, if life is spared and strength is given.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may be added, that although the comments were the work of my health
          — the rest of the volume is the product of my sickness. When
          protracted illness and weakness laid me aside from daily preaching, I
          resorted to my pen as an available means of doing good. I would have
          preached had I been able, but as my Master denied me the privilege of
          thus serving him — I gladly availed myself of the other method of
          bearing testimony for his name. O that he may give me fruit in this
          field also, and his shall be all the praise.
