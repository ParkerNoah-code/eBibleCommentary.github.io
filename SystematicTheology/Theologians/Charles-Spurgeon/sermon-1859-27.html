        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.251)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 8th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"And I will put my Spirit within you." -- Ezekiel, 36:27.</p>
        <p>
          The miracles of Christ are remarkable for one fact, namely that they
          are none of them unnecessary. The pretended miracles of Mahomet, and
          of the church of Rome, even if they had been miracles, would have been
          pieces of folly. Suppose that Saint Denis had walked with his head in
          his hand after it had been cut off, what practical purpose would have
          been subserved thereby? He would certainly have been quite as well in
          his grave, for any practical good he would have conferred on men. The
          miracles of Christ were never unnecessary. They are not freaks of
          power; they are displays of power it is true, but they all of them
          have a practical end. The same thing may be said of the promises of
          God. We have not one promise in the Scripture which may be regarded as
          a mere freak of grace. As every miracle was necessary, absolutely
          necessary, so is every promise that is given in the Word of God. And
          hence from the text that is before us, may I draw, and I think very
          conclusively, the argument, that if God in his covenant made with his
          people has promised to put his Spirit within them, it must be
          absolutely necessary that this promise should have been made, and it
          must be absolutely necessary also to our salvation that every one of
          us should receive the Spirit of God. This shall be the subject of this
          morning's discourse. I shall not hope to make it very interesting,
          except to those who are anxiously longing to know the way of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start, then, by laying down this proposition -- that the work of
          the Holy Spirit is absolutely necessary to us, if we would be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In endeavoring to prove this, I would first of all make the remark
          that this is very manifest if we remember what man is by nature. Some
          say that man may of himself attain unto salvation -- that if he hear
          the Word, it is in his power to receive it, to believe it, and to have
          a saving change worked in him by it. To this we reply, you do not know
          what man is by nature, otherwise you would never have ventured upon
          such an assertion. Holy Scripture tells us that man by nature is dead
          in trespasses and sins. It does not say that he is sick, that he is
          faint, that he has grown callous, and hardened, and seared, but it
          says he is absolutely dead. Whatever that term "death" means in
          connection with the body, that it means in connection with man's soul,
          viewing it in its relation to spiritual things. When the body is dead
          it is powerless; it is unable to do any thing for itself; and when the
          soul of man is dead, in a spiritual sense, it must be, if there is any
          meaning in the figure, utterly and entirely powerless, and unable to
          do any thing of itself or for itself. When ye shall see dead men
          raising themselves from their graves, when ye shall see them unwinding
          their own sheets, opening their own coffin-lids, and walking down our
          streets alive and animate, as the result of their own power, then
          perhaps ye may believe that souls that are dead in sin may turn to
          God, may recreate their own natures, and may make themselves heirs of
          heaven, though before they were heirs of wrath. But mark, not till
          then. The drift of the gospel is, that man is dead in sin, and t at
          divine life is God's gift; and you must go contrary to the whole of
          that drift, before you can suppose a man brought to know and love
          Christ, apart from the work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit finds men
          as destitute of spiritual life as Ezekiel's dry bones; he brings bone
          to bone, and fits the skeleton together, and then he comes from the
          four winds and breathes into the slain, and they live, and stand upon
          their feet, an exceeding great army, and worship God. But apart from
          that, apart from the vivifying influence of the Spirit of God, men's
          souls must lie in the valley of dry bones, dead, and dead for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Scripture does not only tell us that man is dead in sin; it tells
          us something worse than this, namely, that he is utterly and entirely
          averse to every thing that is good and right. "The carnal mind is
          enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
          indeed can be." -- Romans 8:7. -- Turn you all Scripture through, and
          you find continually the will of man described as being contrary to
          the things of God. What said Christ in that text so often quoted by
          the Arminian to disprove the very doctrine which it clearly states?
          What did Christ say to those who imagined that men would come without
          divine influence? He said, first, "No man can come unto me except the
          Father which hath sent me draw him;" but he said something more strong
          -- "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." No man will
          come. Here lies the deadly mischief; not only that he is powerless to
          do good, but that he is powerful enough to do that which is wrong, and
          that his will is desperately set against every thing that is right.
          Go, Armenian, and tell your hearers that they will come if they
          please, but know that your Redeemer looks you in the face, and tells
          you that you are uttering a lie. Men will not come. They never will
          come of themselves. You cannot induce them to come; you cannot force
          them to come by all your thunders, nor can you entice them to come by
          all your invitations. They will not come unto Christ, that they may
          have life. Until the Spirit draw them, come they neither will, nor
          can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, then, from the fact that man's nature is hostile to the divine
          Spirit, that he hates grace, that he despises the way in which grace
          is brought to him, that it is contrary to his own proud nature to
          stoop to receive salvation by the deeds of another -- hence it is
          necessary that the Spirit of God should operate to change the will, to
          correct the bias of the heart, to set man in a right track, and then
          give him strength to run in it. Oh! if ye read man and understand him,
          ye cannot help being sound on the point of the necessity of the Holy
          Spirit's work. It has been well remarked by a great writer, that he
          never knew a man who held any great theological error, who did not
          also hold a doctrine which diminished the depravity of man. The
          Armenian says man is fallen, it is true, but then he has power of will
          left, and that will is free; he can raise himself. He diminishes the
          desperate character of the fall of man. On the other hand, the
          Antinomian says, man cannot do any thing, but that he is not at all
          responsible, and is not bound to do it, it is not his duty to believe,
          it is not his duty to repent. Thus, you see, he also diminishes the
          sinfulness of man; and has not right views of the fall. But once get
          the correct view, that man is utterly fallen, powerless, guilty,
          defiled, lost, condemned, and you must be sound on all points of the
          great gospel of Jesus Christ. Once believe man to be what Scripture
          says he is -- once believe his heart to be depraved, his affections
          perverted, his understanding darkened, his will perverse, and you must
          hold that if such a wretch as that be saved, it must e t e work of the
          Spirit of God, and of the Spirit of God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I have another proof ready to hand. Salvation must be the work of
          the Spirit in us, because the means used in salvation are of
          themselves inadequate for the accomplishment of the work. And what are
          the means of' salvation? Why, first and foremost stands the preaching
          of the Word of God. More men are brought to Christ by preaching than
          by any thing else; for it is God's chief and first instrument. This is
          the sword of the Spirit, quick and powerful, to the dividing asunder
          of the joints and marrow. "It pleaseth God by the foolishness of
          preaching to save them that believe." But what is there in preaching,
          by which souls are saved, that looks as if it would be the means of
          saving souls? I could point you to divers churches and chapels into
          which you might step, and say, "Here is a learned minister, indeed, a
          man who would instruct and enlighten the intellect;" you sit down, and
          you say, "Well, if God means to work a great work, he will use a
          learned man like this." But do you know any learned men that are made
          the means of bringing souls to Christ, to any great degree? Go round
          your churches, if you please, and look at them, and then answer the
          question. Do you know any great men -- men great in learning and
          wisdom -- who have become spiritual fathers in our Israel? Is it not a
          fact that stares us in the face, that our fashionable preachers, our
          eloquent preachers, our learned preachers, are just the most useless
          men in creation for the winning of souls to Christ. And where are
          souls born to God? Why, in the house around which the jeer and the
          scoff and the sneer of the world have long gathered. Sinners are
          converted under the man whose eloquence is rough and homely, and who
          has nothing to commend him to his fellows, who has daily to fall on
          his knees and confess his own folly, and when the world speaks worst
          of him, feels that he deserves it all, since he is nothing but an
          earthen vessel, in which God is pleased to put his heavenly treasure.
          I will dare to say it, that in every age of the world the most
          despised ministry has been the most useful; and I could find you at
          this day poor Primitive Methodist preachers who can scarce speak
          correct English, who have been the fathers of more souls, and have
          brought to Christ more than any one bishop on the bench. Why, the Lord
          hath been pleased always to make it so, that he will clothe with power
          the weak and the foolish, but he will not clothe with power those who,
          if good were done, might be led to ascribe the excellence of the power
          to their learning, their eloquence, or their position. Like the
          apostle Paul, it is every minister's business to glory in his
          infirmities. The world says, "Pshaw! upon your oratory; it is rough,
          and rude, and eccentric." Yet, tis even so, but we are content, for
          God blesses it. Then so much the better that it has infirmities in it;
          for now shall it be plainly seen that it is not of man or by man, but
          the work of God, and of God alone. It is said that once upon a time a
          man exceedingly curious desired to see the sword with which a mighty
          hero had fought some desperate battles; casting his eye along the
          blade, he said, "Well, I don't see much in this sword." "Nay," said
          the hero, "but you have not examined the arm that wields it." And so
          when men come to hear a successful minister, they are apt to say, "I
          do not see any thing in him." No, but you have not examined the
          eternal arm that reaps its harvest with this sword of the Spirit. If
          ye had looked at the jaw-bone of the ass in Samson's hand, you would
          have said, "What! heaps on heaps with this!" No; bring out some
          polished blade; bring forth the Damascus steel! NO; but God would have
          all the glory, and, therefore, not with the polished steel, but with
          the jaw-bone must Samson get the victory. So with ministers; God has
          usually blessed the weakest to do the most good. Well, now, does it
          not follow from this, that it must be the work of the Spirit? Because,
          if there be nothing in the instrument that can lead thereunto, is it
          not the work of the Spirit when the thing is accomplished? Let me just
          put it to you. Under the ministry dead souls are quickened, sinners
          are made to repent, the vilest of sinners are made holy, men who came
          determined not to believe are compelled to believe. Now, who does
          this? If you say the ministry does it, then I say farewell to your
          reason, because there is nothing in the successful ministry which
          would tend thereunto. It must be that the Spirit worketh in man
          through the ministry or else such deeds would never be accomplished.
          You might as well expect to raise the dead by whispering in their
          ears, as hope to save souls by preaching to them, if it were not for
          the agency of the Spirit. Melancthon went out to preach, you know,
          without the Spirit of the Lord, and he thought he should convert all
          the people, but he found out at last that old Adam was too strong for
          young Melancthon, and he had to go back and ask for the help of the
          Holy Spirit or ever he saw a soul saved. I say, that the fact that the
          ministry is blessed proves, since there is nothing in the ministry,
          that salvation must be the work of a higher power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other means, however, are made use of to bless men's souls. For
          instance, the two ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. They
          are both made a rich means of grace. But let me ask you, is there any
          thing in baptism that can possibly bless any body? Can immersion in
          water have the slightest tendency to be blessed to the soul? And then
          with regard to the eating of bread and the drinking of wine at the
          Lord's Supper, can it by any means be conceived by any rational man
          that there is any thing in the mere piece of bread that we eat, or in
          the wine that we drink? And yet, doubtless, the grace of God does go
          with both ordinances for the confirming of the faith of those who
          receive them, and even for the conversion of those who look upon the
          ceremony. There must be something, then, beyond the outward ceremony;
          there must, in fact, be the Spirit of God, witnessing through the
          water, witnessing through the wine, witnessing through the bread, or
          otherwise none of these things could be means of grace to our souls.
          They could not edify; they could not help us to commune with Christ;
          they could not tend to the conviction of sinners, or to the
          establishment of saints. There must, then, from these facts, be a
          higher, unseen, mysterious influence -- the influence of the divine
          Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Let me again remind you, in the third place, that the absolute
          necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit in the heart may be clearly
          seen from this fact, that all which has been done by God the Father,
          and all that has been done God the Son must be ineffectual to us,
          unless the Spirit shall reveal these things to our souls. We believe,
          in the first place, that God the Father elects his people; from before
          all worlds he chooses them to himself, but let me ask you -- what
          effect does the doctrine of election have upon any man until the
          Spirit of God enters into him? How do I know whether God has chosen me
          from before the foundation of the world? How can I possibly knows. Can
          I climb to heaven and read the roll? Is it possible for me to force my
          way through the thick mists which hide eternity, and open the seven
          seals of the book, and read my name recorded there? Ah! no; election
          is a dead letter both in my consciousness and in any effect which it
          can produce upon me, until the Spirit of God calls me out of darkness
          into marvelous light. And then, through my calling, I see my election,
          and, knowing myself to be called of God, I know myself to have been
          chosen of God from before the foundation of the world. It is a
          precious thing -- that doctrine of election -- to a child of God. But
          what makes it precious? Nothing but the influence of the Spirit. Until
          the Spirit opens the eye to read, until the Spirit imparts the mystic
          secret, no heart can know its election. No angel ever revealed to any
          man that he was chosen of God; but the Spirit doth it. He, by his
          divine workings bears an infallible witness with our spirits that we
          are born of God; and then we are enabled to "read our title clear to
          mansions in the skies."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, again, at the covenant of grace. We know that there was a
          covenant made with the Lord Jesus Christ by his Father from before all
          worlds, and that in this covenant the persons of all his people were
          given to him, and were secured; but of what use, or of what avail is
          the covenant to us, until the Holy Spirit brings the blessings of the
          covenant to us? The covenant is, as it were, a holy tree laden with
          fruit; if the Spirit doth not shake that tree, and make the fruit fall
          therefrom, until it comes to the level of our standing, how can we
          receive it? Bring hither any sinner and tell him there is a covenant
          of grace, what is he advantaged thereby? "Ah," says he, "I may not be
          included in it; my name may not be recorded there; I may not be chosen
          in Christ;" but let the Spirit of God dwell in his heart, richly by
          faith and love which is in Christ Jesus, and that man sees the
          covenant, ordered in all things and sure, and he cries with David, "It
          is all my salvation and all my desire."
        </p>
        <p>
          Take, again, the redemption of Christ. We know that Christ did stand
          in the room, place, and stead of all his people, and that all those
          who shall appear in heaven will appear there as an act of justice as
          well as of grace, seeing that Christ was punished in their room and
          stead, and that it would have been unjust if God punished them, seeing
          that he had punished Christ for them. We believe that Christ, having
          paid all their debts, they have a right to their freedom in Christ --
          that Christ having covered them with his righteousness, they are
          entitled to eternal life as much as if they had themselves been
          perfectly holy. But of what avail is this to me, until the Spirit
          takes of the things of Christ and shows them to me? What is Christ's
          blood to any of you until you have received the Spirit of grace? You
          have heard the minister preach about the blood of Christ a thousand
          times, but you passed by; it was nothing to you that Jesus should die.
          You know that he did atone for sins that were not his own; but you
          only regarded it as a tale, perhaps, even an idle tale. But when the
          Spirit of God led you to the cross, and opened your eyes, and enabled
          you to see Christ crucified, ah, then there was something in the blood
          indeed. When his hand dipped the hyssop in the blood, and when it
          applied that blood to, your spirit, then there was a joy and peace in
          believing, such as you had never known before. But ah, my hearer,
          Christ's dying is nothing to thee unless thou hast a living Spirit
          within thee. Christ brings thee no advantage, saving, personal, and
          lasting, unless the Spirit of God hath baptized thee in the fountain
          filled with his blood, and washed thee from head to foot therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only mention these few out of the many blessings of the covenant
          just to prove that they are, none of them, of any use to us, unless
          the Holy Spirit gives them to us. There hang the blessings on the nail
          -- on the nail, Christ Jesus; but we are short of stature; we cannot
          reach them; the Spirit of God takes them down and gives them to us,
          and there they are; they are ours. It is like the manna in the skies,
          far out of mortal reach; but the Spirit of God opens the windows of
          heaven, brings down the bread, and puts it to our lips, and enables us
          to eat. Christ's blood and righteousness are like wine stored in the
          wine-vat; but we cannot get thereat. The Holy Spirit dips our vessel
          into this precious wine, and then we drink; but without the Spirit we
          must die and perish just as much, though the Father elect and the Son
          redeem, as though the Father never had elected, and though the Son had
          never bought us with his blood. The Spirit is absolutely necessary.
          Without him neither the works of the Father, nor of the Son, are of
          any avail to us.
        </p>

          4. This brings us to another point. The experience of the true
          Christian is a reality; but it never can be known and felt without the
          Spirit of God. For what is the experience of the Christian? Let me
          just give a brief picture of some of its scenes. There is a person
          come into this hall this morning -- one of the most reputable men in
          London. He has never committed himself in any outward vice; he has
          never been dishonest; but he is known as a staunch, upright tradesman.
          Now, to his astonishment, he is informed that he is a condemned, lost
          sinner, and just as surely lost as the thief who died for his crimes
          upon the cross. Do you think that man will believe it? Suppose,
          however, that he does believe it, simply because he reads it in the
          Bible, do you think that man will ever be made to feel it? I know you
          say, "Impossible!" Some of you, even now, perhaps, are saying, "Well,
          I never should!" Can you imagine that honorable, upright tradesman,
          saying, "God be merciful to me, a sinner?" -- standing side by side
          with the harlot and the swearer, and feeling in his own heart as if he
          had been as guilty as they were, and using just the same prayer and
          saying, "Lord, save, or I perish." You cannot conceive it, can you? It
          is contrary to nature that a man who has been so good as he should pat
          himself down among the chief of sinners. Ah! but that will be done
          before he will be saved; he must feel that before he can enter heaven.
          Now, I ask, who can bring him to such a leveling experience as that,
          but the Spirit of God? Ye know very well proud nature will not stoop
          to it. We are all aristocrats in our own righteousness; we do not like
          to bend down and come among common sinners. If we are brought there,
          it must be the Spirit of God who casts us to the ground. Why, I know
          if any one had told me that I should ever cry to God for mercy, and
          confess that I had been the vilest of the vile, I should have laughed
          in their face; I should have said, "Why I have not done anything
          particularly wrong; I have not hurt anybody." And yet I know this very
          day I can take my place upon the lowest form, and if I can get inside
          heaven I shall feel happy to sit among the chief of sinners, and
          praise that Almighty love which has saved even me from my sins.. Now,
          what works this humiliation of heart? Grace. It is contrary to nature
          for an honest and an upright man in the eye of the world to feel
          himself a lost sinner. It must be the Holy Spirit's work, or else it
          never will be done. Well, after a man has been brought here, can you
          conceive that man at last conscience-stricken, and led to believe that
          his past life deserves the wrath of God? His first thought would be,
          "Well, now, I will live better than I ever have lived." He would say,
          "Now, I will try and play the hermit, and pinch myself here and there,
          and deny myself, and do penance; and in that way, by paying attention
          to the outward ceremonies of religion, together with a high moral
          character, I doubt not I shall blot out whatever slurs and stains
          there have been." Can you suppose that man brought at last to feel
          that, if ever he gets to heaven, he will have to get there through the
          righteousness of another? "Through the righteousness of another?" says
          he, "I don't want to be rewarded for what another man does, -- not I.
          If I go there, I will go there and take my chance; I will go there
          through what I do myself. Tell me something to do, and I will do it; I
          will be proud to do it, however humiliating it may be, so that I may
          at last win the love and esteem of God." Now, can you conceive such a
          man as that brought to feel that he can do nothing? -- that, good man
          as he thinks himself, he cannot do any thing whatever to merit God's
          love and favor; and that, if he goes to heaven, he must go through
          what Christ did? Just the same as the drunkard must go there through
          the merits of Christ, so this moral man must enter into life, having
          nothing about him but Christ's perfect righteousness, and being washed
          in the blood of Jesus. We say that this is so contrary to human
          nature, so diametrically opposed to all the instincts of our poor
          fallen humanity, that nothing but the Spirit of God can ever bring a
          man to strip himself of all self-righteousness, and of all creature
          strength, and compel him to rest and lean simply and wholly upon Jesus
          Christ the Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two experiences would be sufficient to prove the necessity of
          the Holy Spirit to make a man a Christian. But let me now describe a
          Christian as he is after his conversion. Trouble comes, storms of
          trouble, and he looks the tempest in the face and says, "I know that
          all things work together for my good." His children die, the partner
          of his bosom is carried to the grave; he says, "The Lord gave and the
          Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord." His farm
          fails, his crop is blighted; his business prospects are clouded, all
          seem to go, and he is left in poverty: he says, "Although the fig tree
          shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of
          the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat; the flocks
          shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the
          stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
          salvation." You see him next laid upon a sick bed himself, and when he
          is there, he says, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, for
          before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I kept thy Word."
          You see him approaching at last the dark valley of the shadow of
          death, and you hear him cry, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of
          the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; thy rod and thy staff they
          comfort me, and thou thyself art with me." Now, I ask you, what makes
          this man calm in the midst of all these varied trials, and personal
          troubles, if it be not the Spirit of God? O, ye that doubt the
          influence of the Spirit, produce the like without him, go ye and die
          as Christians die, and live as they live, and if you can show the same
          calm resignation, the same quiet joy, and the same firm belief that
          adverse things shall, nevertheless, work together for good, then we
          may be, perhaps, at liberty to resign the point, and not till then.
          The high and noble experience of a Christian in times of trial and
          suffering, proves that there must be the operation of the Spirit of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But look at the Christian, too, in his joyous moments. He is rich. God
          has given him all his heart's desire on earth. Look at him: he says,
          "I do not value these things at all, except as they are the gift of
          God; I sit loose by them all and, notwithstanding this house and home,
          and all these comforts, I am willing to depart and be with Christ,
          which is far better.' It is true, I want nothing here on earth; but
          still I feel that to die would be gain to me, even though I left all
          these." He holds earth loosely; he does not grasp it with a tight
          hand, but looks upon it all as dust, -- a thing which is to pass away.
          He takes but little pleasure therein, saying, --
        </p>
        <p>"I've no abiding city here,</p>
        <p>I seek a city out of sight."</p>
        <p>
          Mark that man; he has plenty of room for pleasures in this world, but
          he drinks out of a higher cistern. His pleasure springs from things
          unseen; his happiest moments are when he can shut all these good
          things out, and when he can come to God as a poor guilty sinner, and
          come to Christ and enter into fellowship with him, and rise into
          nearness of access and confidence, and boldly approach to the throne
          of the heavenly grace. Now, what is it that keeps a man who has all
          these mercies from setting his heart upon the earth? This is a wonder,
          indeed, that a man who has gold and silver, and flocks and herds,
          should not make these his god, but that he should still say, --
        </p>
        <p>"There's nothing round this spacious earth</p>
        <p>That suits my large desire;</p>
        <p>To boundless joy and solid mirth</p>
        <p>My nobler thoughts aspire."</p>
        <p>
          These are not my treasure; my treasure is in heaven, and in heaven
          only. What can do this? No mere moral virtue. No doctrine of the Stoic
          ever brought a man to such a pass as. that. No, it must be the work of
          the Spirit, and the work of the Spirit alone, that can lead a man to
          live in heaven, while there is a temptation to him to live on earth. I
          do not wonder that a poor man looks forward to heaven; he has nothing
          to look upon on earth. When there is a thorn in the nest, I do not
          wonder that the lark flies up, for there is no rest for him below.
          When you are beaten and chafed by trouble, no wonder you say, --
        </p>
        <p>"Jerusalem! my happy home!</p>
        <p>Name ever dear to me;</p>
        <p>When shall my labors have an end,</p>
        <p>In joy, and peace, and thee?"</p>
        <p>
          But the greatest wonder is, if you line the Christian's nest never so
          softly, if you give him all the mercies of this life, you still cannot
          keep him from saying, --
        </p>
        <p>"To Jesus, the crown of my hope,</p>
        <p>My soul is in haste to be gone;</p>
        <p>Oh bear me, ye cherubim, up,</p>
        <p>And waft me away to his throne."</p>
        <p>
          5. And now, last of all, the acts, the acceptable acts, of the
          Christian's life, cannot be performed without the Spirit; and hence,
          again, the necessity for the Spirit of God. The first act of the
          Christian's life is repentance. Have you ever tried to repent? If so,
          if you tried without the Spirit of God you know that to urge a man to
          repent without the promise of the Spirit to help him, is to urge him
          to do an impossibility. A rock might as soon weep, and a desert might
          as soon blossom, as a sinner repent of his own accord. If God should
          offer heaven to man, simply upon the terms of repentance of sin,
          heaven would be as impossible as it is by good works; for a man can no
          more repent of himself, than he can perfectly keep God's law; for
          repentance involves the very principle of perfect obedience to the law
          of God. It seems to me that in repentance there is the whole law
          solidified and condensed; and if a man can repent of himself then
          there is no need of a Saviour, he may as well go to heaven up the
          steep sides of Sinai at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith is the next act in the divine life. Perhaps you think faith very
          easy; but if you are ever brought to feel the burden of sin you would
          not find it quite so light a labor. If you are ever brought into deep
          mire, where there is no standing, it is not so easy to put your feet
          on a rock, when the rock does not seem to be there. I find faith just
          the easiest thing in the world when there is nothing to believe; but
          when I have room and exercise for my faith, then I do not find I have
          so much strength to accomplish it. Talking one day with a countryman,
          he used this figure: "In the middle of winter I sometimes think how
          well I could mow; and in early spring I think, oh! how I would like to
          reap; I feel just ready for it; but when mowing time comes, and when
          reaping time comes, I find I have not strength to spare." So when you
          have no troubles, couldn't you mow them down at once? When you have no
          work to do, couldn't you do it? But when work and trouble come you
          find how difficult it is. Many Christians are like the stag, who
          talked to itself, and said, "Why should I run away from the dogs? Look
          what a fine pair of horns I've got, and look what heels I've got too;
          I might do these hounds some mischief. Why not let me stand and show
          them what I can do with my antlers? I can keep off any quantity of
          dogs." No sooner did the dogs bark, than off the stag went. So with
          us. "Let sin arise," we say, "we will soon rip it up, and destroy it;
          let trouble come, we will soon get over it; but when sin and trouble
          come, we then find what our weakness is. Then we have to cry for the
          help of the Spirit; and through him we can do all things, though
          without him we can do nothing at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all the acts of the Christian's life, whether it be the act of
          consecrating one's self to Christ, or the act of daily prayer, or the
          act of constant submission, or preaching the gospel, or ministering to
          the necessities of the poor, or comforting the desponding, in all
          these the Christian finds his weakness and his powerlessness, unless.
          he is clothed about with the Spirit of God. Why, I have been to see
          the sick at times, and I have thought how I would like to comfort
          them; and I could not get a word out that was worth their hearing, or
          worth my saying; and my soul has been in agony to be the means of
          comforting the poor, sick, desponding brother; but I could do nothing,
          and I came out of the chamber, and half wished I had never been to see
          a sick person in my life: I had so learned my own folly. So has it
          been full often in preaching. You get a sermon up, study it, and come
          and make the greatest mess of it that can possibly be. Then you say,
          "I wish I had never preached at all." But all this is to show us, that
          neither in comforting nor in preaching can one do any thing right,
          unless the Spirit work in us to will and to do of his own good
          pleasure. Every thing, moreover, that we do with out the Spirit is
          unacceptable to God; and whatever we do under his influence, however
          we may despise it, is not despised of God, for he never despises his
          own work, and the Spirit never can look upon what he works. in us with
          any other view than that of complacency and delight. If the Spirit
          helps me to groan, then God must accept the groaner. If thou couldst
          pray the best prayer in the world, without the Spirit, God would have
          nothing to do with it; but if thy prayer be broken, and lame, and
          limping, if the Spirit made it, God will look upon it, and say, as he
          did upon the works of creation, "It is very good;" and he will accept
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let me conclude by asking this question. My hearer, then have
          you the Spirit of God in you? You have some religion, most of you, I
          dare say. Well, of what kind is it? Is it a homemade article? Did you
          make yourself what you are? Then, if so, you are a lost man up to this
          moment. If, my hearer, you have gone no further than you have walked
          yourself, you are not on the road to heaven yet; you have got your
          face turned the wrong way; but if you have received something which
          neither flesh nor blood could reveal to you, if you have been led to
          do the very thing which you once hated, and to love that thing which
          you once despised, and to despise that on which your heart and your
          pride were once set, then, soul, if this be the Spirit's work,
          rejoice; for where he hath begun the good work he will carry it on.
          And you may know whether it is the Spirit's work by this. Have you
          been led to Christ, and away from self: Have you been led away from
          all feelings, from all doings, from all willings, from all prayings,
          as the ground of your trust and your hope, and have you been brought
          nakedly to rely upon the finished work of Christ? If so, this is more
          than human nature ever taught any man; this is a height to which human
          nature never climbed. The Spirit of God has done that, and he will
          never leave what he has once begun, but thou shalt go from strength to
          strength, and thou shalt stand among the bloodwashed throng, at last
          complete in Christ, and accepted in the beloved. But if you have not
          the Spirit of Christ, you are none of his. May the Spirit lead you to
          your chamber now to weep, now to repent, and now to look to Christ,
          and may you now have a divine life implanted, which neither time nor
          eternity shall be able to destroy. God, hear this prayer, and send us
          away with a blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
