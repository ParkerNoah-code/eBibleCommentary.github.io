          1. Inasmuch, then, as in this world (aioni) some persons betake
          themselves to the light, and by faith unite themselves with God, but
          others shun the light, and separate themselves from God, the Word of
          God comes preparing a fit habitation for both. For those indeed who
          are in the light, that they may derive enjoyment from it, and from the
          good things contained in it; but for those in darkness, that they may
          partake in its calamities. And on this account He says, that those
          upon the right hand are called into the kingdom of heaven, but that
          those on the left He will send into eternal fire for they have
          deprived themselves of all good.

          2. And for this reason the apostle says: "Because they received not
          the love of God, that they might be saved, therefore God shall also
          send them the operation of error, that they may believe a lie, that
          they all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but consented
          to unrighteousness." For when he (Antichrist) is come, and of his own
          accord concentrates in his own person the apostasy, and accomplishes
          whatever he shall do according to his own will and choice, sitting
          also in the temple of God, so that his dupes may adore him as the
          Christ; wherefore also shall he deservedly "be cast into the lake of
          fire:" [this will happen according to divine appointment], God by His
          prescience foreseeing all this, and at the proper time sending such a
          man, "that they may believe a lie, that they all may be judged who did
          not believe the truth, but consented to unrighteousness;" whose coming
          John has thus described in the Apocalypse: "And the beast which I had
          seen was like unto a leopard, and his feet as of a bear, and his mouth
          as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon conferred his own power upon
          him, and his throne, and great might. And one of his heads was as it
          were slain unto death; and his deadly wound was healed, and all the
          world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon because
          he gave power to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who
          is like unto this beast, and who is able to make war with him? And
          there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemy
          and power was given to him during forty and two months. And he opened
          his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name and His
          tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. And power was given him
          over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation. And all who
          dwell upon the earth worshipped him, [every one] whose name was not
          written in the book of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
          world. If any one have ears, let him hear. If any one shall lead into
          captivity, he shall go into captivity. If any shall slay with the
          sword, he must be slain with the sword. Here is the endurance and the
          faith of the saints." After this he likewise describes his
          armour-bearer, whom he also terms a false prophet: "He spake as a
          dragon, and exercised all the power of the first beast in his sight,
          and caused the earth, and those that dwell therein, to adore the first
          beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he shall perform great
          wonders, so that he can even cause fire to descend from heaven upon
          the earth in the sight of men, and he shall lead the inhabitants of
          the earth astray." Let no one imagine that he performs these wonders
          by divine power, but by the working of magic. And we must not be
          surprised if, since the demons and apostate spirits are at his
          service, he through their means performs wonders, by which he leads
          the inhabitants of the earth astray. John says further: "And he shall
          order an image of the beast to be made, and he shall give breath to
          the image, so that the image shall speak; and he shall cause those to
          be slain who will not adore it." He says also: "And he will cause a
          mark [to be put] in the forehead and in the right hand, that no one
          may be able to buy or sell, unless he who has the mark of the name of
          the beast or the number of his name; and the number is six hundred and
          sixty-six," that is, six times a hundred, six times ten, and six
          units. [He gives this] as a summing up of the whole of that apostasy
          which has taken place during six thousand years.

          3. For in as many days as this world was made, in so many thousand
          years shall it be concluded. And for this reason the Scripture says:
          "Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and all their adornment.
          And God brought to a conclusion upon the sixth day the works that He
          had made; and God rested upon the seventh day from all His works."
          This is an account of the things formerly created, as also it is a
          prophecy of what is to come. For the day of the Lord is as a thousand
          years; and in six days created things were completed: it is evident,
          therefore, that they will come to an end at the sixth thousand year.

          4. And therefore throughout all time, man, having been moulded at the
          beginning by the hands of God, that is, of the Son and of the Spirit,
          is made after the image and likeness of God: the chaff, indeed, which
          is the apostasy, being cast away; but the wheat, that is, those who
          bring forth fruit to God in faith, being gathered into the barn. And
          for this cause tribulation is necessary for those who are saved, that
          having been after a manner broken up, and rendered fine, and sprinkled
          over by the patience of the Word of God, and set on fire [for
          purification], they may be fitted for the royal banquet. As a certain
          man of ours said, when he was condemned to the wild beasts because of
          his testimony with respect to God: "I am the wheat of Christ, and am
          ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure
          bread of God." <br />
