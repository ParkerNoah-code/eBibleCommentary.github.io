        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3281)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, December 21st, 1911,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>
          NOTE: This is taken from an early published edition of the original
          sermon. The version that appears in The Metropolitan Tabernacle
          Pulpit, vol.57, was edited and slightly abbreviated. For edition we
          have restored the fuller text of the earlier published edition, while
          retaining a few of the editorial refinements of the Met Tab edition.

        <p>|The broad wall.| -- Nehemiah 3:8.</p>
        <p>
          IT SEEMS that around Jerusalem of old, in the time of her splendor,
          there was a broad wall, which was her defence and her glory. Jerusalem
          is a type of the Church of God. It is always well when we can see
          clearly, distinctly, and plainly, that around the Church to which we
          belong there runs a broad wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea of a broad wall around the Church suggests three things:
          separation, security, and enjoyment. Let us examine each of these in
          its turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, the SEPARATION of the people of God from the world is like
          that broad wall surrounding the holy city of Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a man becomes a Christian he is still in the world, but he is no
          longer to be of it. He was an heir of wrath, but he has now become a
          child of grace. Being of a distinct nature, he is required to separate
          himself from the rest of mankind, as the Lord Jesus Christ did, who
          was |holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.| The Lord's
          Church was separated in his eternal purpose. It was separated in his
          covenant and decree. It was separated in the atonement, for even there
          we find that our Lord is called |the saviour of all men, especially of
          them that believe.| An actual separation is made by grace, is carried
          on in the work of sanctification, and will be completed in that day
          when the heavens shall be on fire, and the saints shall be caught up
          together with the Lord in the air; and in that last tremendous day, he
          shall divide the nations as a shepherd divides the sheep from the
          goats, and then there shall be a great gulf fixed, across which the
          ungodly cannot go to the righteous, neither shall the righteous
          approach the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practically, my business is to say to those of you who profess to be
          the Lord's people, take care that you maintain a broad wall of
          separation between yourselves and the world. I do not say that you are
          to adopt any peculiarity of dress, or to take up some singular style
          of speech. Such affectation gendereth, sooner or later, hypocrisy. A
          man be as thoroughly worldly in one coat as in another, he may be
          quite as vain and conceited with one style of speech as with another;
          nay, he may be even more of the world when he pretends to be separate,
          than if he had left the pretence of separation alone. The separation
          which we plead for is moral and spiritual. Its foundation is laid deep
          in the heart, and its substantial reality is very palpable in the
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Christian, it seems to me, should be more scrupulous than other
          men in his dealings. He must never swerve from the path of integrity.
          He should never say, |It is the custom: it is perfectly understood in
          the trade.| Let the Christian remember that custom cannot sanction
          wrong, and that its being |understood| is no apology for
          misrepresentation. A lie |understood| is not therefore true. While the
          golden rule is more admired than practiced by ordinary men, the
          Christian should always do unto others as he would that they should do
          unto him. He should be one whose word is his bond, and who, having
          once pledged his word, sweareth to his own hurt, but changeth not.
          There ought to be an essential difference between the Christian and
          the best moralist, by reason of the higher standard which the gospel
          inculcates, and the Saviour has exemplified. Certainly, the highest
          point to which the best unconverted man can go might well be looked
          upon as a level below which the converted man will never venture to
          descend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Christian should especially be distinguished by his
          pleasures, for it is here, usually, that the man comes out in his true
          colors. We are not quite ourselves, perhaps, in our daily toil, where
          our pursuits are rather dictated by necessity than by choice. We are
          not alone; the society we are thrown into imposes restraints upon us;
          we have to put the bit and the bridle upon ourselves. The true man
          does not then show himself; but when the day's work is done, then the
          |birds of a feather flock together.| It is with the multitude of
          traders and commercial men as it was with those saints of old, of
          whom, when they were liberated from prison, it was said, |Being let
          go, they went unto their own company.| So will your pleasures and
          pastimes give evidence of what your heart is, and where it is. If you
          can find pleasure in sin, then in sin you choose to live, and unless
          grace prevent, in sin you will not fail to perish. But if your
          pleasures are of a nobler kind, and your companions of a devouter
          character; if you seek spiritual enjoyments, if you find your happiest
          moments in worship, in communion, in silent prayer, or in the public
          assembling of yourselves with the people of God, then your higher
          instincts become proof of your purer character, and you will be
          distinguished in your pleasures by a broad wall which effectually
          separates you from the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such separation should be carried, I think, into everything which
          affects the Christian. |What have they seen in thy house?| was the
          question asked of Hezekiah. When a stranger comes into our house it
          should be so ordered that he can clearly perceive that the Lord is
          there. A man ought scarcely to tarry a night beneath our roof, without
          gathering that we have a respect unto him that is invisible, and that
          we desire to live and move in the light of God's countenance. I have
          already said that I would not have you cultivate singularities for
          singularity's sake; yet, as the most of men are satisfied if they do
          as other people do, you must never be satisfied until you do more and
          better than other people, having found out a mode and course of life
          as far transcending the ordinary worldling's life, as the path of the
          eagle in the air is above that of the mole which burrows under the
          soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          This broad wall between the godly and the ungodly should be most
          conspicuous in the spirit of our mind. The ungodly man has only this
          world to live for; do not wonder if he lives very earnestly for it. He
          has no other treasure; why should he not get as much as he can of
          this? But you, Christian, profess to have immortal life, therefore,
          your treasure is not to be amassed in this brief span of existence.
          Your treasure is laid up in heaven and available for eternity. Your
          best hopes overleap the narrow bounds of time, and fly beyond the
          grave; your spirit must not, therefore, be earth-bound and grovelling,
          but soaring and heavenly. There should be about you always the air of
          one who has his shoes on his feet, his loins girded, and his staff in
          his hand -- away, away, away to a better land. You are not to talk of
          this world as though it were to last for ever. You are not to hoard it
          and treasure it up, as though you had set your heart upon it, but you
          are to be on the wing as though you had not a nest here, and never
          could have, but expected to find your resting-place among the cedars
          of God, in the hill- tops of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depend upon it, the more unworldly a Christian is the better it is for
          him. Methinks I could mention several reasons why this wall should be
          very broad. If you are sincere in your profession, there is a very
          broad distinction between you and unconverted people. Nobody can tell
          how far life is removed from death. Can you measure the difference?
          They are as opposite as the poles. Now, according to your profession,
          you are a living child of God, you have received a new life, whereas
          the children of this world are dead in trespasses and sins. How
          palpable the difference between light and darkness? Yet, you profess
          to have been |sometimes darkness,| but now you are made |light in the
          Lord.| There is, therefore, a great distinction between you and the
          world if you are what you profess to be. You say, when you put on the
          name of Christ, that you are going to the Celestial City, to the New
          Jerusalem; but the world turns its back upon the heavenly country, and
          goes downward to that other city of which you know that destruction is
          its doom; your path is different from theirs. If you be what you say
          you are, the road you take must be diametrically opposite to that of
          the ungodly man. You know the difference between their ends. The end
          of the righteous shall be glory everlasting, but the end of the wicked
          is destruction. Unless then you are a hypocrite, there is such a
          distinction between you and others as only God himself could make -- a
          distinction which originates here, to be perpetuated throughout
          eternity. When the social diversities occasioned by rank and
          dependency, riches and poverty, ignorance and learning, shall all have
          passed away; the distinctions between the children of God and the
          children of men, between saints and scoffers, between the chosen and
          the castaway, will still exist. I pray you, then, maintain a broad
          wall in your conduct, as God has made a broad wall in your state and
          in your destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember again, that our Lord Jesus Christ had a broad wall between
          him and the ungodly. Look at him and see how different he is from the
          men of his time. All his life long you observe him to be a stranger
          and a foreigner in the land. Truly, he drew near to sinners, as near
          as he could draw, and he received them when they were willing to draw
          near to him; but he did not draw near to their sins. He was |holy,
          harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.| When he went to his
          own city of Nazareth, he only preached a single sermon, and they would
          have cast him headlong down the hill if they could. When he passed
          through the street, he became the song of the drunkard, the butt of
          the foolish, the mark at which the proud shot out the arrows of their
          scorn. At last, having come to his own, and his own having received
          him not, they determined to thrust him altogether out of the camp, so
          they took him to Golgotha, and nailed him to the tree as a malefactor,
          a promoter of sedition. He was the great Dissenter, the great
          Nonconformist of his age. The National Church first excommunicated,
          and then executed him. He did not seek difference in things trivial;
          but the purity of his life and the truthfulness of his testimony,
          roused the spleen of the rulers and the chief men of their synagogues.
          He was ready in all things to serve them and to bless them, but he
          never would blend with them. They would have made him a king. Ah! if
          he would but have joined the world, the world would have given him the
          chief place, as the world's Prince said on the mountain: |All these
          things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.| But
          he drives away the fiend, and stands immaculate and separate even to
          the close of his life. If you are a Christian, be a Christian. If you
          follow Christ, go without the camp. But if there be no difference
          between you and your fellow-man, what will you say unto the King in
          the day when he cometh and findeth that you have on no wedding garment
          by which you can be distinguished from the rest of mankind? Because
          Christ made a broad wall around himself, there must be such an one
          around his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, dear friends, you will find that a broad wall of separation
          is abundantly good for yourselves. I do not think any Christian in the
          world will tell you that when he has given way to the world's customs,
          he has ever been profited thereby. If you can go and find an evening's
          amusement in a suspicious place, and feel profited by it, I am sure
          you are not a Christian; for, if you were a Christian indeed, it would
          pain your conscience, and unfit you for devouter exercises of the
          heart. Ask a fish to spend an hour on dry land, and, I think, did it
          comply, the fish would find that it was not much to its benefit, for
          it would be out of its element. And it will be so with you in
          communion with sinners. When you are compelled to associate with
          worldly people in the ordinary course of business, you find much that
          grates upon the ear, that troubles the heart, and annoys the soul. You
          will be often like righteous Lot, vexed with the conversation of the
          wicked, and you will say with David:
        </p>
        <p>|Ah! woe is me that I</p>
        <p>In Meshech dwell so long:</p>
        <p>That I in tabernacles stay,</p>
        <p>To Kedar that belong!|</p>
        <p>
          Your soul would pine and sigh to come forth and wash your hands of
          everything that is impure and unclean. As you find no comfort there,
          you will long to get away to the chaste, the holy, the devout, the
          edifying fellowship of the saints. Make a broad wall, dear friends, in
          your daily life. If you begin to give way a little to the world, you
          will soon give way a great deal. Give sin an inch, and it will take an
          ell. |Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of
          themselves,| is an apt motto of economy. So, too, guard against little
          sins, if you would be clear of the great transgression. Look after the
          little approaches to worldliness, the little givings-up towards the
          things of ungodliness, and then you will not make provision for the
          flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another good reason for keeping up the broad wall of separation is,
          that you will do most good to the world thereby. I know Satan will
          tell you that if you bend a little, and come near to the ungodly, then
          they also will come a little way to meet you. Ay, but it is not so.
          You lose your strength, Christian, the moment you depart from your
          integrity. What do you think ungodly people say behind your back, if
          they see you inconsistent to please them? |Oh!| say they, |there is
          nothing in his religion, but vain pretence; the man is not sincere.|
          Although the world may openly denounce the rigid Puritan, it secretly
          admires him. When the big heart of the world speaks out, it has
          respect to the man that is sternly honest, and will not yield his
          principles -- no, not a hair's breadth. In such an age as this, when
          there is so little sound conviction, when principle is cast to the
          winds, and when a general latitudinarianism, but of thought and of
          practice, seems to rule the day, it is still the fact, that a man who
          is decided in his belief, speaks his mind boldly, and acts according
          to his profession -- such a man is sure to command the reverence of
          mankind. Depend upon it, woman, your husband and your children will
          respect you none the more because you say, |I will give up some of my
          Christian privileges,| or |I will go sometimes with you into that
          which is sinful.| You cannot help them out of the mire if you go and
          plunge into the mud yourself. You cannot help to make them clean if
          you go and blacken your own hands. How can you wash their faces then?
          You young man in the shop -- you young woman in the work-room -- if
          you keep yourselves to yourselves in Christ's name, chaste and pure
          for Jesus, not laughing at jests which should make you blush: not
          mixing up with pastimes that are suspicious; but, on the other hand,
          tenderly jealous of your conscience as one who shrinks from a doubtful
          thing as a sinful thing, holding sound faith and being scrupulous of
          the truth -- if you will keep yourselves, your company in the midst of
          others shall be as though an angel shook his wings, and they will say
          to one another, |Refrain from this or that just now, for so-and-so is
          there.| They will fear you, in a certain sense; they will admire you,
          in secret; and who can tell but they, at last, may come to imitate
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would ye tempt God? Would ye challenge the desolating flood? Whenever
          the church comes down to mingle with the world, it behooves the
          faithful few to fly to the ark and seek shelter from the avenging
          storm. When the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were
          fair to look upon, then it was that God said it repented him that he
          had made men upon the face of the earth, and he sent the deluge to
          sweep them away. A separate people God's people must be, and they
          shall be. It is his own declaration, |The people shall dwell alone;
          they shall not be numbered among the people.| The Christian is, in
          some respects like the Jew. The Jew is the type of the Christian. You
          may give the Jew political privileges, as he ought to have; he may be
          adopted into the State, as he ought to be; but a Jew he is, and a Jew
          he must be still. He is not a Gentile, even though he calls himself
          English, or Portuguese, or Spanish, or Polish. He remains one of the
          people of Israel, a child of Abraham, a Jew still; and you can mark
          him as such -- his speech betrayeth him in every land. So should it be
          with the Christian; mixing up with other men, as he must in his daily
          calling; going in and out among them, like a man among men; trading in
          the market; dealing in the shop; mingling in the joys of the social
          circle; taking his part in politics, like a citizen, as he is; but, at
          the same time even, having a higher and a nobler life, a secret into
          which the world cannot enter, and showing the world by his superior
          holiness, his zeal for God, his sterling integrity, and his unselfish
          truthfulness, that he is not of the world, even as Christ was not of
          the world. You cannot tell how concerned I am for some of you, that
          this broad wall should be kept up; for I detect in some of you at
          times a desire to make it very narrow, and, perhaps, to pull it down
          altogether. Brethren, beloved in the Lord, you may depend upon it that
          nothing worse can happen to a church than to be conformed unto this
          world. Write |Ichabod| upon her walls then; for the sentence of
          destruction has gone out against her. But, if you can keep yourselves
          as --
        </p>
        <p>|A garden walled around,</p>
        <p>Chosen and made peculiar ground,| --</p>
        <p>
          you shall have your Master's company; your graces shall grow; you
          shall be happy in your own souls; and Christ shall be honored in your
          lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly; the broad wall round about Jerusalem INDICATED SAFETY.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same way, a broad wall round Christ's church indicates her
          safety too. Consider who they are that belong to the church of God. A
          man does not become a member of Christ's church by baptism, nor by
          birthright, nor by profession, nor by morality. Christ is the door
          into the sheepfold; every one who believes in Jesus Christ is a member
          of the true church. Being a member of Christ, he is a member,
          consequently, of the body of Christ, which is the church. Now, around
          the church of God -- the election of grace, the redeemed by blood, the
          peculiar people, the adopted, the justified, the sanctified -- around
          the church there are bulwarks of stupendous strength, munitions which
          guard them safely. When the foe came to attack Jerusalem, he counted
          the towers and bulwarks, and marked them well; but after he had seen
          the strength of the Holy City, he fled away. How could he hope ever to
          scale such ramparts as those? Brethren, Satan often counts the towers
          and bulwarks of the New Jerusalem. Anxiously does he desire the
          destruction of the saints, but it shall never be. He that rests in
          Christ is saved. He who hath passed through the gate of faith to rest
          in Jesus Christ may sing, with joyful confidence --
        </p>
        <p>|The soul that on Jesus hath lean'd for repose,</p>
        <p>I will not, I will not desert to his foes;</p>
        <p>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</p>
        <p>I'll never, no never, no never forsake.|</p>
        <p>
          |I will be,| saith Jehovah, |a wall of fire round about thee.|
          Salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian is surrounded by the broad wall of God's power. If God
          be omnipotent, Satan cannot defeat him. If God's power be on my side,
          who, then, shall hurt me? |If God be for us, who can be against us?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian is surrounded by the broad wall of God's love. Who shall
          prevail against those whom God loves? I know that it is vain to curse
          those whom God hath not cursed, or to defy those whom the Lord hath
          not defied; for whomsoever he blesseth is blessed indeed. Balak, the
          son of Zippor, sought to curse the beloved people, and he went first
          to one hill-top and then to another, and looked down upon the chosen
          camp. But, aha! Balaam, thou couldst not curse them, though Balak
          sought it! Thou couldst only say, |They are blessed, yea, and they
          shall be blessed!|
        </p>
        <p>
          God's law is a broad wall around us, and so is his justice too. These
          once threatened our destruction, but now the justice of God demands
          the salvation of every believer. If Christ has died instead of me, it
          would not be justice if I had to die also for my sin. If God has
          received the full payment of the debt from the hand of the Lord Jesus
          Christ, then how can he demand the debt again? He is satisfied, and we
          are secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The immutability of God, also, surrounds his people like a broad wall.
          |I am God, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.|
          As long as God is the same, the rock of our salvation will be our
          secure hiding-place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this delightful truth, we might linger long, for there is much to
          cheer us in the strong security which God has given in covenant to his
          people. They are surrounded by the broad wall of electing love. Doth
          God choose them, and will he lose them? Did he ordain them to eternal
          life, and shall they perish? Did he engrave their names upon his
          heart, and shall those names be blotted out? Did he give them to his
          Son to be his heritage, and shall his Son lose his portion? Did he
          say, |They shall be mine, saith the Lord, in the day when I make up my
          jewels,| and shall he part with them? Has he who maketh all things
          obey him no power to keep the people whom he has formed for himself to
          be his own peculiar heritage? God forbid that we should doubt it.
          Electing love, like a broad wall, surrounds every heir of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And oh, how broad is the wall of redeeming love. Will Jesus fail to
          claim the people he bought with so great a price? Did he shed his
          blood in vain? How can he revive enmity against those whom he hath
          once reconciled unto God, not imputing their transgressions unto them?
          Having obtained eternal redemption for them, will he adjudge them to
          everlasting perdition? Has he purged their sins by sacrifice, and will
          he then leave them to be the victims of satanic craft? By the blood of
          the everlasting covenant, every Christian-may be assured that he
          cannot perish, neither can any pluck him out of Christ's hand. Unless
          the cross were all a peradventure, unless the atonement were a mere
          speculation, those for whom Jesus died are saved through his death.
          Therefore he shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a broad wall which surrounds the saints of God is the work of the
          Holy Spirit. Does the spirit begin and not finish the operations of
          his grace? Ah no? Does he give life which afterwards dies out?
          Impossible! Hath he not told us that the Word of God is the
          incorruptible seed, which liveth and abideth for ever? And shall the
          powers of hell or the evil of our own flesh destroy what God has
          pronounced immortal, or cause dissolution to that which God says is
          incorruptible? Is not the Spirit of God given us to abide with us for
          ever, and shall he be expelled from that heart in which he has taken
          up his everlasting dwelling place? Brethren, we are not of their mind,
          who are led by fear of fallacy to hazard such conjectures. We rejoice
          to say with Paul, |I am persuaded that he who hath begun a good work
          in you will carry it on.| We like to sing --
        </p>
        <p>|Grace will complete what grace begins,</p>
        <p>To save from sorrows or from sins;</p>
        <p>The work that wisdom undertakes</p>
        <p>Eternal mercy ne'er forsakes.|</p>
        <p>
          Almost every doctrine of grace affords us a broad wall, a strong
          bastion, a mighty bulwark, a grand munition of defence. Take, for
          instance, Christ's suretyship engagements. He is surety to his Father
          for his people. When he brings home the flock, think you he will have
          to report that some of them are lost? At his hands will they be
          required. Not so!
        </p>
        <p>|I know that safe with him remains,</p>
        <p>Protect by his power,</p>
        <p>What I've committed to his hands,</p>
        <p>Till the decisive hour.|</p>
        <p>
          |Here am I,| will he say, |and the children whom thou hast given me,
          of all whom thou hast given me I have lost none.| He will keep all the
          saints even to the end. The honor of Christ is involved. If Christ
          loses one soul that leans upon him, the integrity of his crown is
          gone; for if there should be one believing soul in hell, the prince of
          darkness would hold up that soul and say -- |Aha! Thou couldst not
          save them all! Aha! Thou Captain of Salvation, thou wast defeated
          here! Here is one poor little Benjamin, one Ready-to-Halt, that thou
          couldst not bring to glory, and I have him to be my prey for ever!|
          But it shall not be. Every gem shall be in Jesu's crown. Every sheep
          shall be in Jesu's flock. He shall not be defeated in any way, or in
          any measure; but he shall divide the spoil with the strong, he shall
          establish the cause he undertakes, he shall eternally conquer; glory
          be unto his great and good name!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have tried to show you the broad walls which are round about
          believers. They are saved, and they may say to their enemies, |the
          virgin daughter of Zion hath shaken her head at them, and laughed them
          to scorn! Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is
          God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that
          died, yea, rather that hath risen again from the dead; who sitteth at
          the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us! For I am
          persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
          principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
          nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
          separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The idea of a broad wall, and with this I close, SUGGESTS
          ENJOYMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          The walls of Ninevah and Babylon were broad; so broad that there was
          found room for several chariots to pass each other. Here men walked at
          sunset, and talked and promoted good fellowship. If you have ever been
          in the city of York you will know how interesting it is to walk around
          the broad walls there. But our figure is drawn from the Orientals.
          They were accustomed to come out of their houses and walk on the broad
          walls. They used them for rest from toil, and for the manifold
          pleasures of recreation. It was very delightful when the sun was going
          down, and all was cool, to walk on those broad walls. And so, when a
          believer comes to know the deep things of God, and to see the defences
          of God's people, he walks along them and he rests. |Now,| saith he, |I
          am at rest and peace; the destroyer cannot molest me; I am delivered
          from the noise of archers in the place of the drawing of water, and
          here I can exercise myself in prayer and meditation! Now that
          salvation is appointed for walls and bulwarks, I will sing a song unto
          him who hath done these great things for me; I will take my rest and
          be quiet for he that believeth hath entered into rest; there is,
          therefore, now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.|
          Broad walls, then, are for rest, and so are our broad walls of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those broad walls were also for communion. Men came there and talked
          with one another. They leaned over the wall and whispered their loving
          words, conversed of their business, comforted one another, related
          their troubles and their joys. So, when believers come unto Christ
          Jesus they commune with one another, with the angels, with the spirits
          of just men made perfect, and with Jesus Christ their Lord, who is
          best of all. Oh! on those broad walls, when the banner of love waves
          over them, they sometimes rejoice with a joy unspeakable, in
          fellowship with him who loved them and gave himself for them. It is a
          blessed thing in the Church when you get such a knowledge of the
          doctrines of the gospel that you can have the sweetest communion with
          all the Church of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the broad walls were also intended for prospects and
          outlooks. The citizen came up on the broad wall, and looked away from
          the smoke and dirt of the city within, right across to the green
          fields, and the gleaming river, and the far off mountains, delighted
          to watch the mowing of hay, or the reaping of corn, or the setting sun
          beyond the distant hills. It was one of the common enjoyments of the
          citizen of any walled city, to come to the top of the wall in order to
          take views afar. So, when a man once gets into the altitudes of gospel
          doctrines, and has learned to understand the love of God in Christ
          Jesus, what views he can take! How he looks down upon the sorrows of
          life! How he looks beyond that narrow little stream of death! How,
          sometimes, when the weather is bright and his eye is clear enough to
          let him use the telescope, he can see within the gates of pearl, and
          behold the joys which no mortal eye hath seen, and hear the songs
          which no mortal ear hath heard, for these are things, not for eyes and
          ears, but for hearts and spirits! Blessed is the man who dwelleth in
          the Church of God, for he can find on her broad walls places from
          which he can see the king in his beauty, and the land which is very
          far off!
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! dear friends, I wish that these things had to do with you all, but
          I am afraid they have not; for many of you are outside the wall, and
          when the destroyer comes none will be safe but those who are inside
          the wall of Christ's love and mercy. I would go to God that you would
          escape to the gate at once, for it is open. It will be shut -- it will
          be shut one day, but it is open now. When night comes, the night of
          death, the gate will be shut, and you will come then and say, |Lord,
          Lord, open to us!| But, the answer will be --
        </p>
        <p>|Too late, too late!</p>
        <p>Ye cannot enter now.|</p>
        <p>
          But it is not too late yet. Still Christ saith, |Behold, I set before
          thee an open door, and no man can shut it.| Oh! that thou hadst the
          will to come and put thy trust in Jesus; for if thou dost so, thou
          shalt be saved. I cannot speak to some of you about security, for
          there are no broad walls to defend you. You have run away from the
          security. Perhaps you have been patching up with some untempered
          mortar a righteousness of your own, which will all be thrown down as a
          bowing wall and as a tottering fence. Oh! that you would trust in
          Jesus! Then would you have a broad wall which all the battering-rams
          of hell shall never be able to shake. When the storms of eternity
          shall beat against that wall, it shall stand fast for aye.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot speak to some of you about rest, and enjoyment, and
          communion, for you have sought rest where there is none; you have got
          a peace which is no peace, you have found a comfort which will be your
          destruction. God make you to be distressed, and constrain you by sore
          stress to flee to the Lord Jesus and get true peace, the only peace,
          for |he is our peace.| Oh! that you would close in with Christ and
          trust him, then you would rejoice in the present happiness which faith
          would give you; but, the sweetest thing of all would be the prospect
          which should then unfold to you of the eternal happiness which Christ
          has prepared for all those who put their trust in him.
