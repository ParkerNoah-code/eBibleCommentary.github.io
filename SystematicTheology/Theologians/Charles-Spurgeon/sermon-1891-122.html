          1. For thus it had behoved the sons of Abraham [to be], whom God has
          raised up to him from the stones, and caused to take a place beside
          him who was made the chief and the forerunner of our faith (who did
          also receive the covenant of circumcision, after that justification by
          faith which had pertained to him, when he was yet in uncircumcision,
          so that in him both covenants might be prefigured, that he might be
          the father of all who follow the Word of God, and who sustain a life
          of pilgrimage in this world, that is, of those who from among the
          circumcision and of those from among the uncircumcision are faithful,
          even as also "Christ is the chief corner-stone" sustaining all
          things); and He gathered into the one faith of Abraham those who, from
          either covenant, are eligible for God's building. But this faith which
          is in uncircumcision, as connecting the end with the beginning, has
          been made [both] the first and the last. For, as I have shown, it
          existed in Abraham antecedently to circumcision, as it also did in the
          rest of the righteous who pleased God: and in these last times, it
          again sprang up among mankind through the coming of the Lord. But
          circumcision and the law of works occupied the intervening period.

          2. This fact is indeed set forth by many other [occurrences], but
          typically by [the history of] Thamar, Judah's daughter-in-law. For
          when she had conceived twins, one of them put forth his hand first;
          and as the midwife supposed that he was the first-born, she bound a
          scarlet token on his hand. But after this had been done, and he had
          drawn back his hand, his brother Phares came forth the first; then,
          after him, Zara, upon whom was the scarlet line, [was born] the
          second: the Scripture clearly pointing out that people which possessed
          the scarlet sign, that is, faith in a state of circumcision, which was
          shown beforehand, indeed, in the patriarchs first; but after that
          withdrawn, that his brother might be born; and also, in like manner,
          him who was the elder, as being born in the second place, [him] who
          was distinguished by the scarlet token which was [fastened] on him,
          that is, the passion of the Just One, which was prefigured from the
          beginning in Abel, and described by the prophets, but perfected in the
          last times in the Son of God.
        </p>

          3. For it was requisite that certain facts should be announced
          beforehand by the fathers in a paternal manner, and others prefigured
          by the prophets in a legal one, but others, described after the form
          of Christ, by those who have received the adoption; while in one God
          are all things shown forth. For although Abraham was one, he did in
          himself prefigure the two covenants, in which some indeed have sown,
          while others have reaped; for it is said, "In this is the saying true,
          that it is one people' who sows, but another who shall reap;" but it
          is one God who bestows things suitable upon both -- seed to the sower,
          but bread for the reaper to eat. Just as it is one that planteth, and
          another who watereth, but one God who giveth the increase. For the
          patriarchs and prophets sowed the word [concerning] Christ, but the
          Church reaped, that is, received the fruit. For this reason, too, do
          these very men (the prophets) also pray to have a dwelling-place in
          it, as Jeremiah says, "Who will give me in the desert the last
          dwelling-place?" in order that both the sower and the reaper may
          rejoice together in the kingdom of Christ, who is present with all
          those who were from the beginning approved by God, who granted them
          His Word to be present with them. <br />
