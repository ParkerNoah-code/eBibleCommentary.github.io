        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1888)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, February 28th, 1886, by</p>

        <p>
          And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of
          sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that ye
          refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him
          that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away
          from him that speaketh from heaven." -- Hebrews 12:24, 25.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE ARE JOYFULLY REMINDED by the apostle that we are not come to Mount
          Sinai and its overwhelming manifestations. After Israel had kept the
          feast of the Passover, God was pleased to give his people a sort of
          Pentecost, and more fully to manifest himself and his law to them at
          Sinai. They were in the wilderness, with the solemn peaks of a
          desolate mountain as their center; and from the top thereof, in the
          midst of fire, and blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and with the
          sound of a trumpet, God spake with them. "The earth shook, the heavens
          also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at
          the presence of God, the God of Israel." We are not come to the dread
          and terror of the old covenant, of which our apostle saith in another
          place, "The covenant from the Mount Sinai gendereth unto bondage"
          (Galatians 4:24.) Upon the believer's spirit there rests not the
          slavish fear, the abject terror, the fainting alarm, which swayed the
          tribes of Israel; for the manifestation of God which he beholds,
          though not less majestic, is far more full of hope and joy. Over us
          there rests not the impenetrable cloud of apprehension; we are not
          buried in a present darkness of despair; we are not tossed about with
          a tempest of horror; and, therefore, we do not exceedingly fear and
          quake. How thankful we should be for this! Israel was privileged even
          in receiving a fiery law from the right hand of Jehovah; but we are
          far more favored, since we receive "the glorious gospel of the blessed
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our apostle next tells us what we are come to. I suppose he speaks of
          all the saints after the death and resurrection of our Lord and the
          descent of the Holy Ghost. He refers to the whole church, in the midst
          of which the Holy Spirit now dwells. We are come to a more joyous
          sight than Sinai, and the mountain burning with fire. The Hebrew
          worshipper, apart from his sacrifices, lived continually beneath the
          shadow of the darkness of a broken law; he was startled often by the
          tremendous note of the trumpet, which threatened judgment for that
          broken law; and thus he lived ever in a condition of bondage. To what
          else could the law bring him? To convince of sin and to condemn the
          sinner is its utmost power. The believer in the Lord Jesus Christ
          lives in quite another atmosphere. He has not come to a barren crag,
          but to an inhabited city, Jerusalem above, the metropolis of God. He
          has quitted the wilderness for the land which floweth with milk and
          honey, and the material mount which might be touched for the spiritual
          and heavenly Jerusalem. He has entered into fellowship with an
          innumerable company of angels, who are to him, not cherubim with
          flaming swords to keep men back from the tree of life, but ministering
          spirits sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation. He is come
          to the joyous assembly of all pure intelligences who have met, not in
          trembling, but in joyous liberty, to keep the feast with their great
          Lord and King. He thinks of all who love God throughout all worlds,
          and he feels that he is one of them; for he has come to "the general
          assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven."
          Moreover, he has come "to God the Judge of all," the umpire and
          rewarder of all the chosen citizens who are enrolled by his command,
          the ruler and judge of all their enemies. God is not to them a
          dreadful person who speaks from a distance; but he is their Father and
          their Friend, in whom they delight themselves, in whose presence there
          is fullness of joy for them. Brethren, our fellowship is with the
          Father, our God. To him we have come through our Lord Jesus Christ.
          Moreover, in the power of the Spirit of God we realize the oneness of
          the church both in heaven and earth, and the spirits of just men made
          perfect are in union with us. No gulf divides the militant from the
          triumphant; we are one army of the living God. We sometimes speak of
          the holy dead; but there are none such: they live unto God; they are
          perfected as to their spirits even now, and they are waiting for the
          moment when their bodies also shall be raised from the tomb to be
          again inhabited by their immortal souls. We no longer shudder at the
          sepulcher, but sing of resurrection. Our condition of heart, from day
          to day, is that of men who are in fellowship with God, fellowship with
          angels, fellowship with perfect spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also come to Jesus, our Savior, who is all and in all. In him
          we live; we are joined unto him in one spirit; he is the Bridegroom of
          our souls, the delight of our hearts. We are come to him as the
          Mediator of the new covenant. What a blessed thing it is to know that
          covenant of which he is the Mediator! Some in these days despise the
          covenant; but saints delight in it. To them the everlasting covenant,
          "ordered in all things, and sure," is all their salvation and all
          their desire. We are covenanted ones through our Lord Jesus. God has
          pledged himself to bless us. By two immutable things wherein it is
          impossible for him to lie, he has given us strong consolation, and
          good hope through grace, even to all of us who have fled for refuge to
          the Lord Jesus. We are happy to live under the covenant of grace, the
          covenant of promise, the covenant symbolized by Jerusalem above, which
          is free, and the mother of us all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes the last thing of all, mentioned last, as I shall have to
          show you, for a purpose. We have come "to the blood of sprinkling." On
          that first day at Sinai no blood of sprinkling was presented, but
          afterwards it was used by divine order to ratify the national covenant
          which the tribes made with Jehovah at the foot of the hill. Of that
          covenant the Lord says, "which my covenant they brake, although I was
          an husband unto them." He never brake his covenant, but they brake it;
          for they failed to keep that condition of obedience without which a
          covenant founded upon works falls to the ground. We have come to the
          blood of sprinkling which has fallen upon a covenant which never shall
          be broken; for the Lord hath made it to endure though rocks and hills
          remove. This is called by the Holy Ghost "a better covenant, which was
          established upon better promises." We are come to the covenant of
          grace, to Jesus the Mediator of it, and to his blood, which is the
          seal of it. Of this last we are going to speak at this time -- "The
          blood of sprinkling which speaketh better things than that of Abel."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall need this morning to occupy all the time with what I regard as
          only the first head of my discourse. What is it? "The blood of
          sprinkling." It will be our duty afterwards to consider where we are
          -- "we are come unto this blood;" and, thirdly, to remember what then?
          "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. FIRST, WHAT IS IT? What is this "blood of sprinkling?" In a few
          words, "the blood of sprinkling" represents the pains, the sufferings,
          the humiliation, and the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, which he
          endured on the behalf of guilty man. When we speak of the blood, we
          wish not to be understood as referring solely or mainly to the literal
          material blood which flowed from the wounds of Jesus. We believe in
          the literal fact of his shedding his blood; but when we speak of his
          cross and blood we mean those sufferings and that death of our Lord
          Jesus Christ by which he magnified the law of God; we mean what Isaiah
          intended when he said, "He shall make his soul an offering for sin;"
          we mean all the griefs which Jesus vicariously endured on our behalf
          at Gethsemane, and Gabbatha, and Golgotha, and specially his yielding
          up his life upon the tree of scorn and doom. "The chastisement of our
          peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed." "Without
          shedding of blood there is no remission;" and the shedding of blood
          intended is the death of Jesus, the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that his sufferings and death were not apparent only, but
          true and real; and that they involved an incalculable degree of pain
          and anguish. To redeem our souls cost our Lord an exceeding
          sorrowfulness "even unto death;" it cost him the bloody sweat, the
          heart broken with reproach, and specially the agony of being forsaken
          of his Father, till he cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
          me?" Our Mediator endured death under the worst possible aspects,
          bereft of those supports which are in all other cases of godly men
          afforded by the goodness and faithfulness of God. His was not merely a
          natural death, but a death aggravated by supernatural circumstance,
          which infinitely intensified its woe. This is what we mean by the
          blood of Christ, his sufferings, and his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were voluntarily undertaken by himself out of pure love to us,
          and in order that we might thereby be justly saved from deserved
          punishment. There was no natural reason on his own account why he
          should suffer, bleed, and die. Far from it, -- "He only hath
          immortality." But out of supreme love to us, that man might be
          forgiven without the violation of divine rectitude, the Son of God
          assumed human flesh, and became in very deed a man, in order that he
          might be able to offer in man's place a full vindication to the
          righteous and unchangeable law of God. Being God, he thus showed forth
          the wondrous love of God to man by being willing to suffer personally
          rather than the redeemed should die as the just result of their sin.
          The matchless majesty of his divine person lent supreme efficacy to
          his sufferings. It was a man that died, but he was also God, and the
          death of incarnate God reflects more glory upon law than the deaths of
          myriads of condemned creatures could have done. See the yearning of
          the great God for perfect righteousness: he had sooner die than stain
          his justice even to indulge his mercy. Jesus the Lord, out of love to
          the Father and to men, undertook willingly and cheerfully for our
          sakes to magnify the law, and bring in perfect righteousness. This
          work was so carried out to the utmost, that not a jot of the suffering
          was mitigated, nor a particle of the obedience foregone: "he became
          obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." Now he hath
          finished transgression, made an end of sin, and brought in everlasting
          righteousness: for he has offered such an expiation that God is just,
          and the justifier of him that believeth. God is at once the righteous
          Judge, and the infinitely loving Father, through what Jesus hath
          suffered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, though I have said that there was no reason why the Son of
          God should bleed and die on his own account, yet towards us there was
          a reason. Our Lord from of old in the eternal covenant was constituted
          the head and representative of all who were in him; and so, when the
          time came, he took the place, bore the sin, and suffered the penalty
          of those whom the Father gave him from before the foundations of the
          world. He is as much the representative man as the first Adam was the
          representative man; and as in Adam the sin was committed which ruined
          us, so in the second Adam the atonement was made which saves us. "As
          in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." There was
          no other person so fit to undertake the enterprise of our redemption
          as this second man, who is the Lord from heaven. He properly, but yet
          most generously and spontaneously, came and shed his precious blood,
          in the room and place and stead of sinners, to bring the guilty near
          to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text does not merely speak of the blood shed, which I have
          explained to you, but of "the blood of sprinkling." This is the
          atonement applied for divine purposes, and specially applied to our
          own hearts and consciences by faith. For the explanation of this
          sprinkling we must look to the types of the Old Testament. In the Old
          Testament the blood of sprinkling meant a great many things; in fact,
          I cannot just now tell you all that it signified. We meet with it in
          the Book of Exodus, at the time when the Lord smote all the first-born
          of Egypt. Then the blood of sprinkling meant preservation. The basin
          filled with blood was taken, and a bunch of hyssop was dipped into it,
          and the lintel and the two side-posts of every house tenanted by
          Israelites were smeared with the blood; and when God saw the blood
          upon the house of the Israelite, he bade the destroyer pass that
          family by, and leave their first-born unharmed. The sprinkled blood
          meant preservation: it was Israel's passover and safeguard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sprinkled blood very frequently signified the confirmation of a
          covenant. So it is used in Exodus 24., which I read to you just now.
          The blood was sprinkled upon the book of the covenant, and also upon
          the people, to show that the covenant was, as far as it could be,
          confirmed by the people who promised, "All that the Lord hath said
          will we do." The blood of bulls and of goats in that case was but a
          type of the sacrificial blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. The lesson
          which we learn from Exodus 24:is that the blood of sprinkling means
          the blood of ratification or confirmation of the covenant, which God
          has been pleased to make with men in the person of our Lord Jesus
          Christ. Since Jesus died, the promises are Yea and Amen to all
          believers, and must assuredly be fulfilled. The covenant of grace had
          but one condition, and that condition Jesus has fulfilled by his
          death, so that it has now become a covenant of pure and unconditional
          promise to all the seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases the sprinkling of the blood meant purification. If a
          person had been defiled, he could not come into the sanctuary of God
          without being sprinkled with blood. There were the ashes of a red
          heifer laid up, and these were mixed with blood and water; and by
          their being sprinkled on the unclean, his ceremonial defilement was
          removed. There were matters incident to domestic life, and accidents
          of outdoor life, which engendered impurity, and this impurity was put
          away by the sprinkling of blood. This sprinkling was used in the case
          of recovery from infectious disease, such as leprosy; before such
          persons could mingle in the solemn assemblies, they were sprinkled
          with the blood, and thus were made ceremonially pure. In a higher
          sense this is the work of the blood of Christ. It preserves us, it
          ratifies the covenant, and wherever it is applied it makes us pure;
          for "the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." We
          have our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience; for we have come
          unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sprinkling of the blood meant, also, sanctification. Before a man
          entered upon the priesthood the blood was put upon his right ear, and
          on the great toe of his right foot, and on the thumb of his right
          hand, signifying that all his powers were thus consecrated to God. The
          ordination ceremony included the sprinkling of blood upon the altar
          round about. Even thus hath the Lord Jesus redeemed us unto God by his
          death, and the sprinkling of his blood hath made us kings and priests
          unto God for ever. He is made of God unto us sanctification, and all
          else that is needed for the divine service.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other signification of the blood of the sacrifice was acceptation
          and access. When the high priest went into the most holy place once a
          year, it was not without blood, which he sprinkled upon the ark of the
          covenant, and upon the mercy-seat, which was on the top thereof. All
          approaches to God were made by blood. There was no hope of a man
          drawing near to God, even in symbol, apart from the sprinkling of the
          blood. And now to-day our only way to God is by the precious sacrifice
          of Christ; the only hope for the success of our prayers, the
          acceptance of our praises, or the reception of our holy works, is
          through the ever-abiding merit of the atoning sacrifice of our Lord
          Jesus Christ. The Holy Ghost bids us enter into the holiest by the
          blood of Jesus; there is no other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were other uses besides these, but it may suffice to put down
          the sprinkling of the blood as having these effects, namely, that of
          preservation, satisfaction, purification, sanctification, and access
          to God. This was all typified in the blood of bulls and of goats, but
          actually fulfilled in the great sacrifice of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this as an explanation, I desire to come still closer to the
          text, and view it with great care; for to my mind it is singularly
          full of teaching. May the Holy Spirit lead us into the truth which
          lies herein like treasure hid in a field!
        </p>
        <p>
          First. The blood of sprinkling is the center of the divine
          manifestation under the gospel. Observe its innermost place in the
          passage before us. You are privileged by almighty grace to come first
          to Mount Zion, to climb its steeps, to stand upon its holy summit, and
          to enter the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. In those
          golden streets, surrounding the hallowed shrine, you behold an
          innumerable company of angels. What a vision of glory! But you must
          not rest here; for the great general assembly, the festal gathering,
          the solemn convocation of the enrolled in heaven, is being held, and
          all are there in glad attire, surrounding their God and Lord. Press
          onward to the throne itself, where sits the Judge of all, surrounded
          by those holy spirits who have washed their robes, and, therefore,
          stand before the throne of God in perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you not come a long way? Are you not admitted into the very
          center of the whole revelation? Not yet. A step further lands you
          where stands your Savior, the Mediator, with the new covenant. Now is
          your joy complete; but you have a further object to behold. What is in
          that innermost shrine? What is that which is hidden away in the holy
          of holies? What is that which is the most precious and costly thing of
          all, the last, the ultimatum, God's grandest revelation? The precious
          blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot -- the
          blood of sprinkling. This comes last; it is the innermost truth of the
          dispensation of grace under which we live. Brethren, when we climb to
          heaven itself, and pass the gate of pearl, and wend our way through
          the innumerable hosts of angels, and come even to the throne of God,
          and see the spirits of the just made perfect, and hear their holy
          hymn, we shall not have gone beyond the influence of the blood of
          sprinkling; nay, we shall see it there more truly present than in any
          other place beside. "What!" say you, "the blood of Jesus in heaven?"
          Yes. The earthly sanctuary, we are told, was purified with the blood
          of bulls and of goats, "but the heavenly things themselves with better
          sacrifices than these."(Hebrews 9:23) When Jesus entered once for all
          into the holy place, he entered by his own blood, having obtained
          eternal redemption for us: so saith the apostle in the ninth chapter
          of this epistle. Let those who talk lightly of the precious blood
          correct their view ere they be guilty of blasphemy; for the revelation
          of God knows no lower deep, this is the heart and center of all. The
          manifestation of Jesus under the gospel is not only the revelation of
          the Mediator, but especially of his sacrifice. The appearance of God
          the Judge of all, the vision of hosts of angels and perfect spirits,
          do but lead up to that sacrifice which is the source and focus of all
          true fellowship between God and his creatures. This is the character
          which Jesus wears in the innermost shrine where he reveals himself
          most clearly to those who are nearest to him. He looks like a lamb
          that has been slain. There is no sight of him which is more full, more
          glorious, more complete, than the vision of him as the great sacrifice
          for sin. The atonement of Jesus is the concentration of the divine
          glory; all other revelations of God are completed and intensified
          here. You have not come to the central sun of the great spiritual
          system of grace till you have come to the blood of sprinkling -- to
          those sufferings of Messiah which are not for himself, but are
          intended to bear upon others, even as drops when they are sprinkled
          exert their influence where they fall. Unless you have learned to
          rejoice in that blood which taketh away sin, you have not yet caught
          the key-note of the gospel dispensation. The blood of Christ is the
          life of the gospel. Apart from atonement you may know the skin, the
          rind, the husk of the gospel; but its inner kernel you have not
          discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I next ask you to look at the text and observe that this sprinkling of
          the blood, as mentioned by the Holy Ghost in this passage, is
          absolutely identical with Jesus himself. Read it. "To Jesus the
          mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that
          speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that ye refuse not him
          that speaketh." He saith it is the blood that speaketh; and then he
          proceeds to say, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh." This is a
          very unexpected turn, which can only be explained upon the supposition
          that Jesus and the blood are identical in the writer's view. By what
          we may call a singularity in grammar, in putting him for it, the
          Spirit of God intentionally sets forth the striking truth, that the
          sacrifice is identical with the Savior. "We are come to the Savior,
          the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that
          speaketh; see that ye refuse not him." Beloved friends, there is no
          Jesus if there is no blood of sprinkling; there is no Savior if there
          is no sacrifice. I put this strongly, because the attempt is being
          made nowadays to set forth Jesus apart from his cross and atonement.
          He is held up as a great ethical teacher, a self-sacrificing spirit,
          who is to lead the way in a grand moral reformation, and by his
          influence to set up a kingdom of moral influence in the world. It is
          even hinted that this kingdom has never had prominence enough given to
          it because it has been overshadowed by his cross. But where is Jesus
          apart from his sacrifice? He is not there if you have left out the
          blood of sprinkling, which is the blood of sacrifice. Without the
          atonement, no man is a Christian, and Christ is not Jesus. If you have
          torn away the sacrificial blood, you have drawn the heart out of the
          gospel of Jesus Christ, and robbed it of its life. If you have
          trampled on the blood of sprinkling, and counted it a common thing,
          instead of putting it above you upon the lintel of the door, and all
          around you upon the two side-posts, you have fearfully transgressed.
          As for me, God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, since to me that cross is identical with Jesus
          himself. I know no Jesus but he who died the just for the unjust. You
          can separate Jesus and the blood materially; for by the spear-thrust,
          and all his other wounds, the blood was drawn away from the body of
          our Lord; but spiritually this "blood of sprinkling" and the Jesus by
          whom we live, are inseparable. In fact, they are one and indivisible,
          the self-same thing, and you cannot truly know Jesus, or preach Jesus,
          unless you preach him as slain for sin; you cannot trust Jesus except
          you trust him as making peace by the blood of his cross. If you have
          done with the blood of sprinkling, you have done with Jesus
          altogether; he will never part with his mediatorial glory as our
          sacrifice, neither can we come to him if we ignore that character. Is
          it not clear in the text that Jesus and the blood of sprinkling are
          one? What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. Note this
          right carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, observe that this "blood of sprinkling" is put in close
          contact with "the new covenant." I do not wonder that those who are
          lax in their views of the atonement have nothing honorable to say
          concerning the covenants, old or new. The doctrine of the covenants is
          the marrow of divinity; but these vain-glorious spirits affect to
          despise it. This is natural, since they speak slightingly of the
          atonement. What covenant is there without blood? If it be not
          ratified, if there be no sacrifice to make it sure, then is it no
          covenant in the sight of God or of enlightened men. But, O beloved, ye
          who know your Lord, and follow on to know him yet better, to you the
          covenant of promise is a heritage of joy, and his atonement is most
          precious as the confirmation of it. To us the sacrificial death of our
          Lord is not a doctrine, but the doctrine, not an outgrowth of
          Christian teaching, but the essence and marrow of it. To us Jesus in
          his atonement is Alpha and Omega, in him the covenant begins and ends.
          You see how it was confirmed by blood. If it be a man's covenant, if
          it be confirmed, it standeth; but this is God's covenant, confirmed
          with promises, oaths and blood, and it stands fast for ever and ever.
          Every believer is as much interested in that covenant as was Abraham
          the father of believers; for the covenant was made with Abraham and
          his spiritual seed; and in Christ it is confirmed to all that seed for
          ever by his most precious blood. That, also, is evident enough in the
          text: fail not to consider it well.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, fourthly, I want you to notice that according to the text the
          blood is the voice of the new dispensation. Observe that on Sinai
          there was "the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice
          they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them
          any more." You look, therefore, under the new dispensation, for a
          voice, and you do not come to any till you reach the last object in
          the list, and there see "the blood of sprinkling that speaketh." Here,
          then, is the voice of the gospel; it is not the sound of a trumpet,
          nor the voice of words spoken in terrible majesty; but the blood
          speaks, and assuredly there is no sound more piercing, more potent,
          more prevailing. God heard the voice of Abel's blood and visited Cain
          with condign punishment for killing his brother; and the precious
          blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, cries in the ears of God with a
          voice which is ever heard. How can it be imagined that the Lord God
          should be deaf to the cry of his Son's sacrifice? Lo, these many ages
          the blood has cried -- "Forgive them! Forgive them! Accept them!
          Deliver them from going down into the pit, for I have found a ransom!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The blood of sprinkling has a voice of instruction to us even as it
          has a voice of intercession with God. It cries to us, "See the evil of
          sin! See how God loveth righteousness! See how he loveth men! See how
          impossible it is for you to escape from the punishment of sin except
          by this great sacrifice in which the love and the justice of God
          equally appear! See how Jehovah spared not his own Son, but freely
          delivered him up for us all."
        </p>
        <p>
          What a voice there is in the atonement! -- a voice which pleads for
          holiness and love, for justice and grace, for truth and mercy. "See
          that ye refuse not him that speaketh."
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not hear it? If you take away the blood of sprinkling from the
          gospel, you have silenced it. It has no voice if this be gone. "Oh,"
          they say, "the gospel has lost its power!" What wonder when they have
          made it a dumb gospel! How can it have power when they take away that
          which is its life and speech? Unless the preacher is evermore
          preaching this blood, and sprinkling it by the doctrine of faith, his
          teaching has no voice either to rouse the careless or to cheer the
          anxious. If ever there should come a wretched day when all our pulpits
          shall be full of modern thought, and the old doctrine of a
          substitutionary sacrifice shall be exploded, then will there remain no
          word of comfort for the guilty or hope for the despairing. Hushed will
          be for ever those silver notes which now console the living, and cheer
          the dying; a dumb spirit will possess this sullen world, and no voice
          of joy will break the blank silence of despair. The gospel speaks
          through the propitiation for sin, and if that be denied, it speaketh
          no more. Those who preach not the atonement exhibit a dumb and dummy
          gospel; a mouth it hath, but speaketh not; they that make it are like
          unto their idol.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me draw you nearer still to the text. Observe, that this voice is
          identical with the voice of the Lord Jesus; for it is put so. "The
          blood of sprinkling that speaketh. See that ye refuse not him that
          speaketh." Whatever the doctrine of the sacrifice of Jesus may be, it
          is the main teaching of Jesus himself. It is well to notice that the
          voice which spoke from Sinai was also the voice of Christ. It was
          Jesus who delivered that law the penalty of which he was himself to
          endure. He that read it out amidst the tempest was Jesus. Notice the
          declaration -- "Whose voice then shook the earth." Whenever you hear
          the gospel, the voice of the precious blood is the voice of Jesus
          himself, the voice of him that shook the earth at Sinai. This same
          voice shall by-and-by shake, not the earth only, but also heaven. What
          a voice there is in the blood of sprinkling, since indeed it is the
          voice of the eternal Son of God, who both makes and destroys! Would
          you have me silence the doctrine of the blood of sprinkling? Would any
          one of you attempt so horrible a deed? Shall we be censured if we
          continually proclaim the heaven-sent message of the blood of Jesus?
          Shall we speak with bated breath because some affected person shudders
          at the sound of the word "blood?" or some "cultured" individual rebels
          at the old-fashioned thought of sacrifice? Nay, verily, we will sooner
          have our tongue cut out than cease to speak of the precious blood of
          Jesus Christ. For me there is nothing worth thinking of or preaching
          about but this grand truth, which is the beginning and the end of the
          whole Christian system, namely, that God gave his Son to die that
          sinners might live. This is not the voice of the blood only, but the
          voice of our Lord Jesus Christ himself. So saith the text, and who can
          contradict it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, my brethren, from the text I learn another truth, namely,
          that this blood is always speaking. The text saith not "the blood of
          sprinkling that spoke," but "that speaketh." It is always speaking, it
          always remaineth a plea with God and a testimony to men. It never will
          be silenced, either one way or the other. In the intercession of our
          risen and ascended Lord his sacrifice ever speaketh to the Most High.
          By the teaching of the Holy Ghost the atonement will always speak in
          edification to believers yet upon the earth. It is the blood that
          speaketh, according to our text, this is the only speech which this
          dispensation yields us. Shall that speech ever be still? Shall we
          decline to hear it? Shall we refuse to echo it? God forbid. By day, by
          night, the great sacrifice continues to cry to the sons of men, "Turn
          ye from your sins, for they cost your Savior dear. The times of your
          ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to
          repent, since he is able to forgive and yet be just. Your offended God
          has himself provided a sacrifice; come and be sprinkled with its
          blood, and be reconciled once for all." The voice of this blood speaks
          wherever there is a guilty conscience, wherever there is an anxious
          heart, wherever there is a seeking sinner, wherever there is a
          believing mind. It speaketh with sweet, familiar, tender, inviting
          voice. There is no music like it to the sinner's ear: it charms away
          his fears. It shall never cease its speaking so long as there is a
          sinner yet out of Christ; nay, so long as there is one on earth who
          still needs its cleansing power because of fresh backslidings. Oh,
          hear ye its voice! Incline your ear and receive its blessed accents:
          it says, "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though
          your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
          be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."
        </p>
        <p>
          This part of my discourse will not be complete unless I bid you notice
          that we are expressly told that this precious blood speaks "better
          things than that of Abel." I do not think that the whole meaning of
          the passage is exhausted if we say that Abel's blood cries for
          vengeance, and that Christ's blood speaks for pardon. Dr. Watts puts
          it: --
        </p>
        <p>"Blood has a voice to pierce the skies:</p>
        <p>'Revenge!' the blood of Abel cries;</p>
        <p>But the dear stream when Christ was slain</p>
        <p>Speaks peace as loud from ev'ry vein."</p>
        <p>
          That is quite true; but I conceive that it is not all the sense, and
          perhaps not even the sense here intended. Revenge is scarcely a good
          thing; yet Abel's blood spake good things, or we should hardly read
          that Christ's blood speaks "better things." What does the blood of
          Abel speak? The blood of Abel speaks to a complete and believing
          obedience to God. It shows us a man who believes God, and,
          notwithstanding the enmity of his brother, brings to God the appointed
          sacrifice of faith, strictly following up, even to the bitter end, his
          holy obedience to the Most High. That is what the blood of Abel says
          to me; and the blood of Jesus says the same thing most emphatically.
          The death of Jesus Christ was the crown and close of a perfect life,
          it was a fit completion of a course of holiness. In obedience to the
          Great Father, Jesus even laid down his life. But if this be all the
          blood of Jesus speaks, as some say that it is, then it does not speak
          better things than the blood of Abel; for it only says the same things
          in a louder voice. The martyrdom of any saint has a voice for
          obedience to God as truly as the martyrdom of Jesus; but the death of
          our Lord says far more, infinitely more, than this: it not only
          witnesses to complete obedience, but it provides the way by which the
          disobedient may be forgiven and helped to obedience and holiness. The
          cross has a greater, deeper, gladder gospel for fallen men than that
          of a perfect example which they are unable to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blood of Abel said this, too -- that he was not ashamed of his
          faith, but witnessed a good confession concerning his God, even to the
          death; he put his life in his hand, and was not ashamed to stand at
          the altar of God, and avow his faith by obediently offering the
          ordained sacrifice. Now, I grant you that the blood of Jesus also
          declares that he was a faithful and true witness, who willingly sealed
          his witness with his blood. He proved by shedding his blood that he
          could not be turned aside from truth and righteousness, even though
          death stood in his way; but if that is all that the blood of
          sprinkling speaketh, it saith no better things than the blood of Abel.
          "Be faithful unto death," is the voice of Abel as well as of Jesus.
          Jesus must have said more than this by his blood-shedding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blood of Abel said good things; that is implied in the fact that
          the blood of Jesus Christ says better things; and no doubt the blood
          of Abel rises to the dignity of teaching self-sacrifice. Here was a
          man, a keeper of sheep, who by his mode of life laid out his life for
          the good of those committed to his charge; and at the last, in
          obedience to God, he yielded himself up to die by a brother's hand. It
          was the first draught of a picture of self-sacrifice. Our Lord Jesus
          Christ also made a complete self-sacrifice. All his life long he gave
          himself to men. He lived never for himself. The glory of God and the
          good of men were united in one passion which filled his whole soul. He
          could say, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." His death was
          the completion of his perfect self-sacrifice. But if that were all,
          the blood of Jesus saith no better thing than Abel's death saith,
          though it may say it more emphatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord's blood saith "better things than that of Abel;" and what
          doth it say? It saith, "There is redemption through his blood, the
          forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace." "He his own
          self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to
          sins should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes we were healed."
          "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
          made the righteousness of God in him." The voice of the blood is this,
          "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and
          their iniquities will I remember no more." "The blood of Jesus Christ
          his Son cleanseth us from all sin." Now, my brethren, these are better
          things than Abel's blood could say, and they are what the blood of
          Jesus speaks to every one upon whom it is sprinkled by faith. It must
          be applied to each one of us by faith, or it says nothing to us. But
          when it falls on each believing individual, it saith to him words of
          blessing which pacify his conscience and delight his soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle says that "Ye are come to the blood of sprinkling." Is it
          so? Has that blood of sprinkling ever been applied to you? Do you feel
          it? Are you preserved? Are you cleansed? Are you brought nigh to God?
          Are you sanctified unto God's service by the atoning sacrifice? If so,
          then go you out, and in firm confidence that never can be shaken, make
          your glory in the blood of sprinkling. Tell every sinner whom you meet
          that if the Lord Jesus wash him he shall be whiter than snow. Preach
          the atoning sacrifice of the Lamb of God and then sing of it.
          Recollect that wondrous threefold song in the fifth chapter of the
          Revelation, where, first of all, the elders and living creatures round
          about the throne, sing a new song, saying, "Thou wast slain, and hast
          redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and
          people, and nation." Then ten thousand times ten thousand, and
          thousands of thousands of angels take up the strain and cry, "Worthy
          is the Lamb that was slain." Nor is this all; for the apostle tells
          us, "Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under
          the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard
          I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that
          sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever." See you
          not that they all extol the Lord Jesus in his sacrificial character as
          the Lamb slain? I have scant patience with those who dare to put this
          great truth into the background, and even sneer at it or misrepresent
          it of set purpose. Sirs, if you would be saved you must have the blood
          of Jesus sprinkled upon you. He that believeth not in Christ Jesus, in
          Jesus the atoning sacrifice, must perish. The eternal God must repulse
          with infinite disgust the man who refuses the loving sacrifice of
          Jesus. Inasmuch as he counted himself unworthy of this wondrous
          sacrifice, this marvellous expiation there remaineth no other
          sacrifice for sin, and nothing for him but that eternal blackness and
          darkness and thunder which were foreshadowed at Sinai. Those who
          refuse the atonement which wisdom devised, which love provided, and
          which justice has accepted, have signed their own death-warrant, and
          none can wonder that they perish. The Lord lead us to glory in Christ
          crucified. Amen.
