          1. Inasmuch as certain men have set the truth aside, and bring in
          lying words and vain genealogies, which, as the apostle says,
          "minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith," and
          by means of their craftily-constructed plausibilities draw away the
          minds of the inexperienced and take them captive, [I have felt
          constrained, my dear friend, to compose the following treatise in
          order to expose and counteract their machinations.] These men falsify
          the oracles of God, and prove themselves evil interpreters of the good
          word of revelation. They also overthrow the faith of many, by drawing
          them away, under a pretence of [superior] knowledge, from Him who
          rounded and adorned the universe; as if, forsooth, they had something
          more excellent and sublime to reveal, than that God who created the
          heaven and the earth, and all things that are therein. By means of
          specious and plausible words, they cunningly allure the simple-minded
          to inquire into their system; but they nevertheless clumsily destroy
          them, while they initiate them into their blasphemous and impious
          opinions respecting the Demiurge; and these simple ones are unable,
          even in such a matter, to distinguish falsehood from truth.

          2. Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity, lest,
          being thus exposed, it should at once be detected. But it is craftily
          decked out in an attractive dress, so as, by its outward form, to make
          it appear to the inexperienced (ridiculous as the expression may seem)
          more true than the truth itself. One far superior to me has well said,
          in reference to this point, "A clever imitation in glass casts
          contempt, as it were, on that precious jewel the emerald (which is
          most highly esteemed by some), unless it come under the eye of one
          able to test and expose the counterfeit. Or, again, what inexperienced
          person can with ease detect the presence of brass when it has been
          mixed up with silver?" Lest, therefore, through my neglect, some
          should be carried off, even as sheep are by wolves, while they
          perceive not the true character of these men, -- because they
          outwardly are covered with sheep's clothing (against whom the Lord has
          enjoined us to be on our guard), and because their language resembles
          ours, while their sentiments are very different, -- I have deemed it
          my duty (after reading some of the Commentaries, as they call them, of
          the disciples of Valentinus, and after making myself acquainted with
          their tenets through personal intercourse with some of them) to unfold
          to thee, my friend, these portentous and profound mysteries, which do
          not fall within the range of every intellect, because all have not
          sufficiently purged their brains. I do this, in order that thou,
          obtaining an acquaintance with these things, mayest in turn explain
          them to all those with whom thou art connected, and exhort them to
          avoid such an abyss of madness and of blasphemy against Christ. I
          intend, then, to the best of my ability, with brevity and clearness to
          set forth the opinions of those who are now promulgating heresy. I
          refer especially to the disciples of Ptolemæus, whose school may be
          described as a bud from that of Valentinus. I shall also endeavour,
          according to my moderate ability, to furnish the means of overthrowing
          them, by showing how absurd and inconsistent with the truth are their
          statements. Not that I am practised either in composition or
          eloquence; but my feeling of affection prompts me to make known to
          thee and all thy companions those doctrines which have been kept in
          concealment until now, but which are at last, through the goodness of
          God, brought to light. "For there is nothing hidden which shall not be
          revealed, nor secret that shall not be made known."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thou wilt not expect from me, who am resident among the Keltæ, and
          am accustomed for the most part to use a barbarous dialect, any
          display of rhetoric, which I have never learned, or any excellence of
          composition, which I have never practised, or any beauty and
          persuasiveness of style, to which I make no pretensions. But thou wilt
          accept in a kindly spirit what I in a like spirit write to thee
          simply, truthfully, and in my own homely way; whilst thou thyself (as
          being more capable than I am) wilt expand those ideas of which I send
          thee, as it were, only the seminal principles; and in the
          comprehensiveness of thy understanding, wilt develop to their full
          extent the points on which I briefly touch, so as to set with power
          before thy companions those things which I have uttered in weakness.
          In fine, as I (to gratify thy long-cherished desire for information
          regarding the tenets of these persons) have spared no pains, not only
          to make these doctrines known to thee, but also to furnish the means
          of showing their falsity; so shalt thou, according to the grace given
          to thee by the Lord, prove an earnest and efficient minister to
          others, that men may no longer be drawn away by the plausible system
          of these heretics, which I now proceed to describe.
