          We know not by whom this Psalm was written, but we do know that it was
          sung in Solomon's temple (2 Chronicles 7:3,6), and by the armies of
          Jehoshaphat when they sang themselves into victory in the wilderness
          of Tekoa. From the striking form of it we should infer that it was a
          popular hymn among the Lord's ancient people. Most hymns with a solid,
          simple chorus become favorites with congregations, and this is sure to
          have been one of the best beloved. It contains nothing but praise. It
          is tuned to rapture, and can only be fully enjoyed by a devoutly
          grateful heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It commences with a threefold praise to the Triune Lord (verses 1-3),
          <br />
          then it gives us six notes of praise to the Creator (verses 4-9),
          <br />
          six more upon deliverance from Egypt (verses 10-15), <br />
          and seven upon the journey through the wilderness and the entrance
          into Canaan (verses 16-22). <br />
          Then we have two happy verses of personal gratitude for present mercy
          (verses 23-24), one (verse 25) to tell of the Lord's universal
          providence, and a closing verse to excite to never ending praise.<br />

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. O give thanks unto the LORD.</p></b> The
        exhortation is intensely earnest: the Psalmist pleads with the Lord's
        people with an "O", three times repeated. Thanks are the least that we
        can offer, and these we ought freely to give.
        <p align="justify">
          The inspired writer calls us to praise Jehovah for all his goodness to
          us, and all the greatness of his power in blessing his chosen. We
          thank our parents, let us praise our heavenly Father; we are grateful
          to our benefactors, let us give thanks unto the Giver of all good.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For he is good.</p></b> <i>Essentially </i>he is
        goodness itself, <i>practically </i>all that he does is good,
        <i>relatively </i>he is good to his creatures. Let us thank him that we
        have seen, proved, and tasted that he is good.
        <p align="justify">
          He is good beyond all others: indeed, he alone is good in the highest
          sense; he is the <i>source </i>of good, the good of all good, the
          sustainer of good, the perfecter of good, and the rewarder of good.
          For this he deserves the constant gratitude of his people.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">For his mercy endures forever.</p></b>We shall
        have this repeated in every verse of this song, but not once too often.
        It is the sweetest stanza that a man can sing. What joy that there is
        mercy, mercy with Jehovah, enduring mercy, mercy enduring forever. We
        are ever needing it, trying it, praying for it, receiving it: therefore
        let us forever <i> sing </i>of it.

          Moreover, for the moment assuming that the deities of the heathen were
          gods—yet none of them could be compared with our <i>Elohim</i>, who is
          infinitely beyond what they are fabled to be. Jehovah is our God, to
          be worshiped and adored, and he is worthy of our reverence to the
          highest degree.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the heathen cultivate the worship of their gods with zeal, how much
          more intently should we seek the glory of the God of gods—the only
          true and real God. Foolish people have gathered from this verse that
          the Israelites believed in the existence of many gods, at the same
          time believing that their Jehovah was the chief among them; but this
          is an absurd inference, since gods who have a God over them cannot
          possibly be gods themselves.

          The words are to be understood after the usual manner of human speech,
          in which things are often spoken of not as they really are, but as

          his mercy endures forever.

          Imagine supreme Godhead without everlasting mercy! It would then have
          been as fruitful a source of terror as it is now a fountain of

          right well do his nature and his acts deserve the gratitude of all his
          creatures.

        There are lords many, but Jehovah is the Lord of them. All lordship is
        vested in the Eternal. He makes and administers law, he rules and
        governs mind and matter, he possesses in himself all sovereignty and
        power.
        <p align="justify">
          All lords in the plural are summed up in this Lord in the singular; he
          is more lordly than all emperors and kings condensed into one. For
          this we may well be thankful, for we know the superior Sovereign will
          rectify the abuses of the underlings who now lord it over mankind. He
          will call these lords to his bar, and reckon with them for every
          oppression and injustice.

        <p align="justify">
          He is as truly the Lord of lords as he is Lord over the basest of the

        <b> <p align="justify">For his mercy endures forever.</p></b>Yes, he
        mingles mercy with his justice, and reigns for the benefit of his
        subjects. He pities the sorrowful, protects the helpless, provides for
        the needy, and pardons the guilty; and this he does from generation to
        generation, never wearying of his grace, "because he delights in mercy."
        <p align="justify">
          Let us arouse ourselves to laud our glorious Lord! A third time let us
          thank him who is our Jehovah, our God, and our Lord; and let this one

        he is alone in wonderland, the Creator and Worker of true marvels,
        compared with which all other remarkable things are as child's play.
        <p align="justify">
          His works are all great in wonder even when they are not great in

          None of the gods or the lords helped Jehovah in creation, or in the

          Even when the Lord uses men as his instruments—yet the wonder of the

          Praise is to be rendered to Jehovah, for his mercy endures forever.
          The mercy of the wonder is the wonder of the mercy; and the enduring
          nature of that mercy is the central wonder of that wonder. The Lord
          causes us often to sit down in amazement as we see what his mercy has
          wrought out and prepared for us: "wonders of grace to God belong",
          yes, great wonders and unsearchable. <i>Oh the depth! </i>Glory be to

        His goodness appears in creating the upper regions. He set his wisdom to
        the task of fashioning an atmosphere suitable for a world upon which
        mortal men should dwell. What a mass of wisdom lies hidden in this one
        creating act! The discoveries of our keenest observers have never
        searched out all the evidences of design which are crowded together in
        this work of God's hands. The lives of plants, animals, and men are
        dependent upon the fashioning of our heavens: had the skies been other
        than they are, we had not been here to praise God. Divine foresight
        planned the air and the clouds, with a view to the human race.

        This also is a creating miracle worthy of our loudest thanks. What could

        dry land to move upon—yet what could they see, and where could they go
        without light? Thanks be to the Lord, who has not consigned us to
        darkness. In great mercy he has not left us to an uncertain, indistinct
        light, floating about fitfully, and without order; but he has
        concentrated light upon two grand luminaries, which, as far as we are
        concerned, are to us "great lights."

          The Psalmist is making a song for common people, not for your critical

        for the third time in the Psalm, with the addition of the words, "his
        servant." The leasehold of Canaan to Israel after the flesh was made

          If we think of heavenly food, by which all saints are supplied, our
          praises rise to a still greater height. But meanwhile the universal
          goodness of God in feeding all his creatures is as worthy of praise as
          his special favors to the elect nation. Because the Lord feeds all
          life therefore we expect him to take special care of his own family.

        <b> <p align="justify">For his mercy endures forever.</p></b> Reaching
        downward even to beasts and reptiles, it is, indeed, a boundless mercy,
        which knows no limit because of the baseness of its object.

        The title is full of honor. The Lord is God in the highest realms, and
        among celestial beings. His throne is set in glory, above all, out of
        reach of foes, in the place of universal oversight.

          See herein the greatness of his nature, the depth of his
          condescension, and the range of his love. Mark the one sole cause of
          his bounty: <b>For his mercy endures forever. </b>He has done all
          things from this motive; and because his mercy never ceases, he will
          continue to multiply deeds of love world without end. Let us with all
          our powers of heart and tongue give thanks unto the holy name of
          Jehovah forever and ever!
