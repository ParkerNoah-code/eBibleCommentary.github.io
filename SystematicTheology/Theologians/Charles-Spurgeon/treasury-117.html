        <p align="justify">TITLE AND SUBJECT.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          This Psalm is one of pure praise, and contains but little which
          requires exposition.<i>
            A warm heart full of admiring adoration of the Most High will best
            of all comprehend this sacred hymn.</i
          >
          Its subject is the greatness and condescending goodness of the God of
          Israel, as exhibited in lifting up the needy from their low estate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may fitly be sung by the church during a period of revival after it
          has long been diminished and brought low.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          With this Psalm begins the Hallel, or Hallelujah of the Jews, which
          was sung at their solemn feasts. We will therefore call it
          <i> the Commencement of the Hallel</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Its allusions to the poor in the dust and the needy upon the dunghill
          are all in keeping with Israel in Egypt, and so also is the reference
          to the birth of numerous children where they were least expected.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">DIVISION.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          No division need be made in the exposition of this Psalm, except it be
          that which is suggested by the always instructive headings supplied by
          the excellent authors of our common version: an exhortation to praise
          God, for his excellency, 1-5; for his mercy, 6-9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Praise the LORD</p></b>, or Hallelujah,
        or praise to JAH, or praise to Jehovah. Praise is an essential offering
        at all the solemn feasts of the people of God. Prayer is the myrrh, and
        praise is the frankincense, and both of these must be presented unto the
        Lord.
        <i
          >How can we pray for mercy for the future, if we do not bless God for
          his love in the past? </i
        >The Lord has wrought all good things for us, let us therefore adore
        him. All other praise is to be excluded, the entire devotion of the soul
        must be poured out unto Jehovah only.
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise, O servants of the LORD.</p></b> You above
        all men, for you are bound to do so by your calling and profession. If
        God's own servants do not praise him, who will? You are a people near
        unto him, and should be heartiest in your loving gratitude.
        <p align="justify">
          While they were slaves of Pharaoh, the Israelites uttered groans and
          sighs by reason of their hard bondage; but now that they had become
          servants of the Lord, they were to express themselves in songs of joy.
          His service is perfect freedom, and those who fully enter into it
          discover in that service a thousand reasons for adoration.<i>
            They are sure to praise God best, who serve him best</i
          >; indeed, service is praise.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Praise the name of the LORD</p></b>. Extol his
        revealed character, magnify every sacred attribute, exult in all his
        doings, and reverence the very name by which he is called.
        <p align="justify">
          The name of Jehovah is thrice used in this verse, and may by us who
          understand the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity be regarded as a
          thinly veiled allusion to that holy mystery. Let Father, Son, and Holy
          Spirit, all be praised as the one, only, living, and true God. The
          close following of the words, "Hallelujah, Hallelu, Hallelu," must
          have had a fine effect in the public services. These were not vain
          repetitions, for the theme is one which we ought to dwell upon; it
          should be deeply impressed upon the soul, and perseveringly kept
          prominent in the life.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. Blessed be the name of the LORD.</p></b>
        While praising him aloud, the people were also to bless him in the
        silence of their hearts, wishing glory to his name, success to his
        cause, and triumph to his truth.
        <p align="justify">
          By mentioning the <i>name</i>, the Psalmist would teach us to bless
          each of the attributes of the Most High, which are as it were the
          letters of his name; not quarreling with his justice or his severity,
          nor servilely dreading his power—but accepting him as we find him
          revealed in the inspired word and by his own acts, and loving him and
          praising him as such.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            We must not give the Lord a new name nor invent a new nature, for
            that would be the setting up of a false God.
          </p></i
        >
        Every time we think of the God of Scripture we should bless him, and his
        august name should never be pronounced without joyful reverence.
        <b> <p align="justify">From this time forth.</p></b> If we have never
        praised him before, let us begin now. As the Passover stood at the
        beginning of the year it was well to commence the new year with blessing
        him who wrought deliverance for his people. Every solemn feast had its
        own happy associations, and might be regarded as a fresh starting place
        for adoration.

        <p align="justify">
          Are there not reasons why the reader should make the present day the
          opening of a year of praise? When the Lord says, "From this time I
          will bless you," we ought to reply, "Blessed be the name of the Lord
          from this time forth."
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And forevermore</p></b>: eternally. The Psalmist
        could not have intended that the divine praise should cease at a future
        date however remote. "Forevermore" in reference to the praise of God,
        must signify endless duration. Can our hearts ever cease to praise the
        name of the Lord? Can we imagine a period in which the praises of Israel
        shall no more surround the throne of the Divine Majesty? Impossible.
        Forever, and more than "forever," if more can be, let him be magnified.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
            the LORD'S name is to be praised.
          </p></b
        >
        From early morn until evening the ceaseless hymn should rise unto
        Jehovah's throne, and from east to west over the whole round earth pure
        worship should be rendered unto his glory.
        <p align="justify">
          So ought it to be; and blessed be God, we are not without faith that
          so it shall be. We trust that before the world's dread evening comes,
          the glorious name of the Lord will be proclaimed among all nations,
          and all people shall call him blessed. At the first proclamation of
          the gospel the name of the Lord was glorious throughout the whole
          earth; shall it not be much more so before the end shall be? At any
          rate, this is the desire of our souls. Meanwhile, let us endeavor to
          sanctify every day with praise to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a marvel of mercy that the sun should rise on the rebellious
          sons of men, and prepare for the undeserving fruitful seasons and days
          of pleasantness; let us for this <i>prodigy of goodness </i>praise the
          Lord of all. From hour to hour let us renew the strain, for each
          moment brings its mercy.

          <p align="justify">Verse 4. The Lord is high above all nations.</p></b
        >
        Though the Gentiles knew him not—yet was Jehovah their ruler: their
        false gods were no gods, and their kings were puppets in his hands. The
        Lord is high above all the learning, philosophy, and imagination of
        heathen sages, and far beyond the pomp and might of the monarchs of the
        nations. Like the great arch of the firmament, the presence of the Lord
        spans all the lands where dwell the varied tribes of men, for his
        providence is universal: this may well excite our confidence and praise.
        <b> <p align="justify">And his glory above the heavens</p></b>: higher
        than the loftiest part of creation; the clouds are the dust of his feet,
        and sun, moon, and stars twinkle far below his throne. Even the Heaven
        of heavens cannot contain him. His glory cannot be set forth by the
        whole visible universe, nor even by the solemn pomp of angelic armies;
        <i>it is above all conception and imagination, for he is God—infinite</i
        >. Let us above all adore him who is above all.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 5. Who is like unto the LORD our God?</p></b
        >The challenge will never be answered. None can be compared with him for
        an instant; Israel's God is without parallel. Our own God in covenant
        stands alone, and none can be likened unto him. Even those whom he has
        made like himself in some respects are not like him in godhead, for many
        of his divine attributes are incommunicable and inimitable.
        <i
          >None of the metaphors and figures by which the Lord is set forth in
          the Scriptures can give us a complete idea of him</i

        in Jesus is the Godhead seen—but he unhesitatingly declared "he who has
        seen me has seen the Father."
        <b> <p align="justify">Who dwells on high.</p></b> In the height of his
        abode none can be like him. His throne, his whole character, his person,
        his being, everything about him—is lofty, and infinitely majestic, so
        that none can be likened unto him. His serene mind abides in the most
        elevated condition, he is never dishonored, nor does he stoop from the
        pure holiness and absolute perfection of his character. His saints are
        said to dwell on high, and in this they are the reflection of his glory.
        But as for himself, the height of his dwelling place surpasses thought,
        and he rises far above the most exalted of his glorified people.

        He dwells so far on high that even to observe heavenly things, he must
        humble himself. He must stoop to view the skies, and bow to see what
        angels do. What, then, must be his condescension, seeing that he
        observes the humblest of his servants upon earth, and makes them sing
        for joy like Mary when she said, "You have regarded the low estate of

            Verse 7. He raises up the poor out of the dust.
          </p></b
        >
        This is an instance of his gracious stoop of love: he frequently lifts
        the lowest of mankind out of their poverty and degradation and adopts
        them into His family. His gracious Spirit is continually visiting the
        down-trodden, giving beauty for ashes to those who are cast down, and
        elevating the hearts of his mourners until they shout for joy. These
        upliftings of grace are here ascribed directly to the divine hand, and
        truly those who have experienced them will not doubt the fact that it is
        the Lord alone who brings his people up from the dust of sorrow and
        death. When no hand but his can help, he interposes and the work is
        done.
        <p align="justify">
          It is worth while to be cast down, to be so divinely raised from the

        <b> <p align="justify">And lifts the needy out of the dunghill</p></b>,
        whereon they lay like worthless refuse, cast off and cast out—left as
        they thought to rot into destruction, and to be everlastingly forgotten.
        <p align="justify">
          How great a stoop from the height of his throne, to a dunghill! How
          wonderful is that power which occupies itself in lifting up beggars,
          all befouled with the filthiness in which they lay! For he lifts them
          out of the dunghill, not disdaining to search them out from amidst the
          base things of the earth that he may by their means bring to nothing
          the great ones, and pour contempt upon all human glorying.

        made kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign forever and ever.
        Instead of poverty, he gives us the wealth of princes. Instead of
        dishonor, he gives us a more exalted rank than that of the great ones of
        the earth.
        <b> <p align="justify">Even with the princes of his people.</p></b>All
        his people are princes, and so the text teaches us that God places needy
        souls whom he favors among the princes of princes. He often enables
        those who have been most despairing to rise to the greatest heights of
        spirituality and gracious attainment, for those who once were last shall
        be first. Paul, though less than the least of all saints was,
        nevertheless, made to be not a whit behind the very chief of the
        apostles. In our own times, Bunyan, the blaspheming tinker, was raised
        into another apostle John, whose dream almost rivals the visions of the
        Apocalypse.

          Such verses as these should give great encouragement to those who are
          lowest in their own esteem. The Lord pours contempt upon princes; but
          as for those who are in the dust and on the dunghill, he looks upon
          them with compassion, acts towards them in grace, and in their case
          displays the riches of his glory by Christ Jesus. Those who have
          experienced such amazing favor should sing continual hallelujahs to
          the God of their salvation.

        >The strong desire of the easterns to have children caused the birth of
        offspring to be hailed as the choicest of favors, while barrenness was
        regarded as a curse; hence this verse is placed last as if to crown the
        whole, and to serve as a climax to the story of God's mercy.

          The glorious Lord displays his condescending grace in regarding those
          who are despised on account of their barrenness, whether it be of body
          or of soul. Sarah, Rachel, the wife of Manoah, Hannah, Elizabeth, and
          others were all instances of the miraculous power of God in literally
          fulfilling the statement of the psalmist. Women were not supposed to
          have a house until they had children; but in certain cases where
          childless women pined in secret the Lord visited them in mercy, and
          made them not only to have a house—but to <i>keep </i>it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Gentile church is a spiritual example upon a large scale of the
          gift of fruitfulness after long years of hopeless barrenness; and the
          Jewish church in the latter days will be another amazing display of
          the same quickening power. Long forsaken for her spiritual adultery,
          Israel shall be forgiven, and restored, and joyously shall she keep
          that house which now is left unto her desolate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Nor is this all, <i>each believer </i>in the Lord Jesus must at times
          have mourned his lamentable barrenness; he has appeared to be a dry
          tree yielding no fruit to the Lord, and yet when visited by the Holy
          Spirit, he has found himself suddenly to be like Aaron's rod which
          budded, and blossomed, and brought forth almonds.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Before we have been aware, our barren heart has kept house, and
          entertained the Savior, our graces have been multiplied as if many
          children had come to us at a single birth, and we have exceedingly
          rejoiced before the Lord. Then have we marveled greatly at the Lord
          who dwells on high, that he has deigned to visit such poor worthless
          things. Like Mary, we have lifted up our <i>Magnificat</i>, and like
          Hannah, we have said, "There is none holy as the Lord; for there is
          none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God."

          <p align="justify">
            In an endless circle let us bless the Lord, whose mercies never
            cease.
          </p></i
        >Let us praise him in youth, and all along our years of strength; and
        when we bow in the ripeness of abundant age, let us still praise the
        Lord, who does not cast off his old servants.
        <p align="justify">
          Let us not only praise God ourselves—but exhort <i>others </i>to do
          it; and if we meet with any of the needy who have been enriched, and
          with the barren who have been made fruitful—then let us join with them
          in extolling the name of him whose mercy endures forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Having been <i>ourselves </i>lifted from spiritual beggary and
          barrenness, let us never forget our former estate or the grace which
          has visited us—but world without end let us praise the Lord.
          Hallelujah.
