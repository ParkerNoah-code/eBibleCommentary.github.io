              TITLE. A Psalm of David. This is just such a psalm as the man
              after God's own heart would compose when he was about to become
              king in Israel. It is David all over, straight forward, resolute,
              devout; there is no trace of policy or vacillation, the Lord has
              appointed him to be king, and he knows it, therefore he purposes
              in all things to behave as befits a monarch who me the Lord
              himself has chosen.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              If we call this THE PSALM OF PIOUS RESOLUTIONS, we shall perhaps
              remember it all the more readily. After songs of praise a psalm of
              practice not only makes variety—but comes in most fittingly.<i>
                We never praise the Lord better than when we do those things
                which are pleasing in his sight.</i

              He would extol both the love and the severity, the sweets and the
              bitters, which the Lord had mingled in His experience; he would
              admire the justice and the goodness of the Lord. Such a song would
              fitly lead up to godly resolutions as to his own conduct, for that
              which we admire in our superiors we naturally endeavor to imitate.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              Mercy and judgment would temper the administration of David,
              because he had adoringly perceived them in the dispensations of
              his God.

              about it. We ought as much to bless the Lord for the judgment with
              which he chastens our sin, as for the mercy with which he forgives
              it<i
                >. There is as much love in the blows of God's hand as in the
                kisses of his mouth</i
              >. Upon a retrospect of their lives instructed saints scarcely
              know which to be most grateful for—the comforts which have, or the
              afflictions which nave purged them.

            <b> <p align="justify">Unto you, O LORD, will I sing.</p></b>
            <p align="justify">
              Jehovah shall have all our praise. The secondary agents of either
              the mercy or the judgment must hold a very subordinate place in
              one memory, and the Lord alone must be hymned by our heart. Our
              soul's sole worship must be the lauding of the Lord. The psalmist
              forsakes the minor key, which was soon to rule him in the one
              hundred and second psalm, and resolves that, come what may, he
              will sing, and sing to the Lord too, whatever others might do.

            <p align="justify">
              To be holy is to be wise; a perfect way is a wise way. David's
              <i>resolve </i>was excellent—but his <i>practice </i>did not fully
              tally with it. Alas! he was not always wise or perfect—but it was
              well that it was in his heart.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              A king had need be both sage and pure, and, if he be not so in
              intent, when he comes to the throne, his after conduct will be a
              sad example to his people.<i>

              of his high vocation. David longed for a more special and
              effectual visitation from the Lord before he began his reign.<i>
                If God be with us, we shall neither err in judgment nor
                transgress in character; his presence brings us both wisdom and
                holiness</i

              There are persons in courts who walk in a very crooked way,
              leaving the high road of integrity; and these, by short cuts, and
              twists, and turns, are often supposed to accomplish work for their
              masters which simple honest hearts are not competent to undertake.
              But David would not employ such, he would pay no secret service
              money, he loathed the practices of men who deviate from
              righteousness. He was of the same mind as the dying statesman who

              services of bad characters. A good master does well to choose a
              good servant; he may take a prodigal into his house for the
              sinner's good—but if he consults his own good he will look in
              another quarter.

              Wicked nursemaids and teachers have great influence for evil over
              the minds of little children, and ungodly servants often injure
              the morals of the older members of the family—and therefore great
              care should be exercised that godly servants should be employed as
              far as possible. Even irreligious men have the sense to perceive
              the value of Christian servants, and surely their own Christian
              brethren ought not to have a lower appreciation of them.

              Deceit among most orientals is reckoned to be a virtue, and is
              only censured when it is not sufficiently cunning, and therefore
              comes to be found out; it was therefore all the more remarkable
              that David should have so determinedly set his face against it. He
              could not tell what a deceitful man might be doing, what plots he
              might be contriving, what mischief he might be brewing, and
              therefore he resolved that he would at any rate keep him out of
              his house, that his palace might not become a den of villainy.
