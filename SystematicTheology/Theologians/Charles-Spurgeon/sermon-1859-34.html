        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.258)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 19th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"The mighty God." -- Isaiah 9:6.</p>
        <p>
          OTHER TRANSLATIONS of this divine title have been proposed by several
          very eminent and able scholars. Not that they have any of them been
          prepared to deny that this translation is after all most accurate; but
          rather that whilst there are various words in the original, which we
          render by the common appellation of "GOD," it might be possible so to
          interpret this as to show more exactly its definite meaning. One
          writer, for example, thinks the term might be translate! "The
          Irradiator," -- he who gives light to men. Some think it bears the
          meaning of "The Illustrious," -- the bright and the shining one. Still
          there are very few, if any, who are prepared to dispute the fact that
          our translation is the most faithful that could possibly be given --
          the mighty God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The term here used for God, El, is taken from a Hebrew or root, which,
          as I take it, signifies strength; and perhaps a literal translation
          even of that title might be, "The Strong one," the strong God. But
          there is added to this an adjective in the Hebrew, expressive of
          mightiness, and the two taken together express the omnipotence of
          Christ, his real deity and his omnipotence, as standing first and
          foremost among the attributes which the prophet beheld. "The mighty
          God." I do not propose this morning to enter into any argument in
          proof of the divinity of Christ, because my text dues not seem to
          demand it of me. It does not say that Christ shall be "the mighty
          God," -- that is affirmed in many other places of Sacred writ; but
          here it says, "He shall be called Wonderful," called "Counsellor,"
          called, "The mighty God;" and I think that therefore I may be excused
          from entering into any proof of the fact, if I am at least able to
          establish the truth of that which is here foretold, inasmuch as Christ
          is indeed called at this day, and shall be called to the end of the
          world, "the mighty God."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, this morning, I shall speak for a moment on the folly of those
          who profess to be his followers, but who do not call him "the mighty
          God." In the second place I shall try to show how the true believer
          practically calls Christ "the mighty God," in many of the acts which
          concern his salvation; and then I shall close by noticing how Jesus
          Christ has proved himself to be indeed "the mighty God " to us, and in
          the experience of his church.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First let note point out THE FOLLY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS TO BE THE
          DISCIPLES OF CHRIST, YET DO NOT, AND WILL, NOT, CALL HIM GOD. The
          question has sometimes been proposed to me, how it is that those of us
          who hold the divinity of Christ manifest what is called
          uncharitableness towards those who deny him. We do continually affirm
          that an error, with regard to the divinity of Christ, is absolutely
          fatal, and that a man cannot be right in his judgment upon any part of
          the gospel unless he think rightly of him who is personally the very
          center of all the purposes of heaven, and the foundation of all the
          hopes of earth. Nor can we admit of any latitudinarianism here. We
          extend the right hand of fellowship to all those who love the Lord
          Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth; but we cannot exchange our
          Christian greetings with those who deny him to be "very God of very
          God." And the reason is sometimes asked; for say our opponents, "We
          are ready to give the right hand of fellowship to you, why don't you
          do so to us?" Our reply shall be given thus briefly: "You have no
          right to complain of us, seeing that in this matter we stand on the
          defensive When you declare yourselves to believe that Christ is not
          the Son of God, you may not be conscious of it, but you have charged
          us with one of the blackest sins in the entire cataligue of crime.
          "The Unitarians must, to be existent, charge the whole of us, who
          worship Christ, with being idolators. Now idolatry is a sin of the
          most heinous character; it is not an offense against men it is true,
          but it is an intolerable offense against the majesty of God. We are
          ranked by Unitarians, if they be consistent, with the Hottentots.
          "No," say they, "we believe that you are sincere in your worship." So
          is the Hottentot; he bows down before his Fetich, his block of wood or
          stone, and he is an idolator; and although you charge us with bowing
          before a man, yet we do hold that you have laid at our cool a sin
          insufferably gross, and we are obliged to repel your accusation with
          some severity. You have so insulted us by denying the Godhead of
          Christ, you have charged us with so great a crime, that you cannot
          expect us to sit coolly down and blandly smile at the imputation. It
          matters not what a Man worships, if it be not God, he is an idolater.
          There is no distinction in principle between worship to a god of mud
          and a god of gold, nay further, there is no distinction between the
          worship of an onion and the worship of the sun, moon, and stars. These
          are alike idolatries. And though Christ be confessed by the Socinian
          to be the best of men, perfection's own self; yet if he be nothing
          more, the vast mass of the Christian world is deliberately assailed
          with the impudent accusation of being idolators. Yet those who charge
          us with idolatry, expect us to receive them with cordial kindness. It
          is not in flesh and blood for us to do so, if we take the low ground
          of reason; it is not in grace or truth to do so, if we take the high
          ground of revelation. As wren, we are willing to shew them respect, we
          regard them, we pray for them, we have no anger or enmity against
          them. But when we come to the point of theology, we cannot as we
          profess to be followers of Christ, tamely see ourselves charged with
          an offense so dreadful and so heinous as that of idol worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I confess I would almost rather be charged with a religion that
          extenuated murder, than with one that justified idolatry. Murder,
          great as the offense is, is but the slaying of man; but idolatry is in
          its essence the killing of God; it is the attempt to thrust the
          Eternal Jehovah out of his seat, and to foist into his place the work
          of his own hang, or the creature of my own conceit. Shall a man charge
          me with being so besotted as to worship a mere many shall he tell me I
          am so low and groveling in my intellect, that I should stoop down to
          worship my own fellow -- creature? and yet does he expect me after
          that to receive him as a brother professing the same faith? I cannot
          understand his presumption. The charge against our sanctity of heart
          is so tremendous, the accusation is so frightful, that if there have
          been some severity and bitterness of temper in the controversy, the
          sin lies upon our opponent, and not on us. For he has charged us with
          a crime so dreadful, that an upright man must repel it as an insult.
          But to go further; if Jesus Christ be not a Divine person -- if I
          could once imagine that he was no more than a mere man, I should
          prefer Mahomet to Christ; and if you ask me why, I think I could
          clearly prove to demonstration, that Mahomet was a greater prophet
          than Christ. If Jesus Christ be not the Son of God, coequal,
          co-eternal with the Father, he so spoke as to induce that belief in
          the minds of his own disciples, and of his adversaries likewise.
          Mahomet, with regard to the unity of the Godhead, is so clear and so
          distinct, that there is no Mahometan to this day, that has ever fallen
          into idolatry. You will find that throughout the whole of the
          Mahometan world the cry is still sternly uttered and faithfully
          believed, "There is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet." Now, if
          Christ were but a good man and a prophet, why did he not speak more
          decisively? Why has he not left on record a war cry for the Christian,
          which would be as explicit and decisive as that of Mahomet? If Christ
          did not mean to teach that he himself is God, at least he was not very
          clear and definite in his denial and he has left his disciples
          extremely in the dark, the proof whereof is to be found in the fact,
          that at the present day, nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every
          thousand of the whole of the professed followers of Christ, do receive
          him, and bow down before him, as being the very God. And if he it not
          God, I deny his right to be esteemed as a prophet. If he is not God,
          he was an impostor, the grandest, the greatest of deceivers that ever
          existed. This, of course, is no argument to the man who denies the
          faith, and does not avow himself to be a follower of Christ. But to
          the man that it Christ's follower, I do hold that the argument is
          irresistible, that Christ could not have been a good and great
          prophet, if he were not what ho certainly led us to believe himself to
          be, the Son of God, who thought it not robbery to be equal with God,
          -- he very God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not
          anything made that is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will say yet another thing, which may startle the believer, but
          which is intended rather to reduce the heterodox doctrine of Christ
          not being God, to an absurdity, If Christ were not the Son of God, his
          death, so far from being a satisfaction for sin, was a death most
          richly and righteously deserved. The Sanhedrim before which He was
          tried was the recognized and authorised legislature of the country. He
          was brought before that Sanhedrim, charged with blasphemy, and it was
          upon that charge that they condemned him to die, because he made
          himself the Son of God. Now, I do not hesitate honestly to aver, that
          if I had been called on to plead in that ease, I should have pleaded
          an avowal, and that moreover, I should have stood up, and said and
          felt, that I had a clear case before me, which nothing but lying and
          perjury could ever have put on one side, if Jesus of Nazareth had been
          charged with having declared himself to be the Son of God. Why, his
          whole preaching seemed to derive from thence it's unrivalled
          authority. There was continually in his actions and in his words, a
          claim to be something more than man ever could lay claim to. And when
          he was brought before the Sanhedrim, witnesses enough might have been
          found, to prove that he had made himself the Son of God; if he were
          not so, his condemnation for blasphemy was the justest sentence that
          ever was pronounced, and his crucifixion on Calvary, was absolutely
          the most righteous execution that ever was performed by the hand of
          the government. It is his being verily God, that frees him from the
          charge of blasphemy, It is the fact that he is God. and that his
          Godhead is not to be denied, that makes his death an unrighteous
          decide at the hand of apostate man, and renders it, as before God, an
          acceptable sacrifice for the sins of all the people whom he redeemed
          with his most precious blood But if he be not God, I do repeat, that
          there is no reason whatever, Why we should have had a New Testament
          written; for there would be then nothing in the sublime central-fact
          of that New Testament but the righteous execution of one, who
          certainly deserved to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you remember, my dear friends, when the apostle Paul was preaching
          on the resurrection of the dead, in his letter to the Corinthians, how
          he uses an ex post facto argument, to shoe, the natural consequences,
          if it were possible to overturn the truths He says, "If Christ be not
          risen, then is mar preaching vain,and your faith is also vain, and ye
          are yet in your sins." Now, I may fairly use the apostle's line of
          argument in reference to the Godhead and Sonship of Christ, of which
          his resurrection gave such a palpable demonstration: "If Christ be not
          the Son of God, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also
          vain, and ye are yet in your sins all our visions of heaven are
          blasted and withered; the brightness of our hope is quenched for ever;
          that rock on which our trust is built, turns out to be nothing better
          than mere sand if the divinity of Christ be not proved. All the joy
          and consolation we ever had in this world, in our belief that his
          blood was sufficient to atone for sin, has been but a dream of fancy
          and a "figment of idle brains;" all the communion we have ever had
          with him has been but an illusion and a trance, and all the hopes we
          have of beholding his face in glory, and of being satisfied when we
          awake in his likeness, are but the foulest delusions that ever cheated
          the hopes of man. Oh, my brethren, and can any of you believe that the
          blood of all the martyrs has been shed as a witness to a lie? Have all
          those who have rotted in Roman dungeons, or have been burned at the
          stake because they witnessed that Christ was God, died in vain?
          Verily, if Christ be not God, we are of all men the most miserable. To
          what purpose is the calumny and abuse that we have had to endure day
          after day; to what purpose are our repentance, our sighs, our tears;
          to what purpose is our faith; to what purpose have our fears and
          bodings been supplanted by our hope and confidence; to what purpose
          our joy and our rejoicing, if Christ be not the Son of God? Will you
          put yourselves all down for fools; can you imagine that God's Word has
          misguided you; that prophets and apostles, and martyrs and saints,
          have all leagued together to lead you into a trap and to delude your
          souls? God forbid that we should think such a thing. There is no folly
          in the world that has in it so much as a do it of madness, compared
          with the folly of denying the divinity of Christ, and then professing
          to be his followers. No, beloved:
        </p>
        <p>"Let all the forms that men devise,</p>
        <p>Assault our faith with treacherous art;</p>
        <p>We'll call them vanity and lies,</p>
        <p>And bind the gospel to our heart!"</p>
        <p>
          We will write this on the forefront of our banner, -- Christ is God;
          co-equal and co-eternal with his Father; very God of very God, who
          counted it not robbery to be equal with God."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings me to the second part of the subject: HOW DO WE CALL
          CHRIST "THE DIGNITY GOD?" Here there is no dispute whatever; I am now
          about to speak of matters of pure fact. Whether Christ be mighty God
          or not, it is quite certain that we are in the constant habit of
          calling him so. Not, I mean, by the mere utterance of the term, but we
          do so in a stronger way -- n fact; -- and actions speak louder than
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, I will soon prove that you and I are in the habit of
          calling Christ God. And I will prove it first, because it is our
          delight, and our joy and our privilege to attribute to him the
          attributes of Deity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hours of devout contemplation, how often do we look up to him as
          being the Eternal Son. You and I sit down in our chambers, and in our
          house of prayer, and as we muse upon the great covenant of grace, we
          are in the habit of speaking of our Lord Jesus Christ's everlasting
          love to his people. This is one of the jewels of our life, one of the
          ornaments with which we array ourselves as a bride doth. This is a
          part of the manna that tasteth like wafers made with honey upon which
          our souls are wont to feed. We speak of God's eternal love, of our
          names having been inscribed in his eternal book, and of Christ's
          having borne them from before the foundation of the world upon his
          breast, as our great high-priest, our remembrancer before the throne
          of heaven. In so doing, we have virtually called him the mighty God;
          because none but God could have been from everlasting to everlasting.
          As often as we profess the doctrine of election, we call Christ the
          mighty God; as often as me talk of the eternal covenant, ordered in
          all things and sure, so often do we proclaim him to be God: because we
          speak of him as an everlasting one, and none could be from everlasting
          but one who is self-existent, who is God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: how frequently do we repeat over to ourselves that precious
          verse, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever." We
          are always in the habit of ascribing to him immutability. Some of our
          choicest hymns are founded on that circumstance, and our richest hopes
          flow from that attribute. We know that all things will change. We are
          convinced that we ourselves are mutable as the winds, and as easily
          moved as the sand by the waves of the sea; but we know that our
          Redeemer liveth, and we cannot entertain a suspicion of any change in
          his love, his purpose, or his power How often do we sing: --
        </p>
        <p>"Immutable his will</p>
        <p>Though dark may be my frame,</p>
        <p>His loving heart is still Unchangeably the same.</p>
        <p>My soul through many changes goes:</p>
        <p>His love no variation knows!"</p>
        <p>
          Do you not see that you have in fact called him God, because none but
          God is immutable? The creature changes. This is written on the
          forefront of creation -- "Change!" The mighty ocean, that knows no
          furrows on its brow, changeth at times, and at times shifteth its
          level. It moveth hither and thither, and we know that it is to be
          licked up with forked tongues of flame, and yet we ascribe to Christ
          immutability. We do, then, in fact, ascribe to him, divinity; for,
          none but the divine can be immutable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not also our joy to believe that wherever two or three are
          gathered together in Christ's name, there is he in the midst of them?
          Do we not repeat it in all our prayer-meetings? Perhaps some minister
          in Australia began the solemnities of public worship this day with the
          reflection that Jesus Christ was with him, according to his promise,
          and I know that as I came here the same reflection comforted me, "Yea,
          I am with you always even to the end of the world," -- That wherever a
          Christian is found, there God is. And though there be but two or three
          met in a barn, or on the greensward under the canopy of God's blue
          sky, yet there Christ vouchsafes his presence. Now I ask you, have we
          not ascribed to Christ, omnipresence; and who can be omnipotent but
          God? Have we not thus in feet then, though not in words, called Christ
          "God?" How is it possible for us to dream of Him as being here, and
          there, and everywhere; in the bosom of his Father, with the angels,
          and in the hearts of the contrite all at the same time, if he be not
          God? Grant me that he is omnipresent, and you have said that he is
          God, for none but God can be present everywhere. Again, are we not
          also wont to ascribe to Christ omnisience? You believe when your heart
          is aching that Christ knows your pains, and that he reckons every
          groan; or at least if you do not believe it, it is always my
          satisfaction to know that --
        </p>
        <p>"He feels at his heart,</p>
        <p>All my sighs and my groans."</p>
        <p>
          And so he does yours. Wherever you are, you believe that he hears your
          prayers that he sees your tears, that he knows your wants, that he is
          ready to pardon your sins; that you are better known to him, than you
          are to yourself. You believe that he searches your hearts, and tries
          your reins, and that you never can come to him without finding him
          full of sympathy, and full of love. Now do you not see that you have
          ascribed conscience to him. and therefore, though not in words, you
          have, in accents louder than words, called him the mighty God, for you
          have assumed that he is omniscient; and who can be omniscient but the
          very God of very God?
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not stop to descant upon the other attributes, but I think we
          might prove that we have each of us ascribed to Christ all the
          attributes of the Godhead in our daily life and in our constant trust
          and intercession. I am sure that it is true of many loving hearts of
          God's own children here. We have called him the mighty God, and it
          others have not called him so, nevertheless the text is verified by
          our faith. "He shall be called wonderful, counsellor, the mighty God."
          So he is, and so he shall be, world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I have another proof to offer, that Christ is called "the
          mighty God." We call him so in many of his offices. We believe this
          morning that Christ is the mediator between God and man If we would
          understand the term mediator or daysman, we must interpret it as Job
          did; one "that might lay his hand upon us both." We are accustomed to
          say that Jesus Christ is the mediator of the new covenant, and we
          offer our prayers to God through him, because we believe that he
          mediates between us and the Father. Let it once be granted then that
          Christ is the mediator, and you have asserted his divinity. You have
          virtually called him the Son of God; and you have granted his
          humanity, for he must put his hand upon both; therefore he must put
          his hand upon man in our nature, he must be touched with a feeling of
          our infirmities, and be in all points like as we are. But he is not a
          mediator unless he can put his hand upon God, unless as fellow of the
          Eternal One he shall be able without blasphemy to place his hand upon
          the divine Being. There is no mediatorship unless the hand is put on
          both and who could put his hand on God but God? Can cherubim or
          seraphim talk of laying their hands on the Divine? Shall they touch
          the Infinite? "Dark with insufferable light his skirts appear" -- then
          what is He Himself in the glorious Essence of Deity? -- an
          all-devouring and consuming fire. Only God can put his hand on God,
          and yet Christ hath this high prerogative, for mark, there is no
          mediatorship established, there cannot be, unless the two are linked.
          If you wished to build a bridge you might commence on this aide of the
          river, but if you have not connected it with the other aide, you have
          not built the bridge. There can be no mediatorship unless the parties
          are fully linked. The ladder must have its feet on earth but it must
          reach to heaven, for if there were a single breach we should fall from
          its summit and perish. There must be entire communication between the
          two. Do you not see therefore that in calling Christ mediator we have
          in feet called him the mighty God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, we call Christ our Saviour. Now, have any of you that
          foolish credulity which would lead you to trust in a man for the
          everlasting salvation of your soul? If you have, I pity you: your
          proper place is not in a Protestant assembly, but among the deluded
          votaries of Rome. If you can commit the keeping of your soul to one
          like yourself, I must indeed mourn over you, and pray that you may be
          taught better. But you do trust your salvation to him whom God hath
          set forth for a propitiation, do you not, O follower of Jesus? Can you
          not say all your hope is fixed on him, for he is all your salvation
          and all your desire? Does not your spirit rest on that unbuttressed
          pillar of his entire satisfaction, his precious death and burial, his
          glorious resurrection and ascension? Now, observe, you are either
          resting on man, or else you have declared Christ to be "the mighty
          God." When I say I put my faith in him, I do most honestly declare
          that I dare not trust even to him, if I did not believe him to be God.
          I could not put my trust in any being that was merely, created. God
          forbid that my folly should ever go to such an extent as that. I would
          sooner trust myself than trust any other man, and yet I dare not trust
          myself, for I should be accursed. "Cursed is he that trusteth in man,
          and maketh flesh his arm. "And would the Socinian have me to believe
          that I am to preach faith in Christ, and that yet, if my hearers trust
          Christ, they will be accursed, as they assuredly meat be, if he is
          nothing but man, for again I repeat it, "cursed is he that trusteth in
          man, and maketh flesh his arm." You get a blessing by faith in Jesus,
          but how? Is it not because -- "Blessed is he that trusteth in the
          Lord, and whose hope the lord is? "Christ is very Jehovah, and
          therefore the blessing comes to those who trust in him. So, then, as
          often as ye put your trust in Jesus, for time and eternity, ye have
          called hind "the mighty God."
        </p>
        <p>
          This subject is capable of the greatest expansion, and I do believe
          there is sufficient interest attaching to it to warrant me in keeping
          you to a late hour this day, but I shall not do so. There has been
          enough said, I think, to prove at least, that we are in the habit
          continually of calling Christ "the mighty God."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. My third proposition is to explain to you now CHRIST HAS PROVED
          HIMSELF TO US TO BE "THE MIGHTY GOD." And here beloved, without
          controversy, great is the mystery of Godliness, for the passage from
          which the text is taken says, "Unto us a child is born." A child! what
          can that do? A child it totters in its walk, it trembles in its steps
          -- and it is a child newly born. Born! what an infant hanging on its
          mother's breast, an infant deriving its nourishment from a woman?
          That! can that work wonders? Yea, saith the prophet, "Unto us a child
          is born." But then it is added, "Unto us a Son is given." Christ was
          not only born, but given. As man he is a child born, as God he is the
          Son given. He emotes down from ml high; he is given by God to become
          our Redeemer. But here behold the wonder! "His name is name," this
          child's name, "shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God."
          Is this child, then, to us the mighty God? If so, brethren, without
          controversy, great is the mystery of Godliness indeed! And yet, just
          let us look, look through the history of the church, and discover
          whether we have not ample evidence to substantiate it. This child
          born, this Son given, came into the world to enter into the lists
          against sin. For thirty years and upwards he had to struggle and
          wrestle against temptations more numerous and more terrible than man
          had ever known before. Adam fell when but a woman tempted him; Eve
          fell when but a serpent offered fruit to her, but Christ, the second
          Adam, stood invulnerable against all the shafts of Satan though
          tempted he was in all points, like as we are. Not one arrow out of the
          quiver of hell was spared; the whole were shot against him. Every
          arrow was aimed against him with all the might of Satan's are here,
          and that is no little! And yet, without sin or taint of sin, more then
          conqueror he stood. Foot to foot with Satan, in the solitude of the
          wilderness hand to hand with him on the top of the pinnacle of the
          temple; side by side with him in the midst of a busy crowd -- yet ever
          more than conqueror. He gave him battle wherever the adversary willed
          to meet him, and at last, when Satan gathered up all his might, and
          seized the Saviour in the garden of Gethsemne, and crushed him till he
          sweat as it were greet drops of blood, then when the Saviour said,
          "Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt," the tempter was
          repulsed. "Hence, hence!" Christ seemed to say; and away the tempter
          fled, nor dare return again. Christ, in all his conquests over sin,
          does seem to me to have established his Godhead. I never heard of any
          other creature that could endure such temptation as this. Look at the
          angels in heaven. How temptation entered there I know not; but this I
          know, that Satan, the great archangel, sinned, and I know that he
          became the tempter to the rest of his companions, and drew with him a
          third part of the stars of heaven. Angels were but little tempted,
          some of them not tempted at all, and yet they fell. And then look at
          man; slight was his temptation, yet he fell. It is not in a creature
          to stand against temptation; he will yield, if the temptation be
          strong enough. But Christ stood, and it seems to me, that in his
          standing he proved Himself to have the omni-radient purity, the
          immaculate holiness of Him before whom angels veil their faces, and
          cry, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth."
        </p>
        <p>
          But these proofs might appear insufficient, if he did not accomplish
          more than this. We know also that Christ proved himself to be the
          "mighty God" from the feet that at last all the sins of all his people
          were gathered upon his shoulders, and "he bare them in his own body on
          the tree." The heart of Christ became like a reservoir in the midst of
          mountains. All the tributary streams of iniquity, and every drop of
          the sins of his people, ran down and gathered into one vast lake, deep
          as hell, and shoreless as eternity. All these met, as it were, in
          Christ's heart, and yet he endured them all. With many a sign of human
          weakness, but with convincing signs of divine omnipotence, he took all
          our griefs and carried all our sorrows. The divinity within
          strengthened his manhood, and though wave after wave rolled over his
          head, till he sank in deep mire where there was no standing, and all
          Gods waves and his billows had gone over him, yet did he lift up his
          he ad, and snore than a conqueror, at length, he put the sins of his
          people to a public execution. They are dead. They have ceased to be;
          and, if they be sought for, they shall not be found any more for ever.
          Certainly if this be true, he is "the mighty God" indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he did more than this, he descended into the grave, and there he
          slept, fast fettered with the cold chains of death. But the appointed
          hour arrives -- the sunlight of the third day gave the warning, and he
          snapped the bands of death as if they were but tow, and came forth to
          life as "the Lord of life and glory." His flesh did not see
          corruption, for he was not able to be holden by the bands of death.
          And who shall be the death of death, the plague of the grave, the
          destroyer of destruction, but God? Who but immortal life, who but the
          Self-existent, shall trample out the fires of hell; who, but he whose
          Being is eternal, without beginning, and without end, shall burst the
          shackles of the grave? He proved himself then, when he led captivity
          captive, and crushed death and ground his iron limbs to powder -- he
          proved himself then to be the mighty God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, my soul, thou canst say, that he has proved himself in thy heart
          to be a mighty God. Sins, many hath he forgiven thee and relieved thy
          conscience of the keen sense of guilt, griefs innumerable hath he
          assuaged, temptations insurmountable hath he overcome; virtues once
          impossible hath he implanted, grace in its fullness hath he promised,
          and in its measure hath he given. My soul bears record that what has
          been done for me could never have been done by a mere man; and you
          would rise from your seats, I am sure, if it were needful, and say,
          "Yes, he that hath loved me, washed me from my sins, and made me what
          I am, must be God, none but God could do what he has done, could bear
          so patiently, could bless so lavishly, forgive so freely, enrich so
          infinitely. He is, he must be, we will crown him such -- "The mighty
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, in conclusion, lest I weary you, permit me now to say, I beg and
          beseech of you all present, as God the Spirit shall help you, come and
          put your trust in Jesus Christ, he is "the mighty God." Oh,
          Christians, believe him more than ever, cast your troubles constantly
          on him; he is "the mighty God;" go to Him in all your dilemmas, when
          the enemy cometh in like a flood, this mighty God shall make a way for
          your deliverance; take to him your griefs, this mighty God can
          alleviate them all; tell him your backslidings and sins, this mighty
          God shall blot them out. And, O sinners, ye that feel your need of a
          Saviour, come to Christ and trust him for he is "the mighty God." Go
          to your houses, and fall on your knees and confess your sins, and then
          cast your poor, guilty, helpless, naked, defenceless souls before his
          omnipotence, for he is able to save unto the uttermost them that come
          unto God by him, because when he died he was not manhood, without
          divinity, but he was "the mighty God." This, I say, we will write on
          our banners, from this day forth and for ever; this shall be our joy
          and our song -- the child bow and the son given is to us "the mighty
          God."
