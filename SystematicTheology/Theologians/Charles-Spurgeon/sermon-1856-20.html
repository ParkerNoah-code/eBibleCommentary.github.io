        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.74)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 13, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties
          of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy
          youth." -- Psalm 110:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never verse in the Scripture has puzzled me more than this to find out
          its meaning and its connection. In reading it over hastily, at first
          sight, it may appear very easy; but if you search into it very
          carefully you will find you can with difficulty string the words
          together, or give them any intelligible meaning. I have taken down all
          the commentators I have in my possession; I find they all give a
          meaning to the words, but not a soul of them -- not even Dr. Gill --
          gives a connected meaning to the whole sentence. After looking at the
          old translations, and employing every means in my power to discover
          the meaning, I found myself as far off as when I began. Matthew Henry,
          one of the wisest commentators, certainly the best for family reading,
          makes the passage read as if it were like this: "Thy people shall come
          willingly in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness. In the
          womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth." That is how he
          explains it, though he does not say that is the proper translation. He
          explains the last sentence, "Thou hast the dew of thy youth," as
          meaning that in early life, from the womb of the morning, young people
          would give themselves to Jesus Christ. But it is no such thing. There
          is a colon at the word "morning," dividing the sentence. Besides, it
          does not say, the "people shall be willing; thou hast the dew of their
          youth," as it would read if it were as the expositors understand it;
          but it says to Christ, "Thou hast the dew of thy youth." It was not
          until we had thoroughly looked at the connection of the verse, and
          tried to catch the scope of the Psalm, that we thought we had hit upon
          its meaning; and even now we shall leave it with your judgment to
          decide whether or not we have gained the mind of the Spirit, as we
          hope we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalm is a kind of coronation Psalm. Christ is bidden to take his
          throne: "Sit thou at my right hand." The sceptre is put into his hand.
          "The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion." And then
          the question is asked, "Where are his people?" For a king would be no
          king without subjects. The highest title of kingship is but an empty
          one that hath no subjects to make up its fulness. Where, then, shall
          Christ find that which shall be the fulness of him that filleth all in
          all? The great anxiety we have is not whether Christ is king or not:
          -- we know he is; he is the Lord of creation and of providence; our
          anxiety is about his subjects. Ofttimes do we ask, "O Lord, where
          shall we find thy subjects?" When we have preached to hard hearts, and
          prophesied to dry bones, our unbelief at times says, "Where shall we
          find children for Christ? Where shall we find people who will
          constitute the subjects of his empire?" Our fears are all put to rest
          by this passage: "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power,
          in the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning;" and by the
          second promise, "Thou hast the dew of thy youth." These thoughts are
          placed here to allay the anxieties of God's believing people, and to
          let them see how Christ shall indeed be king, and never lack a
          multitude of subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, here is a promise concerning his people; and secondly, here is
          a promise concerning Christ himself, that he shall always be as
          strong, as fresh, as new, and as mighty a Christ as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we shall look at THE PROMISE MADE TO CHRIST'S PEOPLE. "Thy
          people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of
          holiness from the womb of the morning." Here is a promise of time; "in
          the day of thy power." Here is a promise of people: "thy people." Here
          is a promise of disposition: "thy people shall be willing." Here is a
          promise of character: "thy people shall be willing in the beauties of
          holiness." And here is a majestic figure to show the manner in which
          they shall be brought forth. By a very bold metaphor, they are said to
          come out as mysteriously as the dew drops from the womb of the
          morning. We know not how, but they are produced by God. "Thy people
          shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of
          holiness." In the womb of the morning they shall come.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, here is a promise concerning time. Christ is not to gather
          in his people every day, but on one special day, the day of his power.
          It is not the day when man feels himself to be the most mighty, that
          souls are gathered; for alas! God's servants sometimes preach until
          their self-complacency tells them they have been exceedingly eloquent
          and mighty, and that, therefore, men must be saved: but there is no
          promise that in the day of our power we shall ever see men gathered to
          Christ. There are times too when the people seem to have a great power
          of seeking after God, and when they have the power of hearing, but
          there is no promise that just when an excitement reigns, and when
          there appears to be power in the creature, that such a day shall be
          the day of God's ingathering. It is "the day of thy power" -- not of
          the minister's power, nor of the hearers'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day of God's power -- when is it? We take it, it is the day when
          God pours out his own power upon the minister, so that God's children
          are gathered in by his preaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are times, beloved, when the ordained servant of the living God
          will have nothing to do in preaching, but just to open his mouth and
          allow the words to flow. He will scarcely need stay to think, but the
          thoughts will be injected into his mind, and while he preaches he will
          feel there is a power accompanying his word. His hearers too will
          discern it. Some of them will feel as if they were sitting under a
          sledge hammer, beating on their hearts. Others will feel as if truth
          were stealing into their hearts and slaying all their unbelief, in
          such a way that they could not resist the blessed power. It will often
          happen that God's children will find an influence and a might
          irresistible going with the word. They have heard that minister
          before, they were delighted with him, they trusted that they had been
          edified on good soil, every blow hit the mark, there was no arrow shot
          which did not go into the centre of the soul -- there was not a
          syllable uttered which was not like the word of Jehovah himself,
          speaking either from Sinai, or Calvary. Have you never known such
          times? Have you not felt them when you have been standing or sitting
          in the house of God? Ah! those are times when God, by the
          manifestation of himself, is pleased to enlighten his children, to
          gather in his people, and to make poor sinners willing. There is also
          a day of power in every sinner's heart; for, alas! the general day of
          power which occurs to our congregation omits many -- many over whom we
          have to weep -- while hundreds shed tears of penitence, other hundreds
          sit stolid and unmoved. While some hearts leap for very joy, others
          are bound in the fetters of ignorance, and are sleeping the sleep of
          death. While God is pouring out his Spirit till some hearts are full
          to the very brim, ready to burst, there are some dry, without a drop
          of the heavenly moisture. But the day of God's power is a day of
          personal power in our souls, like that day of Zaccheus when the Lord
          said, "Make haste, and come down." It is a day not of argument of man,
          but a day of omnipotent power -- God working in the heart. It is not a
          day of intellectual enlightenment, a day of instruction merely, but a
          day when God shall enter into the heart, and with a mighty hand shall
          wrench the will and turn it as he would -- shall make the judgment
          judge righteously, the imagination think as it ought, and shall guide
          the whole soul to himself. Did you never think what power that was
          which God exerts in every individual heart? There is no power like it.
          Should a man command the mighty waterfalls to congeal and stand, in
          heaps? If they should obey him, he would not have worked a miracle
          half so mighty as that which God works in the heart when he bids the
          floods of sin to cease flowing. Could I command Etna with its flames
          and smoke to cease its ebullitions, and should it at once be still, I
          had not worked a deed so mighty as when God speaks to a boiling spirit
          sending forth fire and smoke, and bids it stay. The everlasting God
          exhibits more power in turning a sinner from the error of his ways,
          than in the creation of a world or the sustentation of an universe. In
          the day of God's power, God's people shall be willing. Beloved, we
          also look for a day of power in the coming period of the reign of
          Jesus Christ. I take it there is a time coming when the feeblest among
          us shall be as David, and when David shall be as the angel of the
          Lord. The time is approaching when every poor ignorant minister shall
          preach with power, and when every child of God shall be filled with
          the knowledge of God. We hope for a happy day when Christ shall come
          and shall cause the knowledge of the Lord to be spread so rapidly that
          it shall cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea. We often cheer
          ourselves with this subject -- well, if we do labour in vain and spend
          our strength for nought now, it will not be so always; the day will
          come when the fresh wind of the Spirit will fill the sails of the
          church, and she shall go swiftly along; when the feeble hand of the
          minister shall be as mighty as the hand of the boldest Christian
          warrior who ever wielded the sword of the Spirit; when every word of
          Christ shall be as ointment poured forth, spreading perfume over a
          sinful world; when we shall never preach a sermon without effect;
          when, as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, it not only
          shall not return void, but shall water the earth, so that having
          already brought forth and budded, it shall bring forth fruit to the
          glory of God -- that fruit, the destruction of idols, and the casting
          down of all false religions. Happy day, that day of power! Christians!
          why do you not pray for it? Why do ye not ask that God would give his
          people might, and that Christ may speedily come and find his people
          willing?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, however, another translation to these words. Calvin
          translates them, "at the time of the assembling of their army," "au
          jour des montres" "in the day of the review." You sometimes say, "Oh!
          if a great struggle were to occur, where would be found the men to
          fight for Christ?" We have heard timid believers say, "Oh, I am afraid
          if persecution should set in, we should find very few valiant for
          truth -- few ministers would come forward boldly to uphold the gospel
          of Christ." No such thing, believer! Christ's people will be willing
          in the day of God's armies. God never had a battle to fight yet when
          he could say, "I have no soldiers in reserve." God never had an
          arduous campaign in which his armies were insufficient. Once the
          prophet said, Zechariah I.18-21, "Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw,
          and behold four horns. And I said unto the angel that talked with me,
          What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have
          scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. And the Lord showed me four
          carpenters. Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying,
          These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did
          lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the
          horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of
          Judah to scatter it." God had enough men to cut off the horns, and to
          build his house, there were four; and he had the right sort of men
          ready to do his work; for "carpenters" were ready. Whenever a struggle
          is approaching God will find his men. Whenever a battle is to
          commence, God will find the men valiant for truth. Never be afraid
          that God will not take care of his church. "Thy people shall be
          willing in the day of God's battle." Are you undertaking some noble
          enterprise? Are you saying, "Here is a grand endeavour to evangelize
          the world; where shall we find people? The answer is, "God's people
          shall be willing in the day of his armies." Some Sunday-school
          teachers are complaining, that in their church they cannot find enough
          to canvass the district. Why not? Because they have not enough of
          God's people, for God's people are willing in the day of his armies.
          We have complained that we cannot get ministers to evangelize. Why
          not? Because they are not thoroughly imbued with the Master's Spirit,
          for his people would be willing in the day of God's armies when they
          are wanted. They always have willing hearts to be ready for the
          battle. They do not say, "I must consult flesh and blood." No, there
          is the standard; up go God's soldiers! There is the battle; out go
          their swords! They are ready for the fight at once. They are always
          ready in the day of God's armies. Beloved, fear no struggle; dread no
          enterprise; neither think that the silver and the gold will be
          withholden from us -- "The silver and the gold are mind, and the
          cattle on a thousand hills." Think not, however grand your ideas, that
          you shall fail therein. God's people will come forward willingly when
          he requires their aid. We believe that truth firmly; but we must wait
          for God's day; we must pray for God's day; we must hope for it; we
          must labour for it, and when it comes, God shall find his people
          willing, as they ought to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Next, we have here the promise of a people, "Thy people shall be
          willing in the day of thy power" -- nobody else. Here is a promise
          that Christ shall always have a people. In the darkest ages Christ has
          always had a church; and if darker times shall come, he will have his
          church still. Oh! Elijah, thy unbelief is foolish. Thou sayest, "I,
          only I, am left alone, and they seek my life." Nay, Elijah, in those
          caves of the earth God has his prophets, hidden by seventies. Thou,
          too, poor unbelieving Christian, at times thou sayest, "I, even I, am
          left." Oh! if thou hadst eyes to see, if thou couldst travel a little,
          thy heart would be glad to find that God does not lack a people. It
          cheers my heart to find that God has a family everywhere. We do not go
          anywhere but we find really earnest hearts -- men full of prayer. I
          bless God that I can say, concerning the church wherever I have been,
          though they are not many, there are a few, who sigh and groan over the
          sorrows of Israel. There are chosen bands in every church, thoroughly
          earnest men who are looking out for, and are ready to receive their
          Master, who cry to God that he would send them times of refreshing
          from the presence of the Lord. Do not be too sad; God has a people,
          and they are willing now; and when the day of God's power shall come,
          there is no fear about the people. Religion may be at a low ebb, but
          it never was at such a low ebb that God's ship was stranded. It may be
          ever so low, but the devil shall never be able to cross the river of
          Christ's church dry shod. He shall always find abundance of water
          running in the channel thereof. God grant us grace to look out for his
          people, believing that there are some everywhere, for the promise is,
          "thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We next come to disposition. God's people are a willing people.
          Adam Clarke says, -- "This verse has been woefully perverted. It has
          been supposed to point out that irresistible operation of the grace of
          God on the souls of the elect, thereby making them willing to receive
          Christ as their Saviour." A doctrine which he utterly discards. Well,
          my dear Adam Clarke, we are extremely obliged to you for your remark,
          but at the same time we think that the text has not been "woefully
          perverted." We believe that the text has been very properly used to
          show that God makes men willing. For if we read our Bibles rightly, we
          understand that men, by nature, are not willing; for there is a text
          you are extremely fond of which we do not think belongs to you, and
          which says, "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." "No
          man can come unto me, except the Father which has sent me, draw him."
          If you would remember that, we think, even though the text does not
          teach it, you might at least have some respect for the doctrine; but
          it says, God's people shall be willing in the day of God's power; and
          if we read it as plain English people, we look from this text that
          there must be a work of his grace making men willing in the day of
          God's power. We do not know whether you think that fair logic. We
          think it is. We have been accused of having no logic, and we are not
          particularly sorry about that, for we would rather have what men call
          dogmatism than logic. It is Christ's to prove; it is ours to preach.
          We leave argument to Christ; for us, we have only to affirm what we
          see in God's Word. God's people are to be a willing people. We can
          tell who are the children by the fact that they are willing. I preach
          to many of you times without number. I tell you of hell; I bid you
          flee from it; I tell you of Christ; I bid you look to him, but you are
          unwilling to do so. What do I conclude from that? Either that the day
          of God's power has not yet come, or that you are not God's people.
          When I preach with power, and the word is dispensed with unction, if I
          see you unmoved and unsettled, unwilling to cast yourselves on Jesus
          Christ, what say I? Why, I fear those are not God's people, for God's
          people are willing in the day of his power, willing to submit to
          sovereign grace, to give themselves up into the hands of the Mediator,
          to hang simply on his cross for salvation. I ask again what has made
          them willing? Must it not have been something in grace which has
          turned their will? If the will of man be purely free to do right or
          wrong, I conjure you, my friends, to answer this: if it be so, why do
          you not turn to God this very moment without divine assistance? It is
          because you are not willing, and it needed a promise that God's people
          should be willing in the day of his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this word applies not only to their being willing to be saved,
          but willing to work after they are saved. Did you ever know a minister
          who preached on the Sunday, but who at the prayer-meeting on the
          Monday night seemed as if he would much rather be at home? And if
          there was a lecture on Thursday, did not he, poor man, come up as if
          he were about to perform some enormously hard duty? What do you think
          of him? Why, you think he is not one of the people of God, else he
          would be willing. Some persons come to the house of God, but they come
          just as the negro would to his whipping place, they do not like it,
          and they are glad to get away again. But what do we say of God's
          people, --
        </p>
        <p>"Up to her courts with joys unknown,</p>
        <p>The sacred tribes repair."</p>

          They are a willing people. There is a collection. The Church of God
          requires some assistance. One man doles out as small a trifle as ever
          he can to keep up his respectability. You do not think he exhibits the
          spirit of a Christian because he is not willing; but Christ's people
          are willing; all that they do, they do willingly, for they are
          constrained by no compulsion, but by grace alone. I am sure we all can
          do a thing far better when we are willing than when we are forced. God
          loves his people's services, because they do them voluntarily.
          Voluntaryism is the essence of the gospel. Willing people are those
          whom God delights to have as his servants. He would not have slaves to
          grace his throne, but free men, who, with gladness and joy, should be
          willing in the day of his power.

          4. We shall scarcely have time for a discussion of the whole text, but
          we must briefly notice the character of these people as well as their
          dispositions. "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power."
          "They shall be willing in the beauties of holiness." This is how they
          shall be clothed -- not merely in holiness, but in the beauties of
          holiness, for holiness hath its beauties, its gems, its pearls; and
          what are these? They shall be clothed in the beauties of holiness of
          imputed righteousness and of imparted grace. God's people are, in
          themselves a deformed people, hence their comeliness must be given
          them. The standard of beauty is saintship. If an angel should descend
          from heaven, and carry up to God the most beautiful creature he could
          find, he would not cull earth's roses, he would not gather her lilies,
          but he would take up to heaven the fair character of a child of God.
          Where he found a self-denying hero, where he discovered a
          disinterested Christian -- an ardent disciple, the angel would take
          him up, exclaiming, "Great God, here is beauty; take it, this is thy
          beauty." We walk along and admire statues and such-like things, and we
          say, "Here is beauty," but the Christian has on him the true beauty --
          the beauties of holiness. Oh! ye young, ye gay, ye proud, ye ask for
          beauty, but do you know that all the beauties of this earth can do you
          no good, for you must die and wear a shroud?
        </p>
        <p>"Time will rob you of your bloom,</p>
        <p>Death will drag you to the tomb."</p>
        <p>
          But if you have the beauties of holiness, they shall increase and
          become fairer and fairer, and amongst the fair angels, you, as fair as
          they, shall stand decked in your Saviour's righteousness. "Thy people
          shall be willing" to come forward, and they shall be the right sort of
          people; they will be a holy people, arrayed in all "the beauties of
          holiness."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Now there is a bold metaphor here which we must explain in the last
          place. The text says, "Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy
          power in the beauties of holiness." Now you understand that, but what
          do the next words mean, "From the womb of the morning?" "Why, from the
          earliest periods of their lives," say the commentators, "God's people
          shall be willing." No, it does not mean that; there is a bold and
          brilliant figure here. It is asked, where are they to come from? how
          are God's people to be brought? what means are to be employed? how is
          it to be done? The simple answer is this. Did you never see the
          dew-drops glistening on the earth? and did you never ask, "Whence came
          these? how came they here so infinite in number, so lavishly scattered
          everywhere, so pure and brilliant." Nature whispered the answer, "They
          came from the womb of the morning." So God's people will come forth as
          noiselessly, as mysteriously, as divinely, as if they came "from the
          womb of the morning," like the dew drops. Philosophy has laboured to
          discover the origin of dew, and perhaps has guessed it; but to the
          Eastern, one of the greatest riddles was, out of whose womb came the
          dew? Who is the mother of those pearly drops? Now, so will God's
          people come mysteriously. It will be said by the bystander, "There was
          nothing in that man's preaching; I thought I should hear an orator;
          this man has been made the means of salvation to thousands, and I
          thought I should hear an eloquent man, but I have heard a great many
          preachers far more intelligent and intellectual than he; how were
          these souls converted? "Why, they have come from the womb of the
          morning," mysteriously. Again, the dew drops -- who made them? Do
          kings and princes rise up and hold their sceptres, and bid the clouds
          shed tears, or affright them to weeping by the beating of the drum? Do
          armies march to the battle to force the sky to give up its treasure,
          and scatter its diamonds lavishly? No; God speaks; he whispers in the
          ears of nature, and it weeps for joy at the glad news that the morning
          is come. God does it; there is no apparent agency employed, no
          thunder, no lightning; God has done it. That is how God's people shall
          be saved; they come forth from the "womb of the morning" divinely
          called, divinely brought, divinely blessed, divinely numbered,
          divinely scattered over the entire surface of the globe, divinely
          refreshing to the world, they proceed from the "womb of the morning."
          You may have noticed in the morning what a multitude of dew drops
          there are, and you may have inquired, "Whence comes so great a
          multitude?" We answer, the womb of nature is capable of ten thousand
          births at once. So, "from the womb of the morning" God's children
          shall come. No struggle, no pang, no shriek, no agony is heard, all is
          secret; but they shall come fresh "from the womb of the morning." The
          figure is so beautiful that words cannot explain it. You have only to
          stand early one morning when the sun is beginning to shoot his rays of
          light up to the sky, and look at the fields all glistening with dew,
          and say, "Whence came all these?" The answer is, they came "From the
          womb of the morning." So when you find that multitudes are saved, and
          you see them coming so mysteriously, so gently, so divinely, and yet
          so numerously, you can only compare them to the dew of the morning.
          You say, "Whence came these?" And the answer is, they have come "from
          the womb of the morning."

          II. Now the second part of the text is the sweetest, and we must have
          a little time upon that. There was a promise made to Christ concerning
          his people, and that sets our fears at rest concerning the Church. Now
          here is ANOTHER PROMISE MADE TO CHRIST: "Thou hast the dew of thy
          youth." Ah! believer, this is the great source of gospel success, that
          Christ has the dew of his youth. Jesus Christ, personally, has the dew
          of his youth. Certain leaders in their young days have led their
          troops to battle, and by the loudness of their voice, and the strength
          of their bodies, they have inspired their men with courage; but the
          old warrior hath his hair sown with grey; he begins to be decrepid,
          and no longer can lead men to battle. It is not so with Jesus Christ.
          He has still the dew of his youth. The same Christ who led his troops
          to battle in his early youth leads them now. The arm which smote the
          sinner with his word smites now; it is as unpalsied as it was before.
          The eye which looked upon his friends with gladness, and upon his
          foemen with a glance most stern and high -- that same eye is regarding
          us now, undimmed, like that of Moses. He has the dew of his youth. Oh!
          it does delight us to think that Christ was "God over all, blessed for
          ever," in his youth, filled with Almighty power, and he is just the
          same now. He is not an old Christ -- a worn out Christ, but our leader
          still. He is as young as ever. The same dew, the same freshness, is
          about him. You hear it said of a minister, "In his younger days there
          was a deal of freshness about him, but he is getting old and begins to
          repeat himself." It is never so with Christ; he always has the dew of
          his youth. He who "spake as never man spake," once, when he shall come
          to speak again, will speak just as he did before. He has the dew of
          his youth personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          So also doctrinally. Christ hath the dew of his youth. Usually, when a
          religion starts it is very rampant, but it afterwards decays. Look at
          the religion of Mahommed. For one hundred years or more it threatened
          to subvert kingdoms, and overturn the whole world, but where are the
          blades that flashed then? Where are now the willing hands that smote
          down the foes of Mahommed? Why, his religion has become an old
          worn-out thing; no one cares about it; and the Turk, sitting on his
          divan, with his legs crossed, smoking his pipe, is the best image of
          the Mahommedan religion -- old, infirm, effete. But the Christian
          religion, -- ah! it is as fresh as when it started from its cradle at
          Jerusalem; it is as hale, and hearty, and mighty, as when Paul
          preached it at Athens, or Peter at Jerusalem. It is not an old
          religion. Not one particle of it hath waxed old, though hundreds of
          years have passed away. How many religions have died since Christ's
          began! How many have risen up, like mushrooms in a night! But is not
          Christ's as new as it ever was? I ask you, ye old grey heads, you have
          known your Master in your youth, and you thought his religion sweet
          and precious; do you find it useless now? Do you find now that Christ
          has not the dew of youth upon him? No; you can say, "Sweet Jesus, the
          day I first touched thine hand, the day of mine espousals, I thought
          thee altogether lovely; and thou art not like an earthly friend: thou
          hast not waxed old; thou art as young as ever. Thy brow hath no
          furrows on it; thine eyes are not dime. Thine hair is still black as
          the raven, not white with age; thou art still unmoved, unaltered,
          notwithstanding all the years that I have known thee. Well, beloved,
          do you see what encouragement this is to us in the propagation of our
          Master's kingdom, that we are not preaching an old thing that is out
          of date, but a religion which has the dew of its youth upon it. The
          same religion which could save three thousand at Pentecost, can save
          three thousand now. I preach old doctrine, but it is as new as when it
          first came from heaven's mint. The image and the superscription is as
          clear, and the metal is as bright and undimmed as ever. I have an old
          sword, but it is not a rusty one; though it hath hacked and cut many a
          Rahab, yet it has not a single mark of weakness upon itself -- it is
          as new as when it was first forged upon the anvil of wisdom. The
          gospel has the same spirit attending it now, that it had when it was a
          young gospel. As Peter stood up to preach then so may Peters now, and
          God shall give them the same unction. As Paul preached then, so shall
          Pauls now. As Timothy upheld the Lord's word, so may Timothys now, and
          the same Holy Spirit shall attend it. I am afraid Christ's people do
          not believe this sentence -- that Christ has the dew of his youth.
          They have a notion that the times of great revivals are gone by. And
          the fathers, they ask, where are they? We are apt to cry, "The horses
          of Israel, and the chariots thereof." No one will ever wear Elijah's
          mantle again; we shall never see great and wondrous deeds again. O
          foolish unbelief! Christ has still the dew of his youth. He has as
          much of the Holy Spirit now as he had at first, for he has it without
          measure. And though he has dispensed it unto thousands, he will
          dispense it still. But the question is asked, "How is it that people
          in these times begin to get tired of the gospel, if it has the dew of
          its youth?" Why, beloved, it is because the gospel does not come to
          them in the form of dew at all. Do we not frequently hear a gospel all
          dry and marrowless, like a lot of bones out of which the marrow has
          been boiled? Very nice these bones are for your philosophical divines,
          who like to study antiquities, and discover to what unclean animal
          this or that bone belongs, but of no service at all to God's children,
          for there is no food on the bones. We want a gospel covered with
          unction, full of savour; and when God's people have that, they are
          never tired of it, they find a dew and a freshness about it which are
          lasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if Christ has the dew of his youth about him, how earnestly ought
          those of us who are his ministers to proclaim his word. There is
          nothing like strong faith to make a man preach mightily. If I think I
          preach a tottering old gospel, I cannot proclaim it with zeal; but if
          I think I am preaching a strong stalwart gospel, whose frame has not
          been shaken, and whose might is just as great as ever, how strongly
          ought I to preach it? Ah! blessed be God, there are a few hearts as
          hot as ever, a few souls as firm in their Master's cause as ever were
          the hearts of the Apostles. They are yet a few good men and true, who
          rally round the cross. Like David's men in the cave Adullam, there are
          some mighties who rally round the standard. He is not left without his
          witnesses, he has the dew of his youth yet, and the day may come when
          those now hidden in darkness, shall, as dew before the sunshine, come
          out, glistening on every bush, adorning every tree, enlightening every
          village, cheering every pasture, making the little hills sing for joy.
          Go, Christian, and put this into the form of prayer. Pray to Christ
          that his people may be willing in the day of his power, and that he
          would always retain the dew of his youth.
        </p>
        <p>"Ride forth, sweet Prince, triumphantly,</p>
        <p>And bid the world obey."</p>
        <p>
          Go on, and prove thyself to be the same as ever, the blessed God, "God
          over all, blessed for evermore." Up, Christian, up! fight for your
          young Monarch! Up with ye, warriors! Let your swords flash from their
          scabbards! Fight for your King! Up! up! for the old banner is a new
          banner too. Christ is still fresh and still young. Let the enthusiasm
          of your youth gird you! Once again, start up, ye aged Christians, and
          let your young days come again, for if Christ has the dew of his youth
          about him, it behooves you to serve him with youthful vigour. Up!
          starting now from your sleep, give to him a new youth, and strive to
          be as earnest and as zealous for his cause as if it were the first day
          you ever knew him. Oh! may God make many sinners willing! May he bring
          many to his feet, for he has promised that they shall be willing in
          the day of his power.<br />
