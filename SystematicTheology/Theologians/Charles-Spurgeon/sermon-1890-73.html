          After the death of Abgar, the kingdom of Armenia was divided between
          two: Ananoun, Abgar's son, reigned at Edessa, and his sister's son,
          Sanadroug, in Armenia. What took place in their time has been
          previously told by others: the apostle's arrival in Armenia, the
          conversion of Sanadroug and his apostasy for fear of the Armenian
          satraps, and the martyrdom of the apostle and his companions in the
          canton of Chavarchan, now called Ardaz, and the stone opening to
          receive the body of the apostle, and the removal of this body by his
          disciples, his burial in the plain, and the martyrdom of the king's
          daughter, Santoukhd, near the road, and the apparition of the remains
          of the two saints, and their removal to the rocks -- all circumstances
          related by others, as we have said, a long time before us: we have not
          thought it important to repeat them here. In the same way also what is
          related of the martyrdom at Edessa of Attæus, a disciple of the
          apostle, a martyrdom ordered by Abgar's son, has been told by others
          before us.

          The prince who reigned after the death of his father, did not inherit
          his father's virtues: he opened the temples of the idols, and embraced
          the religion of the heathen. He sent word to Attæus: "Make me a
          head-dress of cloth interwoven with gold, like those you formerly used
          to make for my father." He received this answer from Attæus: "My hands
          shall not make a head-dress for an unworthy prince, who does not
          worship Christ the living God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Immediately the king ordered one of his armed men to cut off Attæus'
          feet. The soldier went, and, seeing the holy man seated in the chair
          of the teacher, cut off his legs with his sword, and immediately the
          saint gave up the ghost. We mention this cursorily, as a fact related
          by others a long while ago. There came then into Armenia the Apostle
          Bartholomew, who suffered martyrdom among us in the town of Arepan. As
          to Simon, who was sent unto Persia, I cannot relate with certainty
          what he did, nor where he suffered martyrdom. It is said that one
          Simon, an apostle, was martyred at Veriospore. Is this true, or why
          did the saint come to this place? I do not know; I have only mentioned
          this circumstance that you may know I spare no pains to tell you all
          that is necessary.<br />
