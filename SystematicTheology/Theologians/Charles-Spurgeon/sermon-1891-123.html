          1. If any one, therefore, reads the Scriptures with attention, he will
          find in them an account of Christ, and a foreshadowing of the new
          calling (vocationis). For Christ is the treasure which was hid in the
          field, that is, in this world (for "the field is the world" ); but the
          treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ, since He was pointed out by
          means of types and parables. Hence His human nature could not be
          understood, prior to the consummation of those things which had been
          predicted, that is, the advent of Christ. And therefore it was said to
          Daniel the prophet: "Shut up the words, and seal the book even to the
          time of consummation, until many learn, and knowledge be completed.
          For at that time, when the dispersion shall be accomplished, they
          shall know all these things." But Jeremiah also says, "In the last
          days they shall understand these things." For every prophecy, before
          its fulfilment, is to men [full of] enigmas and ambiguities. But when
          the time has arrived, and the prediction has come to pass, then the
          prophecies have a clear and certain exposition. And for this reason,
          indeed, when at this present time the law is read to the Jews, it is
          like a fable; for they do not possess the explanation of all things
          pertaining to the advent of the Son of God, which took place in human
          nature; but when it is read by the Christians, it is a treasure, hid
          indeed in a field, but brought to light by the cross of Christ, and
          explained, both enriching the understanding of men, and showing forth
          the wisdom of God and declaring His dispensations with regard to man,
          and forming the kingdom of Christ beforehand, and preaching by
          anticipation the inheritance of the holy Jerusalem, and proclaiming
          beforehand that the man who loves God shall arrive at such excellency
          as even to see God, and hear His word, and from the hearing of His
          discourse be glorified to such an extent, that others cannot behold
          the glory of his countenance, as was said by Daniel: "Those who do
          understand, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and many
          of the righteous as the stars for ever and ever." Thus, then, I have
          shown it to be, if any one read the Scriptures. For thus it was that
          the Lord discoursed with the disciples after His resurrection from the
          dead, proving to them from the Scriptures themselves "that Christ must
          suffer, and enter into His glory, and that remission of sins should be
          preached in His name throughout all the world." And the disciple will
          be perfected, and [rendered] like the householder, "who bringeth forth
          from his treasure things new and old."

          2. Wherefore it is incumbent to obey the presbyters who are in the
          Church, -- those who, as I have shown, possess the succession from the
          apostles; those who, together with the succession of the episcopate,
          have received the certain gift of truth, according to the good
          pleasure of the Father. But [it is also incumbent] to hold in
          suspicion others who depart from the primitive succession, and
          assemble themselves together in any place whatsoever, [looking upon
          them] either as heretics of perverse minds, or as schismatics puffed
          up and self-pleasing, or again as hypocrites, acting thus for the sake
          of lucre and vainglory. For all these have fallen from the truth. And
          the heretics, indeed, who bring strange fire to the altar of God --
          namely, strange doctrines -- shall be burned up by the fire from
          heaven, as were Nadab and Abiud. But such as rise up in opposition to
          the truth, and exhort others against the Church of God, [shall] remain
          among those in hell (apud inferos), being swallowed up by an
          earthquake, even as those who were with Chore, Dathan, and Abiron. But
          those who cleave asunder, and separate the unity of the Church,
          [shall] receive from God the same punishment as Jeroboam did.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Those, however, who are believed to be presbyters by many, but
          serve their own lusts, and, do not place the fear of God supreme in
          their hearts, but conduct themselves with contempt towards others, and
          are puffed up with the pride of holding the chief seat, and work evil
          deeds in secret, saying, "No man sees us," shall be convicted by the
          Word, who does not judge after outward appearance (secundum gloriam),
          nor looks upon the countenance, but the heart; and they shall hear
          those words, to be found in Daniel the prophet: "O thou seed of
          Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust
          perverted thy heart. Thou that art waxen old in wicked days, now thy
          sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light; for thou
          hast pronounced false judgments, and hast been accustomed to condemn
          the innocent, and to let the guilty go free, albeit the Lord saith,
          The innocent and the righteous shalt thou not slay." Of whom also did
          the Lord say: "But if the evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
          delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite the man-servants and
          maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken; the lord of that servant
          shall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that
          he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his
          portion with the unbelievers."

        <p>
          4. From all such persons, therefore, it behoves us to keep aloof, but
          to adhere to those who, as I have already observed, do hold the
          doctrine of the apostles, and who, together with the order of
          priesthood (presbyterii ordine), display sound speech and blameless
          conduct for the confirmation and correction of others. In this way,
          Moses, to whom such a leadership was entrusted, relying on a good
          conscience, cleared himself before God, saying, "I have not in
          covetousness taken anything belonging to one of these men, nor have I
          done evil to one of them." In this way, too, Samuel, who judged the
          people so many years, and bore rule over Israel without any pride, in
          the end cleared himself, saying, "I have walked before you from my
          childhood even unto this day: answer me in the sight of God, and
          before His anointed (Christi ejus); whose ox or whose ass of yours
          have I taken, or over whom have I tyrannized, or whom have I
          oppressed? or if I have received from the hand of any a bribe or [so
          much as] a shoe, speak out against me, and I will restore it to you."
          And when the people had said to him, "Thou hast not tyrannized,
          neither hast thou oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any
          man's hand," he called the Lord to witness, saying, "The Lord is
          witness, and His Anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found
          ought in my hand. And they said to him, He is witness." In this strain
          also the Apostle Paul, inasmuch as he had a good conscience, said to
          the Corinthians: "For we are not as many, who corrupt the Word of God:
          but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in
          Christ;" "We have injured no man, corrupted no man, circumvented no
          man."
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Such presbyters does the Church nourish, of whom also the prophet
          says: "I will give thy rulers in peace, and thy bishops in
          righteousness." Of whom also did the Lord declare, "Who then shall be
          a faithful steward (actor), good and wise, whom the Lord sets over His
          household, to give them their meat in due season? Blessed is that
          servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing." Paul
          then, teaching us where one may find such, says, "God hath placed in
          the Church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers."
          Where, therefore, the gifts of the Lord have been placed, there it
          behoves us to learn the truth, [namely,] from those who possess that
          succession of the Church which is from the apostles, and among whom
          exists that which is sound and blameless in conduct, as well as that
          which is unadulterated and incorrupt in speech. For these also
          preserve this faith of ours in one God who created all things; and
          they increase that love [which we have] for the Son of God, who
          accomplished such marvellous dispensations for our sake: and they
          expound the Scriptures to us without danger, neither blaspheming God,
          nor dishonouring the patriarchs, nor despising the prophets.<br />
