          "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
          you." -- Ephesians 4:82.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE HEATHEN moralists, when they wished to teach virtue, could not
          point to the example of their gods, for, according to their
          mythologists, the gods were a compound of every imaginable, and, I had
          almost said, unimaginable vice. Many of the classic deities surpassed
          the worst of men in their crimes: they were as much greater in
          iniquity as they were supposed to be superior in power. It is an ill
          day for a people when their gods are worse than themselves. The
          blessed purity of our holy faith is conspicuous, not only in its
          precepts, but in the character of the God whom it reveals. There is no
          excellency which we can propose but we can see it brightly shining in
          the Lord our God: there is no line of conduct in which a believer
          should excel but we can point to Christ Jesus our Lord and Master as
          the pattern of it. In the highest places of the Christian faith you
          have the highest virtue, and unto God our Father and the Lord Jesus be
          the highest praise. We can urge you to the tenderest spirit of
          forgiveness by pointing to God who for Christ's sake has forgiven you.
          What nobler motive can you require for forgiving one another? With
          such high examples, brethren, what manner of people ought we to he? We
          have sometimes heard of men who were better than their religion, but
          that is quite impossible with us: we can never, in spirit or in act,
          rise to the sublime elevation of our divine religion. We should
          constantly be rising above ourselves, and above the most gracious of
          our fellow Christians, and yet above us we shall still behold our God
          and Saviour. We may go from strength to strength in thoughts of
          goodness and duties of piety, but Jesus is higher still, and evermore
          we must be looking up to him as we climb the sacred hill of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this time we wish to speak a little concerning the duties of love
          and forgiveness; and here we note, at once, that the apostle sets
          before us the example of God himself. Upon that bright example we
          shall spend most of our time, but I hope not quite so much as to
          forget the practical part, which is so much needed in these days by
          certain Unforgiving spirits who nevertheless assume the Christian
          name. The theme of God's forgiving love is so fascinating that we may
          linger awhile, and a long while too, upon that bright example of
          forgiveness which God has set before us, but from it all I hope we
          shall be gathering grace by which to forgive others even to seventy
          times seven.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall take the text word by word, and so we shall obtain the
          clearest divisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first word to think about is "FOR CHRIST'S SAKE." We use these
          words very often; but probably we have never thought of their Three,
          and even at this time we cannot bring forth the whole of their
          meaning. Let us touch thereon with thoughtfulness, praying the good
          Spirit to instruct us. "For Christ's sake;" all the good things which
          God has bestowed upon us have come to us "for Christ's sake," but
          especially the forgiveness of our sins has come "for Christ's sake."
          This is the plain assertion of the text. What does it mean? It means.
          surely, first, for the sake of the great atonement which Christ has
          offered. The great God can, as a just Lawgiver and King, readily pass
          by out' offences because of the expiation for sin which Christ has
          offered. If sin were merely a personal affront toward God, we have
          abundant evidence that he would be ready enough to pass it by without
          exacting vengeance; but it is a great deal more than that. Those who
          view it as a mere personal affront against God are but very shallow
          thinkers. Sin is an attack upon the moral government of God; it
          undermines the foundations of society, and were it permitted to have
          its way it would reduce everything to anarchy, and even destroy the
          governing power and the Ruler himself. God hath a great realm to
          govern, not merely of men that dwell on the face of the earth, but
          beneath his sway there are angels, and principalities, and powers, and
          we do not know how many worlds of intelligent beings. It would
          certainly be a monstrous thing to suppose that God has made yonder
          myriads of worlds that we see sparkling in the sky at night without
          having placed some living creatures in them; it is far more reasonable
          to suppose that this earth is an altogether insignificant speck in the
          divine dominion, a mere province in the boundless empire of the King
          of kings. Now, this world having rebelled against God high-handedly,
          as it has done, unless there were a satisfaction demanded for its
          rebellion it would be a tolerated assault upon the dominion of the
          great Judge of all, and a lowering of his royal influence over all his
          domain. If sin in man's case were left unpunished it would soon be
          known through myriads of worlds, and in fact by ten thousand times ten
          thousand races of creatures, that they might sin with impunity; if one
          race had done so, why not all the rest? This would be a proclamation
          of universal license to rebel. It would probably be the worst calamity
          that could happen -- that any sin should go unpunished by the supreme
          Judge. Sometimes in a state, unless the lawgiver executes the law
          against the murderer, life will be in peril, and everything will
          become insecure, and therefore it becomes mercy to write the
          death-warrant: so is it with God in reference to this world of
          sinners. It is his very love as well as his holiness and his justice
          which, if I may use such a term, compels him to severity of judgment,
          so that sin cannot and must not be blotted out till atonement has been
          presented. There must first of all be a sacrifice for sin, which, mark
          you, the great Father, to show his love, himself supplies, for it is
          his own Son who is given to die, and so the Father himself supplies
          the ransom through his Son, that Son being also one with himself by
          bonds of essential unity, mysterious but most intense. If God demands
          the penalty in justice, he himself supplies it in love. "Tis a
          wondrous mystery, this mystery of the way of salvation by an atoning
          sacrifice; but this much is clear, that now God for Christ's sake hath
          forgiven us, because satisfaction has been made to the injured honour
          of the divine government, and justice is satisfied. I want you to
          consider for a moment how readily God may now blot out sin since
          Christ hath died. The blotting out of sin seems hard till we see the
          cross, and then it appears easy enough. I have looked at sin till it
          seemed to blind me with its horror, and I said in myself, "This damned
          spot can never be washed out; no fuller's soap can change its hue;
          sooner might the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots.
          sin, thou deep, eternal evil, what can remove thee?" And then I have
          seen the Son of God dying on the cross, and read the anguish of his
          soul, and heard the cries which showed the torment of his spirit when
          God his Father had forsaken him, and it has seemed to me as if the
          blotting out of sin were the easiest thing under heaven. When I have
          seen Jesus die I have not been able to understand how any sin could be
          difficult to remove. Let a man stand on Calvary and look on him whom
          he hath pierced, and believe and accept the atonement made, and it
          becomes the simplest thing possible that his debt should be discharged
          now that it is paid, that his freedom should be given now that the
          ransom is found, and that he should be no longer under condemnation,
          since the guilt that condemned him has been carried away by his great
          Substitute and Lord. It is then because of what Jesus Christ has
          suffered in our stead that God for Christ's sake hath forgiven us,
        </p>
        <p>
          The second rendering of the text would be this, that God has forgiven
          us because of the representative character of Christ. It should never
          be forgotten that we originally fell by a representative. Adam stood
          for us, and he was our federal head. We did not fall personally at the
          first, but in our representative. Had he kept the conditions of the
          covenant we had stood through him, but, inasmuch as he fell, we fell
          in him. I pray you cavil not at the arrangement, because there lay the
          hope of our lace. The angels probably fell individually, one by one,
          and hence they fell irretrievably, -- there was no restoring them: but
          as we fell in one Adam, there remained the possibility of our rising
          in another Adam; and therefore in the fulness of time God sent forth
          his Son Jesus Christ, born of a woman, made under the law to become
          the second Adam. He undertook to remove our burdens and to fulfil the
          conditions of our restoration. According to covenant he must appear in
          our nature, and that nature in the fulness of time he assumed. He must
          bear the penalty: that he hath done in his personal suffering and
          death. He must obey the law: that he has done to the utmost. And now
          Christ Jesus, having borne penalty and fulfilled law, is himself
          justified before God, and stands forth before God as the
          representative of all that are in him. God for Christ's sake has
          accepted us in him, has forgiven us in him, and looks upon us with
          love infinite and changeless in him. This is how all our blessings
          come to us -- in and through Christ Jesus; and if we are indeed in
          him, the Lord doth not only forgive us our sin, but he bestows upon us
          the boundless riches of his grace in him: in fact, he treats us as he
          would treat his Son, he deals with us as he would deal with Jesus. Oh,
          how pleasant to think that when the just God looks upon us it is
          through the reconciling medium, he views us through the Mediator. We
          sometimes sing a hymn which says --
        </p>
        <p>"Him and then the sinner see,</p>
        <p>Look through Jesus' wounds on me,"</p>
        <p>
          and this is just what the Lord doth. He counts us just for the sake of
          our Saviour's atonement, and because of his representative character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now go a little further. When we read "for Christ's sake" it surely
          means for the deep love which the Father bears him. My brethren, can
          you guess a little of the love which the Father hath toward the
          Only-begotten? We cannot pry into the wondrous mystery of the eternal
          filiation of the Son of God lest we be blinded by excess of tight; but
          this we know, that they are one God, -- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit;
          and the union which exists between them is intense beyond conception.
          "The Father loveth the Son," was always true, and is true now; but how
          deeply, how intensely he loves the Son no mind can conceive. Now,
          brethren, the Lord will do great things for the sake of a Son whom he
          loves as he loveth Jesus, for in addition to the fact of his eternally
          loving him, as being one with him by nature and essence, there is now
          the superadded cause of love arising out of what the Lord Jesus hath
          done as the servant of the Father. Remember that our Lord Jesus has
          been obedient to his Father's will -- obedient to death, even to the
          death of the cross, wherefore God hath highly exalted hi in and given
          him a name that is above every name. One of the sweetest thoughts, to
          my mind, which I sometimes suck at when I am alone, is this -- that
          God the Father will do anything for Christ. Here is also another piece
          of a honeycomb -- when I can plead Christ's name I am sure to win my
          suit of him. "For Christ's sake" is a plea that always touches the
          heart of the great God. Show that for you to receive such and such a
          blessing will glorify Christ, and the Father cannot withhold it, for
          it is his delight to honour Jesus. We speak after the manner of men,
          of course, and on such a theme as this we must be careful, but still
          we can only speak as men, being only men. It is the joy of the Father
          to express his love to his Son. Throughout all ages they have had
          fellowship one with another: they have always been one in all their
          designs, they have never differed upon any points and cannot differ;
          and you notice when our Lord says, "Father, glorify thy Son," he is so
          knit with the Father that he adds, "that thy Son also may glorify
          thee." Their mutual love is inconceivably great, and, therefore,
          brethren, God will do anything for Jesus. God will forgive us for
          Christ's sake; yea, he has done so in the case of thousands around me.
          And thou, big black sinner, if thou wilt go to God at this moment and
          say, "Lord, I cannot ask thee to forgive me for my own sake, but do it
          out of love for thy dear Son," he will do it, for he will do anything
          for the sake of Jesus. If thou art at this time conscious of sin so as
          to despair of thyself, it is well that thou shouldest be so, for
          self-despair is only common-sense, since there is nothing in thyself
          upon which thou canst rely. But do catch at this hope -- it is not a
          straw, it is a good substantial life-buoy -- if thou canst ask
          forgiveness for the sake of Jesus, God will do anything for Jesus, and
          he will do anything for thee for his dear sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we read our text once more in the light of a truth which grows out
          of the love of God; namely, that God does forgive sin for the sake of
          glorifying Christ. Christ took the shame that he might magnify his
          Father, and now his Father delights to magnify him by blotting out the
          sin. If von can prove that any gift to you would reflect glory upon
          Christ, you may depend upon it you will have it. If there is anything
          under heaven. that would make Christ more illustrious the Father would
          not spare it for a moment. If thou seest that for thee to have thy sin
          forgiven would raise the fame of the Saviour, go and plead that
          argument with God, and thou shalt surely prevail. Will it not make
          Christ glad if he saves such a sinner as thou art? Then go with this
          argument in thy mouth, "Father, glorify thy Son by exalting him as a
          glorious Saviour in saving me." I find this often a great lever at a
          dead lift, -- to say unto the Lord, "Lord, thou knowest the straits I
          am in; thou knowest how undeserving I am; thou knowest what a poor,
          undone creature I am before thee; but if thy dear Son shall help and
          save me the very angels will stand and wonder at his mighty grace, and
          so it will bring glory to him, therefore I entreat thee be gracious
          unto me." Be sure thou art certain to prevail if thou canst plead that
          it will glorify Christ, and surely thou wouldest not wish to have a
          thing that would not glorify him. Thy prayer shall always be
          prevalent, if thy heart be in such a state that thou art willing to
          have or not to have, according as it will honour thy Lord: if it will
          not glorify Christ, be thou more than content to do without the
          choicest earthly good; but be thou doubly grateful when the boon that
          is granted tends to bring honour to the ever dear and worshipful name
          of Jesus. "For Christ's sake." It is a precious word; dwell upon it,
          and lay up this sentence in the archives of thy memory -- the Father
          will do anything for the sake of Jesus Christ his Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, we pass on to observe what it is which we are told
          in the text has been done for us, and to us, for Christ's sake. "God
          for Christ's sake HATH FORGIVEN YOU."
        </p>
        <p>
          First notice, that he has done this certainly. The apostle does not
          say he hopes so, but he says, "God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
          you." Are you in the number of the forgiven, my dear hearer? Hast thou
          believed in the Lord Jesus Christ? Then, as sure as you have believed,
          God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Have you put your trust in
          the atoning sacrifice? Then God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
          You have not begun to be a Christian, I hope, with the idea that one
          day, at some future period, you may obtain forgiveness. No. "God for
          Christ's sake hath forgiven you." Pardon is not a prize to be run for,
          but a blessing received at the first step of the race. If you have
          believed in Jesus your sin has all gone -- all gone; all your sin has
          been erased from the records of the past, never to be mentioned
          against you for ever. The moment a sinner looks to Christ, the burden
          of his sin rolls from off his shoulders never to return. If Christ
          hath washed thee, (and be has if thou hast believed in him,) then thou
          art clean every whit, and before the Lord thou standest delivered from
          every trace of guilt. Pardon is not a matter of hope, but a matter of
          fact. Expectation looks for many a blessing, but pardon is a realized
          favour which faith holds in her hand even now. If Christ took thy
          load, thy load cannot remain on thine own back: if Christ paid thy
          debts, then they do not stand in God's books against thee. How can
          they? It stands to reason that if thy Substitute has taken thy sin and
          put it away, thy sin lies no more on thee. God for Christ's sake hath
          forgiven thee. Get hold of that grand truth, and hold it, though all
          the devils in hell roar at thee. Grasp it as with a hand of steel;
          grip it as for life: "God for Christ's sake hath forgiven me," -- may
          each one of us be able to say that. We shall not feel the divine
          sweetness and force of the text unless we can make a personal matter
          of it by the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then notice that God has forgiven us continuously. He not only forgave
          us at the first all our sins, but he continues daily to forgive, for
          the act of forgiveness is a continuous one. I have sometimes heard it
          said that we were so forgiven when we first believed that there is no
          need to ask for further forgiveness; to which I reply -- We were so
          completely forgiven when we first believed that we ought continually
          to ask for the perpetuity of that one far-reaching act, that the Lord
          may continue to exert towards us that fulness of forgiving grace which
          absolved us perfectly at the first, that we may continue to walk
          before him with a sense of that complete forgiveness, clear and
          unquestioned. I know I was forgiven when first I believed in Christ;
          and I am equally sure of it now: the one absolution continues to ring
          in my ears like joy-bells which never cease. Pardon once given
          continues to be given. When through doubt and anxiety I was not sure
          of my pardon, yet it was still true; for he that believeth on him is
          not condemned, even though he may write bitter things against himself.
          Beloved friend, catch hold of that, and do not let it go. Divine
          pardon is a continuous act.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this forgiveness on God's part was most free. We did nothing to
          obtain it by merit, and we brought nothing wherewith to purchase it.
          He forgave us for Christ's sake, not for aught that we had done. True,
          we did repent, and did believe, but repentance and faith he gave us,
          so that he did not forgive us for the sake of them, but purely of his
          own dear love, because he delighteth in mercy, and is never more like
          himself than when he passeth by transgression, iniquity, and sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, also, that he forgave us fully. It was not here and there a
          sin that he blotted out, but the whole horrible list and catalogue of
          our offences he destroyed at once. The substitution of our Lord has
          finished that matter even to perfection: --
        </p>
        <p>"Because the sinless Saviour died,</p>
        <p>My sinful soul is counted free;</p>
        <p>For God, the Just, is satisfied</p>
        <p>To look on him and pardon me."</p>
        <p>
          All our transgressions are swept away at once, carried off as by a
          flood, and so completely removed from us that no guilty trace of them
          remains They are all gone! O ye believers, think of this, for the all
          is no little thing: sins against a holy God, sins against his loving
          Son, sins against gospel as well as against law, sins against man as
          well as against God, sins of the body as well as sins of the mind,
          sins as numerous as the sands on the sea shore, and as great as the
          sea itself: all, all are removed from us as far as the east is from
          the west. All this evil was rolled into one great mass, and laid upon
          Jesus, and having borne it all he has made an end of it for ever. When
          the Lord forgave us he forgave us the whole debt. He did not take the
          bill and say, "I strike out this item and that," but the pen went
          through it all; -- PAID. It was a receipt in full of all demands,
          Jesus took the handwriting which was against us and nailed it to his
          cross, to show before the entire universe that its power to condemn us
          had ceased for ever. We have in him a full forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let it be remembered that this forgiveness which God has given us
          for Christ's sake is an eternal forgiveness. He will never rake up our
          past offences and a second time impute them, lie will not find us on
          an evil day, and say, "I have had great patience with you, but now
          will I deal with you after your sins." Far otherwise; he that
          believeth in Jesus hath everlasting life, and shall never come into
          condemnation. Irreversible is the pardon of heaven. "The gifts and
          calling of God are without repentance." He never repents what he has
          given, or forgiven. "Tis done, "tis done for ever: Jehovah absolves
          and the sentence stands fast for ever. "There is therefore now no
          condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." "Who shall lay
          anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who
          is he that condemneth?" Blessed be God for eternal pardon!
        </p>
        <p>
          And since I could not find a word to finish with but this one, I will
          use it: he hath divinely pardoned us. There is such a truth, reality,
          and emphasis in the pardon of God as you can never find in the pardon
          of man; for though a man should forgive all you have done against him,
          if you have treated him very badly, yet it is more than you could
          expect that he should quite forget it, but the Lord says, "Their sins
          and iniquities will I remember no more for ever." If a man has played
          you false, although you have forgiven him, you are not likely to trust
          him again. It is an old proverb, "Never ride a broken-knee'd horse,"
          and it is not a bad proverb either. But see how the Lord deals with
          his people. When Peter was set on his legs again he was a
          broken-knee'd horse enough, and yet see how gloriously the Lord rode
          that charger on the day of Pentecost. Did he not go forth conquering
          and to conquer? The Lord lets bygones be bygones so completely that he
          trusts pardoned souls with his secrets, for "the secret of the Lord is
          with them that fear him"; and he entrusts some of us with his choicest
          treasures, for Paul said, "He hath put me in trust with the gospel,
          though I was a blasphemer." He commits to our keeping that priceless
          casket which encloses the best hope of men, namely, the gospel of
          Jesus. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels." This shows how
          perfect is our forgiveness, -- nay, I must put it, how divine is the
          forgiveness which we have received. Let us rejoice in that grand
          promise which comes to us by the mouth of Jeremiah of old, "In those
          days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall
          be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and
          they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve." Here
          is annihilation -- the only annihilation I know of -- the absolute
          annihilation of sin through the pardon which the Lord gives to his
          people. Let us sing it as though it were a choice hymn -- "The
          iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, if you have drank into the spirit of our subject you will be
          strengthened to bear what I have to say to you upon a point of
          practice. "FORGIVING ONE ANOTHER, even as God for Christ's sake hath
          forgiven you." Let me say, at the commencement, that I do not know of
          anyone here present who has fallen out with anybody else, and
          therefore I shall make no personal allusions. If I did know of
          quarrels and bickerings it is very likely that I should say about the
          same, but I do not happen to know of any, and if therefore, my remarks
          should come home, I would earnestly beg each one so affected to
          believe that what I say is intended for him, and to receive it as a
          pointed, personal message from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
          you." Now observe how the apostle puts it. Does he say "forgiving
          another"? No, that is not the text, if you look at it. It is
          "forgiving, one another." One another! Ah, then that means that if you
          have to forgive to-day, it is very likely that you will yourself need
          to be forgiven to-morrow for it is "forgiving one another." It is turn
          and turn about, a mutual operation, a co-operative service. In fact,
          it is a joint-stock business of mutual forgiveness, and members of
          Christian churches should take large shares in this concern.
          "Forgiving one another." You forgive me, and I forgive you, and we
          forgive them, and they forgive us, and so a circle of unlimited
          forbearance and love goes round the world. There is something wrong
          about me that needs to be forgiven by my brother, but there is also
          something wrong about my brother which needs to be forgiven by me, and
          this is what the apostle means -- that we are all of us mutually to be
          exercising the sacred art and mystery of forgiving one another. If we
          always did this we should not endure those who have a special faculty
          for spying out faults. There are some who, whatever church they are
          in, always bring an ill report of it. I have heard this sort of thing
          from many -- "There is no love among Christians at all." I will tell
          you the character of the gentleman who makes that observation; he is
          both unloving and unlovely, and so he is out of the track of the
          pilgrims of love. Another cries, "There is no sincerity in the world
          now." That man is a hypocrite: be you quite sure of that. Judge a bird
          by its song, and a man by his utterance. The censorious measure our
          corn, but they use their own bushels. You may know very well what a
          man is by what he says of others. It is a gauge of character which
          very seldom will deceive you, to judge other men by their own judgment
          of their fellows. Their speech betrays their heart. Show me your
          tongue, sir! Now I know whether you are sick or well. He that speaketh
          with an ill tongue of his neighbour hath an ill heart; rest assured of
          that. Let us begin our Christian career with the full assurance that
          we shall have a great deal to forgive in other people, but that there
          will be a great deal more to be forgiven in ourselves, and let us set
          our account upon having to exercise gentleness, and needing its
          exercise from others, "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's
          sake hath forgiven you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Note again. When we forgive, it is a poor and humble business compared
          with God's forgiving us, because we are only forgiving one another,
          that is, forgiving fellow-servants; whereas when God forgives us it is
          the Judge of all the earth forgiving, not his fellows, but his rebel
          subjects, guilty of treason against his majesty. For God to forgive is
          something great; for us to forgive, though some think it great, should
          be regarded as a very small matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then reflect upon the matter to be forgiven. Our Lord in his parable
          tells us that the fellow-servant owed a few pence, but the servant
          himself was debtor to his master many talents. What we owe to God is
          infinite, but what our fellow creature owes to us is a very small sum.
          What did he do which has so much offended you? "He said a very
          shameful thing about me." It was very bad of him, no doubt. "Then he
          played me a very nasty trick, and acted very ungraciously; in fact, he
          behaved scandalously, and if you hear the story you will be quite
          indignant." Well, I am indignant. He is a bad fellow, there is no
          doubt about it; and so are you. So were you certainly when you first
          came to God; bad as he is to you, you have been much worse to the
          Lord. I will warrant that his blacks towards you are whites compared
          with your blacks in the presence of God. "Oh, but you would not
          believe how basely he acted." No, and I dare say I should hardly
          believe it if I heard how base you have been to the Lord; at any rate,
          it should make our eyes fill with tears to think bow we have grieved
          our God, and vexed his Spirit. Some of us have had so much manifest
          forgiveness, so much outward sin forgiven, that for us to forgive
          ought to be us natural as to open our hands. After such forgiveness as
          the Lord has bestowed on some of us, we should be wicked servants
          indeed if we were to take our brother by the throat and say, "Pay me
          what thou owest." We should deserve to be given over to the tormentors
          by our angry Master if we did not count it joy to pass by a brother's
          fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anyone here who is a Christian finds a difficulty in forgiveness, I
          am going to give him three words which will help him wonderfully. I
          would put them into the good man's mouth. I gave them to you just now,
          and prayed you to get the sweetness of them; here they are again! "For
          Christ's sake." Cannot you forgive an offender on that ground? Ah, the
          girl has acted very shamefully, and you, her father, have said some
          strong things, but I beg you to forgive her for Christ's sake. Cannot
          you do it with that motive? It is true your son has behaved very
          wrongly, and nothing hurts a father's heart more than the wicked
          conduct of a son. You did in a fit of anger say a very stern thing,
          and deny him your house for ever. I entreat you to eat your words up
          for Christ's sake. Sometimes when I have been pleading a case like
          that, the person I have been persuading has kindly said, "I will do it
          for you, sir." I have said, "I will thank you if you will do it at
          all, but I would rather you would have said you would do it for my
          Master, for what a blessed Master he has been to you! Do it for his
          sake." I may be speaking very plainly home to some of you. I hope I
          am. If there be any of you who have got into a bad state of heart and
          have said you never will forgive a rebellious son, do not say so again
          till you have looked at the matter, for Christ's sake. Not for the
          boy's sake, not for your neighbour's sake who has offended you, not
          for any other reason do I urge you to mercy, but for Christ's sake.
          Come, you two brothers, who have fallen out, love each other for
          Christ's sake; come, you two sisters, come you two friends who have
          been alienated, get together directly, and end all your ill feeling
          for Christ's sake. You must not keep a drop of malice in your soul,
          for Christ's sake. Oh charming word, how it melts us, and as it melts
          it seems to leave no trace of anger behind it: for Christ's sake our
          love suffers long and never fails.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not know how to put this next word I am going to say. It is a
          paradox. You must forgive or you cannot be saved; at the same time you
          must not do it from compulsion; you must do it freely. There is a way
          of carrying this into practice, though I cannot explain it in words.
          You must forgive, not because you are forced to, but because you
          heartily do it. Remember, it is of no use for you to put your money
          into that offering box as you go out unless you remember first to
          forgive your brother. God will not accept the gifts, prayers, or
          praises of an unrelenting heart. Though you leave all your substance
          to his cause, he will not accept a penny of it if you die in an
          unforgiving temper. There is no grace where there is no willingness to
          overlook faults. John saith, "He that loveth not his brother whom he
          hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" The very prayer
          that teaches you to ask for mercy bids you say "forgive us, as we
          forgive our debtors." Unless you have forgiven others you read your
          own death-warrant when you repeat the Lord's prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I want to say to you all, brethren, that, as brothers and
          sisters in Christ Jesus, if we are to forgive one another, there must
          be some other things which we ought to do. And the first is, do not
          let us provoke each other to offend. If I know that a man does not
          like a certain thing, I will not thrust it in his way. Do not say,
          "Well, but if he is short tempered, I cannot help it; he should not be
          so ready to take offence. I cannot be always paying deference to his
          absurd sensitiveness." No; but, brother, your friend is very ready to
          take offence, and you know that he is; have respect, then, to his
          infirmity of temper, such as you would have if he were afflicted in
          body. If you have rheumatism or gout, your friends do not go stamping
          across the room and saying, "He ought not to mind that; he ought not
          to feel it." Kind-hearted people step across the floor with a light
          step, for fear they should hurt the poor suffering limb. If a man has
          a diseased mind and is very irritable, treat him gently, pity his
          infirmity, and do not irritate him. A friend wrote me a short while
          ago a letter of serious complaint against a brother who had been very
          angry with him, and had spoken very sharply while excited to passion.
          I felt bound to hear the other side of the story, and I was obliged to
          say, "Now, you two brothers are both wrong. You, my brother, lost your
          temper; but you, my other brother, irritated him, so that I do not
          wonder he did lose his temper. And when you saw he had lost his temper
          why did you not go away, or do something to quiet him? No, but you
          remained to increase the wrath, and then wrote to expose him." I blame
          the wood for burning, but what shall I say of the bellows? It was
          wrong to blaze, but was it right to fan the flame? Very often when a
          man is angry he may not be the only one to blame. Therefore, brothers
          and sisters, if we are to forgive each other, do not let us provoke
          each other to offend.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, do not make offences. Oftentimes a man has been
          offended at another for no reason at all. One person has said of
          another as he passed him in the street, "He will not even nod to me.
          lie is too proud to own me, because I am a poor man." Now, that
          beloved friend who was thus blamed could not see much further than his
          hand, for he was shortsighted. Another has been censured for not
          hearing, though he was deaf, and another for not shaking hands when Ii
          is arm was crippled. Do not imagine offences where they are not
          intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, do not take offences where they are intended. It is a splendid
          thing if you will not be offended. Nothing makes a man feel so small
          as when you accept what he intended for an insult as if it were a
          compliment, and thank him for it. Can you master yourself to that
          point? Remember, when you have conquered yourself you have conquered
          the world. You have overcome everybody when you have so fully overcome
          your own spirit that you remain content with that which naturally
          would excite your wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, if you must be offended, dear brother, do not exaggerate an
          offence. Some good women, I was about to say, and men also, when they
          come as tale-bearers with a charge, make a great many flourishes and
          additions. They go a long way round, and they bring innumerable
          beliefs, and suggestions, and hints, and hearsays into the business,
          until a midge's egg becomes as huge as ever was laid by an ostrich. I
          begin coolly to strip off the feathers and the paint, and I say, "Now,
          I do not see what that point had to do with it, or what that remark
          has in it all I can see when I come to look at the bare fact is
          so-and-so, and that was not much, was it?" "Oh, but there was more
          intended." Do hot believe that, dear brother, dear sister. If there
          must be something wrong, let it be as little as you can. If you have a
          telescope, look through the large hole and minify instead of
          magnifying, or, better still, do not look at it at all. A blind eye is
          often the best eye a man can have, and a deaf ear is better by far
          than one which hears too much. "Also take no heed," says Solomon,
          "unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse
          thee." Something you have done may irritate a servant, and he may make
          remarks which are unbecoming and impertinent. Don't hear what he is
          muttering. Keep out of hearing, lie will be sorry to-morrow, and if he
          thinks you did not hear him he will continue in your service and be
          faithful to you. What would you do if your master picked you up for
          every word, and if he caught up every sentence that you uttered? How
          would you live at all if he reckoned sharply with you? No, dear
          friends, as you have to forgive one another, do not take offence, and
          when offence is given do not exaggerate it, and, if you can, do not
          even observe it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, do not publish offences. There has been something very
          offensive said. What then? Do not repeat it. Do not go first to one,
          and then to another, and say, "Now this is quite private, and mind you
          keep it a secret; So-and-so has spoken shamefully." Better that you
          should let your heart break than go up and down with a fire-brand in
          this fashion. If a brother has done wrong why should you do wrong? You
          will be doing wrong if you publish his fault. Remember how the curse
          came upon Noah's son for exposing his father; and how much better it
          is for us all when there is anything wrong to go backward and cover
          it, without even looking at it ourselves, if we can help it. Cover it
          up: cover it up. Charity covereth a multitude of sins. Not only one,
          two, three sins will charity cover, but she carries a cloak which
          covereth a whole host of faults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, my brethren, and with this I close, never in any way,
          directly or indirectly, avenge yourselves. For any fault that is ever
          done to you, the Master says unto you, -- resist not evil. In all
          things bend, bow, yield, submit. "If you tread on a worm it will
          turn," says somebody. And is a worm your example? Christ shall be
          mine. It is a shocking thing when a Christian man forgets his Lord to
          find an excuse for himself among the poor creatures under his feet.
          But if it must be so, what does a worm do when it turns? When you have
          trodden on a worm, does it bite? Does the worm hurt any one? Ah, no.
          It has turned, but it has turned in its agony and writhed before you,
          that is all. You may do that, if you must. Brother, the most splendid
          vengeance you can ever have is to do good to them that do you evil,
          and to speak well of them that speak ill of you. They will be ashamed
          to look at you; they will never hurt you again if they see that you
          cannot be provoked except it be to greater love and larger kindness.
          This ought to be the mark of Christians; not "I will have the law of
          you," or "I will avenge myself," but "I will bear and forbear even to
          the end." "Vengeance is mine. I will repay it, saith the Lord." Do not
          take that into your hand which God says belongs to him, but as he for
          Christ's sake has forgiven you, so also forgive all those who do you
          wrong. "How long am I to do that?" says one. "I would not mind doing
          it three or four times." There was one of old who would go the length
          of six or seven, but Jesus Christ said "unto seventy times seven. That
          is a very considerable number. You may count whether you have yet
          reached that amount, and if you have you will now be glad to begin
          again, still forgiving, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven
          you. God help us to be patient to the end. Though I have not just now
          been preaching Christ Jesus as the object of the sinner's trust, yet
          remember that he must also be the object of our imitation. This is the
          kind of doctrine which Christ himself preached, and therefore, since
          he preached continually this love to our neighbour, and forgiveness of
          our enemies, we ought both to preach and to practise it. Go ye and
          believe in him, and be imitators of him, remembering that he forgave
          his murderers upon the cross whereon he wrought out our redemption.
          May his Spirit rest upon you evermore. Amen.
