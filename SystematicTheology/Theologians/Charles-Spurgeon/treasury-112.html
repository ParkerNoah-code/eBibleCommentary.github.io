</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">TITLE AND SUBJECT. <b>A Song or Psalm of David. </b></p>

<p align="justify">To be sung jubilantly as a national hymn, or solemnly as 
    a sacred psalm. We cannot find it in our heart to dismiss this psalm by 
    merely referring the reader first to Psalm 57:7-11 and then to Psalm 
    60:5-12, though it will be at once seen that those two portions of Scripture 
    are almost identical with the verses before us. It is true that most of the 
    commentators have done so, and we are not so presumptuous as to dispute 
    their wisdom; but we hold for ourselves that the words would not have been 
    repeated if there had not been an object for so doing, and that this object 
    could not have been answered if every hearer of it had said, "Ah, we had 
    that before, and therefore we need not meditate upon it again." </p>
<p align="justify">The Holy Spirit is not so short of expressions that he 
    needs to repeat himself, and the repetition cannot be meant merely to fill 
    the book. There must be some intention in the arrangement of two former 
    divine utterances in a new connection; whether we can discover that intent 
    is another matter. It is at least ours to endeavor to do so, and we may 
    expect divine assistance therein.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">First we have an utterance dictated by the spirit of 
    praise, Verses 1-5; </p>
<p align="justify">then a second deliverance evoked by the spirit of 
    believing prayer, Verses 6-12; </p>
<p align="justify">and then a final word of resolve (Verses 13), as the 
    warrior hears the war trumpet summoning him to join battle immediately, and 
    therefore marches with his fellow soldiers at once to the fray.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. O God, my heart is fixed. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Though I have many wars to disturb me, and many cares to 
    toss me to and fro—yet I am settled in one mind and cannot be driven from 
    it. My heart has taken hold and abides in one resolve. Your grace has 
    overcome the fickleness of nature, and I am now in a resolute and determined 
    frame of mind. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will sing and give praise. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Both with voice and music will I extol you, "I will sing 
    and play", as some read it. Even though I have to shout in the battle I will 
    also sing in my soul, and if my fingers must needs be engaged with the 
    bow—yet shall they also touch the ten stringed instrument and show forth 
    your praise. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Even with my glory.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">With my intellect, my tongue, my poetic faculty, my 
    musical skill, or whatever else causes me to be renowned, and confers honor 
    upon me. It is my glory to be able to speak and not to be a dumb animal, 
    therefore my voice shall show forth your praise. It is my glory to know God 
    and not to be a heathen, and therefore my instructed intellect shall adore 
    you. It is my glory to be a saint and no more a rebel, therefore the grace I 
    have received shall bless you. It is my glory to be immortal and not a mere 
    brute which perishes, therefore my inmost life shall celebrate your majesty.
    </p>
<p align="justify">When he says <i>I will</i>, he supposes that there might 
    be some temptation to refrain—but this he puts on one side, and with fixed 
    heart prepares himself for the joyful engagement. He who sings with a fixed 
    heart is likely to sing on, and all the while to sing well.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Awake, psaltery and harp.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">As if he could not be content with voice alone—but must 
    use the well-tuned strings, and communicate to them something of his own 
    liveliness. Strings are wonderful things when some men play upon them, they 
    seem to become sympathetic and incorporated with the minstrel as if his very 
    soul were imparted to them and thrilled through them. Only when a thoroughly 
    enraptured soul speaks in the instrument, can music be acceptable with God. 
    As mere musical sound the Lord can have no pleasure therein, he is only 
    pleased with the thought and feeling which are thus expressed. When a man 
    has musical gift, he should regard it as too lovely a power to be enlisted 
    in the cause of sin. Well did Charles Wesley say: </p>
<p align="justify">"If well I know the tuneful art<br/>
    To captivate a human heart,<br/>
    The glory, Lord, be Thine.<br/>
    A servant of your blessed will,<br/>
    I here devote my utmost skill<br/>
    To sound the praise divine."</p>
<p align="justify">"Your own musician, Lord, inspire,<br/>
    And let my consecrated lyre<br/>
    Repeat the Psalmist's part.<br/>
    His Son and Your reveal in me,<br/>
    And fill with sacred melody<br/>
    The fibers of my heart."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I myself will awake early. I will call up the dawn. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The best and brightest hours of the day shall find me 
    heartily aroused to bless my God. Some singers had need to awake, for they 
    sing in drawling tones, as if they were half asleep; the tune drags wearily 
    along, there is no feeling or sentiment in the singing—but the listener 
    hears only a dull mechanical sound, as if the choir ground out the notes 
    from a worn out barrel-organ. </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, choristers, wake up, for this is not a work for 
    dreamers—but such as requires your best powers in their liveliest condition. 
    In all worship this should be the personal resolve of each worshiper: "I 
    myself will awake."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. I will praise you, O LORD, among the people. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Whoever may come to hear me, devout or profane, believer 
    or heathen, civilized or barbarian, I shall not cease my music. David seemed 
    inspired to foresee that his Psalms would be sung in every land, from 
    Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral strand. His heart was large, he 
    would have the whole race of man listen to his joy in God, and lo, he has 
    his desire, for his psalmody is cosmopolitan—no poet is so universally known 
    as he. He had but one theme, he sang Jehovah and none beside, and his work 
    being thus made of gold, silver, and precious stones, has endured the fiery 
    ordeal of time, and was never more prized than at this day. Happy man, to 
    have thus made his choice to be the Lord's musician, he retains his office 
    as the Poet Laureate of the kingdom of Heaven, and shall retain it until the 
    crack of doom. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And I will sing praises unto you among the nations. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is written, not only to complete the parallelism of 
    the verse—but to reaffirm his fixed resolve. He would march to battle 
    praising Jehovah, and when he had conquered he would make the captured 
    cities ring with Jehovah's praises. He would carry his religion with him 
    wherever he pushed his conquests, and the vanquished should not hear the 
    praises of David—but the glories of the Lord Almighty.</p>
<p align="justify">Would to God that wherever professing Christians travel 
    they would carry the praises of the Lord with them! <i>It is to be feared 
    that some leave their religion when they leave their homes. </i>Nations and 
    peoples would soon know the gospel of Jesus if every Christian traveler were 
    as intensely devout as the Psalmist. Alas, it is to be feared that the 
    Lord's name is profaned rather than honored among the heathen by many who 
    are named by the name of Christ.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. For your mercy is great above the heavens.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">And therefore there must be no limit of time, or place, 
    or people, when that mercy is to be extolled. As the heavens over arch the 
    whole earth, and from above mercy pours down upon men, so shall you be 
    praised everywhere beneath the sky. </p>
<p align="justify">Mercy is greater than the mountains, though they pierce 
    the clouds; earth cannot hold it all, it is so vast, so boundless, so 
    exceeding high that the heavens themselves are over—topped thereby. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And your truth teaches unto the clouds. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As far as we can see we behold your truth and 
    faithfulness, and there is much beyond which lies shrouded in cloud—but we 
    are sure that it is all mercy, though it be far above and out of our sight. 
    Therefore shall the song be lifted high and the psalm shall peal forth 
    without stint of far resounding music. Here is ample space for the loudest 
    chorus, and a subject which deserves thunders of praise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens—and your 
    glory above all the earth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let your praise be according to the greatness of your 
    mercy. Ah, if we were to measure our devotion thus, with what ardor should 
    we sing! The whole earth with its overhanging dome would seem too scant an 
    orchestra, and all the faculties of all mankind too little for the 
    hallelujah. Angels would be called in to aid us, and surely they would come. 
    They will come in that day when the whole earth shall be filled with the 
    praises of Jehovah. We long for the time when God shall be universally 
    worshiped, and his glory in the gospel shall be everywhere made known. </p>
<p align="justify">This is a truly missionary prayer. David had none of the 
    exclusiveness of the modern Jew, or the narrow-heartedness of some nominal 
    Christians. For God's sake, that his glory might be everywhere revealed, he 
    longed to see Heaven and earth full of the divine praise. Amen, so let it 
    be. </p>
<p align="justify">Now prayer follows upon praise, and derives strength of 
    faith and holy boldness therefrom. It is frequently best to begin worship 
    with a hymn, and then to bring forth our vials full of odors after the harps 
    have commenced their sweeter sounds.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. That your beloved may be delivered—save with 
    your right hand, and answer me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let my prayer avail for all the beloved ones. Sometimes a 
    nation seems to hang upon the petitions of one man. With what ardor should 
    such a one pour out his soul! David does so here. </p>
<p align="justify">It is easy praying for the Lord's beloved, for we feel 
    sure of a favorable answer, since the Lord's heart is already set upon doing 
    them good: yet it is solemn work to plead when we feel that the condition of 
    a whole beloved nation depends upon what the Lord means to do with us whom 
    he has placed in a representative position. </p>
<p align="justify">"Answer me, that your many beloved ones may be 
    delivered": it is an urgent prayer. David felt that the case demanded the 
    right hand of God—his wisest, speediest, and most efficient interposition, 
    and he feels sure of obtaining it for himself, since his cause involved the 
    safety of the chosen people. </p>
<p align="justify">Will the Lord fail to use his right hand of power on 
    behalf of those whom he has set at his right hand of favor? Shall not the 
    beloved be delivered by him who loves them? When our suit is not a selfish 
    one—but is bound up with the cause of God, we may be very bold about it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. God has spoken in his holiness.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Aforetime the Lord had made large promises to David, and 
    these his holiness had guaranteed. The divine attributes were pledged to 
    give the son of Jesse great blessings; there was no fear that the covenant 
    God would run back from his plighted word.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will rejoice.</p></b> If God has spoken we may well be 
    glad: the very fact of a divine revelation is a joy. If the Lord had meant 
    to destroy us he would not have spoken to us as he has done. But what God 
    has spoken is a still further reason for gladness, for he has declared "the 
    sure mercies of David", and promised to establish his seed upon his throne, 
    and to subdue all his enemies. David greatly rejoiced after the Lord had 
    spoken to him by the mouth of Nathan. He sat before the Lord in a wonder of 
    joy. See 1 Chronicles 17:1-27, and note that in the next chapter David began 
    to act vigorously against his enemies, even as in this Psalm he vows to do.
<b>
<p align="justify">I will divide Shechem. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Home conquests come first. Foes must be dislodged from 
    Israel's territory, and lands properly settled and managed. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And mete out the valley of Succoth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">On the other side Jordan as well as on this the land must 
    be put in order, and secured against all wandering marauders. Some rejoicing 
    leads to inaction—but not that which is grounded upon a lively faith in the 
    promise of God. </p>
<p align="justify">See how David prays, as if he had the blessing already, 
    and could share it among his men—this comes from having sung so heartily 
    unto the Lord his helper. See how he resolves on action, like a man whose 
    prayers are only a part of his life, and vital portions of his action.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Gilead is mine.</p></b> Thankful hearts dwell upon 
    the gifts which the Lord has given them, and think it no task to mention 
    them one by one.
<b>
<p align="justify">Manasseh is mine.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">I have it already, and it is to me the token and 
    assurance that the rest of the promised heritage will also come into my 
    possession in due time. If we gratefully acknowledge what we have, we shall 
    be in better heart for obtaining that which as yet we have not received.</p>
<p align="justify">He who gives us Gilead and Manasseh will not fail to put 
    the rest of the promised territory into our hands. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Ephraim also is the strength of my head. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This tribe furnished David with more than twenty thousand 
    "mighty men of valor, famous throughout the house of their fathers": the 
    faithful loyalty of this band was, no doubt, a proof that the rest of the 
    tribe were with him, and so he regarded them as the helmet of the state, the 
    guard of his royal crown. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Judah is my lawgiver.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There had he seated the government and chief courts of 
    justice. No other tribe could lawfully govern but Judah: until Shiloh came 
    the divine decree fixed the legal power in that state. To us also there is 
    no lawgiver but our Lord who sprang out of Judah; and whenever Rome, or 
    Canterbury, or any other power shall attempt to set up laws and ordinances 
    for the church, we have but one reply, "Judah is my lawgiver." </p>
<p align="justify">Thus the royal psalmist rejoiced because his own land had 
    been cleansed of intruders, and a regular government had been set up, and 
    guarded by an ample force, and in all this he found encouragement to plead 
    for victory over his foreign foes. </p>
<p align="justify">Even thus do we plead with the Lord that as in one land 
    and another Christ's holy gospel has been set up and maintained, so also in 
    other lands the power of his scepter of grace may be owned until the whole 
    earth shall bow before him, and the Edom of Antichrist shall be crushed 
    beneath his feet.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Moab is my washpot. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This nation had shown no friendly spirit to the 
    Israelites—but had continually viewed them as a detested rival, therefore 
    they were to be subdued and made subject to David's throne. He claims by 
    faith the victory, and regards his powerful enemy with contempt. Nor was he 
    disappointed, for "the Moabites became David's servants and brought him 
    gifts" (2 Samuel 8:2). As men wash their feet after a long journey, and so 
    are revived, so vanquished difficulties serve to refresh us—we use Moab for 
    a washpot. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Over Edom will I cast out my shoe.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It shall be as the floor upon which the bather throws his 
    sandals, it shall lie beneath his foot, subject to his will and altogether 
    his own. Edom was proud—but David throws his slipper at it; its capital was 
    high—but he casts his sandal over it; it was strong—but he hurls his shoe at 
    it as the gage of battle. He had not entered yet into its rock built 
    fortresses—but since the Lord was with him he felt sure that he would do so. 
    Under the leadership of the Almighty, he felt so secure of conquering even 
    fierce Edom itself that he looks upon it as a mere slave, over which he 
    could exult with impunity. </p>
<p align="justify">We ought never to fear those who are defending the wrong 
    side, for since God is not with them, their <i>wisdom </i>is folly, their <i>
    strength </i>is weakness, and their <i>glory </i>is their shame. </p>
<p align="justify">We think too much of God's foes and talk of them with too 
    much respect. Who is this pope of Rome? His Holiness? Call him not so—but 
    call him, His Blasphemy! His Profanity! His Impudence! What are he and his 
    cardinals, and his legates—but the image and incarnation of Antichrist, to 
    be in due time cast with the beast and the false prophet into the lake of 
    fire! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Over Philistia will I triumph. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">David had done so in his youth, and he is all the more 
    sure of doing it again. We read that "David smote the Philistines and 
    subdued them" (2 Samuel 8:1), even as he has smitten Edom and filled it with 
    his garrisons. </p>
<p align="justify">The enemies with whom we battled in our youth are yet 
    alive, and we shall have more brushes with them before we die, but, blessed 
    be God, we are by no means dismayed at the prospect, for we expect to 
    triumph over them even more easily than aforetime.</p>
<p align="justify">Your right hand shall your people aid; <br/>
    Your faithful promise makes us strong; <br/>
    We will Philistia's land invade.<br/>
    And over Edom chant the song.</p>
<p align="justify">Through you we shall most valiant prove,<br/>
    And tread the foe beneath our feet; <br/>
    Through you our faith shall hills remove,<br/>
    And small as chaff the mountains beat.</p>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. Faith leads on to strong desire for the 
    realization of the promise, and hence the practical question, <b>Who will 
    bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom? </b>The 
    difficulty is plainly perceived. Petra is strong and hard to enter: the 
    Psalmist warrior knows that he cannot enter the city by his own power, and 
    he therefore asks who is to help him. He asks of the right person, even of 
    his Lord, who has all men at his beck, and can say to this man, "show my 
    servant the road", and he will show it; or to this band, "cut your way into 
    the rock city", and they will assuredly do it. </p>
<p align="justify">Of Edom it is written in Obadiah 1:3-4, "The pride of 
    your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and 
    make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, 'Who can bring me 
    down to the ground?' Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among 
    the stars, from there I will bring you down," declares the LORD." David 
    looked for his conquest to Jehovah's infinite power and he looked not in 
    vain.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Will not you, O God, who have cast us off? </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">This is grand faith which can trust the Lord even when he 
    seems to have cast us off. </p></i>Some can barely trust him when he pampers 
    them, and yet David relied upon him when Israel seemed under a cloud and the 
    Lord had hidden his face. O for more of this real and living faith. The 
    casting off will not last long when faith so gloriously keeps her hold. None 
    but the elect of God who have obtained "like precious faith" can sing—
<p align="justify">"Now you array your solemn face<br/>
    In angry frowns, without a smile; <br/>
    We, through the cloud, believe your grace,<br/>
    Secure of your compassion still."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And will not you, O God, go forth with our hosts? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Can you forever forsake your own and leave your people to 
    be overthrown by your enemies? The sweet singer is sure that Edom shall be 
    captured, because he cannot and will not believe that God will refrain from 
    going forth with the armies of his chosen people. </p>
<p align="justify">When we ask ourselves, "Who will be the means of our 
    obtaining a promised blessing?" we need not be discouraged if we perceive no 
    secondary agent, for we may then fall back upon the great Promiser himself, 
    and believe that he himself will perform his word unto us. </p>
<p align="justify">If no one else will lead us into Edom, the Lord himself 
    will do it, if he has promised it. Or if there must be visible instruments 
    he will use our hosts, feeble as they are. We need not that any new agency 
    should be created, God can strengthen our present hosts and enable them to 
    do all that is needed; all that is wanted even for the conquest of a world, 
    is that the Lord go forth with such forces as we already have. He can bring 
    us into the strong city even by such weak weapons as we wield today.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Give us help from trouble—for vain is the help 
    of man. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This prayer has often fallen from the lips of men who 
    have been bitterly disappointed by their fellows, and it has also been 
    poured out unto the Lord in the presence of some gigantic labor in which 
    mortal power is evidently of no avail. Edom cannot be entered by any human 
    power—yet from its fastnesses the robber bands come rushing down; therefore, 
    O Lord, interpose and give your people deliverance.<i> Help divine is 
    expected, because help human is of no avail. We ought to pray with all the 
    more confidence in God when our confidence in man is altogether gone. When 
    the help of man is vain, we shall not find it vain to seek the help of God.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. With God we will gain the victory.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God's help shall inspire us to help ourselves. Faith is 
    neither a coward nor a sluggard: she knows that God is with her, and 
    therefore she does valiantly; she knows that he will tread down her enemies, 
    and therefore she arises to tread them down in his name.<i> Where praise and 
    prayer have preceded the battle, we may expect to see heroic deeds and 
    decisive victories</i>. <i>Through God is our secret support; from that 
    source we draw all our courage, wisdom, and strength</i>. This is the public 
    outflow from that secret source: our inward and spiritual faith proves 
    itself by outward and valorous deeds. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he will trample down our enemies. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They shall fall before him, and as they lie prostrate he 
    shall march over them, and all the hosts of his people with him. </p>
<p align="justify">This is a prophecy. It was fulfilled to David—but it 
    remains true to the Son of David and all who are on his side. The Church 
    shall yet arouse herself to praise her God with all her heart, and then with 
    songs and hosannas she will advance to the great battle; her foes shall be 
    overthrown and utterly crushed by the power of her God, and the Lord's glory 
    shall be above all the earth. Send it in our time, we beseech you, O Lord.</p>
