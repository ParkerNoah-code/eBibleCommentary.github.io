          16. The heavens, the heavens are Jehovah's: but the earth he hath
          given to the children of men.17. O God! the dead shall not praise
          thee, nor those who go down to silence.18. But we will bless God from
          this time, and for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.

          16 The heavens, the heavens are Jehovah's In this passage the prophet
          extols the bounty of God, and his paternal regard for the human race,
          in that, though he stood in need of nothing himself, he yet created
          the world, with all its fullness, for their use. How comes it to pass
          that the earth is every where covered with such a great variety of
          good things, meeting our eye in all directions, unless that God, as a
          provident father of a family, had designed to make provision for our
          wants? In proportion, therefore, to the comforts which we here enjoy,
          are the tokens of his fatherly care. This is the prophet's meaning,
          which I am astonished is so little attended to by the most of
          interpreters. The amount is, that God, satisfied with his own glory,
          has enriched the earth with abundance of good things, that mankind may
          not lack any thing. At the same time he demonstrates, that, as God has
          his dwelling-place in the heavens, he must be independent of all
          worldly riches; for, assuredly, neither wine, nor corn, nor any thing
          requisite for the support of the present life is produced there.
          Consequently, God has every resource in himself. To this circumstance
          the repetition of the, term heavens refers, The heavens, the heavens
          are enough for God; and as he is superior to all aid, he is to himself
          instead of a hundred worlds. It remains, therefore, as another
          consequence from this, that all the riches with which the world
          abounds proclaim aloud what a beneficent father God is to mankind. It
          is indeed surprising that there should be no relish for this doctrine,
          considering that the Holy Spirit spoke of the inestimable goodness of
          God. Under the papacy, they chanted this psalm in their churches, and
          they continue the practice still; but is there one among a hundred of
          them who reflects that God, in bestowing all good things upon us,
          reserves nothing for himself, except a grateful acknowledgment of
          them? And not only in this matter does the ingratitude of the world
          appear, but the wicked wretches have conducted themselves most vilely,
          in open and infamous blasphemy; perverting this verse, and making a
          jest of it, saying that God remains unconcerned in heaven, and pays no
          regard to the affairs of men. The prophet here expressly declares that
          the world is employed by God, for the sole purpose of testifying his
          paternal solicitude towards mankind; and yet these swine and dogs have
          made these words a laughing-stock, as if God, by reason of his vast
          distance from men, totally disregarded them. And here I am induced to
          relate a memorable story. While we were supping in a certain inn, and
          speaking of the hope of the heavenly life, a profane despiser of God
          happening to be present, treated our discourse with derision, and now
          and then mockingly exclaimed, "The heaven of heavens is the Lord's."
          Instantly afterwards he was seized with dreadful pain, and began to
          vociferate, "O God! O God!" and, having a powerful voice, he filled
          the whole apartment with his cries. Then I, who had felt indignant at
          his conduct, proceeded, in my own way, to tell him warmly, that now at
          least he perceived that they who mocked God were not permitted to
          escape with impunity. One of the guests, an honest and pious man, yet
          alive, but withal facetious, employed the occasion thus, "Do you
          invoke God? Have you forgotten your philosophy? Why do you not permit
          him to remain at ease in his own heaven?" And as often as the one
          bawled out, "O God!" the other, mocking him, retorted, "Where is now
          thy Coelum coeli Domino?" At that time his pain indeed was mitigated;
          nevertheless, the remainder of his life was spent in impunity.

          17 O God! the dead shall not praise thee In these words the prophet
          goes on to beseech God to show himself propitious towards his Church,
          were there no other object to be gained than the preventing mankind
          from being utterly cut off, and the preserving a people, not only to
          enjoy his kindness, but also to invoke and praise his name. After
          celebrating God's peculiar favor towards the Israelites, and the
          beneficence which he displayed towards mankind at large, he has
          recourse to the mercy of God for the pardoning of the sins of his
          people. And he proceeds on this footing, that though the heathen
          nations revel amidst the profuseness of God's bounty, yet the seed of
          Abraham alone are set apart to celebrate his praises. "Lord, if thou
          shouldst allow us to perish, what would be the result, but that thy
          name would become extinct, and would be entombed with us?" From his
          appearing to deprive the dead of all sensibility, a question occurs:
          If souls, after they have departed from their corporeal prison, still
          survive? It is certain that they are then more vigorous and active,
          and; therefore, it must inevitably follow that God is also praised by
          the dead. Moreover, in appointing mankind their abode upon earth, he
          so disconnects them with God, that he leaves them a life such as they
          enjoy in common with the brutal tribes. For the earth was not given
          exclusively to men, but also to oxen, swine, dogs, lions, and bears,
          and what is more, to every sort of reptile and insect. For there is
          not a fly, nor a creeping thing, however mean, which the earth does
          not supply with an abode. The solution of the first question is easy.
          Men were so situated on the earth that they might, as it were, with
          one voice celebrate the praises of God. And it was to this concord
          that the prophet in this place referred, as does also the Scripture in
          many other passages.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I shall not die, but live, and declare the words of the Lord," (Psalm
          118: 17).
        </p>
        <p>The good king Hezekiah also, said,</p>
        <p>"The living, the living, he shall praise thee," (Isaiah 38:19).</p>
        <p>Jonah, too, when cast out of the belly of the fish, said,</p>
        <p>
          "I will offer sacrifices, and I will pay my vows unto the Lord,"
          (Jonah 2:10.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, the prophet very justly excludes the dead from taking any
          part in the celebration of God's praises; for among them there is no
          communion and fellowship qualifying them for mutually sounding forth
          his praises: the proclaiming of his glory on the earth being the very
          end of our existence. The reply to the second inquiry is this: The
          prophet says that the earth was given to mankind, that they might
          employ themselves in God's service, until they be put in possession of
          everlasting felicity. True, indeed, the abundance of the earth belongs
          also to the brutal tribes; but the Holy Spirit declares that all
          things were created principally for the use of men, that they might
          thereby recognize God as their father. In fine, the prophet concludes
          that the whole course of nature would be subverted, unless God saved
          his Church. The creation of the world would serve no good purpose, if
          there were no people to call upon God. Hence he infers that there will
          always be some left alive upon the earth. And he not only promises
          that the Church shall be preserved, but also calls upon all who are
          thus preserved to offer a tribute of gratitude to their deliverer;
          and, moreover, he engages in their name to set forth the praises of
          God. He does not speak merely of the persons who belong to one age,
          but of the whole body of the Church which God upholds from one
          generation after another, that he may never leave himself without some
          to testify and declare his justice, goodness, and mercy.<br />
