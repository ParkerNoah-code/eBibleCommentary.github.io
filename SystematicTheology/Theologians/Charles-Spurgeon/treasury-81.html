<p align="justify">Preface to Volume 4, Psalms 79-103<br/>
Â </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The work of compiling notes from this volume may be 
    judged from the fact that I wrote a brilliant teacher for some assistance in 
    my research on Psalm 103. I received the following note. "I have hunted 
    through my books and was surprised to find that with the exception of what 
    is universally known, there is little written about Psalm 103." This most 
    generous brother had the warmest zeal and love to investigate, yet this was 
    the result. Using the Psalms in this volume, I repeated the experiment on 
    other Bible scholars and received the same reply. Hence, dear reader, your 
    patience has been tested in waiting for Volume Four of The Treasury, and my 
    toil has correspondingly increased. </p>
<p align="justify">Here, however, is the volume: as thick as its 
    predecessors, and I hope not inferior. If it is, I can honestly say that it 
    is not the fault of my endeavors.<i> I have withheld no energy, spared no 
    cost, and took whatever time was necessary</i>. Although time has been a 
    precious commodity, it has frequently been snatched from rest that fatigue 
    demanded and prudence might have wisely yielded. Volume Four is finished, 
    and with it, two-thirds of my allotted task. May God be praised!</p>
<p align="justify">I am surprised at the general scarcity of sermons and 
    comments on this portion of the Psalms, for it contains some of the more 
    notable compositions, such as Psalms 84, 90, 91, 92, and 103. This section 
    of the Psalms is so rich that, had several volumes existed illustrating any 
    of them, it would not have been a surprise. When I found one sermon on a 
    passage, it was generally easy to collect many; preachers run so much in 
    ruts that they leave a large portion of the Scripture without exposition. 
    This suggests many thoughts that will naturally occur to every thoughtful 
    reader. I need not enlarge on it in a mere preface, but this much may be 
    said without offense. If the habit of expounding Scripture passages that are 
    read in public worship should ever become more common, the preparation for 
    doing this in an interesting and instructive manner would greatly enlarge 
    the range of texts discussed from the pulpit. It would inevitably lead 
    people to receive more of God's word and less of man's. This would be no 
    small benefit.</p>
<p align="justify">I think it right to repeat that I am not to be understood 
    as endorsing all the passages quoted from other authors. The names are 
    given, and each writer bears their own responsibility.</p>
<p align="justify">Only one word of defense will further delay the reader. A 
    critic has so greatly mistaken my meaning that he found human vanity in the 
    title to the sermon notes. I am amazed. I do not pretend to be entirely free 
    from that vice, but no trace of it is discovered by my keenest and most 
    conscientious inspection. I originally called the sermon outlines, "Hints to 
    the Village Preacher," because I did not think they were good enough to 
    offer my brethren in the regular ministry. I hoped that they might aid those 
    good people who are generally, but I think incorrectly, called <i>lay 
    preachers</i>, who are not supposed to have the time and the books of 
    regular ministers. I thought this somewhat modest and did not see how it 
    could be misunderstood. Our village ministers are among the most thoughtful 
    and useful of our brotherhood. I never dreamed of casting a <i>slur </i>on 
    them. Since I have been misunderstood, however, I will take the higher 
    ground. I trust the hints may be useful to <i>any </i>preacher, in city or 
    country. The other day, I met a most eminent metropolitan preacher, and he 
    kindly thanked me for suggesting a <i>hint </i>in The Treasury for a sermon 
    he had hoped had been most acceptable to his congregation. He remarked that 
    there was no need to be bashful about the "Hints." So I have followed his 
    advice and may be misunderstood again. It is a small matter to be unjustly 
    censured, but I would not look down on preachers even in the most obscure 
    places, for this is the last thing in my heart.</p>
<p align="justify">For the generous reviews the three volumes have received 
    I am deeply grateful. I commit this fourth volume to the press, praying that 
    it may, according to the Lord's will, build His church and His glory.</p>
