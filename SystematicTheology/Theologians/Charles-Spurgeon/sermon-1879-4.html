          "Have ye not read?...Have ye not read?...If ye had known what this
          meaneth." -- Matthew 12:3-7.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES were great readers of the law. They studied
          the sacred books continually, poring over each word and letter. They
          made notes of very little importance, but still very curious notes --
          as to which was the middle verse of the entire old Testament, which
          verse was halfway to the middle, and how many times such a word
          occurred, and even how many times a letter occurred, and the size of
          the letter, and its peculiar position. They have left us a mass of
          wonderful notes upon the mere words of Holy Scripture. They might have
          done the same thing upon another book for that matter, and the
          information would have been about as important as the facts which they
          have so industriously collected concerning the letter of the old
          Testament. They were, however, intense readers of the law. They picked
          a quarrel with the Saviour upon a matter touching this law, for they
          carried it at their fingers' ends, and were ready to use it as a bird
          of prey does its talons to tear and rend. Our Lord's disciples had
          plucked some ears of corn, and rubbed them between their hands.
          According to Pharisaic interpretation, to rub an ear of corn is a kind
          of threshing, and, as it is very wrong to thresh on the Sabbath day,
          therefore it must be very wrong to rub out an ear or two of wheat when
          you are hungry on the Sabbath morning. That was their argument, and
          they came to the Saviour with it, and with their version of the
          Sabbath law. The Saviour generally carried the war into the enemy's
          camp, and he did so on this occasion. He met them on their own ground,
          and he said to them, "Have ye not read?" -- a cutting question to the
          scribes and Pharisees, though there is nothing apparently sharp about
          it. It was very a fair and proper question to put to them; but only
          think of putting it to them. "Have ye not read?" "Read!" they could
          have said, "Why, we have read the book through very many times. We are
          always reading it. No passage escapes our critical eyes." Yet our Lord
          proceeds to put the question a second time -- "Have ye not read?" as
          if they had not read after all, though they were the greatest readers
          of the law then living. He insinuates that they have not read at all;
          and then he gives them, incidentally, the reason why he had asked them
          whether they had read. He says, "If ye had known what this meaneth,"
          as much as to say, "Ye have not read, because ye have not understood."
          Your eyes have gone over the words, and you have counted the letters,
          and you have marked the position of each verse and word, and you have
          said learned things about all the books, and yet you are not even
          readers of the sacred volume, for you have not acquired the true art
          of reading; you do not understand, and therefore you do not truly read
          it. You are mere skimmers and glancers at the Word: you have not read
          it, for you do not understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That is the subject of our present discourse, or, at least the
          first point of it, that IN ORDER TO THE TRUE READING OF THE SCRIPTURES
          THERE MUST BE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEM.
        </p>
        <p>
          I scarcely need to preface these remarks by saying that we must read
          the Scriptures. You know how necessary it is that we should be fed
          upon the truth of Holy Scripture. Need I suggest the question as to
          whether you do read your Bibles or not? I am afraid that this is a
          magazine reading age a newspaper reading age a periodical reading age,
          but not so much a Bible reading age as it ought to be. In the old
          Puritanic times men used to have a scant supply of other literature,
          but they found a library enough in the one Book, the Bible. And how
          they did read the Bible! How little of Scripture there is in modern
          sermons compared with the sermons of those masters of theology, the
          Puritanic divines! Almost every sentence of theirs seems to cast side
          lights upon a text of Scripture; not only the one they are preaching
          about, but many others as well are set in a new light as the discourse
          proceeds. They introduce blended lights from other passages which are
          parallel or semi-parallel thereunto, and thus they educate their
          readers to compare spiritual things with spiritual. I would to God
          that we ministers kept more closely to the grand old Book. We should
          be instructive preachers if we did so, even if we were ignorant of
          "modern thought," and were not "abreast of the times." I warrant you
          we should be leagues ahead of our times if we kept closely to the Word
          of God. As for you, my brothers and sisters, who have not to preach,
          the best food for you is the Word of God itself. Sermons and books are
          well enough, but streams that run for a long distance above ground
          gradually gather for themselves somewhat of the soil through which
          they flow, and they lose the cool freshness with which they started
          from the spring head. Truth is sweetest where it breaks from the
          smitten Rock, for at its first gush it has lost none of its
          heavenliness and vitality. It is always best to drink at the well and
          not from the tank. You shall find that reading the Word of God for
          yourselves, reading it rather than notes upon it, is the surest way of
          growing m grace. Drink of the unadulterated milk of the Word of God,
          and not of the skim milk, or the milk and water of man's word.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, now, beloved, our point is that much apparent Bible reading is
          not Bible reading at all. The verses pass under the eye, and the
          sentences glide over the mind, but there is no true reading. An old
          preacher used to say, the Word has mighty free course among many
          nowadays, for it goes in at one of their ears and out at the other; so
          it seems to be with some readers -- they can read a very great deal,
          because they do not read anything. The eye glances but the mind never
          rests. The soul does not light upon the truth and stay there. It flits
          over the landscape as a bird might do, but it builds no nest there,
          and finds no rest for the sole of its foot. Such reading is not
          reading. Understanding the metering is the essence of true reading.
          Reading has a kernel to it, and the mere shed is little worth. In
          prayer there is such a thing as praying in prayer -- a praying that is
          in the bowels of the prayer. So in praise there is a praising in song,
          an inward fire of intense devotion which is the life of the
          hallelujah. It is so in fasting: there is a fasting which is not
          fasting, and there is an inward fasting, a fasting of the soul, which
          is the soul of fasting. It is even so with the reading of the
          Scriptures. There is an interior reading, a kernel reading -- a true
          and living reading of the Word. This is the soul of reading; and, if
          it be not there, the reading is a mechanical exercise, and profits
          nothing. Now, beloved, unless we understand what we read we have not
          read it; the heart of the reading is absent. We commonly condemn the
          Romanists for keeping the daily service in the Latin tongue; yet it
          might as well be in the Latin language as in any other tongue if it be
          not understood by the people. Some comfort themselves with the idea
          that they have done a good action when they have read a chapter, into
          the meaning of which they have not entered at all; but does not nature
          herself reject this as a mere superstition? If you had turned the book
          upside down, and spent the same times in looking at the characters in
          that direction, you would have gained as much good from it as you will
          in reading it in the regular way without understanding it. If you had
          a New Testament in Greek it would be very Greek to some of you, but it
          would do you as much good to look at that as it does to look at the
          English New Testament unless you read with understanding heart. It is
          not the letter which saves the soul; the letter killeth m many senses,
          and never can it give life. If you harp on the letter alone you may be
          tempted to use it as a weapon against the truth, as the Pharisees did
          of old, and your knowledge of the letter may breed pride in you to
          your destruction. It is the spirit, the real inner meaning, that is
          sucked into the soul, by which we are blessed and sanctified. We
          become saturated with the Word of God, like Gideon's fleece, which was
          wet with the dew of heaven; and this can only come to pass by our
          receiving it into our minds and hearts, accepting it as God's truth,
          and so far understanding it as to delight in it. We must understand
          it, then, or else we have not read it aright.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, the benefit of reading must come to the soul by the way of
          the understanding. When the high priest went into the holy place he
          always lit the golden candlestick before he kindled the incense upon
          the brazen altar, as if to show that the mind must have illumination
          before the affections can properly rise towards their divine object.
          There must be knowledge of God before there can be love to God: there
          must be a knowledge of divine things, as they are revealed, before
          there can be an enjoyment of them. We must try to make out, as far as
          our finite mind can grasp it, what God means by this and what he means
          by that; otherwise we may kiss the book and have no love to its
          contents, we may reverence the letter and yet really have no devotion
          towards the Lord who speaks to us in these words. Beloved, you will
          never get comfort to your soul out of what you do not understand, nor
          find guidance for your life out of what you do not comprehend; nor can
          any practical bearing upon your character come out of that which is
          not understood by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if we are thus to understand what we read or otherwise we read in
          vain, this shows us that when we come to the study of Holy Scripture
          we should try to have our mind well awake to it. We are not always
          fit, it seems to me, to read the Bible. At times it were well for us
          to stop before we open the volume. "Put off thy shoe from thy foot,
          for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." You have just
          come in from careful thought and anxiety about your worldly business,
          and you cannot immediately take that book and enter into its heavenly
          mysteries. As you ask a blessing over your meat before you fall to, so
          it would be a good rule for you to ask a blessing on the word before
          you partake of its heavenly food. Pray the Lord to strengthen your
          eyes before you dare to look into the eternal light of Scripture. As
          the priests washed their feet at the laver before they went to their
          holy work, so it were well to wash the soul's eyes with which you look
          upon God's word, to wash even the fingers, if I may so speak -- the
          mental fingers with which you will turn from page to page -- that with
          a holy book you may deal after a holy fashion. Say to your soul --
          "Come, soul, wake up: thou art not now about to read the newspaper;
          thou art not now perusing the pages of a human poet to be dazzled by
          his flashing poetry; thou art coming very near to God, who sits in the
          Word like a crowned monarch in his halls. Wake up, my glory; wake up,
          all that is within me. Though just now I may not be praising and
          glorifying God, I am about to consider that which should lead me so to
          do, and therefore it is an act of devotion. So be on the stir, my
          soul: be on the stir, and bow not sleepily before the awful throne of
          the Eternal." Scripture reading is our spiritual meal time. Sound the
          gong and call in every faculty to the Lord's own table to feast upon
          the precious meat which is now to be partaken of; or, rather, ring the
          church-bell as for worship, for the studying of the Holy Scripture
          ought to be as solemn a deed as when we lift the psalm upon the
          Sabbath day in the courts of the Lord's house.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these things be so, you will see at once, dear friends, that, if
          you are to understand what you read, you will need to meditate upon
          it. Some passages of Scripture lie clear before us -- blessed shallows
          in which the lambs may wade; but there are deeps in which our mind
          might rather drown herself than swim with pleasure, if she came there
          without caution. There are texts of Scripture which are made and
          constructed on purpose to make us think. By this means, among others,
          our heavenly Father won d educate us for heaven -- by making us think
          our way into divine mysteries. Hence he puts the word in a somewhat
          involved form to compel us to meditate upon it before we reach the
          sweetness of it. He might, you know, have explained it to us so that
          we might catch the thought in a minute, but he does not please to do
          so m every case. Many of the veils which are cast over Scripture are
          not meant to hide the meaning from the diligent but to compel the mind
          to be active, for oftentimes the diligence of the heart in seeking to
          know the divine mind does the heart more good than the knowledge
          itself. Meditation and careful thought exercise us and strengthen the
          son for the reception of the yet more lofty truths. I have heard that
          the mothers in the Balearic Isles, in the old times, who wanted to
          bring their boys up to be good slingers, would put their dinners up
          above them where they could not get at them until they threw a stone
          and fetched them down: our Lord wishes us to be good slingers, and he
          puts up some precious truth in a lofty place where we cannot get it
          down except by slinging at it; and, at last, we hit the mark and find
          food for our souls. Then have we the double benefit of learning the
          art of meditation and partaking of the sweet truth which it has
          brought within our reach. We must meditate, brothers. These grapes
          will yield no wine till we tread upon them. These olives must be put
          under the wheel, and pressed again and again, that the oil may flow
          therefrom. In a dish of nuts, you may know which nut has been eaten,
          because there is a little hole which the insect has punctured through
          the shell -- just a little hole, and then inside there is the living
          thing eating up the kernel. Well, it is a grand thing to bore through
          the shell of the letter, and then to live inside feeding upon the
          kernel. I would wish to be such a little worm as that, living within
          and upon the word of God, having bored my way through the shell, and
          having reached the innermost mystery of the blessed gospel. The word
          of God is always most precious to the man who most lives upon it. As I
          sat last year under a wide-spreading beech, I was pleased to mark with
          prying curiosity the singular habits of that most wonderful of trees,
          which seems to have an intelligence about it which other trees have
          not. I wondered and admired the beech, but I thought to myself, I do
          not think half as much of this beech tree as yonder squirrel does. I
          see him leap from bough to bough, and I feel sure that he dearly
          values the old beech tree, because he has his home somewhere inside it
          in a hollow place, these branches are his shelter, and those
          beech-nuts are his food. He lives upon the tree. It is his world, his
          playground, his granary, his home; indeed, it is everything to him,
          and it is not so to me, for I find my rest and food elsewhere. With
          God's word it is well for us to be like squirrels, living in it and
          living on it. Let us exercise our minds by leaping from bough to bough
          of it, find our rest and food in it, and make it our all in all. We
          shall be the people that get the profit out of it if we make it to be
          our food, our medicine, our treasury, our armourv, our rest, our
          delight. May the Holy Ghost lead us to do this and make the Word thus
          precious to our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I would next remind you that for this end we shall be
          compelled to pray. It is a grand thing to be driven to think, it is a
          grander thing to be driven to pray through having been made to think.
          Am I not addressing some of you who do not read the word of God, and
          am I not speaking to many more who do read it, but do not read it with
          the strong resolve that they will understand it? I know it must be so.
          Do you wish to begin to be true readers? Will you henceforth labour to
          understand? Then you must get to your knees. You must cry to God for
          direction. Who understands a book best? The author of it. If I want to
          ascertain the real meaning of a rather twisted sentence, and the
          author lives near me, and I can call upon him, I shall ring at his
          door and say, "Would you kindly tell me what you mean by that
          sentence? I have no doubt whatever that it is very dear, but I am such
          a simpleton, that I cannot make it out. I have not the knowledge and
          grasp of the subject which you possess, and therefore your allusions
          and descriptions are beyond my range of knowledge. It is quite within
          your range, and commonplace to you, but it is very difficult to me.
          Would you kindly explain your meaning to me?" A good man would be glad
          to be thus treated, and would think it no trouble to unravel his
          meaning to a candid enquirer. Thus I should be sure to get the correct
          meaning, for I should be going to the fountain head when I consulted
          the author himself. So, beloved, the Holy Spirit is with us, and when
          we take his book and begin to read, and want to know what it means, we
          must ask the Holy Spirit to reveal the meaning. He will not work a
          miracle, but he will elevate our minds, and he will suggest to us
          thoughts which will lead us on by their natural relation, the one to
          the other, till at last we come to the pith and marrow of his divine
          instruction. Seek then very earnestly the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
          for if the very soul of reading be the understanding of what we read,
          then we must in prayer call upon the Holy Ghost to unlock the secret
          mysteries of the inspired word.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we thus ask the guidance and teaching of the Holy Spirit, it will
          follow, dear friends, that we shall be ready to use all means arid
          helps towards the understanding of the Scriptures. When Philip asked
          the Ethiopian eunuch whether he understood the prophecy of Isaiah he
          replied, "How can 1, unless some man should guide me?" Then Philip
          went up and opened to him the word of the Lord. Some, under the
          pretense of being taught of the Spirit of God refuse to be instructed
          by books or by living men. This is no honouring of the Spirit of God;
          it is a disrespect to him, for if he gives to some of his servants
          more light than to others -- and it is clear he does -- then they are
          bound to give that light to others, and to use it for the good of the
          church. But if the other part of the church refuse to receive that
          light, to what end did the Spirit of God give it? This would imply
          that there is a mistake somewhere in the economy of gifts and graces,
          which is managed by the Holy Spirit. It cannot be so. The Lord Jesus
          Christ pleases to give more knowledge of his word and more insight
          into it to some of his servants than to others, and it is ours
          joyfully to accept the knowledge which he gives in such ways as he
          chooses to give it. It would be most wicked of us to say, "We will not
          have the heavenly treasure which exists in earthen vessels. If God
          will give us the heavenly treasure out of his own hand, but not
          through the earthen vessel, we will have it; but we think we are too
          wise, too heavenly minded, too spiritual altogether to care for jewels
          when they are placed in earthen pots. We will not hear anybody, and we
          will not read anything except the book itself, neither will we accept
          any light, except that which comes in through a crack in our own roof.
          We will not see by another man's candle, we would sooner remain in the
          dark." Brethren, do not let us fall into such folly. Let the light
          come from God, and though a child shall bring it, we will joyfully
          accept it. If any one of his servants, whether Paul or Apollos or
          Cephas, shall have received light from him, behold, "all are yours,
          and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's," and therefore accept of the
          light which God has kindled, and ask for grace that you may turn that
          light upon the word so that when you read it you may understand it.

        <p>
          I do not wish to say much more about this, but I should like to push
          it home upon some of you. You have Bibles at home, I know; you would
          not like to be without Bibles, you would think you were heathens if
          you had no Bibles. You have them very neatly bound, and they are very
          fine looking volumes: not much thumbed, not much worn, and not likely
          to be so, for they only come out on Sundays for an airing, and they
          lie in lavender with the clean pocket handkerchiefs all the rest of
          the week. You do not read the word, you do not search it, and how can
          you expect to get the divine blessing? If the heavenly gold is not
          worth digging for you are not likely to discover it. often and often
          have I told you that the searching of the Scriptures is not the way of
          salvation. The Lord bath said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
          thou shalt be saved." But, still, the reading of the word often leads,
          like the hearing of it, to faith, and faith bringeth salvation; for
          faith cometh by hearing, and reading is a sort of hearing. While you
          are seeking to know what the gospel is, it may please God to bless
          your souls. But what poor reading some of you give to your Bibles. I
          do not want to say anything which is too severe because it is not
          strictly true -- let your own consciences speak, but still, I make
          bold to enquire, -- Do not many of you read the Bible m a very hurried
          way -- just a little bit, and off you go? Do you not soon forget what
          you have read, and lose what little effect it seemed to have? How few
          of you are resolved to get at its soul, its juice, its life, its
          essence, and to drink in its meaning. Well, if you do not do that, I
          tell you again your reading is miserable reading, dead reading,
          unprofitable reading; it is not reading at all, the name would be
          misapplied. May the blessed Spirit give you repentance touching this
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now, secondly, and very briefly, let us notice that IN READING
          WE OUGHT To SEEK OUT THE SPIRITUAL TEACHING OF THE WORD. I think that
          is in my text, because our Lord says, "Have ye not read?" Then, again,
          "Have ye not read?" and then he says, "If ye had known what this
          meaneth" -- and the meaning is something very spiritual. The text he
          quoted was, "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice" -- a text out of
          the prophet Hosea. Now, the scribes and Pharisees were all for the
          letter -- the sacrifice, the killing of the bullock, and so on. They
          overlooked the spiritual meaning of the passage, "I will have mercy,
          and not sacrifice" -- namely, that God prefers that we should care for
          our fellow-creatures rather than that we should observe any ceremonial
          of his law, so as to cause hunger or thirst and thereby death, to any
          of the creatures that his hands have made. They ought to have passed
          beyond the outward into the spiritual, and all our readings ought to
          do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, that this should be the case when we read the historical
          passages. "Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungered,
          and they that were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and
          did eat the shew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither
          for them which were with him, but only for the priests?" This was a
          piece of history, and they ought so to have read it as to have found
          spiritual instruction in it. I have heard very stupid people say,
          "Well, I do not care to read the historical parts of Scripture."
          Beloved friends, you do not know what you are talking about when you
          say so. I say to you now by experience that I have sometimes found
          even a greater depth of spirituality in the histories than I have in
          the Psalms. You will say, "How is that?" I assert that when you reach
          the inner and spiritual meaning of a history you are often surprised
          at the wondrous clearness -- the realistic force -- with which the
          teaching comes home to your soul. Some of the most marvelous mysteries
          of revelation are better understood by being set before our eyes in
          the histories than they are by the verbal declaration of them. When we
          have the statement to explain the illustration, the illustration
          expands and vivifies the statement. For instance, when our Lord
          himself would explain to us what faith was, he sent us to the history
          of the brazen serpent; and who that has ever read the story of the
          brazen serpent has not felt that he has had a better idea of faith
          through the picture of the dying snake-bitten persons looking to the
          serpent of brass and living, than from any description which even Paul
          has given us, wondrously as he defines and describes. Never, I pray
          you, depreciate the historical portions of God's word, but when you
          cannot get good out of them, say, "That is my foolish head and my slow
          heart. o Lord, be pleased to clear my brain and cleanse my soul." When
          he answers that prayer you will feel that every portion of God's word
          is given by inspiration, and is and must be profitable to you. Cry,
          "open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
          law."
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the same thing is true with regard to all the ceremonial
          precepts, because the Saviour goes on to say, "Have ye not read in the
          law, how that on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple profane
          the Sabbath, and are blameless?" There is not asingle precept in the
          old law but has an inner sense and meaning; therefore do not turn away
          from Leviticus, or say, "I cannot read these chapters in the books of
          Exodus and Numbers. They are all about the tribes and their standards,
          the stations in the wilderness and the halts of the march, the
          tabernacle and furniture, or about golden knobs and bowls, and boards,
          and sockets, and precious stones, and blue and scarlet and fine
          linen." No, but look for the inner meaning. Make thorough search; for
          as in a king's treasure that which is the most closely locked up and
          the hardest to come at is the choicest jewel of the treasure, so is it
          with the Holy Scriptures. Did you ever go to the British Museum
          Library? There are many books of reference there which the reader is
          allowed to take down when he pleases. There are other books for which
          he must write a ticket, and he cannot get them without the ticket; but
          they have certain choice books which you will not see without a
          special order, and then there is an unlocking of doors, and an opening
          of cases, and there is a watcher with you while you make your
          inspection. You are scarcely allowed to put your eye on the
          manuscript, for fear you should blot a letter out by glancing at it;
          it is such a precious treasure; there is not another copy of it in all
          the world, and so you cannot get at it easily. Just so, there are
          choice and precious doctrines of God's word which are locked up in
          such cases as Leviticus or Solomon's Song, and you cannot get at them
          without a deal of unlocking of doors and the Holy Spirit himself must
          be with you, or else you will never come at the priceless treasure.
          The higher truths are as choicely hidden away as the precious regalia
          of princes; therefore search as well as read. Do not be satisfied with
          a ceremonial precept till you reach its spiritual meaning, for that is
          true reading. You have not read till you understand the spirit of the
          matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is just the same with the doctrinal statements of God's word. I
          have sorrowfully observed some persons who are very orthodox, and who
          can repeat their creed very glibly, and yet the principal use that
          they make of their orthodoxy is to sit and watch the preacher with the
          view o framing a charge against him. He has uttered a single sentence
          which is judged to be half a hair's breadth below the standard! "That
          man is not sound. He said some good things, but he is rotten at the
          core, I am certain. He used an expression which was not eighteen
          ounces to the pound." Sixteen ounces to the pound are not enough for
          these dear brethren of whom I speak, they must have something more and
          over and above the shekel of the sanctuary. Their knowledge is used as
          a microscope to magnify trifling differences. I hesitate not to say
          that I have come across persons who
        </p>
        <p>"Could a hair divide</p>
        <p>Betwixt the west and north-west side,"</p>
        <p>
          in matters of divinity, but who know nothing about the things of God
          in their real meaning. They have never drunk them into their souls,
          but only sucked them up into their mouths to spit them out on others.
          The doctrine of election is one thing, but to know that God has
          predestinated you, and to have the fruit of it m the good works to
          which you are ordained, is quite another thing. To talk about the love
          of Christ, to talk about the heaven that is provided for his people,
          and such things -- all this is very well; but this may be done without
          any personal acquaintance with them. Therefore, beloved, never be
          satisfied with a sound creed, but desire to have it graven on the
          tablets of your heart. The doctrines of grace are good, but the grace
          of the doctrines is better still. See that you have it, and be not
          content with the idea that you are instructed until you so understand
          the doctrine that you have felt its spiritual power.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes us feel that, in order to come to this, we shall need to
          feel Jesus present with us whenever we read the word. Mark that fifth
          verse, which I would now bring before you as part of my text which I
          have hitherto left out. "Have ye not read in the law, how on the
          Sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are
          blameless? But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than
          the temple." Ay, they thought much about the letter of the Word, but
          they did not know that he was there who is the Sabbath's Master --
          man's Lord and the Sabbath's Lord, and Lord of everything. oh, when
          you have got hold of a creed, or of an ordinance, or anything that is
          outward in the letter, pray the Lord to make you feel that there is
          something greater than the printed book, and something better than the
          mere shell of the creed. There is one person greater than they all,
          and to him we should cry that he may be ever with us. o living Christ,
          make this a living word to me. Thy word is life, but not without the
          Holy Spirit. I may know this book of thine from beginning to end, and
          repeat it all from Genesis to Revelation, and yet it may be a dead
          book, and I may be a dead soul. But, Lord, be present here; then will
          I look up from the book to the Lord; from the precept to him who
          fulfilled it; from the law to him who honoured it; from the
          threatening to him who has borne it for me, and from the promise to
          him in whom it is "Yea and amen." Ah, then we shall read the book so
          differently. He is here with me in this chamber of mine: I must not
          trifle. He leans over me, he puts his finger along the lines, I can
          see his pierced hand: I will read it as in his presence. I will read
          it, knowing that he is the substance of it, -- that he is the proof of
          this book as well as the writer of it; the sum of this Scripture as
          well as the author of it. That is the way for true students to become
          wise! You will get at the soul of Scripture when you can keep Jesus
          with you while you are reading. Did you never hear a sermon as to
          which you felt that if Jesus had come into that pulpit while the man
          was making his oration, he would have said, "Go down, go down; what
          business have you here? I sent you to preach about me, and you preach
          about a dozen other things. Go home and learn of me, and then come and
          talk." That sermon which does not lead to Christ, or of which Jesus
          Christ is not the top and the bottom, is a sort of sermon that will
          make the devils in hell to laugh, but might make the angel of God to
          weep, if they were capable of such emotion. You remember the story I
          told you of the Welshman who heard a young man preach a very fine
          sermon -- a grand sermon, a highfaluting, spread-eagle sermon; and
          when he had done, he asked the Welshman what he thought of it. The man
          replied that he did not think anything of it. "And why not?" "Because
          there was no Jesus Christ in it." "Well," said he, "but my text did
          not seem to run that way." "Never mind," said the Welshman, "your
          sermon ought to run that way." "I do not see that, however," said the
          young man. "No," said the other, "you do not see how to preach yet.
          This is the way to preach. From every little village in England -- it
          does not matter where it is -- there is sure to be a road to London.
          Though there may not be a road to certain other places, there is
          certain to be a road to London. Now, from every text in the Bible
          there is a road to Jesus Christ, and the way to preach is just to say,
          How can I get from this text to Jesus Christ?' and then go preaching
          all the way along it." "Well, but," said the young man, "suppose I
          find a text that has not got a road to Jesus Christ." "I have preached
          for forty years," said the old man, "and I have never found such a
          Scripture, but if I ever do find one I will go over hedge and ditch
          but what I will get to him, for I will never finish without bringing
          in my Master." Perhaps you will think that I have gone a little over
          hedge and ditch to-night, but I am persuaded that I have not for the
          sixth verse comes in here, and brings our Lord in most sweetly,
          setting him in the very forefront of you Bible readers, so that you
          must not think of reading without feeling that he is there who is Lord
          and Master of everything that you are reading, and who shall make
          these things precious to you if you realize him in them. If you do not
          find Jesus in the Scriptures they will be of small service to you, for
          what did our Lord himself say? "Ye search the Scriptures, for in them
          ye think ye have eternal life, but ye will not come unto me that ye
          might have life"; and therefore your searching comes to nothing; you
          find no life, and remain dead in your sins. May it not be so with us?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, SUCH A READING OF SCRIPTURE, as implies the understanding
          of and the entrance into its spiritual meaning, and the discovery of
          the divine Person who is the spiritual meaning, IS PROFITABLE, for
          here our Lord says, "If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have
          mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
          It will save us from making a great many mistakes if we get to
          understand the word of God, and among other good things we shall not
          condemn the guiltless.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no time to enlarge upon these benefits, but I will just say,
          putting all together, that the diligent reading of the word of God
          with the strong resolve to get at its meaning often begets spiritual
          life. We are begotten by the word of God: it is the instrumental means
          of regeneration. Therefore love your Bibles. Keep close to your
          Bibles. You seeking sinners, you who are seeking the Lord, your first
          business is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ; but while you are yet
          in darkness and in gloom, oh love your Bibles and search them! Take
          them to bed with you, and when you wake up in the morning, if it is
          too early to go downstairs and disturb the house, get half-an-hour of
          reading upstairs. Say, "Lord, guide me to that text which shall bless
          me. Help me to understand how I, a poor sinner, can be reconciled to
          thee." I recollect how, when I was seeking the Lord, I went to my
          Bible and to Baxter's "Call to the Unconverted," and to Alleine's
          "Alarm," and Doddridge's "Rise and Progress," for I said in myself, "I
          am afraid that I shall be lost but I will know the reason why. I am
          afraid I never shall find Christ but it shall not be for want of
          looking for him." That fear used to haunt me, but I said, "I will find
          him if he is to be found. I will read. I will think." There was never
          a soul that did sincerely seek for Jesus in the word but by-and-by he
          stumbled on the precious truth that Christ was near at hand and did
          not want any looking for; that he was really there, only they, poor
          blind creatures, were in such a maze that they could not just then see
          him. Oh, cling you to Scripture. Scripture is not Christ, but it is
          the silken clue which will lead you to him. Follow its leadings
          faithfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have received regeneration and a new life, keep on reading,
          because it will comfort you. You will see more of what the Lord has
          done for you. You will learn that you are redeemed, adopted, saved,
          sanctified. Half the errors in the world spring from people not
          reading their Bibles. Would anybody think that the Lord would leave
          any one of his dear children to perish, if he read such a text as
          this, -- "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never
          perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand"? When I read
          that, I am sure of the final perseverance of the saints. Read, then,
          the word and it will be much for your comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be for your nourishment, too. It is your food as well as your
          life. Search it and you will grow strong in the Lord and in the power
          of his might.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be for your guidance also. I am sure those go rightest who
          keep closest to the book. Oftentimes when you do not know what to do,
          you will see a text leaping up out of the book, and saying, "Follow
          me." I have seen a promise sometimes blaze out before my eyes, just as
          when an illuminated device flames forth upon a public building. One
          touch of flame and a sentence or a design flashes out in gas. I have
          seen a text of Scripture flame forth in that way to my soul; I have
          known that it was God's word to me, and I have gone on my way
          rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, oh, you will get a thousand helps out of that wondrous book if
          you do but read it; for, understanding the words more, you will prize
          it more, and, as you get older, the book will grow with your growth,
          and turn out to be a greybeard's manual of devotion just as it was
          aforetime a child's sweet story book. Yes, it will always be a new
          book -- just as new a Bible as it was printed yesterday, and nobody
          had ever seen a word of it till now; and yet it will be a deal more
          precious for all the memories which cluster round it. As we turn over
          its pages how sweetly do we recollect passages in our history which
          will never be forgotten to all eternity, but will stand for ever
          intertwined with gracious promises. Beloved, the Lord teach us to read
          his book of life which he has opened before us here below, so that we
          may read our titles clear in that other book of love which we have not
          seen as yet, but which will be opened at the last great day. The Lord
          be with you, and bless you.
