        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.80)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 18, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"He only is my rock and my salvation." -- Psalm 92:2.</p>
        <p>
          HOW noble a title. So sublime, suggestive, and overpowering. "MY
          ROCK." It is a figure so divine, that to God alone shall it ever be
          applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look on yon rocks and wonder at their antiquity, for from their
          summits a thousand ages look down upon us. When this gigantic city was
          as yet unfounded they were grey with age; when our humanity had not
          yet breathed the air, tis said that these were ancient things; they
          are the children of departed ages. With awe we look upon these aged
          rocks, for they are among nature's first-born. You discover, embedded
          in their bowels, the remnants of unknown worlds, of which, the wise
          may guess, but which, nevertheless, they must fail to know, unless God
          himself should teach them what hath been before them. You regard the
          rock with reverence, for you remember what stories it might tell, if
          it had a voice; of how through igneous and aqueous agency, it has been
          tortured into the shape it now assumes. Even so is our God
          pre-eminently ancient. His head and his hair are white like wool, as
          white as snow, for he is "the ancient of days," and we are always
          taught in Scripture to remember, that he is "without beginning of
          years." Long ere creation was begotten, "from everlasting to
          everlasting," he was God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My rock!" What a history the rock might give you of the storms to
          which it has been exposed; of the tempests which have raged in the
          ocean at its base, and of the thunders which have disturbed the skies
          above its head; while it, itself, has stood unscathed by tempests, and
          unmoved by the buffettings of storms. So with our God. How firm hath
          he stood -- how steadfast hath he been -- though the nations have
          reviled him, and "the kings of the earth have taken counsel together!"
          By merely standing still he hath broken the ranks of the enemy,
          without even stretching forth his hand! With motionless grandeur like
          a rock he hath broken the waves, and scattered the armies of his
          enemies, driving them back in confusion. Look at the rock again: see
          how firm and unmoved it stands! It doth not stray from place to place,
          but it abideth fast for evermore. Other things have changed, islands
          have been drowned beneath the sea, and continents have been shaken;
          but see, the rock stands as steadfast as if it were the very
          foundation of the whole world, and could not move till the wreck of
          creation, or the loosening of the bands of nature. So with God: how
          faithful he is in his promises! how unalterable in his decrees! how
          unswerving! how unchanging!
        </p>
        <p>
          The rock is immutable, nought hath been worn from it. Yon old granite
          peak hath gleamed in the sun, or worn the white veil of winter snow --
          it hath sometimes worshipped God with bare uncovered head, and at
          other times the clouds furnished it with veiling wings, that like a
          cherub, it might adore its Maker, but yet itself hath stood unchanged.
          The frosts of winter have not destroyed it, nor have the heats of
          summer melted it. It is the same with God. Lo, he is my rock; he is
          the same, and his kingdom shall have no end. Unchangeable he is in his
          being, firm in his own sufficiency; he keeps himself immutably the
          same; and "therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed." The ten
          thousand uses of the rock, moreover, are full of ideas as to what God
          is. You see the fortress standing on a high rock, up which the clouds
          themselves can scarcely climb, and up whose precipices the assault
          cannot be carried, and the armed cannot travel, for the besieged laugh
          at them from their eminence. So is our God a sure defence; and we
          shall not be moved if he hath "set our feet upon a rock, and
          established our goings." Many a giant rock is a source of admiration
          from its elevation; for on the summit we can see the world outspread
          below, like some small map; we mark the river or broadly spreading
          stream, as if it were a vein of silver inlaid in emerald. We discover
          the nations beneath our feet, "like drops in a bucket," and the
          islands are "very little things" in the distance, while the sea itself
          seems but a basin of water, held in the hand of a mighty giant. The
          mighty God is such a rock; we stand on him, and look down on the
          world, counting it to be a mean thing. We have climbed to Pisgah's
          top, from the summit of which we can see across this world of storms
          and troubles to the bright land of spirits -- that world unknown to
          ear or eye, but which God hath revealed to us by the Holy Ghost. This
          mighty rock is our refuge, and it is our high observatory, from which
          we see the unseen, and have the evidence of things which as yet, we
          have not enjoyed. I need not, however, stop to tell you all about a
          rock, we might preach for a week upon it; but we give you that for
          your meditation during the week. "He is my rock." How glorious a
          thought! How safe am I, and how secure: and how may I rejoice in the
          fact, that when I wade through Jordan's stream he will be my rock! I
          shall not walk upon a slippery foundation, but I shall tread on him
          who cannot betray my feet; and I may sing, when I am dying, "He is my
          rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him."
        </p>
        <p>
          We now leave the thought of the rock, and proceed to the subject of
          our discourse, which is this: that God alone is the salvation of his
          people.
        </p>
        <p>"He ONLY is my rock and my salvation."</p>
        <p>
          We shall notice, first, the great doctrine, that God only is our
          salvation; secondly, the great experience, to know and to learn that
          "he only is my rock and my salvation"; and, thirdly, the great duty,
          which you may guess at, which is, to give all the glory and all the
          honor, and place all our faith on him who "only is our rock and our
          salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first thing is, THE GREAT DOCTRINE -- that God "only is our
          rock and our salvation." If any one should ask us what we would choose
          for our motto, as preachers of the gospel, we think we should reply,
          "God only is our salvation." The late lamented Mr. Denham has put at
          the foot of his portrait, a most admirable text, "Salvation is of the
          Lord&gt;' Now, that is just an epitome of Calvinism; it is the sum and
          the substance of it. If any one should ask you what you mean by a
          Calvinist, you may reply, "He is one who says, salvation is of the
          Lord." I cannot find in Scripture any other doctrine than this. It is
          the essence of the Bible. "He only is my rock and my salvation." Tell
          me anything that departs from this and it will be a heresy; tell me a
          heresy, and I shall find its essence here, that it has departed from
          this great, this fundamental, this rocky truth, "God is my rock and my
          salvation." What is the heresy of Rome, but the addition of something
          to the perfect merits of Jesus Christ -- the bringing in of the works
          of the flesh, to assist in our justification? and what is that heresy
          of Arminianism but the secret addition of something to the complete
          work of the Redeemer? You will find that every heresy, if rough to the
          touchstone, will discover itself here, it departs from this, "He only
          is my rock and my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now explain this doctrine fully. By the term "salvation" here,
          I understand not simply regeneration and conversion, but something
          more. I do not reckon that to be salvation which regenerates me, and
          then puts me in such a position that I may fall out of the covenant
          and be lost; I cannot call that a bridge which only goes half-way over
          the stream; I cannot call that salvation, which does not carry me all
          the way to heaven, wash me perfectly clean, and put me among the
          glorified who sing constant hosannahs around the throne. By salvation,
          then if I may divide it into parts, I understand deliverance,
          preservation continually through life, sustentation, and the gathering
          up of the whole in the perfecting of the saints in the person of Jesus
          Christ at last.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. By salvation, I understand deliverance from the house of bondage,
          wherein by nature I am born, and being brought out into the liberty
          wherewith Christ makes us free, together with a putting "on a rock,
          and establishing my goings." This I understand to be wholly of God.
          And I think I am right in that conclusion, because I find in Scripture
          that man is dead; and how can a dead man assist in his own
          resurrection? I find that man is utterly depraved, and hates the
          divine change. How can a man, then, work that change which he himself
          hates? I find man to be ignorant of what it is to be born again, and
          like Nicodemus, asking the foolish question, "How can a man enter
          again into his mother's womb, and be born?" I cannot conceive that a
          man can do that which he does not understand: and if he does not know
          what it is to be born again, he cannot make himself to be born again.
          No. I believe man to be utterly powerless in the first work of his
          salvation. He cannot break his chains, for they be not chains of iron,
          but chains of his own flesh and blood; he must first break his own
          heart before he can break the fetters that bind him. And how should
          man break his own heart? What hammer is that which I can use upon my
          own soul to break it, or what fire can I kindle which can dissolve it?
          Nay, deliverance is of God alone. The doctrine is affirmed continually
          to Scripture; and he who doth not believe it doth not receive affirmed
          continually in Scripture; and he who doth not believe it doth not
          receive God's truth. Deliverance is of God alone; "Salvation is of the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And if we are delivered and made alive in Christ, still
          preservation is of the Lord alone. If I am prayerful, God makes me
          prayerful: if I have graces, God gives me graces; if I have fruits,
          God gives me fruits; if I hold on in a consistent life, God holds me
          on in a consistent life. I do nothing whatever towards my own
          preservation, except what God himself first does in me. Whatever I
          have, all my goodness is of the Lord alone. Wherein I sin, that is my
          own; but wherein I act rightly, that is of God, wholly and completely.
          If I have repulsed an enemy, his strength nerved my arm. Did I strike
          a foeman to the ground? His strength sharpened my sword and gave me
          courage to strike the blow. Do I preach his word? It is not I, but
          grace that is in me? Do I live to God a holy life? It is not I, but
          Christ that liveth in me? Am I sanctified? I did not sanctify myself;
          God's Holy Spirit sanctifies me. Am I weaned from the world? I am
          weaned by God's chastisements. Do I grow in knowledge? The great
          Instructor teaches me. I find in God all I want; but I find in myself
          nothing. "He only is my rock and my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And again: sustentation also is absolutely requisite. We need
          sustentation in providence for our bodies, and sustentation in grace
          for our souls. Providential mercies are wholly from the Lord. It is
          true that rain falls from heaven, and waters the earth, and "maketh it
          bring forth and bud, that there may be seed, for the sower, and bread
          for the eater;" but out of whose hand cometh the rain, and from whose
          fingers do the dew drops distil? It is true, the sun shines, and makes
          the plants grow, and bud, and bring forth the blossom, and his heat
          ripens the fruit upon the tree; but who gives the sun his light, and
          who scatters the genial heat from him? It is true, I work and toil;
          this brow sweats; these hands are weary; I cast myself upon my bed,
          and there I rest, but I do not "sacrifice to mine own drag," nor do I
          ascribe my preservation to my own might. Who makes these sinews
          strong? who makes these lungs like iron, and who makes these nerves of
          steel? "God only is the rock of my salvation." He only is the
          salvation of my body and the salvation of my soul. Do I feed on the
          word? That word would be no food for me unless the Lord made it food
          for my soul, and helped me to feed upon it. Do I live on the manna
          which comes down from heaven? What is that manna, but Jesus Christ
          himself incarnate, whose body and whose blood I eat and drink. Am I
          continually receiving fresh increase of might? Where do I gather my
          might? My salvation is of him: without him I can do nothing. As a
          branch cannot bring forth fruit except it abide in the vine, no more
          can I except I abide in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Then if we gather the three thoughts in one. The perfection we
          shall soon have, when we shall stand yonder, near God's throne, will
          be wholly of the Lord. That bright crown which shall sparkle on our
          brow, like a constellation of brilliant stars, shall have been
          fashioned only by our God. I go to a land, but it is a land which the
          plough of earth hath never upturned, though it be greener than earth's
          best pastures, and though it be richer than all her harvests ever saw.
          I go to a building of more gorgeous architecture than man hath
          builded; it is not of mortal architecture; it is "a house not made
          with hands, eternal in the heavens". All I shall know in heaven, will
          be given by the Lord; and I shall say, when at last I appear before
          him, --
        </p>
        <p>"Grace all the work shall crown</p>
        <p>Through everlasting days;</p>
        <p>It lays in heaven the topmost stone,</p>
        <p>And well deserves the praise."</p>
        <p>
          II. And now, beloved, we come to THE GREAT EXPERIENCE. The greatest of
          all experience, I take it, is to know that "he only is our rock and
          our salvation." We have been insisting upon a doctrine; but doctrine
          is nothing unless proved in our experience. Most of God's doctrines
          are only to be learned by practice -- by taking them out into the
          world, and letting them bear the wear and tear of life. If I ask any
          Christian in this place whether this doctrine is true, if he has had
          any deep experience, he will reply, "True! ay, that it is; not one
          word in God's Bible is more true than that, for indeed salvation is of
          God alone." "He only is my rock and my salvation." But, beloved, it is
          very hard to have such an experimental knowledge of the doctrine that
          we never depart from it. It is very hard to believe that "salvation is
          of the Lord." There are times when we put our confidence in something
          else but God, and sin by linking hand-in-hand with God -- something
          besides him. Let me now dwell a little upon the experience which will
          bring us to know that salvation is of God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The true Christian will confess that salvation is of God alone
          effectively; that is, that "he works in him to will and to do of his
          own pleasure." Looking back on my past life, I can see that the
          dawning of it all was of God; of God effectively. I took no torch with
          which to light the sun; but the sun did light me. I did not commence
          my spiritual life -- no, I rather kicked and struggled against the
          things of the Spirit: when he drew me, for a time, I did not run after
          him: there was a natural hatred in my soul of everything holy and
          good. Wooings were lost upon me -- warnings were cast to the wind --
          thunders were despised; and as for the whispers of his love, they were
          rejected as being less than nothing and vanity. But, sure I am, I can
          say now, speaking on behalf of myself, and of all who know the Lord,
          "He only is my salvation, and your salvation too." It was he who
          turned your heart, and brought you down on your knees. You can say in
          very deed, then --
        </p>
        <p>"Grace taught my soul to pray,</p>
        <p>Grace made my eyes o'erflow."</p>
        <p>And coming to this moment, you can say, --</p>
        <p>"Tis grace has kept me to this day,</p>
        <p>And will not let me go."</p>
        <p>
          I remember, when I was coming to the Lord, I thought I was doing it
          all myself, and though I sought the Lord earnestly, I had no idea the
          Lord was seeking me. I do not think the young convert is at first
          aware of him. One day when I was sitting in the house of God, I was
          not thinking much about the man's sermon, for I did not believe it.
          The thought struck me, "How did you come to be a Christian?" I sought
          the Lord. "But how did you come to seek the Lord?" The thought flashed
          across my mind in a moment -- I should not have sought him unless
          there had been some previous influence in my mind to make me seek him.
          I am sure you will not be many weeks a Christian, certainly not many
          months, before you will say, "I ascribe my change wholly to God." I
          desire to make this my constant confession. I know there are some who
          preach one gospel in the morning, and another at night -- who preach a
          good sound gospel in the morning, because they are preaching to
          saints, but preach falsehood in the evening, because they are
          preaching to sinners. But there is no necessity to preach truth at one
          time and falsehood at another. "The word of the Lord is perfect,
          converting the soul." There no need to put anything else in it, in
          order to bring sinners to the Saviour. But, my brothers, you must
          confess that "Salvation is of the Lord." When you turn back to the
          past, you must say, "My Lord, whatever I have, thou gavest it me. Have
          I the wings of faith? I was a wingless creature once. Have I the eyes
          of faith? I was a blind creature once; I was dead, till thou madest me
          alive; blind, till thou openedst my eyes; my heart was a loathsome
          dunghill, but thou puttest pearls there, if pearls there be, for
          pearls are not the produce of dunghills; thou hast given me all I
          have;" And so, if you look at the present, if you experience be that
          of a child of God, you will trace all to him; not only all you have
          had in the past, but all you have now. Here you are, sitting in your
          pew this morning; now, I just want you to review where you stand.
          Beloved, do you think you would be where you are now if it were not
          for divine grace? Only think what a strong temptation you had
          yesterday, they did "consult to cast you down from your excellency;"
          perhaps you were served like I am sometimes. The devil sometimes seems
          to drag me right to the edge of a precipice of sin by a kind of
          enchantment, making me forget the danger by the sweetness which
          surrounds it; and just when he would push me down, I see the yawning
          gulph beneath me, and some strong hang put out, and I hear a voice
          saying, "I will preserve him from going down into the pit; I have
          found a ransom." Do you not feel, that ere this sun goes down you will
          be damned, if grace does not keep you? Have you anything good in your
          heart that grace did not give you? If I thought I had a grace that did
          not come from God, I would trample it beneath my feet, as not being a
          godly virtue; I would guess it to be but a counterfeit, for it could
          not be right if it did not come from the mint of glory. It may look
          ever so much like the right thing: but it is certainly bad unless it
          came from God. Christian! canst thou say, of all things past and
          present, "He only is my rock and my salvation?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And now look forward to the future. Man! think how many enemies thou
          hast; how many rivers thou hast to cross, how many mountains to climb,
          how many dragons to fight, how many lions' teeth to escape, how many
          fires to pass through, how many floods to wade. What thinkest thou,
          man? Can thy salvation be of anything except of God! Oh! if I had not
          that everlasting arm to lean upon, I would cry, "Death! hurl me
          anywhere; anywhere out of the world." If I had not that one hope, that
          one trust, bury me ten thousand fathoms deep beneath creation, where
          my being might be forgotten! Oh! put me far away, for I am miserable
          if I have not God to help me all my journey through. Are you strong
          enough to fight with one of your enemies without your God? I trow not.
          A little silly maid may cast a Peter down, and cast you down too, if
          God do not keep you. I beseech you, remember this; I hope you know it
          by experience in the past; but try to remember it in the future,
          wherever you go, "Salvation is of the Lord." Do not get looking at
          your heart, do not get examining to see whether you have anything to
          recommend you, but remember, "Salvation is of the Lord." "He only is
          my rock and my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Effectively, it all comes of God; and I am sure we must add,
          meritoriously. We have experienced that salvation is wholly of him.
          What merits have I? If I were to scrape together all I ever had, and
          then come to you and beg all you have got, I should not collect the
          value of a farthing among you all. We have heard of some Catholic, who
          said that there was a balance struck in his favour between his good
          works and his bad ones, and therefore he went to heaven. But there is
          nothing of the sort here; I have seen many people, many kinds of
          Christians, and many odd Christians, but I never yet met with one who
          said he had any merits of his own when he came to close quarters. We
          have heard of perfect men, and we have heard of men perfectly foolish,
          and we have thought the characters perfectly alike. Have we any merits
          of our own? I am sure we have not, if we have been taught of God. Once
          we thought we had; but there came a man called Conviction into our
          house one night, and took away our gloryings. Ah! we are vile still. I
          don't know whether Cowper said quite right, when he said, --
        </p>
        <p>"Since the dear hour that brought me to thy foot,</p>
        <p>And cut up all my follies by the root,</p>
        <p>I never trusted in an arm but thine --</p>
        <p>Nor hoped but in thy righteousness divine!"</p>
        <p>
          I think he made a mistake, for most Christians get trusting in self at
          times, but we are forced to own that "salvation is of the Lord," if we
          consider it meritoriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends, have you experienced this in your own hearts? Can you
          say "amen" to that, as it goes round? Can you say, "I know that God is
          my helper?" I dare say you can, most of you; but you will not say it
          so well as you will by-and-bye, if God teach you. We believe it, when
          we commence the Christian life; we know it afterwards; and the longer
          we live, the more we find it to be the truth -- "Cursed is he that
          trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm, but blessed is he who
          trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." In fact, the crown
          of Christian experience is to be delivered from all trust in self or
          man, and to be brought to rely wholly and simply on Jesus Christ. I
          say, Christian, thy highest and noblest experience is not to be
          groaning about thy corruption, is not to be crying about thy
          wanderings, but is to say --
        </p>
        <p>"With all my sin, and care, and woe,</p>
        <p>His Spirit will not let me go."</p>
        <p>
          "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief." I like what Luther says:
          "I would run into Christ's arms if he had a drawn sword in his hands."
          Trust is called venturesome believing; but as an old divine says,
          there is no such thing as venturesome believing; we cannot venture on
          Christ; it is no venture at all; there is no hap-hazard in the least
          degree. It is a holy and heavenly experience, when we can go to
          Christ, amid the storm, and say, "Oh! Jesus, I believe I am covered by
          thy blood;" when we can feel ourselves to be all over rages, and yet
          can say, "Lord, I believe that through Christ Jesus, ragged though I
          am, I am fully absolved." A saint's faith is little faith when he
          believes as a saint; but a sinner's faith is true faith when he
          believes as a sinner. The faith, not of a sinless being, but the faith
          of a sinful creature -- that is the faith which delights God. Go,
          then, Christian: ask that this may be thy experience, to learn each
          day, "He only is my rock and my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the third place, we speak of THE GREAT DUTY. We have
          had the great experience; now we must have the great duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great duty is -- if God only be our rock, and we know it, are we
          not bound to put all our trust in God, to give all our love to God? If
          God be all I have, sure, all I have shall be God's. If God alone is my
          hope, sure, I will put all my hope upon God; if the love of God is
          alone that which saves, sure, he shall have my love alone. Come, let
          me talk to thee, Christian, for a little while, I want to warn thee
          not to have two Gods, two Christs, two friends, two husbands, two
          great Fathers; not to have two fountains, two rivers, two suns, or two
          heavens, but to have only one. I want to bid thee now, as God hath put
          all salvation in himself, to bring all thyself unto God. Come, let me
          talk to thee!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, Christian, never join anything with Christ.
          Wouldest thou stitch thy old rags into the new garment he giveth?
          Wouldest thou put new wine into old bottles? Wouldst thou put Christ
          and self together? Thou mightest as well yoke an elephant and an
          emmet; they could never plough together. What! wouldst thou put an
          archangel in the same harness with a worm, and hope that they would
          drag thee through the sky! How inconsistent! how foolish! What!
          thyself and Christ? Sure, Christ would smile; nay, Christ would weep,
          to think of such a thing! Christ and man together? CHRIST AND CO? No,
          it never shall be; he will have nothing of the sort; he must be all.
          Note how inconsistent it would be to put anything else with him; and
          note, again, how wrong it would be. Christ will never bear to have
          anything else places with him. He calls them adulterers and
          fornicators that love anything else but him; he will have thy whole
          heart to trust in him, thy whole soul to love him, and thy whole life
          to honor him. He will not come into thy house, till thou puttest all
          the keys at his girdle; he will not allow thee to give him all the
          keys but one; he will not come till thou givest him garret, parlour,
          drawing-room, and cellar too. He will make thee sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Yet if I might make some reserve,</p>
        <p>And duty did not call,</p>
        <p>I love my God with zeal so great,</p>
        <p>That I should give him all."</p>
        <p>Mark thee, Christian; it is a sin to keep anything from God.</p>
        <p>
          Again, Christ is very grieved if you do it. Assuredly you do not
          desire to grieve him who shed his blood for you. Surely there is not
          one child of God here who would like to vex his blessed elder Brother.
          There cannot be one soul redeemed by blood who would like to see those
          sweet blessed eyes of our best beloved bedewed with tears. I know ye
          will not grieve your Lord; will ye? But I tell you ye will vex his
          noble spirit if ye love aught but him; for he is so fond of you, that
          he is jealous of your love. It is said, concerning his Father, that he
          is "a jealous God," and he is a jealous Christ you have to deal with;
          therefore, put not your trust in chariots, stay not yourselves in
          horses, but say, "He only is my rock and my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          I beg thee, mark also, one reason why thou shouldest not look at
          anything else; and that is, if thou lookest at anything else thou
          canst not see Christ so well. "Oh!" thou sayest, "I can see Christ in
          his mercies;" but thou canst not see him so well there, as if you
          viewed his person. No man can look at two objects at the same time,
          and see both distinctly. You may afford a wink for the world, and a
          wink for Christ; but you cannot give Christ a whole look and a whole
          eye, and the world half an eye too. I beseech thee, Christian, do not
          try it. If thou lookest on the world, it will be a speck in thine eye;
          if thou trustest in anything but him, betwixt two stools thou wilt
          come to the ground, and a fearful fall wilt thou have. Therefore,
          Christian, look thou only on him. "He only is my rock and my
          salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark thee, again, Christian, I would bid thee never put anything else
          with Christ; for as sure as ever thou dost, thou wilt have the whip
          for it. There never was a child of God who harboured one of the Lord's
          traitors in his heart, but he always had a charge laid against him.
          God has sent out a search warrant against all of us; and do you know
          what he has told his officers to search for? He has told them to
          search for all our lovers, all our treasures, and all our helpers. God
          cares less about our sins as sins, than he does about our sins, or
          even our virtues, as usurpers of his throne. I tell thee, there is
          nothing in the world thou settest thy heart upon that shall not be
          hung upon a gallows higher than Haman's. If thou lovest anything but
          Christ, he will make it to do penance; if thou lovest thy house better
          than Christ, he will make it a prison to thee; if thou lovest thy
          child better than Christ, he will make it an adder in thy breast to
          sting thee; if thou lovest thy daily provisions better than Christ, he
          will make thy drink bitter and thy food like gravel stones in thy
          mouth, till thou comest to live wholly on him. There is nothing which
          thou hast, which he cannot turn into a rod, if thou lovest it better
          than him; and rest assured he will do so, if thou makest it anything
          to rob thy Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, mark thee, once again, if thou lookest at anything save God, thou
          wilt soon go into sin. If the mariner will steer by the pole-star he
          shall go to the north; but if he steers sometimes by the pole-star and
          sometimes by another constellation, he knoweth not where he shall go.
          If thou dost not keep thine eye wholly on Christ, thou wilt soon be
          wrong. If thou ever dost give up the secret of thy strength, namely,
          thy trust I Christ; if thou ever dalliest with the Delilah of the
          world, and lovest thyself more than Christ, the Philistines will be
          upon thee, and shear thy locks, and take thee out to grind at the
          mill, till thy God give thee deliverance by means of thy hair growing
          once more, and bringing thee to trust wholly in the Saviour. Keep
          thine eye, then, fixed on Jesus; for if thou dost turn away from him,
          how ill wilt thou fare! I bid thee, Christian, beware of thy graces;
          beware of thy virtues; beware of thy experience; beware of thy
          prayers; beware of thy hope; beware of thy humility. There is not one
          of thy graces which may not damn thee, if they are left alone to
          themselves. Old Brooks saith, when a woman hath a husband, and that
          husband giveth unto her some choice rings, she putteth them on her
          fingers; and if she should be so foolish as to love the rings better
          than her husband; if she should care only for the jewels, and forget
          him who gave them; how angry would the husband be, and how foolish she
          would be herself! Christian! I warn thee, beware of thy graces; for
          they may prove more dangerous to thee than thy sins. I warn thee of
          everything in this world; for everything has this tendency, especially
          a high estate. If we have a comfortable maintenance, we are most
          likely not to look so much to God. Ah! Christian, with an independent
          fortune, take care of thy money; beware of thy gold and silver; it
          will curse thee if it comes between thee and thy God. Always keep
          thine eye to the cloud, and not to the rain, -- to the river, and not
          to the ship that floateth on its bosom. Look thee not to the sunbeam,
          but to the sun; trace thy mercies to God, and say perpetually, "He
          only is my rock and my salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I bid thee once more to keep thine eye wholly on God, and on
          nothing in thyself, because what art thou now, and what wast thou
          ever, but a poor damned sinner if thou wert out of Christ! I had been
          preaching the other day all the former part of the sermon, as a
          minister; presently I thought I was a poor sinner, and then, how
          differently I began to speak! The best sermons I ever preach are those
          I preach, not in my ministerial capacity, but as a poor sinner
          preaching to sinners. I find there is nothing like a minister
          recollecting that he is nothing but a poor sinner, after all. It is
          said of the peacock, that, although he has fine feathers, he is
          ashamed of his black feet: I am sure that we ought to be ashamed of
          ours. However gay our feathers may appear at times, we ought to think
          of what we should be if grace did not help us. Oh! Christian, keep
          thine eye on Christ, for out of him thou art no better than the damned
          in hell; there is not a demon in the pit but might put thee to the
          blush, if thou art out of Christ. Oh that thou wouldest be humble!
          Recollect what an evil heart thou hast within thee, even when grace is
          there. Thou hast grace -- God loves thee; but recollect, thou hast a
          foul cancer in thy heart still. God has removed much of thy sin, but
          still the corruption remains. We feel that though the old man is
          somewhat choked, and the fire somewhat damped by the sweet waters of
          the Holy Spirit's influence, yet it would blaze up worse than before,
          if God did not keep it under. Let us not glory in ourselves, then. The
          slave need not be proud of his descent: he has the brand-mark upon his
          hand. Out upon pride! Away with it! Let us rest wholly and solely upon
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, just one word to the ungodly -- you who do not know Christ. You
          have heard what I have told you, that salvation is of Christ alone. Is
          not that a good doctrine for you? For you have not got anything, have
          you? You are a poor, lost, ruined sinner. Hear this, then, sinner:
          thou hast nothing, and thou dost not want anything, for Christ has
          all. "Oh!" sayest thou, "I am a bond slave." Ah! but he has got the
          redemption. "Nay," sayest thou, "I am a black sinner." Yes, but he has
          got the bath that can wash thee white. Sayest thou, "I am leprous?"
          Yes, but the good Physician can take thy leprosy away. Sayest thou, "I
          am condemned?" Ay, but he has got the acquittal warrant signed and
          sealed, if thou dost believe in him. Sayest thou, "But I am dead?" Ay,
          but Christ has life, and he can give thee life. Thou wantest nothing
          of thine own -- nothing to rely on but Christ; and if there be a man,
          woman or child here, who is prepared to say solemnly after me, with
          his or her heart, "I take Christ to be my Saviour, with no powers and
          no merits of my own to trust in; I see my sins, but I see that Christ
          is higher than my sins; I see my guilt, but I believe that Christ is
          mightier than my guilt;" -- I say, if any one of you can say that, you
          may go away and rejoice, for you are heirs of the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must tell you a singular story, which was related at our church
          meeting, because there may be some very poor people here who may
          understand the way of salvation by it. One of the friends had been to
          see a person who was about to join the church; and he said to him,
          "Can you tell me what you would say to a poor sinner who came to ask
          you the way of salvation?" "well," said he, "I do not know -- I think
          I can hardly tell you; but it so happened that a case of this sort did
          occur yesterday. A poor woman came into my shop, and I told her the
          way; but it was in such a homely manner that I don't like to tell
          you." "Oh, yes, tell me; I should like to hear it," Well, she is a
          poor woman, who is always pawning her things, and by-and-bye she
          redeems them again. I did not know how to tell her better than this. I
          said to her: -- 'Look here; your soul is in pawn to the devil; Christ
          has paid the redemption money; you take faith for your ticket, and so
          you will get your soul out of pawn.'" Now, that was the most simple,
          but the most excellent way of imparting a knowledge of salvation to
          this woman. It is true our souls were pawned to Almighty vengeance; we
          were poor, and could not pay the redemption money; but Christ came and
          paid it all, and faith is the ticket which we use to get our souls out
          of pawn. We need not take a single penny with us; we have only to say,
          "Here, Lord, I believe in Jesus Christ. I have brought no money to pay
          for my soul, for there is the ticket; the money has been paid long
          ago. This is written in thy word: The blood of Christ cleanseth from
          all sin.'" If thou takest that ticket, thou wilt get thy soul out of
          pawn; and thou wilt say, "I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven, I'm a miracle of
          grace." May God bless you, my friends, for Christ's sake.<br />
