          1. If, again, they maintain that the twelve apostles were a type only
          of that group of twelve Æons which Anthropos in conjunction with
          Ecclesia produced, then let them produce ten other apostles as a type
          of those ten remaining Æons, who, as they declare, were produced by
          Logos and Zoe. For it is unreasonable to suppose that the junior, and
          for that reason inferior Æons, were set forth by the Saviour through
          the election of the apostles, while their seniors, and on this account
          their superiors, were not thus foreshown; since the Saviour (if, that
          is to say, He chose the apostles with this view, that by means of them
          He might show forth the Æons who are in the Pleroma) might have chosen
          other ten apostles also, and likewise other eight before these, that
          thus He might set forth the original and primary Ogdoad. He could not,
          in regard to the second [Duo] Decad, show forth [any emblem of it]
          through the number of the apostles being [already] constituted a type.
          For [He made choice of no such other number of disciples; but] after
          the twelve apostles, our Lord is found to have sent seventy others
          before Him. Now seventy cannot possibly be the type either of an
          Ogdoad, a Decad, or a Triacontad. What is the reason, then, that the
          inferior Æons are, as I have said, represented by means of the
          apostles; but the superior, from whom, too, the former derived their
          being, are not prefigured at all? But if the twelve apostles were
          chosen with this object, that the number of the twelve Æons might be
          indicated by means of them, then the seventy also ought to have been
          chosen to be the type of seventy Æons; and in that case, they must
          affirm that the Æons are no longer thirty, but eighty-two in number.
          For He who made choice of the apostles, that they might be a type of
          those Æons existing in the Pleroma, would never have constituted them
          types of some and not of others; but by means of the apostles He would
          have tried to preserve an image and to exhibit a type of those Æons
          that exist in the Pleroma.

          2. Moreover we must not keep silence respecting Paul, but demand from
          them after the type of what Æon that apostle has been handed down to
          us, unless perchance [they affirm that he is a representative] of the
          Saviour compounded of them [all], who derived his being from the
          collected gifts of the whole, and whom they term All Things, as having
          been formed out of them all. Respecting this being the poet Hesiod has
          strikingly expressed himself, styling him Pandora -- that is, "The
          gift of all" -- for this reason, that the best gift in the possession
          of all was centred in him. In describing these gifts the following
          account is given: Hermes (so he is called in the Greek language),
          Haimulious te logous kai epiklopon ethos autous Kattheto (or to
          express this in the English language), "implanted words of fraud and
          deceit in their minds, and thievish habits," for the purpose of
          leading foolish men astray, that such should believe their falsehoods.
          For their Mother -- that is, Leto -- secretly stirred them up (whence
          also she is called Leto, according to the meaning of the Greek word,
          because she secretly stirred up men), without the knowledge of the
          Demiurge, to give forth profound and unspeakable mysteries to itching
          ears. And not only did their Mother bring it about that this mystery
          should be declared by Hesiod; but very skilfully also by means of the
          lyric poet Pindar, when he describes to the Demiurge the case of
          Pelops, whose flesh was cut in pieces by the Father, and then
          collected and brought together, and compacted anew by all the gods,
          did she in this way indicate Pandora and these men having their
          consciences seared by her, declaring, as they maintain, the very same
          things, are [proved] of the same family and spirit as the others.<br />
