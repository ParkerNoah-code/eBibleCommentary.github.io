          his going down.20. Thou makest darkness, and it is night; wherein all
          the beasts of the forest creep forth.21. The lions roar after their
          prey, and in seeking their food from God. 22. The sun shall rise, and
          they shall gather themselves together, and lie down in their dens. 23.
          Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labor, until the evening.

          19. He hath appointed the moon to distinguish seasons The Psalmist now
          comes to another commendation of God's providence as manifested in the
          beautiful arrangement by which the course of the sun and moon
          alternately succeeds each other; for the diversity in their mutual
          changes is so far from producing confusion, that all must easily
          perceive the impossibility of finding any better method of
          distinguishing time. When it is said, that the moon was appointed to
          distinguish seasons, interpreters agree that this is to be understood
          of the ordinary and appointed feasts. The Hebrews having been
          accustomed to compute their months by the moon, this served for
          regulating their festival days and assemblies, both sacred and
          political. The prophet, I have no doubt, by the figure synecdoche,
          puts a part for the whole, intimating, that the moon not only
          distinguishes the days from the nights, but likewise marks out the
          festival days, measures years and months, and, in fine, answers many
          useful purposes, inasmuch as the distinction of times is taken from
          her course. As to the sentence, The sun knoweth his going down, I
          understand it not only of his daily circuit, but as also denoting that
          by gradually approaching nearer us at one time, and receding farther
          from us at another, he knows how to regulate his movements by which to
          make summer, winter, spring, and autumn. It is farther stated, that
          the beasts of the forest creep forth during the night, because they go
          out of their dens with fear. Some translate the verb rms, ramas, to
          walk; but its proper signification which I have given is not
          unsuitable; for although hunger often drives wild beasts into fury,
          yet they watch for the darkness of the night, that they may move
          abroad from their hiding-places, and on account of this fearfulness
          they are said to creep forth.

          21. The lions roar after their prey Although lions, if hunger compels
          them, go forth from their dens and roar even at noon-day, yet the
          prophet describes what is most usually the case. He therefore says,
          that lions do not venture to go abroad during the daytime, but that,
          trusting to the darkness of the night, they then sally forth in quest
          of their prey. Herein is manifested the wonderful providence of God,
          that a beast so dreadful confines itself within its den, that men may
          walk abroad with the greater freedom. And if lions sometimes range
          with greater liberty, this is to be imputed to the fall of Adam, which
          has deprived men of their dominion over the wild beasts. There are,
          however, still some remains of the original blessing conferred by God
          on men, inasmuch as he holds in check so many wild beasts by the light
          of day, as if by iron cages or chains. The expression, They seek their
          food from God, is not to be understood of their casting themselves
          upon the care of God, as if they acknowledged him to be their
          foster-father, but it points out the fact itself, that God in a
          wonderful manner provides food for such ravenous beasts.

          22. The sun shall rise The Psalmist continues to prosecute the same
          subject, showing that God so distributes the successions of time, as
          that the day belongs properly to man. Did not God put a restraint upon
          so many wild beasts which are hostile to us, the human race would soon
          become extinct. As wild beasts since the fall of man may seem to be
          born to do us hurt, and to rend and tear in pieces all whom they meet
          with, this savage cruelty must be kept under check by the providence
          of God. And in order to keep them shut up within their dens, the only
          means which he employs is to inspire them with terror, simply by the
          light of the sun. This instance of divine goodness, the prophet
          commends the more on account of its necessity; for were it otherwise,
          men would have no liberty to go forth to engage in the labors and
          business of life. Man being thus protected by the light against the
          violence and injuries of wild beasts, in this is to be seen the
          unparalleled goodness of God, who in so fatherly a manner has provided
          for his convenience and welfare.<br />
