          10. They who dwell in darkness, and in the shadow of death, being
          bound in trouble and iron; 11. Because they rebelled against the words
          of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High: 12. When he humbled
          their heart with affliction; they were brought low, and there was none
          to help them.13. In their affliction they cried to Jehovah, and he
          delivered them from their tribulations.14. He rescued them from
          darkness and from the shadow of death, and broke off their chains.15.
          Let them praise the mercy of Jehovah in his presence, and his
          marvelous works in the presence of the sons of men.16. Because he hath
          broken the brazen gates, and dashed in pieces the iron bars.

          10. They who dwell in darkness The Spirit of God makes mention here of
          another species of danger in which God manifestly discovers his power
          and grace in the protecting and delivering of men. The world, as I
          said, calls these vicissitudes the sport of fortune; and hardly one
          among a hundred can be found who ascribes them to the superintending
          providence of God. It is a very different kind of practical wisdom
          which God expects at our hands; namely, that we ought to meditate on
          his judgments in the time of adversity, and on his goodness in
          delivering us from it. For surely it is not by mere chance that a
          person falls into the hands of enemies or robbers; neither is it by
          chance that he is rescued from them. But this is what we must
          constantly keep in view, that all afflictions are God's rod, and that
          therefore there is no remedy for them elsewhere than in his grace. If
          a person fall into the hands of robbers or pirates, and be not
          instantly murdered, but, giving up all hope of life, expects death
          every moment; surely the deliverance of such a one is a striking proof
          of the grace of God, which shines the more illustriously in proportion
          to the fewness of the number who make their escape. Thus, then, should
          a great number perish, this circumstance ought by no means to diminish
          the praises of God. On this account the prophet charges all those with
          ingratitude, who, after they have been wonderfully preserved, very
          soon lose sight of the deliverance thus vouchsafed to them. And, to
          strengthen the charge, he brings forward, as a testimony against them,
          their sighs and cries. For when they are in straits, they confess in
          good earnest that God is their deliverer; how happens it, then, that
          this confession disappears when they are enjoying peace and quietness?

          11. Because they rebelled In assigning the cause of their afflictions
          he corrects the false impressions of those persons who imagine that
          these happen by chance. Were they to reflect on the judgments of God,
          they would at once perceive that there was nothing like chance or
          fortune in the government of the world. Moreover, until men are
          persuaded that all their troubles come upon them by the appointment of
          God, it will never come into their minds to supplicate him for
          deliverance. Farther, when the prophet assigns the reason for their
          afflictions, he is not to be regarded as speaking of those persons as
          if they were notoriously wicked, but he is to be considered as calling
          upon the afflicted carefully to examine some particular parts of their
          life, and although no one accuse them, to look into their hearts,
          where they will always discover the true origin of all the miseries
          which overtake them. Nor does he only charge them with having merely
          sinned, but with having rebelled against the word of God, thus
          intimating that the best and only regulation for our lives consists in
          yielding a prompt obedience to his commandments. When, therefore,
          sheer necessity compels those who are in this manner convicted to cry
          unto God, they must be insensate indeed, if they do not acknowledge
          that the deliverance which, contrary to their expectation, they
          receive, comes immediately from God. For brazen gates and iron bars
          are spoken of for the purpose of enhancing the benefit; as if he said,
          the chains of perpetual slavery have been broken asunder.<br />
