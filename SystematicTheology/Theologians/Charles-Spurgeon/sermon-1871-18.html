        <p>"Will he always call upon God?" -- Job 27:10.</p>
        <p>
          WHEN Job resumes his address in this chapter, he appeals to God in a
          very solemn matter as to the truth of all that he had spoken. No less
          vehemently does he assert his innocence of any signal crime, or his
          consciousness of any secret guile, which could account for his being
          visited with extraordinary suffering. I do not know that his language
          necessarily implies any culpable self-righteousness; it appears to me
          rather that he had good cause to defend himself against the bitter
          insinuations of his unfriendly friends. Possibly his tone was rash,
          but his meaning was right. He might well feel the justice of
          vindicating his character before men: but it was a pity if in so doing
          he seemed to utter a protest of complete purity in the sight of God.
          You may remember how Paul under equal, if not exactly similar,
          provocation, tempered his speech and guarded against the danger of
          misconstruction. Thus he wrote to the Corinthians: "With me it is a
          very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment:
          yea, I judge not mine own self. For I know nothing by myself [or
          myself, as though he should say, My conscience does not accuse me of
          wrong']; yet am I not hereby justified." But the two holy men are very
          like in one respect, for just as Paul, in the struggles of the spirit
          against the flesh, faced the peril and mounted guard against it, "lest
          that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself shall be a
          castaway;" so Job lays bare before his own eyes, and points to the
          view of those who heard him, the features of a hypocrite, lest by any
          means he should turn out to be such. In terrible language he describes
          and denounces the hypocrite's flattering hope and withering doom. The
          suspicion that he himself could harbour a vain presence in his own
          breast, or would pretend to be what he was not, was utterly abhorrent
          to Job's honest heart. He placed himself at the bar, he laid down the
          law with rigour, he weighed his case with exactness; and so
          forestalled his adversaries' verdict, by judging himself that he might
          not be judged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who, then, is this "wicked man," thus portrayed before us? And what
          are the first symptoms of his depravity? We ask not the question idly,
          but in order that we take heed against the uprise of such an evil in
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>"Beneath the saintly veil the votary of sin</p>
        <p>May lurk unseen; and to that eye alone</p>
        <p>Which penetrates the heart, may stand revealed."</p>
        <p>
          The hypocrite is very often an exceedingly neat imitation of the
          Christian. To the common observer he is so good a counterfeit that he
          entirely escapes suspicion. Like base coins which are cunningly made,
          you can scarcely detect them by their ring; it is only by more
          searching tests that you are able to discover that they are not pure
          gold, the current coin of the realm. It would be difficult to say how
          nearly any man might resemble a Christian, and yet not be "in Christ a
          new creature;" or how closely he might imitate all the virtues, and
          yet at the same time possess none of the fruits of the Spirit as
          before the judgment of a heart-searching God. In almost all deceptions
          there is a weak point somewhere. Never is a lying story told but, if
          you be keen enough, you may from internal evidence somewhere or other
          detect the flaw. Though Satan himself has been engaged in the
          manufacture of impostures for thousands of years, yet whether through
          the lack of skill on his part, or through the folly of his agents, he
          always leaves a weak point; his clattering statements are a little too
          strongly scented and smell of a lie; and his mimic Christians are so
          overdone in one place, and slovenly in another, that their falsehood
          betrays itself. Now, in discriminating between saints and hypocrites,
          one great test-point is prayer. "Behold, he prayeth," was to the
          somewhat sceptical mind of Ananias demonstration enough that Paul was
          really converted. If he prays, it may be safely inferred that the
          breath of prayer arises from the life of faith. The process of
          spiritual quickening has at least begun. Hence the hypocrite feigns to
          possess that vital action. If the Christian prays, he will betake
          himself to the like exercise: if the Christian calls upon God the
          deceiver takes care that he will likewise make mention of the name of
          the Lord. And yet, between the prayer of the truly converted man and
          the prayer of the hypocrite there is a difference as radical as
          between life and death, although it is not apparent to everybody. No
          one, it may be, at first can be aware of it except the man himself,
          and sometimes even he scarcely perceives it. Many are deceived by the
          fine expressions, by the apparent warmth, and by the excellent natural
          disposition of the hypocrite, and they think when they hear him call
          upon God that his supplications are sufficient evidence that he is
          truly a quickened child of God. Prayer is always the tell-tale of
          spiritual life. No right prayer, then is there no grace within.
          Slackened prayer, then is there a decrease of grace. Prayer stronger,
          thee the whole man also is stronger. Prayer is as good a test of
          spiritual life and health as the pulse is of the condition of the
          human frame. Hence I say the hypocrite imitates the action of prayer
          while he does not really possess the spirit of prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text goes deeper than the surface, and enquires into vital
          matters. Prayer is a test, but here is a test for the test -- a trial
          even for prayer itself. "Will he always call upon God?" There is the
          point. He does call upon God now, and he appears to be intensely
          devout; he says he was converted in the late revival; he is very
          fervid in expression, and very forward in manner at present. But will
          it wear? Will it wear? Will it last? His prayerfulness has sprung up
          like Jonah's gourd in a night. Will it perish in a night? It is
          beautiful to look upon, like the early dew that glistens in the
          sunlight as though the morning had sown the earth with orient pearl;
          will it pass away like that dew? or will it always abide? "Will he
          always call upon God?" There is the point. O that each one of us now
          may search ourselves, and see whether we have those attributes
          connected with our prayer which will prove us not to be hypocrites, or
          whether, on the contrary, we have those sad signs of base dissembling
          and reckless falsehood which will before long discover us to be dupes
          of Satan, impostors before heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will he always call upon God?" This question, simple as it is, I
          think involves several pertinent enquiries. The first point which it
          raises is that of CONSISTENCY. Is the prayer occasional, or is it
          constant? Is the exercise of devotion permanent and regular, or is it
          spasmodic and inconstant? Will this man call upon God in all seasons
          of prayer? There are certain times when it is most fit to pray, and a
          genuine Christian will and must pray at such periods. Will this
          hypocrite pray at all such times, or will he only select some of the
          seasons for prayer? Will he only be found praying at certain times and
          in selected places? Will he always, in all fit times, be found drawing
          near to God? For instance, he prayed standing at the corners of the
          streets where he was seen of men: he prayed in the synagogue, where
          everybody could mark his fluency and his fervor, but will he pray at
          home? Will he enter into his closet and shut to the door? Will he
          there speak unto the Father who heareth in secret? Will he there pour
          forth petitions as the natural outflow of his soul? Will he walk the
          field at eventide, in lonely meditation, like Isaac, and pray there?
          Will he go to the housetop with Peter, and pray there? Will he seek
          his chamber as Daniel did, or the solitude of the garden as did our
          Lord? Or is he one who only prays in public, who has the gift of
          prayer rather than the spirit of prayer, who is fluent in utterance
          rather than fervent in feeling? Oh, but this, this is one of the
          surest of tests, by which we may discern between the precious and the
          vile. Public prayer is no evidence of piety: it is practiced by an
          abundance of hypocrites; but private prayer is a thing for which the
          hypocrite has no heart -- and if he gives himself to it for a little
          time he soon finds it too hot and heavy a business for his soulless
          soul to persevere in, and he lets it drop. He will sooner perish than
          continue in private prayer. O for heart searchings about this! Do I
          draw near to God alone? Do I pray when no eye sees, when no ear hears?
          Do I make a conscience of private prayer? Is it a delight to pray? For
          I may gather that if I never enjoy private prayer I am one of those
          hypocrites who will not always call upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The true Christian will pray in business; he will pray in labor; he
          will pray in his ordinary calling: like sparks out of the smithy
          chimney short prayers fly up all day long from truly devout souls. Not
          thus is it with the mere pretender. The hypocrite prays at
          prayer-meetings, and his voice is heard in the assembly, sometimes at
          tedious length; but will he pray with ejaculatory prayer? Will he
          speak with God at the counter? Will he draw near to God in the field?
          Will he plead with his Lord in the busy street with noiseless
          pleadings? When he finds that a difficultly has occurred in his daily
          life, will he without saving a word breathe his heart into the ear of
          God? Ah, no! hypocrites know nothing of what it is to be always
          praying, to abide in the spirit of prayer. This is a choice part of
          Christian experience with which they do not meddle. But be sure of
          this -- where there is genuine religion within, it will be more or
          less habitual to the soul to pray. Some of us can say that to be
          asking blessings from God in brief, wordless prayers, comes as natural
          to us as to eat and drink, and breathe. We never encounter a
          difficulty now but we resolve it by appealing to the wisdom of God --
          never meet with any opposition but what we overcome it by leaning upon
          the power of God. To wait upon the Lord and speak with him has become
          a habit with us -- not because it is a duty -- we have left legal
          bondage far behind -- but because we cannot help it, our soul is
          inwardly constrained thereto. The nature within as naturally cries to
          God as a child cries after its mother. The hypocrite prays in his
          fashion because it is a task allotted to him: the Christian because it
          is a part of his very life. Herein is an everstanding mark of
          distinction by which a man may discern himself. If your prayer is only
          for certain hours, and certain places, and certain times, beware lest
          it turn out to be an abomination before the Lord. The fungus forced by
          artificial heat is a far different thing from the rosy fruit of a
          healthy tree, and the unreal devotions of the unspiritual differ
          widely from the deep inward groanings of renewed hearts. If you pray
          by the almanac, observing days and weeks, you may well fear that your
          religion never came from the great Father of Lights, with whom are no
          changing moons. If you can pray by the clock, your religion is more
          mechanical than vital. The Christian does not fast because it is Lent;
          if his Lord reveals his face he cannot fast merely because a church
          commands him. Neither can he therefore feast because it happens to be
          a festival in the calendar. The Spirit of God might make his soul to
          be feasting on Ash-Wednesday, or his soul might be humbled within him
          at Easter; he cannot be regulated by the dominical letter, and the new
          moons and days of the month. He is a spiritual character, and he
          leaves those who have no spiritual life to yield a specious conformity
          to such ecclesiastical regulations, his new-born nature spurns such
          childish bonds. The living soul prays evermore with groanings that
          cannot be uttered, and believingly rejoices evermore with joy
          unspeakable and full of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second point in debate is that of CONTINUANCE. "Will he always call
          upon God?" There are trying periods and sifting seasons; those who
          hold on through these are the true, but those who suspend prayer at
          these test intervals are the false. Now times of joy and sorrow are
          equally critical seasons. Let us look at them in turn. Will the
          hypocrite call upon God in times of pleasure? No; if he indulges
          himself in what he calls pleasure, he dares not pray at night when he
          comes home. He goes to places where he would think it a degradation of
          prayer to think of praying. The genuine Christian prays always,
          because if there be any spot where he dares not pray, just there he
          dares not be found; or if there be any engagement about which he could
          not pray, it is an engagement that shall never ensnare him. Some one
          once proposed to write a collect to be said by a pious young lady when
          attending a theater, and another to be repeated by a Christian
          gentleman when shuffling a pack of cards. There might he another form
          of prayer to be offered by a pious burglar when he is breaking open a
          door, or by a religious assassin when he is about to commit murder.
          There are things about which you cannot pray: they have nothing to do
          with prayer. Many tolerated amusements lead to outrages upon the
          morals of earth, and are an insult to the holiness of heaven. Who
          could think of praying about them? Herein is the hypocrite discerned;
          he does that which he could not ask a blessing upon. Poor as is the
          conscience he owns, he knows it is ridiculous to offer prayer
          concerning certain actions which, notwithstanding, he has the
          hardihood to perform. The Christian avoids things which he could not
          pray about; and so he feels it a pleasure to pray always.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equally trying is the opposite condition of depression and sorrow.
          There, too, we try the question, "Will he always call upon God?" No;
          the hypocrite will not pray when in a desponding state. He breathed
          awhile the atmosphere of enthusiasm. His passions were stirred by the
          preacher, and fermented by the contagious zeal of the solemn assembly.
          But now a damp cold mist obscures his view chills his feelings,
          settles in his heart. Others are growing cold, and he is among the
          first to freeze. He is down-hearted and discouraged. Forthwith, like
          King Saul, he succumbs to the evil spirit. Were he a Christian indeed,
          he would follow in the wake of David, and say: "Why art thou cast
          down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God:
          for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and
          my God;" but he has no heart to hope on in ill weather. He built up
          his hopes tastefully, and he admired the structure which was of his
          own piling, but the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds
          blew, and down it all went; and therefore, being a hypocrite, he said
          within himself: "Now I have no enjoyment of religion: it has lost its
          novelty; I have worn out its delights; I have now no comfort from it;
          I will give it up." Thus in the trying hour the deceiver is laid bare.
          Look at the real Christian when a storm bursts over him which shakes
          his confidence and spoils his joy: what does he do? He prays more than
          ever he did. When his mountain stood firm, and he said, "I shall not
          be moved," he perhaps grew too slack in prayer; but now, when all
          God's waves and billows are going over him, and he hardly knows
          whether he is a child of God or not, and questions whether he has any
          part or lot in the matter, he proves that all is right within, by
          crying unto God in the bitterness of his soul, "O God, have mercy upon
          me, and deliver me from going down into the pit." A Christian's
          despair makes him pray; it is a despair of self. A worldling's despair
          makes him rave against God, and give up prayer. Mark then, how in the
          opposite seasons of joy and sorrow prayer is put into the crucible and
          tested. All our times of pleasure ought to be times of prayer; Job
          accounted his family festivities opportune for calling his children
          together for special devotion. No less should our periods of
          despondency become incentives to prayer; every funeral knell should
          ring us to our knees. The hypocrite cannot keep the statutes and
          ordinances, but the true Christian follows them out; for he is alike
          at home in seeking the Lord, calling upon his name, and asking counsel
          and guidance at his mercy-seat, in any variety of experience, and
          every diversity of circumstance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will he always call upon God?" Here is the question of CONSTANCY.
          Will he pray constantly? It seems to most men a very difficult thing
          to be praying always, to continue in prayer, to pray without ceasing.
          Yes; and herein again is there a great distinction between the living
          child of God and the mere pretender. The living child of God soon
          finds that it is not so much his duty to pray, as his privilege, his
          joy, a necessity of his being. What moment is there when a Christian
          is safe without prayer? Where is there a place wherein he would find
          himself secure if he ceased to pray? Just think of it. Every moment of
          my life I am dependent upon the will of God as to whether I shall draw
          another breath or not. Nothing stands between me and death but the
          will of God. An angel's arm could not save me from the grave, if now
          the Lord willed me to depart. Solemn, then, is the Christian's
          position: ever standing by an open tomb. Should not dying men pray? We
          are always dying. As life is but a long dying, should it not be also a
          long praying? Should we not be incessantly acknowledging to God in
          prayer and praise the continuance of our being, which is due to his
          grace? Brethren, every moment that we live we are receiving favors and
          benefits from God. There is never a minute in which we are not
          recipients of his bounty. We are wont to thank God for his mercies as
          if we thought they came at certain set times; so in truth they do:
          they are new every morning; great is his faithfulness; and they soothe
          us night by night, for his compassion faileth not, but there are
          mercies streaming on in one incessant flow. We never cease to need; he
          never ceases to supply. We want constant protection, and he that
          keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. Lest any hurt us, he keeps
          us night and day. The river of God rolls on with undiminished volume
          and unimpeded velocity. How greatly doth he enrich us thereby! Should
          we not be ever careful to secure his gifts, to reap the harvest be
          provides, and as his people to take these good things from his
          gracious hands? But, oh! let us take heed to mingle prayer with all
          our thanksgiving, lest he should curse the boon over which we have
          asked no blessing; blight the crops, of which we have dedicated to him
          no firstfruits; or smite us with the rod of his anger, while the food
          is yet in our mouth. Our cravings know no abatement, our dependence on
          God knows no limit; therefore our prayers should know no intermission.
          Speak of beggars, we are always beggars. Is it not better for us,
          then, to be regular pensioners than mere casuals? Whatever God has
          given us we are as needy still; we are always, if taken apart from
          him, naked, and poor, and miserable, altogether dependent upon him, as
          well for the soul as for the body; for good thoughts, for spiritual
          aspirations, for holy graces, ay, and for the breath of our nostrils
          and the bread of our mouths; always needing temporals, always needing
          spirituals. If we are always needing, we should be always pleading.
          Besides that, dear friends, we are always in danger; we are in an
          enemy's country, behind every bush there is a foe; we cannot reckon
          ourselves to be secure in any place. The world, the flesh, and the
          devil constantly assail us. Arrows are shot from beneath us, and from
          around us, while the poison of our own corruption rankles within us.
          At any moment temptation may get the mastery over us, or we ourselves
          may go astray and be our own tempters. Storms may drive us, whirlpools
          suck us down, quicksands engulf us, and if none of these accomplish
          our shipwreck we may founder of ourselves, or perish of spiritual
          dry-rot. We need, then, each hour to watch, and each separate moment
          to pray, "Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe." Are ye wealthy? Pray
          God that your silver and your gold bring no spiritual plague with
          them! Do not let your money stick to your hand or your heart, for in
          proportion as it glues itself to you it poisons you. Pray God to
          sanctify your abundance, so that you may know how to abound; a
          difficult piece of knowledge to attain. Are ye poor? Then ask to be
          kept from envy, from discontent, and all the evils that haunt the
          narrow lanes of poverty. Pray that as you are each in danger one way
          or another, you may all be kept hour by hour by the constant grace of
          God. If we knew what poor, weak, helpless creatures we are, we should
          not want to be told always to pray; we should wonder how we could
          think of living without prayer. How can I, whose legs are so feeble,
          try to wall: without leaning on my Father's hand? How can I, who am so
          sickly, wish to be a day without the Good Physician's care? The
          hypocrite does not see this; he does not discern these perpetual needs
          and perpetual gifts, these perpetual dangers and perpetual
          preservations -- not be. He thinks he has prayed enough when he has
          had his few minutes in the morning and his few minutes at night. He
          trots through his form of morning devotion just as he takes his
          morning wash, and has he not settled the business for the day? If at
          evening he says his prayers with the same regularity with which he
          puts on his slippers, is it not all he needs? He almost thinks that
          little turn at his devotions to be a weariness. As to his heart going
          up in prayer to God, he does not understand it; if he be spoken to
          concerning it, it sounds like an idle tale, or mere cant.

          Dear brethren, "we ought always to pray, and not to faint," because we
          are always sinning. If I were not evermore sinning, if I could pause
          in that constant aberration of mind from the pure, the unselfish, the
          holy, perhaps I might suspend confession, and relax supplication
          awhile; but if unholiness stains even my holy things -- if in my best
          endeavors there is something of error, something of sin -- ought I not
          to be continually crying to God for pardon, and involving his grace?
          And are we not constantly liable to new temptations? May we not fall
          into grosser sins than we have hitherto committed, unless we are
          preserved by a power beyond our own? O pray perpetually, for you know
          not what temptations may assail you. Pray that ye enter not into
          temptation. If perchance in some favored moment we could imagine
          ourselves to have exhausted all the list of our needs, were we
          enjoying complete pardon and full assurance, did we stand upon the
          mountain's brow, bathing our foreheads in the sunlight of God's favor,
          if we had no fear, no care, no trouble of our own to harass us, yet we
          might not therefore cease to pray. The interests of others, our
          kindred, our neighbors, our fellow creatures might -- ah! must -- then
          start up before us, and claim that we should bear upon our breasts
          their memorial. Think of the sinners around you hardening in
          transgression, some of them dying, seared with guilt or frenzied with
          despair. O brethren, how could you cease to intercede for others, were
          it possible, which it is not, that you should have no further need to
          supplicate for yourselves? The grand old cause which we have espoused,
          and the Christ who hath espoused our cause -- both these demand our
          prayers. By the truth whose banner waves above us, by the king who has
          ennobled us, love to whose person fires us this day with ardor for his
          cross, and zeal for his gospel, we are constrained to unwavering
          devotion. So spake the gospel of old, and so doth the Spirit of God
          prompt us now. "Prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
          daily shall he be praised." O that in our case the prediction might be
          verified, the promise fulfilled! Not so the hypocrite: he will not
          have it on this fashion. Enough for him to have prayers on the Sunday;
          enough to get through family prayers at any rate, and if that does not
          please you, the morning prayer and the evening prayer shall be said by
          rote at the bedside; will not these suffice? Praying all day long, why
          he considers that it would be almost as bad as heaven, where they are
          singing without ceasing. So he turns on his heel, and saith he will
          have none of it. Nor shall he; for where God is he shall not come, but
          the Lord will tell him, "I never knew you: depart from me, thou worker
          of iniquity."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will he always call upon God?" The question may be an enquiry as to
          IMPORTUNITY. Will the hypocrite pray importunately? He will do no such
          thing. I have heard farmers talk about the why to know a good horse.
          It will serve me to illustrate the way to tell a good Christian. Some
          horses when they get into the traces pull, and when they feel the load
          move they work with all their might, but it they tug and the load does
          not stir, they are not for drawing any longer. There is a breed of
          really good horses in Suffolk which will tug at a dead weight, and if
          they were harnessed to a post, they would pull till they dropped
          though nothing stirred. It is so with a lively Christian. If he is
          seeking a great favor from God, he prays, whether he gets it or not,
          right on: he cannot take a denial; if he knows his petition to be
          according to God's will and promise, he pleads the blood of Jesus
          about it; and if he does not get an answer at once, he says, "My soul,
          wait" -- wait! a grand word -- "wait thou only upon God; for my
          expectation is from him." As for the hypocrite, if he gets into a
          church and there is a prayer-meeting and he feels, "Well, there is a
          fire kindling and an excitement getting up" -- ah! how that man can
          pray, the waggon is moving behind him, and he is very willing to pull.
          But the sincere believer says, "I do not perceive any revival yet. I
          do not hear of many conversions. Never mind, we have prayed that, God
          will glorify his dear Son: we will keep on praying. If the blessing
          does not come in one week, we will try three; if it does not come in
          three weeks, we will try three months; if it does not come in three
          months, we shall still keep on for three years; and if it does not
          come in three years, we will plead on for thirty years: and if it does
          not; come then, we will say, Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
          and thy glory unto their children.' We will plead on until we die, and
          mingle with those who beheld the promise afar off, were persuaded of
          it, prayed for it, and died believing it would be fulfilled." Such
          prayer would not be wasted breath. It is treasure put out to interest;
          seed sown for a future harvest; rather it is the aspiration of saints
          kindled by the inspiration of God. The genuine believer knows how to
          tug. Jacob, when he came to Jabbok, found that the angel was not
          easily to be conquered. He laid hold of him, but the angel did not
          yield the blessing; something more must be done. Had Jacob been a
          hypocrite he would have let the angel loose at once, but being one of
          the Lord's own, he said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless
          me." When the angel touched him in the hollow of his thigh and made
          the sinew shrink, had he been a hypocrite he would have thought, "I
          have had enough of this already; I may be made to shrink all over; I
          cannot tell what may happen next. I will have no more of this midnight
          encounter with an unknown visitor. I will get me back to my tent." But
          no; he meant to prevail, and though he felt the pain, Yet he said --
        </p>
        <p>"With thee all night I mean to stay,</p>
        <p>And wrestle till the break of day."</p>
        <p>
          He did so, and became a prince from that night. Will you take a denial
          from God, you shall have it; but if you will not be denied, neither
          shall you. O importunate Christian, you are he whom God loves! Alas
          for those who only give, as it were, runaway knocks at the door of
          heaven, like boys in the street that knock and run away -- they shall
          never find the blessing. Oh, to continue in prayer! it is the very
          test of sincerity. Hence of the hypocrite it is said, "Will be always
          call upon God?" A hypocrite leaves off praying in either case; he
          leaves off if he does not get what he asks for, as I have shown you;
          and he leaves off if he does get what he asks for. Has he asked to be
          recovered from sickness when ill? If he gets well, what cares he for
          praying again? Did he pray that he might not die? Oh, what a long face
          he drew, and what drawling professions of repentance he groaned out!
          But when his health is regained, and his nerves braced, his spirits
          are cheered, and his manly vigor has come back to him; where are his
          prayers? where are the vows his soul in anguish made? He has forgotten
          them all. That he is a hypocrite is palpable, for he leaves oft
          praying if he does not get heard, and if he does. There is no keeping
          this man up to God's statute or his own promise; he has not the heart
          for true devotion, and soon fails in the attempt to exercise it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will He always call upon God?" Here is the trial of PERSEVERANCE.
          Will he always continue to pray in the future? Will he pray, in years
          to come, as he now professes to do? I call to see him, and he is very
          sick; the doctor gives a very poor account of him; his wife is
          weeping; all over the house there is great anxiety. I sit down by his
          bedside; I talk to him, and he says, "Oh, yes, yes, yes;" he agrees
          with all I say, and he tells me he believes in Jesus. And when he can
          sit up, he cries, "God be merciful to me." His dear friends are godly
          people; they feel so pleased; they look torward to his recovery, and
          reckon upon seeing him a new creature, a disciple of Christ. Besides,
          he has told them, when he gets up, how earnest he will be in a life of
          faith and obedience to the Lord. He will not be a mere professor, he
          means to throw his whole soul into the Master's service. Now mark him.
          He recovers; and when he breaks forth from that sick chamber, and can
          dispense with the ministry of those gentle patient women who nursed
          him and prayed for him, what does the hypocrite do? Oh, he says he was
          a fool to think and speak as he did. He admits he was frightened, but
          he disclaims every pious expression as an infirmity of his distracted
          brain, the delirium of his malady, not the utterance of his reason;
          and he recants all his confessions like the atheist in Addison's
          "Spectator." Addison tells us that certain sailors heard that an
          atheist was on board their vessel: they did not know what an atheist
          was, but they thought it must be some odd fish; and when told it was a
          man who did not believe in God, they said, "Captain, it would be an
          uncommonly good thing to pitch him overboard." Presently a storm comes
          on, and the atheist is dreadfully sick and very fearful; there, on the
          deck, he is seen crying to God for mercy, and whining like a child
          that he is afraid he will be lost and sink to hell. This is the usual
          courage of atheism! But when the coward reached the shore, he begged
          the gentlemen who heard him pray to think nothing of it, for indeed he
          did not know what he was saying, he had no doubt uttered a great deal
          of nonsense. There are plenty of that sort -- who pray in danger, but
          brag when they get clear of the tempest. Hereby the hypocrite is
          discovered. Once take away from him the trouble and you do away with
          the motive for which he put on the cloak of religion. He is like a
          boy's top, which will spin as long as you whip it. The man will pray
          while he smarts, but not one whit longer. The hypocrite will pray
          to-day in society congenial for prayer, but he will discard prayer
          to-morrow when he gets laughed at for it in his business. Some old
          friend of his drops in, who has heard that he has been converted, and
          he begins to ridicule him. He asks him whether he has really turned a
          Methodist? The next thing he expects to hear is, that he is dipped. He
          makes some coarse remarks rather to the chagrin of our courageous
          friend, till he, who set out so boldly to heaven with his prayers,
          feels quite small in the presence of the sceptic. It he were right in
          heart, he would not only have a proper answer to give to the mocker,
          but in all probability he would carry the war into the enemy's
          country, and make his antagonist feel the folly of his sins and the
          insanity of his conduct in living without a God and without a Savior.
          The meet object of ridicule and contempt is the godless, the
          Christless man. The Christian need never be ashamed or lower his
          colors. The hypocrite may well blush and hide his head, for if there
          is any creature that is contemptible, it is a man who has not his
          heart where he professes it to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither will such a one always call upon God if he gets into company
          where he is much flattered; he feels then that he has degraded himself
          somewhat by associating with such low, mean people as those who make
          up the church of God. And if he prospers in business, then he
          considers that the people he once worshipped with are rather inferior
          to himself: he must go to the world's church: he must find a
          fashionable place where he can hear a gospel that is not for the poor
          and needy, but for those who have the key of aristocratic
          drawing-rooms and the select assemblies. His principles -- well, he is
          not very particular -- he swallows them; probably his nonconformity
          was a mistake. The verities which his fathers suffered martyrdom to
          defend, for which they were mulcted of their possessions, driven as
          exiles from their country, or cast into prison, he flings away as
          though they were of no value whatever. Many have fallen from us
          through the temptations of prosperity who stood firmly enough under
          persecution and adversity. It is another form of the same test, "Will
          he always call upon God?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, if none of these things should occur the man who is not
          savingly converted and a genuine Christian, generally gives up his
          religion after a time because the novelty of it dies off. He is like
          the stony ground that received the seed, and because there was no
          depth of earth the sun could play upon it with great force, and up it
          sprang in great haste, but because there was no depth of earth,
          therefore it soon was scorched. So this man is easily impressible,
          feels quickly, and acts promptly under the influence of a highly
          emotional nature. Says he, "Yes, I will go to heaven," as he inwardly
          responds to the appeal of some earnest minister. He thinks he is
          converted, but we had better not be quite so sure as he is. "Wait a
          bit, wait a bit." He cools as fast as he was heated. Like thorns under
          a pot that crackle and blaze and die out, leaving but a handful of
          ashes, so is it with all his godliness. Ere long he gets tired of
          religion, he cannot away with it -- what a weariness it is. If he
          perseveres awhile, it is no more pleasure to him than a pack is to a
          pack horse. He keeps on as a matter of formality: he has got into it
          and he does not see how to break away, but he likes it no better than
          an owl loves daylight. He holds on to his forms of prayer with no
          heart for prayer -- and what a wretched thing that is! I have known
          people who felt bound to keep up their respectability when they had
          little or no income. Their debts were always increasing, their
          respectability was always tottering, and the strain upon their dignity
          was exhausting their utmost resources. Such persons I have considered
          to be the poorest of the poor. An unhappy life they lead, they never
          feel at ease. But what an awful thing it is to have to keep up a
          spiritual respectability with no spiritual income; to overflow with
          gracious talk when there is no well of living water springing up
          within the soul; to be under the obligation to pay court to the
          sanctuary while the heart is wandering on the mountain; to be bound to
          speak gracious words and yet possess no gracious thoughts to prompt
          their utterance. O man, thou art one of the devil's double martyrs,
          because thou hast to suffer for him here in the distaste and nausea of
          thy hypocritical profession, and then thou will be made to suffer
          hereafter also for having dared to insult God, and ruin thy soul by
          being insincere in thy profession of faith in Jesus Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          I may be coming very close home to some persons before me: I am
          certainly pressing my own conscience very severely. I suppose there is
          no one amongst us who does not feel that this is a very searching
          matter. Well, dear friends, if our hearts condemn us not, then have we
          peace towards God; but if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than
          our hearts and knoweth all things. Let us confess to him all past
          failures, and though we may not be conscious of hypocrisy (and I trust
          we are not so), yet, let us say, "Lord, search and try me, and know my
          ways; see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
          everlasting." I was speaking with a gentleman last night, and I said
          to him, "You are a director of such a Life Assurance Company, are you
          not?" "Yes," he said. "Well," I said, "yours is a poor society, is it
          not?" "It is a very good one," he replied; "a very good one." "But it
          is very low down in the list." "What list is that?" "Why, the list
          that has been sent round by certain persons to let the public see the
          condition of the life assurance companies." "Well," said he, "where is
          it to be seen?" "Oh, never mind where it is to be seen: is it true?"
          "No, it is not true; our society stands well -- admirably well." "How
          so?" "Well, you know such a man, he is an excellent actuary and a man
          of honor." "Yes." "Well, when we employed him to go over our accounts,
          we said just this to him: Take the figures, examine them thoroughly,
          sift our accounts, and tell us where the figures land you; tell us
          just that, neither less nor more, do not shirk the truth in the
          slightest degree. If we are in a bankrupt state, tell us; if we are
          flourishing, tell us so.'" My friend has convinced me that his office
          is not what I feared it was. I have much confidence in any man's
          business when he wishes to know and to publish the unvarnished truth.
          I have great confidence in the sincerity of any Christian man who says
          habitually and truthfully, "Lord, let me know the very worst of my
          case, whatever it is. Even if all my fair prospects and bright ideals
          should be but dreams -- the fabric of a vision; if yonder prospect
          before me of green fields and flowing hills should be but an awful
          mirage, and on the morrow should change into the hot burning desert of
          an awful reality; so be it, only let me know the truth; lead me in a
          plain path; let me be sincere before thee, O thou heart-searching,
          rein-trying God!" Let us, with such frank candour, such ingenuous
          simplicity, come before the Lord. Let as many of us as fear the Lord
          and distrust ourselves, take refuge in his omniscience against the
          jealousies and suspicions which haunt our own breasts. And let us do
          better still, let us hasten anew to the cross of Jesus, and thus end
          our difficulties by accepting afresh the sinners' Savior. When I have
          a knot to untie as to my evidence of being a child of God, and I
          cannot untie it, I usually follow Alexander's example with the Gordian
          knot, and cut it. How cut it? Why, in this way. Thou sayest, O
          conscience, this is wrong, and thus is wrong. Thou sayest, O Satan,
          thy faith is a delusion, thy experience a fiction, thy profession a
          lie. Be it so then, I will not dispute it, I end that matter; if I am
          no saint, I am a sinner; there can be no doubt about that! The devil
          himself is defied to question that. Then it is written that "Jesus
          Christ came into the world to save sinners," and to sinners is the
          gospel preached, "He that believeth on him is not condemned." I do
          believe on him; if I never did before I will now, and all my
          transgressions are therefore blotted out. And now, Lord, grant me
          grace to begin again, and from this time forth let me live the life of
          faith, the life of prayer; let me be one of those who will pray
          always, let me be one of those who will pray when they are dying,
          having prayed all their lives. Prayer is our very life: ceasing prayer
          we cease to live. As long as we are here preserved in spiritual life
          we must pray. Lord, grant it may be so with each one here present,
          through the power of thy Spirit, and the merit of Jesus' blood. Amen,
          and Amen.
