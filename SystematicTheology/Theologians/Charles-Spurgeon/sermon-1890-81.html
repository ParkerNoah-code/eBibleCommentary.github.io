          A memorial a which Ambrose, a chief man of Greece, wrote: who became a
          Christian, and all his fellow-senators raised an outcry against him;
          and he fled from them, and wrote and pointed out to them all their
          foolishness.
        </p>
        <p>Beginning his discourse, he answered and said: --</p>
        <p>
          Think not, men of Greece, that my separation from your customs has
          been made without a just and proper reason. For I acquainted myself
          with all your wisdom, consisting of poetry, of oratory, of philosophy;
          and when I found not there anything agreeable to what is right, or
          that is worthy of the divine nature, I resolved to make myself
          acquainted with the wisdom of the Christians also, and to learn and
          see who they are, and when they took their rise, and what is the
          nature of this new and strange wisdom of theirs, or on what good hopes
          those who are imbued with it rely, that they speak only that which is
          true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men of Greece, when I came to examine the Christian writings, I found
          not any folly in them, as I had found in the celebrated Homer, who has
          said concerning the wars of the two trials: "Because of Helen, many of
          the Greeks perished at Troy, away from their beloved home." For, first
          of all, we are told concerning Agamemnon their king, that by reason of
          the foolishness of his brother Menelaus, and the violence of his
          madness, and the uncontrollable nature of his passion, he resolved to
          go and rescue Helen from the hands of a certain leprous shepherd; and
          afterwards, when the Greeks had become victorious in the war, and
          burnt cities, and taken women and children captive, and the land was
          filled with blood, and the rivers with corpses, Agamemnon himself also
          was found to be taken captive by his passion for Briseis. Patroclus,
          again, we are told, was slain, and Achilles, the son of the goddess
          Thetis, mourned over him; Hector was dragged along the ground, and
          Priam and Hecuba together were weeping over the loss of their
          children; Astyanax, the son of Hector, was thrown down from the walls
          of Ilion, and his mother Andromache the mighty Ajax bore away into
          captivity; and that which was taken as booty was after a little while,
          all squandered in sensual indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the wiles of Odysseus the son of Laertes, and of his murders, who
          shall tell the tale? For of a hundred and ten suitors did his house in
          one day become the grave, and it was filled with corpses and blood.
          He, too, it was that by his wickedness gained the praises of men,
          because through his pre-eminence in craft he escaped detection; he,
          too, it was who, you say, sailed upon the sea, and heard not the voice
          of the Sirens only because he stopped his ears with wax.
        </p>
        <p>
          The famous Achilles, again, the son of Peleus, who bounded across the
          river, and routed the Trojans, and slew Hector, -- this said hero of
          yours became the slave of Philoxena, and was overcome by an Amazon as
          she lay dead and stretched upon her bier; and he put off his armour,
          and arrayed himself in nuptial garments, and finally fell a sacrifice
          to love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus much concerning your great "men;" and thou, Homer, hadst deserved
          forgiveness, if thy silly story-telling had gone so far only as to
          prate about men, and not about the gods. As for what he says about the
          gods, I am ashamed even to speak of it: for the stories that have been
          invented about them are very wicked and shocking; passing strange,
          too, and not to be believed; and, if the truth must be told, fit only
          to be laughed at. For a person will be compelled to laugh when he
          meets with them, and will not believe them when he hears them. For
          think of gods who did not one of them observe the laws of rectitude,
          or of purity, or of modesty, but were adulterers, and spent their time
          in debauchery, and yet were not condemned to death, as they ought to
          have been!
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, the sovereign of the gods, the very "father of gods and men," not
          only, as ye say, was an adulterer (this was but a light thing), but
          even slew his own father, and was a pæderast. I will first of all
          speak of his adultery, though I blush to do so: for he appeared to
          Antiope as a satyr, and descended upon Danaë as a shower of gold, and
          became a bull for Europa, and a swan for Leda; whilst the love of
          Semele, the mother of Dionysus, exposed both his own ardency of
          passion and the jealousy of the chaste Hera. Ganymede the Phrygian,
          too, he carried off disguised as an eagle, that the fair and comely
          boy, forsooth, might serve as cup-bearer to him. This said sovereign
          of the gods, moreover killed his father Kronos, that he might seize
          upon his kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! to how many charges is the sovereign of the gods amenable, and how
          many deaths does he deserve to die, as an adulterer, and as a
          sorcerer, and as a pæderast! Read to the sovereign of the gods, O men
          of Greece, the law concerning parricide, and the condemnation
          pronounced on adultery, and about the shame that attaches to the vile
          sin of pæderasty. How many adulterers has the sovereign of the gods
          indoctrinated in sin! Nay, how many pæderasts, and sorcerers, and
          murderers! So that, if a man be found indulging his passions, he must
          not be put to death: because he has done this that he may become like
          the sovereign of the gods; and, if he be found a murderer, he has an
          excuse in the sovereign of the gods; and, if a man be a sorcerer, he
          has learned it from the sovereign of the gods; and, if he be a
          pæderast, the sovereign of the gods is his apologist. Then, again, if
          one should speak of courage, Achilles was more valiant that this said
          sovereign of the gods: for he slew the man that slew his friend; but
          the sovereign of the gods wept over Sarpedon his son when he was
          dying, being distressed for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pluto, again, who is a god, carried off Kora, and the mother of Kora
          was hurrying hither and thither searching for her daughter in all
          desert places; and, although Alexander Paris, when he had carried off
          Helen, paid the penalty of vengeance, as having made himself her lover
          by force, yet Pluto, who is a god, when he carried off Kora, remained
          without rebuke; and, although Menelaus, who is a man, knew how to
          search for Helen his wife, yet Demeter, who is a goddess, knew not
          where to search for Kora her daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let Hephæstus put away jealousy from him, and not indulge resentment.
          For he was hated, because he was old and lame; while Ares was loved,
          because he was a youth and beautiful in form. There was, however, a
          reproof administered in respect of the adultery. Hephæstus was not,
          indeed, at first aware of the love existing between Venus his wife and
          Ares; but, when he did become acquainted with it, Hephæstus said:
          "Come, see a ridiculous and senseless piece of behaviour -- how to me,
          who am her own, Venus, the daughter of the sovereign of the gods, is
          offering insult -- to me, I say, who am her own, and is paying honour
          to Ares, who is a stranger to her." But to the sovereign of the gods
          it was not displeasing: for he loved such as were like these.
          Penelope, moreover, remained a widow twenty years, because she was
          expecting the return of her husband Odysseus, and busied herself with
          cunning tasks, and persevered in works of skill, while all those
          suitors kept pressing her to marry them; but Venus, who is a goddess,
          when Hephæstus her husband was close to her, deserted him, because she
          was overcome by love for Ares. Hearken, men of Greece: which of you
          would have dared to do this, or would even have endured to see it?
          And, if any one "should" dare to act so, what torture would be in
          store for him, or what scourgings!
        </p>
        <p>
          Kronos, again, who is a god, who devoured all those children of his,
          was not even brought before a court of justice. They further tell us
          that the sovereign of the gods, his son, was the only one that escaped
          from him; and that the madness of Kronos his father was cheated of its
          purpose because Rhea his wife, the mother of the sovereign of the
          gods, offered him a stone in the place of the said sovereign of the
          gods, his son, to prevent him from devouring him. Hearken, men of
          Greece, and reflect upon this madness! Why, even the dumb animal that
          grazes in the field knows its proper food, and does not touch strange
          food; the wild beast, too, and the reptile, and the bird, know their
          food. As for men, I need not say anything about them: ye yourselves
          are acquainted with their food, and understand it well. But Kronos,
          who is a god, not knowing his proper food, ate up a stone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, O men of Greece, if ye will have such gods as these, do not
          find fault with one another when ye do such-like things. Be not angry
          with thy son when he forms the design to kill thee: because he thus
          resembles the sovereign of the gods. And, if a man commit adultery
          with thy wife, why dost thou think of him as an enemy, and yet to the
          sovereign of the gods, who is like him, doest worship and service?
          Why, too, dost thou find fault with thy wife when she has committed
          adultery and leads a dissolute life, and yet payest honour to Venus,
          and placest her images in shrines? Persuade your Solon to repeal his
          laws; Lycurgus, also, to make no laws; let the Areopagus repeal
          theirs, and judge no more; and let the Athenians have councils no
          longer. Let the Athenians discharge Socrates from his office: for no
          one like Kronos has ever come before him. Let them not put to death
          Orestes, who killed his mother: for, lo! the sovereign of the gods did
          worse things than these to his father. OEdipus also too hastily
          inflicted mischief on himself, in depriving his eyes of sight, because
          he had killed his mother unwittingly: for he did not think about the
          sovereign of the gods, who killed his father and yet remained without
          punishment. Medea, again, who killed her children, the Corinthians
          banish from their country; and yet they do service and honour to
          Kronos, who devoured his children. Then, too, as regards Alexander
          Paris -- he was right in carrying off Helen: for he did it that he
          might become like Pluto, who carried off Kora. Let your men be set
          free from law, and let your cities be the abode of wanton women, and a
          dwelling-place for sorcerers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore, O men of Greece, seeing that your gods are grovelling like
          yourselves, and your heroes destitute of courage, as your dramas tell
          and your stories declare -- then, again, what shall be said of the
          tribulations of Orestes; and the couch of Thyestes; and the foul taint
          in the family of Pelops; and concerning Danaus, who through jealousy
          killed his sons-in-law, and deprived them of offspring; the banquet of
          Thyestes, too, feeding upon the corpse set before him by way of
          vengeance for her whom he had wronged; about Procne also, to this hour
          screaming as she flies; her sister too, warbling, with her tongue cut
          out? What, moreover, is it fitting to say about the murder committed
          by OEdipus, who took his own mother to wife, and whose brothers killed
          one another, they being at the same time his sons?
        </p>
        <p>
          Your festivals, too, I hate; for there is no moderation where they
          are; the sweet flutes also, dispellers of care, which play as an
          incitement to dancing; and the preparation of ointments, wherewith ye
          anoint yourselves; and the chaplets which ye put on. In the abundance
          of your wickedness, too, ye have forgotten shame, and your
          understandings have become blinded, and ye have been infuriated by the
          heat of passion, and have loved the adulterous bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had these things been said by another, perhaps our adversaries would
          have brought an accusation against him, on the plea that they were
          untrue. But your own poets say them, and your own hymns and dramas
          declare them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, therefore, and be instructed in the word of God, and in the
          wisdom which is fraught with comfort. Rejoice, and become partakers of
          it. Acquaint yourselves with the King Immortal, and acknowledge His
          servants. For not in arms do they make their boast, nor do they commit
          murders: because our Commander has no delight in abundance of
          strength, nor yet in horsemen and their gallant array, nor yet in
          illustrious descent; but He delights in the pure soul, fenced round by
          a rampart of righteousness. The word of God, moreover, and the
          promises of our good King, and the works of God, are ever teaching us.
          Oh the blessedness of the soul that is redeemed by the power of the
          word! Oh the blessedness of the trumpet of peace without war! Oh the
          blessedness of the teaching which quenches the fire of appetite!
          which, though it makes not poets, nor fits men to be philosophers, nor
          has among its votaries the orators of the crowd; yet instructs men,
          and makes the dead not to die, and lifts men from the earth as gods up
          to the region which is above the firmament. Come, be instructed, and
          be like me: for I too was once as ye are.
