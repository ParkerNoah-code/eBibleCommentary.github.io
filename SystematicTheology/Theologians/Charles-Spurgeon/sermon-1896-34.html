        <p>A Psalm of David.</p>
        <p>
          1. I will sing of mercy and of judgment: unto thee, O Jehovah! will I
          sing psalms.2. I will behave myself prudently in a perfect way, till
          thou comest to me: I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the
          midst of thy house.3. I will not set a wicked thing before my eyes: I
          hate the work of those who turn aside; it shall not adhere to me.4.
          The perverse heart shall depart from me: I will not know evil 5. Whoso
          slandereth his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy: the man whose
          eyes are lofty, and whose heart is wide, I cannot endure.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          1 I will sing of mercy and of judgment What David here says concerning
          singing must be understood by the reader as intimating that this psalm
          contains the substance of his meditations with himself, as to what
          kind of king he would be whenever he should be put in possession of
          the sovereign power which had been promised him. To sing therefore of
          mercy and of judgment, is equivalent to declaring in solemn terms,
          that he would be a just and an upright king. Augustine understands
          this as meaning that God is to be praised, whether he punish men with
          severity, or whether he show himself merciful to them; but this
          interpretation is too refined. David does not speak of God's secret
          judgments, but of the due administration of the kingdom, that he might
          both by words and deeds fulfill his vocation. When he asserts, Unto
          thee, O Jehovah! will I sing psalms, he acknowledges that it was by
          the favor of God that he was appointed to so distinguished and
          honorable an office; for it would have been an act of presumptuous
          rashness for him to have thrust himself into it, at the mere impulse
          of his own mind. He very properly comprehends all princely virtues
          under these two particulars, mercy and judgment; for as it is the
          principal duty of a king to yield to every man his own right, so he is
          also required to possess a considerate love and compassion towards his
          subjects. Solomon therefore justly says, (Proverbs 16:12) "The throne
          is established by righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          2 I will behave myself prudently in a perfect way David here shows
          that he carefully considered how weighty a charge was laid upon him
          when he was made king. We know, and it is a truth taught us by
          experience, that almost all kings are intoxicated with the splendors
          of royalty; and the proverb was not used without foundation in ancient
          times, "A king must be born either a king or a fool." It is indeed a
          mistake to say that kings are born fools. Men were led to speak in
          this manner, because it commonly happens that those who are invested
          with the government of kingdoms and empires are fools and blockheads.
          And surely it is a remarkable instance of the vengeance of God, that
          beasts, and such as are altogether unworthy to be numbered among men,
          commonly possess the highest authority. But although kings are not
          born fools, yet they are so blinded by their dignity, that they think
          themselves in no respect indebted to their subjects, become arrogant
          and haughty in their carriage, recklessly plunge into their pleasures,
          and at length utterly forget themselves. David therefore says, I will
          behave myself prudently, or, which amounts to the same thing, I will
          look warily to myself; it being a rare virtue for the man who may do
          as he pleases to exercise such moderation, as not to allow himself
          liberty in any degree to do evil. He then who is exalted to sovereign
          power, and yet, instead of attempting to go as far as he can in doing
          mischief, restrains himself by self-control, is endued with true
          understanding. In short, David protests that he will not be like other
          kings who are infatuated by their own dignity; but that according to
          the greatness of the charge imposed upon him, he would endeavor wisely
          to perform his duty. It is to be observed, that he represents wisdom
          as consisting in a perfect way, or in uprightness. From this we learn
          that tyrants who employ their talents in forming wicked devices, and
          who are daily contriving new methods for burdening and oppressing
          their subjects; in short, who are ingenious only in doing mischief,
          are not wise towards God. Many persons, it is true, dislike such
          craftiness; but still, it is undeniable that, if kings are intent upon
          enlarging the boundaries of their kingdom, and are masters in refined
          policy for accomplishing such a purpose, this is accounted the most
          perfect wisdom which they can possess, and is extolled to the skies.
          David, on the contrary, covets no other wisdom but that which is the
          mistress of integrity. Till thou comest to me These words may be read
          in two ways. Some translate them interrogatively, When wilt thou come?
          as if David besought God not to subject him to any longer delay. And
          truly he had just ground to groan and lament, when he saw himself so
          long oppressed with poverty, and driven from place to place a wretched
          exile. It had been better for him to have lived obscure and unnoticed
          in his father's cottage, following his former occupation as a
          shepherd, than to be anointed king, that, being driven out of his
          country, he might live in utter dishonor and hatred. But I prefer
          reading the sentence without interrogation, until or when thou comest;
          and yet even this I interpret somewhat differently from the majority
          of commentators, understanding it to mean, that although David still
          continued in the condition of a private person, and did not enjoy the
          royal power which had been promised him, he nevertheless did not cease
          in the meantime to follow after uprightness. Thus he sets the midst of
          his house in opposition to palaces and public buildings; as if he had
          said, Within my private house or in my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 I will not set a wicked thing before my eyes After having protested,
          that in leading a private life, he would practice virtue and
          righteousness, even as it becomes good princes to begin with this, he
          now adds, that in executing the office of prince, he will be the enemy
          of all injustice and wickedness. To set a wicked thing before one's
          eyes, is equivalent to purposing to do something that is wicked. He
          therefore declares, that he will turn away from all wickedness; and it
          is certain, that no man can be a just and an impartial punisher of
          wrongdoing, but he who abhors it with all his heart. Whence it follows
          that kings, in order to the performance of their duty, must keep
          themselves entirely free from all consent to wickedness. Some join to
          the first sentence the word svh, asoh, which we translate work, and
          supply the letter l, lamed; as if it had been said, I will not set
          before my eyes any wickedness to do it, or, nothing wicked will be
          acceptable to me to execute it. But the other sense is more probable,
          which is, that David, after having declared that he will not suffer
          any iniquity before his eyes, immediately adds for the sake of
          confirmation, that he will be an enemy to all injustice. If the last
          clause is referred to the persons who turn aside, there is a change of
          the number. It may, however, be explained of the work itself, implying
          that he would never have any share in wicked defections from the path
          of rectitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 The perverse heart shall depart from me Some by perverse heart
          understand perfidious men; but this I reject as a sense too forced,
          and it is moreover inconsistent with the context. As David has added
          in the second clause by way of exposition, I will not know evil, he
          doubtless in the first protests that he will be free from all
          perfidiousness and wickedness. The amount is, that he will do his
          endeavor to keep himself from all wrong-doing, and that he will not
          even know what it is to do wrong to his neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          5 Whoso slandereth his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy. In this
          verse he speaks more distinctly of the duty of a king who is armed
          with the sword, for the purpose of restraining evil-doers. Detraction,
          pride, and vices of every description, are justly offensive to all
          good men; but all men have not the power or right to cut off the proud
          or detractors, because they are not invested with public authority,
          and consequently have their hands bound. It is of importance to attend
          to this distinction, that the children of God may keep themselves
          within the bounds of moderation, and that none may pass beyond the
          province of his own calling. It is certain, that so long as David
          lived merely in the rank of a private member of society, he never
          dared to attempt any such thing. But after being placed on the royal
          throne, he received a sword from the hand of God, which he employed in
          punishing evil deeds. He particularises certain kinds of wickedness,
          that under one species, by the figure synecdoche, he might intimate
          his determination to punish all sorts of wickedness. To detract from
          the reputation of another privily, and by stealth, is a plague
          exceedingly destructive. It is as if a man killed a fellow-creature
          from a place of ambush; or rather a calumniator, like one who
          administers poison to his unsuspecting victim, destroys men unawares.
          It is a sign of a perverse and treacherous disposition to wound the
          good name of another, when he has no opportunity of defending himself.
          This vice, which is too prevalent every where, while yet it ought not
          to be tolerated among men, David undertakes to punish.
        </p>
        <p>
          He next characterises the proud by two forms of expression. He
          describes them as those whose eyes are lofty, not that all who are
          proud look with a lofty countenance, but because they commonly betray
          the superciliousness of their proud hearts by the loftiness of their
          countenance. He farther describes them as wide of heart, because those
          who aspire after great things must necessarily be puffed up and
          swollen. They are never satisfied unless they swallow up the whole
          world. From this we learn that good order cannot exist, unless princes
          are sedulously on the watch to repress pride, which necessarily draws
          after it and engenders outrage and cruelty, contemptuous language,
          rapine, and all kinds of ill treatment. Thus it would come to pass,
          that the simple and the peaceable would be at the mercy of the more
          powerful, did not the authority of princes interfere to curb the
          audacity of the latter. As it is the will of God that good and
          faithful kings should hold pride in detestation, this vice is
          unquestionably the object of his own hatred. What he therefore
          requires from his children is gentleness and meekness, for he is the
          declared enemy of all who strive to elevate themselves above their
          condition.
