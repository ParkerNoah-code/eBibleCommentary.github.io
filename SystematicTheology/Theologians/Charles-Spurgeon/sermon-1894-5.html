          And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the
          daughters of the Philistines. And he came up, and told his father and
          his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters
          of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. Then his
          father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the
          daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to
          take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his
          father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. But his father and
          his mother knew not that it was of the LORD; for he sought an occasion
          against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule
          over Israel. Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
          Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion
          roared against him. And the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him,
          and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
          hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. And
          he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
          And after a while he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
          the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the
          body of the lion, and honey. And he took it into his hands, and went
          on, eating as he went, and he came to his father and mother, and gave
          unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken
          the honey out of the body of the lion. And his father went down unto
          the woman: and Samson made there a feast: for so used the young men to
          do. And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
          companions to be with him. And Samson said unto them, Let me now put
          forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it me within the seven days
          of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen
          garments and thirty changes of raiment: but if ye cannot declare it
          me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of
          raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may
          hear it. And he said unto them,
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of the eater came forth meat,<br />And out of the strong came
          forth sweetness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they could not in three days declare the riddle. And it came to
          pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy
          husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and
          thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is
          it not so? And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
          hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the
          children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her,
          Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell
          thee? And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
          lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her,
          because she pressed him sore: and she told the riddle to the children
          of her people. And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh
          day before the sun went down:
        </p>
        <p>
          What is sweeter than honey?<br />And what is stronger than a lion?
        </p>
        <p>And he said unto them:</p>
        <p>
          If ye had not plowed with my heifer,<br />Ye had not found out my
          riddle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to
          Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave
          the changes of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And his
          anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. But Samson's
          wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that
          Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my
          wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
          And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated
          her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister
          fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. And Samson
          said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the
          Philistines, when I do them a mischief. And Samson went and caught
          three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and
          put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails. And when he had
          set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the
          Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing corn, and
          also the oliveyards. Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this?
          And they said, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he hath
          taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines
          came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. And Samson said unto
          them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and
          after that I will cease. And he smote them hip and thigh with a great
          slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of
          Etam.
