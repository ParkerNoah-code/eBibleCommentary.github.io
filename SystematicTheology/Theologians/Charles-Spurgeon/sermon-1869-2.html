        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.897)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, October 24th, 1869, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
          do." -- Luke 23:34.
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR LORD WAS at that moment enduring the first pains of crucifixion;
          the executioners had just then driven the nails through his hands and
          feet. He must have been, moreover, greatly depressed, and brought into
          a condition of extreme weakness by the agony of the night in
          Gethsemane, and by the scourgings and cruel mockings which he had
          endured all through the morning, from Caiaphas, Pilate, Herod, and the
          Praetorian guards. Yet neither the weakness of the past, nor the pain
          of the present, could prevent him from continuing in prayer. The Lamb
          of God was silent to men, but he was not silent to God. Dumb as sheep
          before her shearers, he had not a word to say in his own defense to
          man, but he continues in his heart crying unto his Father, and no pain
          and no weakness can silence his holy supplications. Beloved, what an
          example our Lord herein presents to us! Let us continue in prayer so
          long as our heart beats; let no excess of suffering drive us away from
          the throne of grace, but rather let it drive us closer to it.
        </p>
        <p>"Long as they live should Christians pray,</p>
        <p>For only while they pray they live."</p>
        <p>
          To cease from prayer is to renounce the consolations which our case
          requires. Under all distractions of spirit, and overwhelmings of
          heart, great God, help us still to pray, and never from the mercy-seat
          may our footsteps be driven by despair. Our blessed Redeemer
          persevered in prayer even when the cruel iron rent his tender nerves,
          and blow after blow of the hammer jarred his whole frame with anguish;
          and this perseverance may be accounted for by the fact that he was so
          in the habit of prayer that he could not cease from it; he had
          acquired a mighty velocity of intercession which forbade him to pause.
          Those long nights upon the cold mountain side, those many days which
          had been spent in solitude, those perpetual ejaculations which he was
          wont to dart up to heaven, all these had formed in him a habit so
          powerful, that the severest torments could not stay its force. Yet it
          was more than habit. Our Lord was baptised in the spirit of prayer; he
          lived in it, it lived in him, it had come to be an element of his
          nature. He was like that precious spice, which, being bruised, doth
          not cease to give forth its perfume, but rather yieldeth it all the
          more abundantly because of the blows of the pestle, its fragrance
          being no outward and superficial quality, but an inward virtue
          essential to its nature, which the pounding in the mortar did not
          fetch from it, causing it to reveal its secret soul of sweetness. So
          Jesus prays, even as a bundle of myrrh gives forth its smell, or as
          birds sing because they cannot do otherwise. Prayer enwrapped his very
          soul as with a garment, and his heart went forth in such array. I
          repeat it, let this be our example -- never, under any circumstances,
          however severe the trial, or depressing the difficulty, let us cease
          from prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, further, that our Lord, in the prayer before us, remains in
          the vigour of faith as to his Sonship. The extreme trial to which he
          now submitted himself could not prevent his holding fast his Sonship.
          His prayer begins, "Father." It was not without meaning that he taught
          us when we pray to say, "Our Father," for our prevalence in prayer
          will much depend upon our confidence in our relationship to God. Under
          great losses and crosses, one is adapt to think that God is not
          dealing with us as a father with a child, but rather as a severe judge
          with a condemned criminal; but the cry of Christ, when he is brought
          to an extremity which we shall never reach, betrays no faltering in
          the spirit of sonship. In Gethsemane, when the bloody sweat fell fast
          upon the ground, his bitterest cry commenced with, "My Father," asking
          that if it were possible the cup of gall might pass from him; he
          pleaded with the Lord as his Father, even as he over and over again
          had called him on that dark and doleful night. Here, again, in this,
          the first of his seven expiring cries, it is "Father." O that the
          Spirit that makes us cry, "Abba, Father," may never cease his
          operations! May we never be brought into spiritual bondage by the
          suggestion, "If thou be the Son of God;" or if the tempter should so
          assail us, may we triumph as Jesus did in the hungry wilderness. May
          the Spirit which crieth, "Abba, Father," repel each unbelieving fear.
          When we are chastened, as we must be (for what son is there whom his
          father chasteneth not?) may we be in loving subjection to the Father
          of our spirits, and live; but never may we become captives to the
          spirit of bondage, so as to doubt the love of our gracious Father, or
          our share in his adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          More remarkable, however, is the fact that our Lord's prayer to his
          Father was not for himself. He continued on the cross to pray for
          himself, it is true, and his lamentable cry, "My God, my God, why hast
          thou forsaken me?" shows the personality of his prayer; but the first
          of the seven great cries on the cross has scarcely even an indirect
          reference to himself. It is, "Father, forgive them." The petition is
          altogether for others, and though there is an allusion to the
          cruelties which they were exercising upon himself, yet it is remote;
          and you will observe, he does not say, "I forgive them" -- that is
          taken for granted -- he seems to lose sight of the fact that they were
          doing any wrong to himself, it is the wrong which they were doing to
          the Father that is on his mind, the insult which they are paying to
          the Father, in the person of the Son; he thinks not of himself at all.
          The cry, "Father, forgive them," is altogether unselfish. He himself
          is, in the prayer, as though he were not; so complete is his
          self-annihilation, that he loses sight of himself and his woes. My
          brethren, if there had ever been a time in the life of the Son of man
          when he might have rigidly confined his prayer to himself, without any
          one cavilling thereat, surely it was when he was beginning his death
          throes. We could not marvel, if any man here were fastened to the
          stake, or fixed to a cross, if his first, and even his last and all
          his prayers, were for support under so arduous a trial. But see, the
          Lord Jesus began his prayer by pleading for others. See ye not what a
          great heart is here revealed! What a soul of compassion was in the
          Crucified! How Godlike, how divine! Was there ever such a one before
          him, who, even in the very pangs of death, offers as his first prayer
          an intercession for others? Let this unselfish spirit be in you also,
          my brethren. Look not every man upon his own things, but every man
          also on the things of others. Love your neighbours as yourselves, and
          as Christ has set before you this paragon of unselfishness, seek to
          follow him, treading in his steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, however, a crowning jewel in this diadem of glorious love.
          The Son of Righteousness sets upon Calvary in a wondrous splendour;
          but amongst the bright colours which glorify his departure, there is
          this one -- the prayer was not alone for others, but it was for his
          cruellest enemies. His enemies, did I say, there is more than that to
          be considered. It was not a prayer for enemies who had done him an ill
          deed years before, but for those who were there and then murdering
          him. Not in cold blood did the Saviour pray, after he had forgotten
          the injury, and could the more easily forgive it, but while the first
          red drops of blood were spurting on the hands which drove the nails;
          while yet the hammer was bestained with crimson gore, his blessed
          mouth poured out the fresh warm prayer, "Father, forgive them, for
          they know not what they do." I say, not that that prayer was confined
          to his immediate executioners. I believe that it was a far-reaching
          prayer, which included Scribes and Pharisees, Pilate and Herod, Jews
          and Gentiles -- yea, the whole human race in a certain sense, since we
          were all concerned in that murder; but certainly the immediate
          persons, upon whom that prayer was poured like precious nard, were
          those who there and then were committing the brutal act of fastening
          him to the accursed tree. How sublime is this prayer if viewed in such
          a light! It stands alone upon a mount of solitary glory. No other had
          been prayed like it before. It is true, Abraham, and Moses, and the
          prophets had prayed for the wicked; but not for wicked men who had
          pierced their hands and feet. It is true, that Christians have since
          that day offered the same prayer, even as Stephen cried, "Lay not this
          sin to their charge;" and many a martyr has made his last words at the
          stake words of pitying intercession for his persecutors; but you know
          where they learnt this, let me ask you where did he learn it? Was not
          Jesus the divine original? He learnt it nowhere; it leaped up from his
          own Godlike nature. A compassion peculiar to himself dictated this
          originality of prayer; the inward royalty of his love suggested to him
          so memorable an intercession, which may serve us for a pattern, but of
          which no pattern had existed before. I feel as though I could better
          kneel before my Lord's cross at this moment than stand in this pulpit
          to talk to you. I want to adore him; I worship him in heart for that
          prayer; if I knew nothing else of him but this one prayer, I must
          adore him, for that one matchless plea for mercy convinces me most
          overwhelmingly of the deity of him who offered it, and fills my heart
          with reverent affection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have introduced to you our Lord's first vocal prayer upon the
          cross. I shall now, if we are helped by God's Holy Spirit, make some
          use of it. First, we shall view it as illustrative of our Saviour's
          intercession; secondly, we shall regard the text as instructive to the
          church's work; thirdly, we shall consider it as suggestive to the
          unconverted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, my dear brethren, let us look at this very wonderful text as
          ILLUSTRATIVE OF OUR LORD'S INTERCESSION.
        </p>
        <p>
          He prayed for his enemies then, he is praying for his enemies now; the
          past on the cross was an earnest of the present on the throne. He is
          in a higher place, and in a nobler condition, but his occupation is
          the same; he continues still before the eternal throne to present
          pleas on the behalf of guilty men, crying, "Father, O forgive them."
          All his intercession is in a measure like the intercession on Calvary,
          and Calvary's cries may help us to guess the character of the whole of
          his intercession above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first point in which we may see the character of his intercession
          is this -- it is most gracious. Those for whom our Lord prayed,
          according to the text, did not deserve his prayer. They had done
          nothing which could call forth from him a benediction as a reward for
          their endeavours in his service; on the contrary, they were most
          undeserving persons, who had conspired to put him to death. They had
          crucified him, crucified him wantonly and malignantly; they were even
          taking away his innocent life. His clients were persons who, so far
          from being meritorious, were utterly undeserving of a single good wish
          from the Saviour's heart. They certainly never asked him to pray for
          them -- it was the last thought in their minds to say, "Intercede for
          us, thou dying King! Offer petitions on our behalf, thou Son of God!"
          I will venture to believe the prayer itself, when they heard it, was
          either disregarded, and passed over with contemptuous indifference, or
          perhaps it was caught as a theme for jest. I admit that it seems to be
          too severe upon humanity to suppose it possible that such a prayer
          could have been the theme for laughter, and yet there were other
          things enacted around the cross which were quite as brutal, and I can
          imagine that this also might have happened. Yet our Saviour prayed for
          persons who did not deserve the prayer, but, on the contrary, merited
          a curse -- persons who did not ask for the prayer, and even scoffed at
          it when they heard it. Even so in heaven there stands the great High
          Priest, who pleads for guilty men -- for guilty men, my hearers. There
          are none on earth that deserve his intercession. He pleads for none on
          the supposition that they do deserve it. He stands there to plead as
          the just One on the behalf of the unjust. Not if any man be righteous,
          but "if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father." Remember,
          too, that our great Intercessor pleads for such as never asked him to
          plead for them. His elect, while yet dead in trespasses and sins, are
          the objects of his compassionate intercessions, and while they even
          scoff at his gospel, his heart of love is entreating the favour of
          heaven on their behalf. See, then, beloved, if such be the truth, how
          sure you are to spend with God who earnestly ask the Lord Jesus Christ
          to plead for you. Some of you, with many tears and much earnestness,
          have been beseeching the Saviour to be your advocate? Will he refuse
          you? Stands it to reason that he can? He pleads for those that reject
          his pleadings, much more for you who prize them beyond gold. Remember,
          my dear hearer, if there be nothing good in you, and if there be
          everything conceivable that is malignant and bad, yet none of these
          things can be any barrier to prevent Christ's exercising the office of
          Intercessor for you. Even for you he will plead. Come, put your case
          into his hands; for you he will find pleas which you cannot discover
          for yourselves, and he will put the case to God for you as for his
          murderers, "Father, forgive them."
        </p>
        <p>
          A second quality of his intercession is this -- its careful spirit.
          You notice in the prayer, "Father, forgive them, for they know not
          what they do." Our Saviour did, as it were, look his enemies through
          and through to find something in them that he could urge in their
          favour; but he could not see nothing until his wisely affectionate eye
          lit upon their ignorance: "they know not what they do." How carefully
          he surveyed the circumstances, and the characters of those for whom he
          importuned! Just so it is with him in heaven. Christ is no careless
          advocate for his people. He knows your precise condition at this
          moment, and the exact state of your heart with regard to the
          temptation through which you are passing; more than that, he foresees
          the temptation which is awaiting you, and in his intercession he takes
          note of the future event which his prescient eye beholds. "Satan hath
          desired to have thee, that he may sift thee as wheat; but I have
          prayed for thee that thy faith fail not." Oh, the condescending
          tenderness of our great High Priest! He knows us better than we know
          ourselves. He understands every secret grief and groaning. You need
          not trouble yourself about the wording of your prayer, he will put the
          wording right. And even the understanding as to the exact petition, if
          you should fail in it, he cannot, for as he knoweth what is the mind
          of God, so he knoweth what is your mind also. He can spy out some
          reason for mercy in you which you cannot detect in yourselves, and
          when it is so dark and cloudy with your soul that you cannot discern a
          foothold for a plea that you may urge with heaven, the Lord Jesus has
          the pleas ready framed, and petitions ready drawn up, and he can
          present them acceptable before the mercy-seat. His intercession, then,
          you will observe is very gracious, and in the next place it is very
          thoughtful.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must next note its earnestness. No one doubts who reads these
          words, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," that
          they were heaven-piercing in their fervour. Brethren, you are certain,
          even without a thought, that Christ was terribly in earnest in that
          prayer. But there is an argument to prove that. Earnest people are
          usually witty, and quick of understanding, to discover anything which
          may serve their turn. If you are pleading for life, and an argument
          for your being spared be asked of you, I will warrant you that you
          will think of one when no one else might. Now, Jesus was so in earnest
          for the salvation of his enemies, that he struck upon an argument for
          mercy which a less anxious spirit would not have thought of: "They
          know not what they do." Why, sirs, that was in strictest justice but a
          scant reason for mercy; and indeed, ignorance, if it be wilful, does
          not extenuate sin, and yet the ignorance of many who surrounded the
          cross was a wilful ignorance. They might have known that he was the
          Lord of glory. Was not Moses plain enough? Had not Esaias been very
          bold in his speech? Were not the signs and tokens such that one might
          as well doubt which is the sun in the firmament as the claims of Jesus
          to be the Messias? Yet, for all that, the Saviour, with marvelous
          earnestness and consequent dexterity, turns what might not have been a
          plea into a plea, and puts it thus: "Father, forgive them, for they
          know not what they do." Oh, how mighty are his pleas in heaven, then,
          in their earnestness! Do not suppose that he is less quick of
          understanding there, or less intense in the vehemence of his
          entreaties. No, my brethren, the heart of Christ still labours with
          the eternal God. He is no slumbering intercessor, but, for Zion's
          sake, he doth not hold his peace, and for Jerusalem's sake, he doth
          not cease, nor will he, till her righteousness go forth as brightness,
          and her salvation as a lamp that burneth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is interesting to note, in the fourth place, that the prayer here
          offered helps us to judge of his intercession in heaven as to its
          continuance, perseverance, and perpetuity. As I remarked before, if
          our Saviour might have paused from intercessory prayer, it was surely
          when they fastened him to the tree; when they were guilty of direct
          acts of deadly violence to his divine person, he might then have
          ceased to present petitions on their behalf. But sin cannot tie the
          tongue of our interceding Friend! Oh, what comfort is here! You have
          sinned, believer, you have grieved his Spirit, but you have not
          stopped that potent tongue which pleads for you. You have been
          unfruitful, perhaps, my brother, and like the barren tree, you deserve
          to be cut down; but your want of fruitfulness has not withdrawn the
          Intercessor from his place. He interposes at this moment, crying,
          "Spare it yet another year." Sinner, you have provoked God by long
          rejecting his mercy and going from bad to worse, but neither blasphemy
          nor unrighteousness, nor infidelity, shall stay the Christ of God from
          urging the suit of the very chief of sinners. He lives, and while he
          lives he pleads; and while there is a sinner upon earth to be saved,
          there shall be an intercessor in heaven to plead for him. These are
          but fragments of thought, but they will help you, I hope, to realise
          the intercession of your great High Priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think yet again, this prayer of our Lord on earth is like his prayer
          in heaven, because of its wisdom. He seeks the best thing, and that
          which his clients most need, "Father, forgive them." That was the
          great point in hand; they wanted most of all there and then
          forgiveness from God. He does not say, "Father, enlighten them, for
          they know not what they do," for mere enlightenment would but have
          created torture of conscience and hastened on their hell; but he
          crieth, "Father, forgive;" and while he used his voice, the precious
          drops of blood which were then distilling from the nail wounds were
          pleading too, and God heard, and doubtless did forgive. The first
          mercy which is needful to guilty sinners is forgiven sin. Christ
          wisely prays for the boon most wanted. It is so in heaven; he pleads
          wisely and prudently. Let him alone, he knows what to ask for at the
          divine hand. Go you to the mercy-seat, and pour out your desires as
          best you can, but when you have done so always put it thus, "O my Lord
          Jesus, answer no desire of mine if it be not according to thy
          judgment; and if in aught that I have asked I have failed to seek for
          what I want, amend my pleading, for thou art infinitely wiser than I."
          Oh, is it sweet to have a friend at court to perfect our petitions for
          us before they come unto the great King. I believed that there is
          never presented to God anything but a perfect prayer now; I mean, that
          before the great Father of us all, no prayer of his people ever comes
          up imperfect; there is nothing left out, and there is nothing to be
          erased; and this, not because their prayers were originally perfect in
          themselves, but because the Mediator makes them perfect through his
          infinite wisdom, and they come up before the mercy-seat moulded
          according to the mind of God himself, and he is sure to grant such
          prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, this memorable prayer of our crucified Lord was like to his
          universal intercession in the matter of its prevalence. Those for whom
          he prayed were many of them forgiven. Do you remember that he said to
          his disciples when he bade them preach, "beginning at Jerusalem," and
          on that day when Peter stood up with the eleven, and charged the
          people with wicked hands they had crucified and slain the Saviour,
          three thousand of these persons who were thus justly accused of his
          crucifixion became believers in him, and were baptised in his name.
          That was an answer to Jesus' prayer. The priest were at the bottom of
          the Lord's murder, they were the most guilty; but it is said, "a great
          company also of the priests believed." Here was another answer to the
          prayer. Since all men had their share representatively, Gentiles as
          well as Jews, in the death of Jesus, the gospel was soon preached to
          the Jews, and within a short time it was preached to the Gentiles
          also. Was not this prayer, "Father, forgive them," like a stone cast
          into a lake, forming at first a narrow circle, and then a wider ring,
          and soon a larger sphere, until the whole lake is covered with
          circling waves? Such a prayer as this, cast into the whole world,
          first created a little ring of Jewish converts and of priest, and then
          a wider circle of such as were beneath the Roman sway; and to-day its
          circumference is wide as the globe itself, so that tens of thousands
          are saved through the prevalence of this one intercession "Father,
          forgive them." It is certainly so with him in heaven, he never pleads
          in vain. With bleeding hands, he yet won the day; with feet fastened
          to the wood, he was yet victorious; forsaken of God and despised of
          the people, he was yet triumphant in his pleas; how much more so now
          the tiara is about his brow, his hand grasp the universal sceptre, and
          his feet are shod with silver sandals, and he is crowned King of
          kings, and Lord of lords! If tears and cries out of weakness were
          omnipotent, even more mighty if possible must be that sacred authority
          which as the risen Priest he claims when he stands before the Father's
          throne to mention the covenant which the Father made with him. O ye
          trembling believers, trust him with your concerns! Come hither, ye
          guilty, and ask him to plead for you. O you that cannot pray, come,
          ask him to intercede for you. Broken hearts and weary heads, and
          disconsolate bosoms, come ye to him who into the golden censer will
          put his merits, and then place your prayers with them, so that they
          shall come up as the smoke of perfume, even as a fragrant cloud into
          the nostrils of the Lord God of hosts, who will smell a sweet savour,
          and accept you and your prayers in the Beloved. We have now opened up
          more than enough sea-room for your meditations at home this afternoon,
          and, therefore we leave this first point. We have an illustration in
          the prayer of Christ on the cross of what his prayers always are in
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>II. Secondly, the text is INSTRUCTIVE OF THE CHURCH'S WORK.</p>
        <p>
          As Christ was, so his church is to be in this world. Christ came into
          this world not to be ministered unto, but to minister, not to be
          honoured, but to save others. His church, when she understands her
          work, will perceive that she is not here to gather to herself wealth
          or honour, or to seek any temporal aggrandisement and position; she is
          here unselfishly to live, and if need be, unselfishly to die for the
          deliverance of the lost sheep, the salvation of lost men. Brethren,
          Christ's prayer on the cross I told you was altogether an unselfish
          one. He does not remember himself in it. Such ought to be the church's
          life-prayer, the church's active interposition on the behalf of
          sinners. She ought to live never for her ministers or for herself, but
          ever for the lost sons of men. Imagine you that churches are formed to
          maintain ministers? Do you conceive that the church exists in this
          land merely that so much salary may be given to bishops, and deans,
          and prebends, and curates, and I know not what? My brethren, it were
          well if the whole thing were abolished if that were its only aim. The
          aim of the church is not to provide out-door relief for the younger
          sons of nobility; when they have not brains enough to win anyhow else
          their livelihood, they are stuck into family livings. Churches are not
          made that men of ready speech may stand up on Sundays and talk, and so
          win daily bread from their admirers. Nay, there is another end and aim
          from this. These places are not built that you may sit here
          comfortably, and hear something that shall make you pass away your
          Sundays with pleasure. A church in London which does not exist to do
          good in the slums, and dens, and kennels of the city, is a church that
          has no reason to justify its longer existing. A church that does not
          exist to reclaim heathenism, to fight with evil, to destroy error, to
          put down falsehood, a church that does not exist to take the side of
          the poor, to denounce injustice and to hold up righteousness, is a
          church that has no right to be. Not for thyself, O church, dost thou
          exist, any more than Christ existed for himself. His glory was that he
          laid aside his glory, and the glory of the church is when she lays
          aside her respectability and her dignity, and counts it to be her
          glory to gather together the outcast, and her highest honour to seek
          amid the foulest mire the priceless jewels for which Jesus shed his
          blood. To rescue souls from hell and lead to God, to hope, to heaven,
          this is her heavenly occupation. O that the church would always feel
          this! Let her have her bishops and her preachers, and let them be
          supported, and let everything be done for Christ's sake decently and
          in order, but let the end be looked to, namely, the conversion of the
          wandering, the teaching of the ignorant, the help of the poor, the
          maintenance of the right, the putting down of the wrong, and the
          upholding at all hazards of the crown and kingdom of our Lord Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the prayer of Christ had a great spirituality of aim. You notice
          that nothing is sought for these people but that which concerns their
          souls, "Father, forgive them." And I believe the church will do well
          when she recollects that she wrestles not with flesh and blood, nor
          with principalities and powers, but with spiritual wickedness, and
          that what she has to dispense is not the law and order by which
          magistrates may be upheld, or tyrannies pulled down, but the spiritual
          government by which hearts are conquered to Christ, and judgments are
          brought into subjection to his truth. I believe that the more the
          church of God strains after, before God, the forgiveness of sinners,
          and the more she seeks in her life prayer to teach sinners what sin
          is, and what the blood of Christ is, and what the hell that must
          follow if sin be not washed out, and what the heaven is which will be
          ensured to all those who are cleansed from sin, the more she keeps to
          this the better. Press forward as one man, my brethren, to secure the
          root of the matter in the forgiveness of sinners. As to all the evils
          that afflict humanity, by all means take your share in battling with
          them; let temperance be maintained, let education be supported; let
          reforms, political and ecclesiastical, be pushed forward as far as you
          have the time and the effort to spare, but the first business of every
          Christian man and women is with the hearts and consciences of men as
          they stand before the everlasting God. O let nothing turn you aside
          from your divine errand of mercy to undying souls. This is your one
          business. Tell to sinners that sin will damn them, that Christ alone
          can take away sin, and make this the one passion of your souls,
          "Father, forgive them, forgive them! Let them know how to be forgiven.
          Let them be actually forgiven, and let me never rest except as I am
          the means of bringing sinners to be forgiven, even the guiltiest of
          them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Saviour's prayer teaches the church that while her spirit should
          be unselfish, and her aim should be spiritual, the range of her
          mission is to be unlimited. Christ prayed for the wicked, what if I
          say the most wicked of the wicked, that ribald crew that had
          surrounded his cross! He prayed for the ignorant. Doth he not say,
          "They know not what they do"? He prayed for his persecutors; the very
          persons who were most at enmity with him, lay nearest to his heart.
          Church of God, your mission is not to the respectable few who will
          gather about your ministers to listen respectfully to their words;
          your mission is not to the 'lite and the eclectic, the intelligent who
          will criticise your words and pass judgment upon every syllable of
          your teaching; your mission is not to those who treat you kindly,
          generously, affectionately, not to these I mean alone, though
          certainly to these as among the rest; but your great errand is to the
          harlot, to the thief, to the swearer and the drunkard, to the most
          depraved and debauched. If no one else cares for these, the church
          always must, and if there be any who are first in her prayers it
          should be these who alas! are generally last in our thoughts. The
          ignorant we ought diligently to consider. It is not enough for the
          preacher that he preaches so that those instructed from their youth up
          can understand him; he must think of those to whom the commonest
          phrases of theological truth are as meaningless as the jargon of an
          unknown tongue; he must preach so as to reach the meanest
          comprehension; and if the ignorant may come not to hear him, he must
          use such means as best he may to induce them, nay, compel them to hear
          the good news. The gospel is meant also for those who persecute
          religion; it aims its arrows of love against the hearts of his foes.
          If there be any whom we should first seek to bring to Jesus, it should
          be just these who are the farthest off and the most opposed to the
          gospel of Christ. "Father, forgive them; if thou dost pardon none
          besides, yet be pleased to forgive them."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, the church should be earnest as Christ was; and if she be so,
          she will be quick to notice any ground of hope in those she deals
          with, quick to observe any plea that she may use with God for their
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          She must be hopeful too, and surely no church ever had a more hopeful
          sphere than the church of this present age. If ignorance be a plea
          with God, look on the heathen at this day -- millions of them never
          heard Messiah's name. Forgive them, great God, indeed they know not
          what they do. If ignorance be some ground for hope, there is hope
          enough in this great city of London, for have we not around us
          hundreds of thousands to whom the simplest truths of the gospel would
          be the greatest novelties? Brethren, it is sad to think that this
          country should still lie under such a pall of ignorance, but the sting
          of so dread a fact is blunted with hope when we read the Saviour's
          prayer aright -- it helps us to hope while we cry, "Forgive them, for
          they know not what they do."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the church's business to seek after the most fallen and the most
          ignorant, and to seek them perseveringly. She should never stay her
          hand from doing good. If the Lord be coming to-morrow, it is no reason
          why you Christian people should not subside into mere talkers and
          readers, meeting together for mutual comfort, and forgetting the
          myriads of perishing souls. If it be true that this world is going to
          pieces in a fortnight, and that Louis Napoleon is the Apocalyptic
          beast, or if it be not true, I care not a fig, it makes no difference
          to my duty, and does not change my service. Let my Lord come when he
          will, while I labour for him I am ready for his appearing. The
          business of the church is still to watch for the salvation of souls.
          If she stood gazing, as modern prophets would have her; if she gave up
          her mission to indulge in speculative interpretations, she might well
          be afraid of her Lord's coming; but if she goes about her work, and
          with incessant toil searches out her Lord's precious jewels, she shall
          not be ashamed when her Bridegroom cometh.
        </p>
        <p>
          My time has been much too short for so vast a subject as I have
          undertaken, but I wish I could speak words that were as loud as
          thunder, with a sense and earnestness as mighty as the lightening. I
          would fain excite every Christian here, and kindle in him a right idea
          of what his work is as a part of Christ's church. My brethren, you
          must not live to yourselves; the accumulation of money, the bringing
          up of your children, the building of houses, the earning of your daily
          bread, all this you may do; but there must be a greater object than
          this if you are to be Christlike, as you should be, since you are
          bought with Jesus' blood. Begin to live for others, make it apparent
          unto all men that you are not yourselves the end-all and be-all of
          your own existence, but that you are spending and being spent, that
          through the good you do to men God may be glorified, and Christ may
          see in you his own image and be satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Time fails me, but the last point was to be a word SUGGESTIVE TO
          THE UNCONVERTED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen attentively to these sentences. I will make them as terse and
          condensed as possible. Some of you here are not saved. Now, some of
          you have been very ignorant, and when you sinned you did not know what
          you did. You knew you were sinners, you knew that, but you did not
          know the far-reaching guilt of sin. You have not been attending the
          house of prayer long, you have not read your Bible, you have not
          Christian parents. Now you are beginning to be anxious about your
          souls. Remember your ignorance does not excuse you, or else Christ
          would not say, "Forgive them;" they must be forgiven, even those that
          know not what they do, hence they are individually guilty; but still
          that ignorance of yours gives you just a little gleam of hope. The
          times of your ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men
          everywhere to repent. Bring forth, therefore, fruits meet for
          repentance. The God whom you have ignorantly forgotten is willing to
          pardon and ready to forgive. The gospel is just this, trust Jesus
          Christ who died for the guilty, and you shall be saved. O may God help
          you to do so this very morning, and you will become new men and new
          women, a change will take place in you equal to a new birth; you will
          be new creatures in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          But ah! My friends, there are some here for whom even Christ himself
          could not pray this prayer, in the widest sense at any rate, "Father,
          forgive them; for they know not what they do," for you have known what
          you did, and every sermon you hear, and especially every impression
          that is made upon your understanding and conscience by the gospel,
          adds to your responsibility, and takes away from you the excuse of not
          knowing what you do. Ah! Sirs, you know that there is the world and
          Christ, and that you cannot have both. You know that there is sin and
          God, and that you cannot serve both. You know that there are the
          pleasure of evil and the pleasures of heaven, and that you cannot have
          both. Oh! In the light which God has given you, may his Spirit also
          come and help you to choose that which true wisdom would make you
          choose. Decide to-day for God, for Christ, for heaven. The Lord decide
          you for his name's sake. Amen.
