        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1015)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, October 15th, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"But one thing is needful." -- Luke 10:42.</p>
        <p>
          WE HAVE no difficulty whatever in deciding what the one thing is. We
          are not allowed to say that it is the Saviour, for he is not a thing;
          and we are not permitted to say that it is attention to our own
          salvation, for although that would be true, it is not mentioned in the
          context. The one thing needful evidently is that which Mary chose --
          that good part which should not be taken away from her. Very clearly
          this was to sit at Jesus' feet and hear his word. This and nothing
          less, this and nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mere posture of sitting down and listening to the Saviour's word
          was nothing in itself: it was that which it indicated. It indicated,
          in Mary's case, a readiness to believe what the Saviour taught, to
          accept and to obey -- nay to delight in, the precepts which fell from
          his lips. And this is the one thing needful -- absolutely needful; for
          no rebel can enter the kingdom of heaven with the weapons of rebellion
          in his hands. We cannot know Christ while we resist Christ: we must be
          reconciled to his gentle sway, and confess that he is Lord, to the
          glory of God the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sit at Jesus' feet implies faith as well as submission. Mary
          believed in what Jesus said, and, therefore, sat there to be taught by
          him. It is absolutely necessary that we have faith in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, in his power as God and man, in his death as being expiatory,
          in his crucifixion as being a sacrifice for our sins. We must trust
          him for time and eternity, in all his relationships as Prophet,
          Priest, and King. We must rely on him; he must be our hope, our
          salvation, our all in all. This one thing is absolutely necessary:
          without it we are undone. A believing submission, and a submissive
          faith in Jesus we must have, or perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          But sitting at Jesus' feet implies, also, that having submitted and
          believed, we now desire to be his disciples. Discipleship is too often
          forgotten; it is as needful as faith. We are to go into all the world
          and disciple all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
          the Son and of the Holy Ghost. A man cannot be saved unless he has
          become a learner in the school of Christ, and a learner, too, in a
          practical sense, being willing to practice what he learns. Only he who
          does the Master's will knows his doctrines. We are, if we have chosen
          the good part, sitters at the feet of Jesus, just as Saul of Tarsus
          sat at the feet of Gamaliel; Christ is to us our great Instructor, and
          we take the law from his lips. The believer's position is that of a
          pupil, and the Lord Jesus is his teacher. Except we be converted and
          become as little children, we can in no wise enter the kingdom of
          heaven. Sitting at the feet of Jesus indicates the child-like spirit
          of true discipleship; and this is the one thing needful: there is no
          salvation apart from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It meant, also, service, for though Mary was not apparently engaged in
          waiting upon Christ as Martha was, yet she was, in very truth,
          ministering unto him in a deeper and truer sense. No one gives greater
          joy to a public speaker than an attentive listener; no one serves a
          teacher better than he who is an apt and attentive scholar. The first
          duty, indeed, of the student to the tutor is that he be cheerful in
          accepting, and diligent in retaining, what is taught: in this sense,
          Mary was really waiting upon Christ in one of his loftiest capacities,
          namely -- that of a teacher and prophet in the midst of Israel. In
          that same spirit, had the Master only intimated it, she would have
          risen to wash his feet, or anoint his head, or wait at table, as
          Martha did; but she would, while she was performing these active
          duties, have continued spiritually in her first posture; she could
          not, of course, have continued literally sitting at the feet of the
          Saviour, but her heart would have remained in the condition which that
          posture indicates. She was in the fittest position for service, for
          she waited to hear what her Lord would have her to do. We must all be
          servants, too; as we have been servants of unrighteousness, we must by
          grace submit ourselves unto the rules of Jesus, and become servants of
          righteousness, or, else, we miss the one thing that is indispensable
          for entrance into heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sitting at the feet of Jesus, also, signifies love. She would not have
          been sitting there at ease and happy in mind, if she had not loved
          him. There was a charm in the very tone of his words to her. She knew
          how he had loved her, and, therefore, each syllable was music to her
          soul. She looked up again and again, I doubt not, into that dear face,
          and often caught the meaning of the words more readily as she read his
          countenance, marked his eyes ofttimes suffused with tears, and ever
          bright with holy sympathy. Her love to his person made her a willing
          learner, and we must be the same. We must not learn of Christ like
          unwilling truant boys, who go to school and must needs have learning
          flogged into them; we must be eager to learn; we must open our mouth
          wide that he may fill it, like the thirsty earth when it needs the
          shower, our soul must break for the longing it hath towards his
          commandments at all times. We must rejoice in his statutes more than
          gold, yea, than much fine gold. When we are moved by this spirit, we
          have found the one thing needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having laid before you the meaning of the text, that to sit at Jesus'
          feet is the one thing necessary, for a literal translation of the text
          would be -- "of one thing there is a necessity;" let us take the text
          as it stands and notice in it four things. The first is a word of
          consideration: the disjunctive conjunction, "but." The Saviour bids us
          to make a pause. He says, "but one thing is needful." Then there comes
          a word of necessity:"one thing is needful." thirdly, a word of
          concentration: "one thing is needful;" and then a word of
          immediateness "one thing is needful -- needful now, at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. -- To begin, then, here is a word of CONSIDERATION, which, as I
          have already said, is interjected into the middle of our Lord's brief
          word to Martha. Martha is very busy; she is rather quick tempered
          also, and so she speaks to the Saviour somewhat shortly; and the
          Master says, "Martha, Martha," -- very tenderly, kindly, gently, with
          only the slightest tinge of rebuke in his tone -- "Martha, Martha,
          thou art careful and troubled about many things -- but, but, but, but,
          but, wait a while and hear." That wise and warning but may be very
          useful to many here. You are engaged to-day in business; very diligent
          you are in it. You throw your whole energy into your trading, as you
          must, if you would succeed. You rise up wearily, and you sit up late.
          Shall I say a word that should discourage your industry? I will not;
          but, but is there nothing else? -- is this life all? Is making money
          everything? Is wealth worth gaining merely for the sake of having it
          said, "He died worth fifty thousand pounds?" Is it so?
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, you are a very hard-working man. You have very little rest
          during the week, and in order to bring up your family comfortably, you
          strain every nerve; you live as you should, economically, and you work
          diligently; from morning to night the thought with you is, "How shall
          I fill these many little mouths? How shall I bring them up properly?
          How shall I, as a working man, pay my way?" Very right; I wish all
          working men would be equally thoughtful and economical, and that there
          were fewer of those foolish spendthrifts who waste their substance
          when they have it, and who, the moment there is a frost, or they are
          out of employ, become paupers, loafing upon the charity of others. I
          commend your industry, but, but, but, at the same time, is that all?
          Were you made only to be a machine for digging holes, laying bricks,
          or cutting out pieces of wood? Were you created only to stand at a
          counter and measure or weigh out goods? do you think your God made you
          for that and that only? Is this the chief end of man -- to earn
          shillings a week, and try to make ends meet therewith? is that all
          immortal men were made for? As an animal like a dog, nor a machine
          like a steam engine, can you stand up and look at yourself, and say,
          "I believe I am perfectly fulfilling my destiny"? I beg this morning
          to interject that quiet "but," right into the middle of your busy
          life, and ask from you space for consideration, a pause for the voice
          of wisdom, that a hearing may be granted her. Business? Labour? Yes,
          but there is a higher bread to be earned, and there is a higher life
          to be considered. Hence the Lord puts it, "Labour not for the meat
          that perisheth," that is to say, not for that first and foremost; "but
          for that which endureth unto life eternal." God hath made man that he
          may glorify him; and whatever else man accomplishes, if he fail to
          reach that end, and make eternal shipwreck, unless he comes to sit at
          Jesus' feet; there and there only can he learn how to sanctify his
          business and to consecrate his labour, and so bring forth unto God;
          through his grace, that which is due to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I have spoken thus to the busy, but I might speak, and I should
          have certainly as good a claim to do so, to those who are lovers of
          pleasure. They are not cumbered with much serving; rather, they laugh
          at those who cumber themselves about anything. They are merry as the
          birds, their life is as the flight of a butterfly, which lightly
          floats from flower to flower, according to its own sweet will; with
          neither comb to make, nor hive to guard. Now, thou gay young man, what
          doth solomon say to thee? "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let
          thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth; but" -- there comes in
          a pause, and the cool hand of wisdom is laid upon the hot brow of
          folly, and the youth is asked to think awhile -- "but know thou, that
          for all these things, God will bring thee into judgement." It cannot
          be that an immortal spirit was made of frivolities; a soul immortal
          spending all her fires on the playthings of the world, "resembles
          ocean into tempest toss'd, to waft a feather, or to drown a fly." So
          great a thing as an immortal soul could not have been made by God with
          no higher object than to spend itself upon trifles light as air. Oh,
          pause a while, thou careless, godless one, and hear the voice that
          saith unto thee, "but." There is something more than the fool's hell;
          and should not life be? The charms of music, the merriment of the gay
          assembly, the beauties of art, and the delights of banqueting -- there
          must be something more for thee than these; and something more must be
          required of thee than that thou shouldst waste from morn to night thy
          precious time upon nothing but to please thyself. Stop, stop, and let
          this admonitory "but" sound in thine ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          I take liberty, moreover, to address the same word to religious
          people, who, perhaps, need it as much as the others. They will, of
          course, agree with anything I can say about the mere worldling or the
          profligate; but, will they listen to me when I say to them, "You are
          very diligent in your religion, you are attentive to all its outward
          rites and ceremonies, you believe the articles of your church, you
          practice the ceremonies ordained by its rulers; but, but, do you know
          that all this is nothing , unless you sit at Jesus' feet?" we may do
          what the church tells us, and never do what Christ tells us, for these
          may be different things; and the church is not our Saviour, but
          Christ. We may believe what a certain creed tells us, but not believe
          what Jesus teaches; for our creed and Christ may be two very different
          things. Ay, and we may believe even what the Bible itself teaches to
          us, or think we believe it; but, if our heart has never made
          submission to the Teacher himself, so as to sit at his feet, and
          receive the truth obediently from him, our religion is altogether
          vain. Traditional religion is not submission to Christ, but to custom.
          Obedience to a denomination is not obedience to Jesus himself. How I
          wish that all professing Christians would bring themselves to an
          examination and enquire, "Do I really believe in the person of my
          Lord, and accept him as my Teacher? Do I study the Word of God to
          learn the truth from him, and not accept it blindly and at second hand
          from my minister, or my parents, or the church of the nation, or the
          creed of my family?" We go to Jesus for teaching, desiring in our
          hearts to be taught by his book and his Spirit, cheerfully agreeing in
          all things to shape our faith to his declaration, and our life to his
          rule. For us, there must be no spiritual law-giver, and no infallible
          Rabbi, but the Blessed One, whom Magdalene called "Rabboni," and whom
          Thomas saluted as, "My Lord and my God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, and let me say, even to those of you who can honestly declare
          that Christ is your sole confidence, it is possible for you to forget
          the necessity of sitting at his feet. You, dear brethren, are looking
          to his precious blood alone for your salvation, and his name is sweet
          to you, and you desire all things to be conformed to his will. So far
          it is well with you, for in this you have a measure of sitting at his
          feet; but so had Martha; she loved her Lord, and she knew his word,
          and she was a saved soul, for "Jesus loved Mary, and Martha, and
          lazarus;" but you have not perhaps so much of this needful thing as
          Mary had, and as you ought to have. You have been very busy this week,
          and have been drifted from your moorings; you have not lived with your
          Lord in conscious fellowship; you have been full of care and empty of
          prayer; you have not committed your sorrows to your loving friend; you
          have blundered on in duty without asking his guidance or assistance,
          you have not maintained, in your Christian service, the communion of
          your spirit with the Well-Beloved, and, if such has been the case, let
          me say "but" to you, and ask you, as you sit here this morning, to
          make a little stop in your Sunday-school teaching or your street
          preaching, or whatever else it is that you are so laudably engaged in,
          and say to yourself: "To me, as a worker, the one thing needful is to
          keep near my Lord, and I must not so suffer the watering of others to
          occupy me, as to neglect my own heart, lest I should have to say woe
          is me, they made me keeper in the vineyards, but my own vineyard have
          I not kept.'" To the saints, as well as to others, the one thing
          needful is to sit at Jesus' feet. We are to be always learners and
          lovers of Jesus. Departure from him, and independence of him, let them
          not once be named among you. It is weakness, sickness, sin, and sorrow
          for a believer to leave his Lord and become either his own leader or
          reliance. We are only safe while we remain humbly and gladly
          subservient to him. You see, then, that this word "but" suggests a
          very useful and salutary pause to us all. May God help us to benefit
          thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, our text speaks of NECESSITY -- one thing is a
          necessity. If this be proven, it overrides all other considerations.
          We are nearly right when we say proverbially, "Necessity has no law."
          If a man steal, and it be found that he was dying of hunger, he is
          always half forgiven, and charity has been known to excuse him
          altogether. Necessity has been frequently accepted as a good excuse
          for what else might not have been tolerated; and when a thing is
          right, and necessity backs it, then indeed the right become
          imperative, and pushes to the front to force its way. Necessity, like
          hunger breaks through stone walls. The text claims for sitting at
          Jesus' feet that it is the first and only necessity. Now, I see all
          around me a crowd of things alluring and fascinating. Pleasure calls
          to me I hear her syren song -- but I reply, "I cannot regard thee, for
          necessity presses upon me to hearken to another voice." Philosophy and
          learning charm me, fain would I yield my heart to them; but, while I
          am yet unsaved, the one thing needful demands my first care, and
          wisdom bids me give it. Not that we love human learning less, but
          eternal wisdom more. Pearls? Yes. Emeralds? Yes; but bread, in God's
          name -- bread at once, when I am starving in the desert! What is the
          use of ingots of gold, or bars of silver, or caskets of jewels, when
          food is wanting? If one thing be needful, it devours, like Aaron's
          rod, all the matters which are merely pleasurable. All the fascinating
          things on earth may go, but the needful things we must have. If you
          are wise, you will evermore prefer the necessary to the dazzling.
        </p>
        <p>
          About us are a thousand things entangling. This world is very much
          like the pools we have heard of in India, in which grows a long grass
          of so clinging a character that, if a man once falls into the water,
          it is almost certain to be his death, for only with the utmost
          difficulty could he be rescued from the meshes of the deadly, weedy
          net, which immediately wraps itself around him. This world is even
          thus entangling. All the efforts of grace are needed to preserve men
          from being ensnared with the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of
          this life. The ledger demands you, the day-book wants you, the shop
          requires you, the warehouse bell rings for you; the theater invites,
          the ball-room calls: you must live, you say, and you must have a
          little enjoyment, and , consequently, you give your heart to the
          world. These things, I say, are very entangling; but we must be
          disentangled from them, for we cannot afford to lose our souls. "What
          shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own
          soul?" If a ship is going down, and a passenger has his gold in a bag
          about him, and he has upon him a costly cloak, see how he acts. Off
          goes the garment when he knows that he cannot possibly swim with it
          upon him. No matter though it be lined with miniver and be made of
          costliest stuff, off he throws it; and, as for his bag of treasure,
          with many a regret he flings them down upon the deck, for his life is
          dearer than they. If he may but save his life, he is willing to lose
          all beside. Oh sirs! for the one thing needful, all entangling things
          must be give up. You must lay aside every weight, and the sin that
          doth so easily beset you, if by any means the one thing needful may be
          yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many things very puzzling, and some people have a strange
          delight in being bewildered. It is astonishing the many letters I
          receive and interviews I am asked to give, in order to adjust in
          people's minds the doctrine of predestination and the fact of free
          agency; and equally remarkable is the way in which young people, and
          old people too, will pick out extremely difficult texts, perhaps
          relating to the Second Advent, or to the battle of Armageddon, and
          they must needs have these opened up to them before they will believe
          the gospel. I think it utterly useless to begin upon such things with
          those who are unsaved. One thing is needful, sir, and that is by no
          means a puzzling matter; it is plainly this, that thou submit thyself
          to Jesus Christ and sit at his feet. That is needful: as for the
          doctrines of election and the second advent, they are important, but
          they are neither the most essential nor the most pressing. The one
          thing needful for a seeking soul is that it receives Jesus and become
          submissive to him, sitting as a disciple at his feet and as a servant
          doing his will. It is true there is the ninth chapter of Romans in the
          Bible, and a precious chapter it is: but the seeking sinner should
          take care to read first the third chapter of John, and till he has
          mastered that, he had better let the Romans alone. Go first to the
          business which concerns your salvation; attend to that, and when all
          is right with you, then, at Jesus' feet, you will be in the best
          possible position to learn all that can be learned of the higher
          mysteries and the deeper truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, there is much that is desirable, very desirable -- desirable
          in the highest spiritual sense; but it must be second to that which is
          needful. If I read the experience of men who have known their own
          hearts and mourned before the Lord, I wish that I had as deep a sense
          of sin as they had; or, I read the story of saints who have lived the
          angelic life, and even here on earth have dwelt with Christ and walked
          the golden streets in fellowship with him, I wish I could rise to all
          their heights; but for all that, if my soul is still polluted with
          sin, for me the one thing needful is cleansing by the Redeemer's
          blood; I must at once believingly yield to Jesus, for this is of
          necessity, and the desirable things will come to me afterwards, if I
          sit down at Jesus' feet. So near the source of all good things, it
          will be easy to be enriched with all knowledge and grace, but our
          first business is to get there, and by the Holy Spirit's blessing we
          may come there without either the deep experience or the elevated
          feelings we have described; we may come just as we are, all guilty and
          lost, and submit ourselves to the Saviour. Having done that, we are in
          the best position for spiritual attainments -- yea, they shall surely
          be ours. Let the heart yield itself to our sole reliance and sure
          confidence, it is well with us: we have all that is needful, and the
          pledge of all that is desirable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tell us it is a necessity, and everything else must give way:
          necessity overrules all else. Now, what is it that sitting at Jesus'
          feet is a necessity? It is so, because it is needful for us to have
          our sins forgiven; but Jesus will never forgive the unhumbled rebel.
          If he will not take Jesus to be a Master, the sinner cannot have him
          to be a Saviour. As long as we rebel against him, we cannot be saved
          by him. Submission, by repentance and faith, we must have, or our
          transgressions will remain upon us to our everlasting ruin. It is
          necessary, because we must have our inbred sins overcome; but none can
          stay corruption in a many but Christ, who has come to destroy the work
          of the devil, and to save his people from their sins. Jesus, the seed
          of the woman, is the only power that can crush the serpent's head.
          Only at the feet of Jesus can the divine power be gained which works
          in us holiness and sanctifies us practically; therefore, as you must
          be purified or you cannot enter heaven, you must come to Jesus' feet.
          Moreover, it is at the feet of Jesus that the soul's ignorance is
          removed; and since ignorance concerning ourselves and our God must be
          taken from us, we must be taught of him. God is "our light and our
          salvation;" our light first, and our salvation in consequence. We must
          have the light. The spiritually blind man cannot enter heaven, he must
          have his eyes opened, but Jesus alone can work that miracle of grace.
          Neither can we receive true light except from him, for he is "the true
          light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;" none are
          ever enlightened, except by him. "In him is light -- all light; and
          the light is the light of men." As God is the mind of the world, he
          who has not God is demented; and as Christ is the light of the world,
          he that believes not in him abideth in darkness even until now. We
          must come, then, and yield ourselves unreservedly to Jesus,
          worshipping him, trusting him, and obeying him -- in a word, we must
          sit at his feet, and hear his word; otherwise, we shall abide in
          darkness and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to enter heaven, it is necessary that our nature should
          become like the nature of Christ. This earth is for those who bear the
          image of the first Adam; but the new heaven and the new earth are for
          those who bear the image of the second Adam.. We must, by some means,
          acquire the nature of the second and heavenly Adam, and this must be
          wrought in us by regeneration, and developed by acquaintance with him.
          By sitting at his feet, and beholding him, we become changed into the
          same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord. If
          we reject the Lord Jesus as our trust, teacher, and exemplar, we have
          no new life, we are not new creatures in Christ,m and we can never be
          admitted within the holy gates where those alone dwell who are
          fashioned after his likeness. We must, then, sit at his feet; it is
          absolutely necessary, and, without it, our whole life will be a
          complete failure; we may make money, but we shall lose our souls; we
          may gain honour, but shall have come short of the glory of God; we may
          enjoy pleasure, but we shall forfeit the pleasure which are at God's
          right hand for evermore; we may have done our country some service,
          but to our God, and the higher country, we shall have rendered no
          service, for we cannot serve God if we will not obey Christ. "He that
          honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent him."
          This life is a blank, a long rebellion, to the man who submits not to
          Jesus, and the life for ever hereafter will be darkness and confusion;
          as darkness itself, a land of sorrow, and of weeping, and of wailing,
          and of gnashing of teeth, a land of despair, upon which no star shall
          ever shine, or sun shall ever rise. Woe, woe, woe, woe to the Godless,
          Christless spirit that passeth across the river of death without a
          hope. Woe, woe, woe, woe eternally to the soul that will not sit at
          the feet of Jesus! he shall be trodden beneath his feet in his anger,
          and crushed in his hot displeasure. God grant that may never be our
          portion. To sit at Jesus' feet is the one thing needful then.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, brethren, let me just say, and leave this point, it is needful to
          every one of you. It is not some of us who must be there, but all. The
          wisest must become fools to learn of him, or fools they are; the most
          educated and cultured mind must submit to this further culture, or
          else it is nothing but a barren waste in his sight. One thing is a
          necessity to you all, high or low, rich or poor, queen or beggar --
          you must sit at Jesus' feet; and all alike must accept his teaching,
          or you know nothing that can save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some things in this world are necessary, after a measure, but this is
          necessary without measure; infinitely needful is it that you sit at
          Jesus' feet, needful now, needful in life; needful in life for peace,
          in death for rest, and in eternity for bliss. This is needful always.
          Many things have their uses for youth, others come not into value till
          old age; but one thing, the one thing, is needful for childhood, and
          needful for palsied age; it is needful for the ruddy cheek, and the
          active limb, and needful everywhere and always. In the highest and
          most emphatic sense, "one thing is needful."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thus much about the necessity, the next word is CONCENTRATION:
          "One thing is needful." I am glad it says "one thing," because a
          division of ends and objects is always weakening. A man cannot follow
          two things well. Our life-flood suffices not to fill two streams or
          three; there is only enough water, as it were, in our life's brooklet,
          to turn one wheel. It is a great pity when a man fritters away his
          energies by being "everything by turns, and nothing long;" trying all
          things, and mastering nothing. Oh soul, it is well for thee that there
          is only one thing in this world that is absolutely necessary, give thy
          whole soul to that. If other things are necessary in a secondary
          place, "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
          these shall be added unto you."
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing is needful, and this is well arranged, for we cannot follow
          two things. If Christ be one of them, we cannot follow another. Is it
          not written, "No man can serve two masters, either he will hate the
          one and love the other, or cleave to the one and despise the other. Ye
          cannot serve God and mammon." Not only would it be very weakening to
          you to attempt to serve both, but it is absolutely impossible that you
          should do so. Jesus Christ is a monopolizer of human hearts, he will
          never accept a portion of our manhood. He bought us altogether, and he
          will have the whole of our personality. Christ must be everything, or
          he will be nothing. He does not love Christ who loves anything as well
          as Christ, neither does he trust him who trusts in anything besides.
          Christ must reign alone. "Jesus only," must be the motto of our
          spirits. It is well for us, therefore, that only one thing is
          necessary, for only one thing is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an unspeakable mercy that the one thing needful is a very simple
          one. Little child, thou couldst not climb the mountain, but thou canst
          sit down at Jesus' feet; thou canst not understand hard doctrine, but
          thou canst love him who said, "Suffer the little children to come unto
          me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
          Unlearned man, thou who hast no time to acquire earthly lore, if the
          one thing needful were something that belonged only to the learned,
          alas for thee; but if thou canst not teach, it is not needful that
          thou shouldst, it is only needful that thou shouldst learn. Take the
          Incarnate Wisdom to be thy Master, and sit as a little child at his
          feet to learn with all thine heart. That is all he asks of thee. Men
          will have it that they must do something to be saved. They must fret
          and worry like Martha, but after all, the right way is to end your
          doing and fretting by sitting down content with Jesus' doing,
          satisfied with his righteousness and with the merit of his precious
          blood. The one thing needful is very easy, except to proud hearts,
          which cannot brook to accept everything gratis, and to be beholden to
          sovereign mercy. To the poor in spirit it is not only simple but sweet
          to sit at Jesus' feet. I would be nothing but what he makes me, I
          would have nothing but what he gives me, I would ask nothing but what
          he promises me, I would trust in nothing but what he has done for me,
          and I would desire nothing but what he has prepared for me. To sit at
          Jesus's feet in humble submission and quiet rest, he the master and I
          the little child, I the vessel waiting to be filled, and he my
          fulness, I the mown grass, and he the falling dew, I the rain drop,
          and he the sun that makes me glisten in life with diamond brilliance,
          and then exhales me in death to be absorbed in him; this is all in all
          to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us remark that, though this is only one thing, and so
          concentrated, yet it is also comprehensive and contains many things.
          Imagine not that to sit at Jesus' feet is a very small, unmeaning
          thing. It means peace, for they who submit to Jesus find peace through
          his precious blood. It means holiness, for those who learn of Jesus
          learn no sin, but are instructed in things lovely and of good repute.
          It means strength, for they that sit with Jesus, and feed upon him,
          are girded with his strength; the joy of the Lord is their strength.
          It means wisdom, for they that learn of the Son of God understand more
          than the ancients because they keep his statutes. It means zeal, for
          the love of Christ fires hearts that live upon it, and they that are
          much with Jesus become like Jesus, so that the zeal of the Lord's
          house eats them up. If we say that in an army the one thing needful is
          loyalty to the sovereign, we know what that means; for the loyal
          solider will be sure to be obedient to his officers, and if attached
          to his queen, he will be brave in the day of battle, and do his duty
          well. If we said that the one thing needful in a family was love, we
          should not have required a small thing; for love will place husband
          and wife in their true position; love will produce obedience in
          children, and diligence in servants. Let love permeate everything, and
          other virtues will grow out of it, as flowers spring from the soil. So
          when we say that sitting at Jesus' feet is the one thing needful,m we
          have not uttered a mere truism: it comprehends a world of blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here would I address a word to the church of God in this country
          at this present time. She, too, is as Martha, cumbered with much
          serving. It were her wisdom, and her strength, if she would become
          more like Mary, and sit at Jesus' feet. Just now we need revival. Oh
          that God would send it! Oh for a mighty flood of spiritual influences,
          that would bear the stranded churches right out into a sea of
          usefulness. But how can we get revival? We shall have it, brethren,
          when we commune with Christ. When the saints habitually sit at Jesus'
          feet they will be revived, and of necessity the revival will spread
          from them, and the hearts of sinners will be touched.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is great talk now-a-days of union; the walls of the various
          churches are to be broken down, and the denominations are to be
          blended. Think not of it in such a fashion; the only union possible,
          or desirable, is that we all unite to sit at Jesus' feet. It is not
          allowable that we concede one truth and you another; that is not
          natural charity, but common treason to Christ. We have no right to
          yield an atom of the truth of God, under the pretence of charity.
          Truth is no property of ours; we are only God's stewards, and it
          behooves us to be faithful to our trust. Neither one church nor
          another has any right to bate its testimony one jot, if it be true. To
          alter the statute-book of Christ is blasphemy. True union will come
          when all the churches learn of Christ, for Christ does not teach two
          things opposed to each other. There are not two baptisms in the Bible;
          we shall not find two sets of dogmas diametrically opposite to each
          other. If we give up the various things that are of man, and hold fast
          each of us only that which is of God, we shall be united in principle
          and in doctrine; and "One Lord, one faith, one baptism" will once
          again be emblazoned upon the banners of the church of God. Sit at
          Jesus' feet, O thou church of Christ, and true unity will come to
          thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hear a great deal about the necessity of controversy. We ought to
          be ready to answer all that infidels object, so wise men say. Every
          absurdity of every fool we are to sit down and reply to, and when this
          labour of Hercules is accomplished, we are to begin again, for by that
          time new whimsies will be in men's brains, and new lies will have been
          begotten. Is this so? Am I to do nothing in winning souls and
          glorifying God, but to spend all my time in finding wind for the
          nostrils of the wild asses of the desert? Well, let those do it who
          please, we believe that the settlement of all controversy in the
          church and for the church would come from the Lord himself, if we
          believed more fully in him, and waited more upon him for guidance, and
          if we preached the gospel more in his own strength, and in his own
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, as for missions: we appoint our committees, we amend our plans,
          and suggest schemes.. All very well and good; but missions will never
          flourish till the church, with regard to missions, sits at Jesus'
          feet. She will never convert the heathen in her own way: God will give
          success only when we work in his way. It may be very useful to make
          translations, and exceedingly beneficial to keep schools; but if I
          read my Bible right, it is not Christ's way. "Go ye into all the
          world, and preach the gospel to every creature," is the law of Jesus
          Christ, and when the church everywhere, at home and abroad, takes more
          earnestly to preaching, when the testimony of the truth is perpetual
          and incessant, in simple language, and popular speech, then Christ the
          Lord will look upon the church that, like Mary,sits at his feet, and
          say "Thou hast done thy part," and blessing shall follow. "Thy work is
          done, and I will give thee thy reward."
        </p>
        <p>
          For us all, beloved, saints and sinners, one thing is needful: that we
          always sit, like Mary, at the Master's feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The last word is IMMEDIATENESS, and there is no need that we say
          much upon it. One thing is a necessity, a necessity not of the future
          only, but of to-day. It is not written, "it shall be needful," on
          certain coming days, to sit at Jesus's feet; but it is so now. Young
          man, one thing is necessary to you while yet young; do not postpone it
          till advanced years. Christian, it is needful for thee to-day to have
          communion with Christ; do not think of it as indispensable to-morrow
          or to-night at the communion table; it is needful now. There are
          dangers thou canst not see, which can only be warded off by present
          and immediate fellowship with Christ. "One thing is needful." It is
          not that it was needful in the past, indeed it was so; but it is
          needful now. It was needful for me in the days of my sinfulness to
          submit to Christ, it is equally needful for me now. However much you
          advance, O believer, you never advance beyond this; whatever your
          experience, or your information, or your ripeness for glory, it is
          needful still to sit at Jesus' feet. You shall never get into a higher
          class in the school of wisdom than is the class which Christ teaches;
          his is the infant class in the school, but it is the highest class
          also. It is always needful, every moment needful, that we sit at
          Jesus' feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is needful, I have already said, to the sinner. Life, and health,
          and peace will come to him when he becomes a disciple of the
          Crucified. Would God that he might be made so this very morning. There
          is life in a look at the Crucified One. To depend entirely upon the
          sinner's Saviour is the sinner's salvation. God bring you to his feet,
          dear hearers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is equally needful for the saint. Covered with the fruits of
          righteousness, his root must still cling to the riven rock. You must
          never imagine, whatever you have done or whatever you have attained,
          that you are to leave Mary's seat; still must you abide there.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the one thing needful for the backslider. If you have fallen
          never so much, you will rise again if you come to the Master
          submissively and abide with him. It was the mark of the man who had
          the devil cast out of him, that he was clothed and in his right mind,
          sitting at the feet of Jesus; it shall show that you, too, are
          restored when you learn of your Lord. A seat at Jesus' feet is the
          place for all Christians to die in, they shall sleep sweetly with
          their heads in Jesus' bosom: it is the place for them to live in, for
          joy and bliss are there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I desire for myself never again to be worried with the cares
          of this church, but to take them all to my Master, and wait at his
          feet. I desire not to be troubled about my preaching, nor to be
          cumbered about anything beneath the sun, but to leave all these, as he
          would have me leave them, in his hands. You who are working in the
          classes, in the school, or anywhere else, I pray you look well to your
          fellowship with Jesus. You cannot slay the enemy by throwing away your
          sword, and nearness to Christ is your battle-axe and weapons of war;
          you have lost your power when you have left your Lord. One thing is
          needful -- let the rest go. What if we have not learning? -- what if
          we have not eloquence? If we live near to Christ, we have something
          better than all these; if we abide in him, and he abides in us, we
          shall go and bring forth fruit, and our fruit shall remain; if he
          abides in us, we shall enjoy heaven on earth, and be daily preparing
          of that eternal heaven which is to be our portion. "One thing is
          needful." God grant it to every one of us! -- Amen.
