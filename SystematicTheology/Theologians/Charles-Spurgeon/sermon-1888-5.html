        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2026)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-day, June 3rd, 1888, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
          not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.| --
          Exodus 6:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          LITTLE WORDS OFTEN CONTAIN great meanings. It is often the case with
          that monosyllable |so.| In the present instance we must lay stress
          upon it and read the text thus -- |Moses spake so unto the children of
          Israel.| That is, he said what God told him to say. He did not invent
          his message. He did not think out the gospel that he had to carry to
          the people. He was simply a repeater of the divine message. As he
          received it, so he spake it. |Moses spake as unto the children of
          Israel.| If he had not done so, the responsibility must have rested
          upon himself, whether the nation was moved by his words or not; but
          when he was simply God's ambassador, saying only what God would have
          him say, his responsibility was limited. If he delivered the Lord's
          own word and it failed to win the heart of Israel, he could not be
          blamed. Although it was a great sadness of heart to him that the
          people did not, and even could not, receive the divine message, yet as
          far as he was concerned, his conscience was clear. It is ever so with
          the preacher of the gospel: if he declares the word of the Lord as he
          has received it, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear,
          he is clear before God, whatever his hearers may do or may not do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I often wonder what those preachers do who feel called to make up
          their message as they go on; for if they fail, their failure must be
          attributed in great measure to their want of ability to make up a
          moving tale. They have to spread their sails to the breeze of the age,
          and to pick up a gospel that comes floating down to them on the stream
          of time, altering every week in the year; and they must have an
          endless task to catch this new idea, or, as they put it, to keep
          abreast of the age. Unless, indeed, like chameleons, they have a
          natural aptitude to change colour, they must have a worrying time of
          it, and a horrible amount of shifting to get through. When they have
          done their best to preach this gospel of their own, then they are
          accountable for having made that gospel. For every bit of its teaching
          they are accountable, because they were the manufacturers of it, and
          it came forth from their foundry, bearing their stamp. If they take
          this yoke upon them, and so refuse to learn of Christ, they will find
          no rest to their souls. To me the preaching of the Lord's own gospel
          is a joy and a privilege; for notwithstanding that concern for your
          souls loads me with the burden of the Lord, it is his burden, and not
          one which I have selected for myself. I often feel on a Sabbath night
          when I go home weary: |I know that I have preached what I believe to
          be God's gospel.| I have not said anything -- I have not intended to
          say anything that was my own. I have not left out, at least, I have
          not intended to leave out anything that was in the text, nor anything
          which I believe to be the teaching of the gospel of Christ. And then
          if you do not receive it, that is a sorrowful business, but it is no
          concern of mine so that I shall have to answer for it at the last
          great day. When a man-servant goes to the door with a message from his
          master, if you do not like what he tells you, do not be angry with
          him. What has he to do with it? Has he said what his master told him
          to say? If he has, then be angry with his master if you must be, or
          accept what his master says if you think fit; but let the poor man
          that brought the message be held clear if he has faithfully reported
          his master's words. I claim that, if I have preached my Master's
          gospel, whether men are saved or lost, whether they accept it or
          reject it, I must leave that with themselves, and not have their sin
          laid at my door. How heartily do I cry to God that the Word may not be
          a savour of death unto death, but a savour of life unto life; but oh,
          my hearers, if you perish after hearing the gospel of God, do not
          think that you can cast the blame on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the message Moses brought was rejected, and he knew why it was
          rejected. He could see the reason. The people were in such bondage,
          they were so miserably ground down, they were so unhappy and hopeless,
          that what he spake seemed to them to be as idle words. There are
          hundreds of reasons why men reject the gospel. We will not go into
          them to-night. He that wants to beat a dog can always find a stick,
          and he that wishes to reject Christ can always find a reason for it;
          and, however unreasonable a reason may be, it will serve a sinner's
          turn, when that turn happens to be the making of some excuse for
          himself why he should not yield to the Saviour. Oh that men were less
          cunning in making apologies for refusing the Lord Jesus!
        </p>
        <p>
          Amongst all the reasons, however, that I ever heard, that with which I
          have the most sympathy, is this one -- that some cannot receive Christ
          because they are so full of anguish, and are so crushed in spirit that
          they cannot find strength enough of mind to entertain a hope that by
          any possibility salvation can come to them. It is to their sad case
          that I desire to speak. I think that I can speak to the case, if God
          help me, for I have felt the same. I do remember when I could not
          believe even Jesus himself by reason of sore anguish and straitness of
          spirit; and, therefore, as one who has worn the chains, I speak to
          those who are still in chains. I know the clanking of those fetters,
          and what it is to feel the damp of the stone walls, and to fear that
          there is no coming out of prison, and to be so despairing that even
          when the emancipator turned the great key in the lock, and set the
          door wide open, yet still my heart had made for itself a direr cage,
          and I could not believe in the possibility of liberty, and therefore I
          sat bound in a dungeon of my own creation. Ah! there is no Bastille so
          awful as that which is built by despair, and kept under the custody of
          a crushed spirit. Many are the desponding ones whose eyes fail so that
          they cannot look up, or look out. To such I speak. May God speak
          through me by the Holy Spirit, the Comforter!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And first, will you notice that what Moses brought to these people
          was glad tidings. IT WAS A FREE AND FULL GOSPEL MESSAGE. To them it
          was the gospel of salvation from a cruel bondage, the gospel of hope,
          the gospel of glorious promise. It is a very admirable type and
          metaphorical description of what the gospel is to us. Moses' word to
          them was singularly clear, cheering, and comforting; but they could
          not receive it. |They hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit
          and cruel bondage.|
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Moses spoke to them about their God. He said, |You have a God,
          and his name is Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
          of Isaac, and of Jacob.| They looked up from their bricks, and they
          seemed to say, |God? What have we to do with him? Oh, that the straw
          were given us to make our bricks! We are up to our necks in this
          filthy Nile mud, making the bricks, and you come and talk to us about
          God. Go, and preach to Pharaoh and the taskmasters that rule us; but
          as for us poor creatures, slaves that we are, we do not understand
          you. What do you mean by JAH, Jehovah, our God? Bring us more garlic
          and onions, or lessen our daily tasks, or take away the sticks from
          our drivers, and then we will listen to you.| And so they shook their
          heads, and said that such mysteries and theologies were not for them.
          And yet, dear sirs, if any of you are in such a case, it is for you.
          Jehovah, Israel's God, was indeed their only hope, and he is your only
          hope also. Alas, that they should be so unwise as to refuse to let the
          light shine upon them, for light it was! What a poor reason for
          refusing light because the night is so dark! Man's best hope lies in
          his God. O you whose lives are bitter with toil and want, there is
          something for you after all, much better than the hard saying, |What
          shall we eat, and what shall we drink?| There is an inheritance above
          the grinding toil of every-day life. There is a portion much better
          than this killing care, which frets so many of you and makes life a
          calamity to you. Do not, therefore, because of the heaviness of your
          lot, refuse to hear about God, your Maker, your Benefactor. In that
          direction lies your only real hope. Have this God for a father and a
          friend, and life will wear another aspect, and you will be another
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Moses went on to tell them about a covenant. He said, |You have a
          God, and that God has said, |I have also established my covenant with
          them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage,
          wherein they were strangers.'| Covenant? Why, many of them would
          hardly know what it meant. |Covenant?| said they, |God made a covenant
          with us poor brickmakers, that have to slave from morning to night
          without wage, and now are forced to make bricks without straw?| God
          and a covenant: these are strange words in ears that hear the curses
          of taskmasters and the crack of their whips. It sounded like mockery
          to them to talk of such high matters. I doubt not they muttered to
          themselves, |This Moses is a mad philosopher who has grand mouthfuls
          of words; but what are words to us? A bit of fish out of the Nile, or
          a cumber from the irrigated fields would be a deal better than talking
          to us about a covenant.| And yet, hearken. If any of you are in a sad
          condition, your best hopes may lie this way. What if God has entered
          into covenant with you that he will bless you for Jesus Christ's sake?
          There may be a mint of wealth for the sons of poverty in this
          everlasting covenant; and the best kind of wealth, too. There may be
          for you a promised emancipation which will break the fetters which now
          hold you, and set you free. I tell you that in the covenant of grace
          lies the charter of the poor and needy. At any rate, if you come under
          that covenant it cannot be worse with you than it is now. You seem now
          to be under a covenant of bondage and of sorrow, and any change will
          be for the better. If there be another covenant -- a covenant of
          grace, and love, and peace, and everlasting faithfulness, it were
          worth while to hear about it, and to seek it out until you discover
          whether you have part and lot in it. I entreat you, look into this
          matter. Hearken diligently to the voice of the gospel. Hear, and your
          soul shall live.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, when Moses had spoken of the covenant, he went on to speak yet
          more about God's pity to them. He reported that Jehovah had said, |I
          have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the
          Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.| I fancy
          that those words opened their eyes a little. They looked up and said
          to one another, |Is there, indeed, a God who has heard our groanings?
          Oh, but,| they muttered, |look at the many years we have been
          groaning. Why, it is forty years since this man Moses first came out
          and saw our burdens. Where has he been these forty years? What is the
          use of pity that is so tardy in its movements?| And yet, dear sirs, if
          you are inclined to talk so, it may be that if God be slow he is sure;
          and if he be slow to you it is out of patience and long-suffering to
          others. He knows best when and how to save his people. Remember that
          when the tale of bricks was doubled then Moses came; and when you are
          getting to your very worst, and your night is darkening into a sort of
          hellish midnight, it may be that your darkness is coming to an end.
          Therefore, be not so bowed down as to let the brick-earth get into
          your ears and eyes and make you deaf and blind. But do listen if there
          be anything to be heard that is better than your daily moans and
          groans. Listen to the messenger of God who comes to tell of what God
          is about to do. He is a God full of compassion, and he has respect
          unto broken hearts and tearful eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then Moses went on further with his blessed gospel message to tell
          them about the Lord's resolve to rescue them by a great redemption.
          The Lord had said, |I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under
          the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their
          bondage.| Do you notice that all along the Lord uses strong words, and
          speaks like a great king? |I am Jehovah. I will. I will. I will.| When
          you go home just notice what a number of |I wills| there are in this
          declaration of the great God. When God says, |I will,| he means it;
          depend upon it. He does not ask our leave, or wait for our help. |I
          will| is omnipotence putting itself into speech. Jehovah will
          accomplish what he promises. He told them, therefore, that he meant to
          come to their rescue. |I will bring you out from under the burdens of
          the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will
          redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments.| God
          means to save you. Poor, troubled, confessedly guilty sinner, believe
          in Jesus Christ the Son of God, and trust yourself with him, and the
          Lord will save you. He will deliver you from all the guilt of your
          past life, from the evil habits of your present life, and from the
          temptations of your future life. He will break the yoke of Satan from
          off your neck and make you to be no more the slave of sin, but you
          shall become the child of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses told them about the Lord's ways of grace and the inheritance
          which he had prepared for them. My message is after the same sort.
          Thus saith Jehovah to-night, in the preaching of the gospel to every
          one that will believe in Jesus, |I will save and I will deliver you;
          and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am your God,
          which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I
          will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to
          give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for
          an heritage: I am the Lord.| These are great words, but they come from
          the mouth of the great God, who cannot lie. Wherefore believe them,
          and take heart of hope. God will take you, poor guilty ones, to be his
          children. He will promote you to be his willing servants. He will use
          you for his glory though now you dishonour his name. He will sanctify
          you and cleanse you, and he will bring you to heaven, even you who
          have lien among the pots and have been defiled in the brick-kilns of
          sin. He will never rest till he makes you sit upon his throne with
          him, where he is glorified, world without end. This I speak to you who
          are in bondage. Even as Jesus said of old, so say I in my measure as
          his messenger: |The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because he hath
          sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the
          captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.|
          Believe you in Christ Jesus, and he who has come to save the lost will
          give you as clear and clean a deliverance from the power of sin as
          Jehovah gave Israel deliverance from the power of the Egyptian tyrant.
          He will bring you out of bondage and guide you through the wilderness
          till you come into the eternal rest, even to a goodlier land than
          Canaan, though it flowed with milk and honey.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We come now to note that IT WAS RECEIVED WITH UNBELIEF CAUSED BY
          ANGUISH OF HEART. The message was from the Lord, and it was full of
          hope for them, but they were too much broken down to receive it. We
          can quite understand what that meant. Let us look into the case. They
          could not now receive this gospel because they had at first caught at
          it, and had been disappointed. They were under a misapprehension, for
          they expected to be free at once, as soon as Moses went to Pharaoh;
          and as they did not get immediate relief, they fell back into sullen
          despair. When Moses came to them and said that God had appeared to him
          at the bush, and had sent him to deliver them, they bowed their heads,
          and worshipped. Great things they looked for on the morrow, for they
          were at the end of their patience; but after that, when Moses went in
          unto Pharaoh, and the tyrant doubled their labour by denying them
          straw, then they could not believe in God or in his messenger. In the
          process of salvation it often happens -- I have seen it many time --
          that after persons have come to hear the gospel, after they have, in
          some measure, become attentive to its invitations, they have for a
          season been much more miserable than they were before. Have you never
          noticed, in taking a medicine, how often you are made to feel more
          sick before you are made well? It is often so in the workings of the
          great remedy of divine grace: it discovers to us our disease that we
          may the more heartily accept the heavenly medicine. Yes, and in
          special cases there may be evils within the spiritual system which
          must be thrown out in the flesh, to be made visible, and so to become
          the subjects of repentance and abhorrence. The man who judges with
          shortness and straightness of judgment, demands a remedy that will
          cure his soul of all evils on the spot, and if it does not evidently
          and immediately do this, he cries, |Away with it.| I find that the
          Hebrew word translated |anguish| here signifies shortness. Your
          marginal Bibles have |straitness.| So they could not believe because
          of the shortness of their judgment: they measured God by inches. They
          limited the great and infinite God to minutes and days; and so, as
          they found themselves at first getting into a worse case than before,
          they said to Moses, deliberately, |Let us alone, that we may serve the
          Egyptians.| They did as good as say -- You have done us no good;
          indeed you have increased our miseries; and we cannot believe in you
          or accept your message as really from God, seeing it has caused us a
          terrible increase of our sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace may truly and effectually come to a heart, and for a while cause
          no joy, no peace; but the reverse. I have known many a man coming to
          this Tabernacle, who has been prospering in business, and so on, and
          yet he has been going down to hell as fast as ever he could travel.
          Well, he has come and heard the gospel, and he has made a great many
          improvements in his conduct, and has become a regular and attentive
          hearer; and at that very time he has fallen into an affliction the
          like of which he had never experienced before; and he has consequently
          complained, |Why, I am worse instead of better. I find my heart grows
          more rebellious against God than ever it was before.| I do not wonder
          that it should be so, for I have seen so many examples of it. The
          discipline of the household of God begins very early. But a present
          increase of sorrow has nothing to do with what the main result will
          be, except that it works towards it in a mysterious manner. Perhaps
          what you at first thought was genuine faith was not faith; and God is
          going to knock down the false before he builds up the true. If you had
          an old house, and any friend of yours were to say, |John, I will build
          you a new house. When shall I begin?| |Oh!| you might say, |begin next
          week to build the new house.| At the end of the week he has pulled
          half your old house down. |Oh,| say you, |this is what you call
          building me a new house, is it? You are causing me great loss: I wish
          I had never consented to your proposal.| He replies, |You are most
          unreasonable: how am I to build you a new house on this spot without
          taking the old one down?| And so it often happens that the grace of
          God does seem in its first work to make a man even worse than he was
          before, because it discovers to him sins which he did not know to be
          there, evils which had been concealed, dangers never dreamed of. Thus
          the work of grace even makes his bondage seem to be heavier than ever
          it was; and yet this is all done in wisdom, in love, and in fulfilment
          of the promise which God has given. Yet I am never very much
          astonished when I find people ready almost to turn away from the
          hearing of the gospel; because, after having at first heard it with
          pleasure, they find that, for the time being, it involves them in even
          greater sorrow than before. How earnestly would I persuade them to
          overcome their very natural tendency to a hasty judgment! Press on,
          dear friend. Be of good courage. Pharaoh will not long be able to make
          you keep up that enormous number of bricks. Within a very few days he
          will be glad to get rid of you. Wait hopefully; for the God who begins
          in darkness will end in light, and before long you will come to
          understand those ways of mercy, which are now past finding out. Not
          many weeks after the sobbing and sighing at the brickyards, Moses and
          the children at Israel sang this song unto the Lord: | Sing unto the
          Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath
          he thrown into the sea.| The work of deliverance began very grimly,
          but it ended very gloriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inability of Israel to believe the message of Moses arose also
          from the fact that they were earthbound by heavy oppression: the mere
          struggle to exist exhausted all their energy, and destroyed all their
          hope. The extreme hardness of their lot made them despondent and
          sullen. They had to work from morning to night. The Egyptian fellahs
          of the present age have known what it is to work very, very hard, and
          to let their earnings go into the coffers of their precious princes.
          It seems always to have been so with wretched Egypt: it is ever the
          house of bondage. But these Israelites, being not even Egyptians, but
          strangers in Egypt, were worked without any pity or mercy. It was a
          daily question with them whether life was worth living under such
          cruel conditions. I do not wonder that a great many are unable to
          receive the gospel in this city of ours, because their struggle for
          existence is awful. I am afraid that it gets more and more intense,
          though even now it passes all bounds. If any of you can do anything to
          help the toil-worn workers, I pray you, do it. The poor workwoman, who
          sits so many hours with the candle and needle, and does not earn
          enough, when she has worked all those hours, to more than just pay the
          rent and keep body and soul together, do you wonder that she thinks
          that this gospel of ours cannot be for her, and does not care to
          listen to it? I know that it would be her comfort, but her soul
          refuseth to be comforted, she is so crushed. The dock labourer, who
          comes home five days out of the six having earned nothing, and hears
          his little children crying for bread -- is it any wonder that he
          cannot hear about heavenly things? Why, it is with our white
          population very much as it was with the negro population of Jamaica.
          When there was work to be had, and they could get enough to eat and
          more, our churches were crowded with them. They were the best of
          hearers and the speediest of converts; they were soon gathered into
          immense churches. But when everything went badly with them, and they
          had to work very hard barely to live, there were groups of
          backsliders, and multitudes who did not feel that they could go to the
          house of God at all. They said that they had no garments to wear, and
          no money to spare; and do you wonder at it? Their poverty was so
          grinding, and their toil so severe, that the services they had once
          delighted in they had no heart for. It is all very easy to say that it
          ought not to be so; but it is so; and it is so with multitudes in
          London. And yet, dear friend -- if such a one has come in here
          to-night -- I pray you do not throw away the next world because you
          have so little of this. This is sheer folly. If I have little here, I
          would make sure of the more hereafter. If you have such a struggle for
          existence here, you should seek that higher, nobler, better life,
          which would give you, even in penury and want, a joy and a comfort to
          which you are a stranger now. May the Holy Ghost come upon you, and
          raise you out of this present evil world into newness of life in
          Christ Jesus! I do not find that God's people get into a condition of
          utter desolation: they are, at their very worst, kept from total
          desertion; for the Lord hath said, |I will never leave thee, nor
          forsake thee.| They do have to work hard, and they may come very near
          to want, but my observation satisfies me that they are happy still;
          that they are joyful still; and they are uplifted by the inner life
          above the down-dragging depression of external trials. I would to God
          that I could say a word that might comfort any child of poverty who
          should happen to be here to-night, and I pray the Lord himself to be
          their comforter and helper.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, worst of all, there are some who seem as if they could not lay
          hold on Christ because their sense of sin has become so intolerable,
          and the wretchedness which follows upon conviction has become so
          fearful, that they have grown almost to be continually despairing. I
          hardly know any condition of mind that is worse than chronic despair,
          when at last that which seemed alarming enough to drive to madness
          settles down into a lifeless, sullen moroseness. These Israelites had
          at last sunk so low that they said, |Let us alone, that we may serve
          the Egyptians.| But your lot is terrible. |We know it is,| they said,
          |but we shall never get out of it.| But your bondage is horrible.
          |Yes, but you may make it worse by interfering. You will only
          aggravate our taskmasters, and bring upon us that last straw which
          breaks the back. Let us alone. We are doomed to suffer: we are
          predestined to be bondsmen. Let us go on as quietly as we may in our
          slavery. It may be that like poor fishes in the cave, we may lose our
          eyes yet, and then we shall not know that it is dark, for we shall
          have lost the capacity for light.| Oh, it is a dreadful thing when a
          heart gets to that -- when a man desires that Christ would depart from
          him, and let him alone to perish. Do not some men virtually say, |I
          know I am lost. Let me enjoy myself as well as I can; I cannot -- I
          cannot enjoy sin; but don't vex my conscience. Do not worry me with
          your talk here, for I shall suffer enough hereafter. Do not tantalize
          me about saving faith, for I shall never believe. Do not begin talking
          to me about repentance. I shall never have a soft and tender heart; I
          know I never shall.| A man who has begun to be numbed with cold, cries
          to his comrades, |Leave me to sleep myself to death|; and thus do
          despairing ones ask to be left in their misery. Dear soul, we cannot,
          we dare not, thus desert you. I will tell you what you shall do, dear
          soul; do give me a hearing. In the name of God, believe that there is
          hope yet -- that even now Christ Jesus invites men, and especially
          such as you, to put their trust in him. O you who are burdened with
          sin, he calls you to let him be your Saviour. If there is a man in the
          world he died for, you are the man. If I see a physician hurrying down
          the street in his brougham, and anybody says to me, |Where is that
          doctor going?| if I knew every house in the street, I should pick out
          the case of a man that I knew to be in the worst condition, and most
          near to death's door. |Sir,| I should say, |the doctor is going there.
          That dying person needs him most, and I believe that he is hurrying to
          his bedside.| If there is one man here that is worse than any other,
          more sad, more sick, more sorry, more despairing than another, my Lord
          Jesus Christ, who is here, has come to meet with such a one. O
          troubled heart, Jesus has come to seek and to save you! I am sure it
          is so. Hope thou! Hope thou! Hope thou! Thou art not beyond hope of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>See, O soul, thou'rt yet alive,</p>
        <p>Not in torment; not in hell.</p>
        <p>Still doth his good Spirit strive,</p>
        <p>With the chief of sinners dwell.</p>
        <p>
          Lift up thy eyes, for thou art not yet where the rich man was after
          his death and burial. Do not yet despair. May be, there awaits thee
          yet a happy life of joy in God. The sun may yet bring thee brighter
          days, days of peace, and rest, and usefulness. Did you never hear the
          story of John Newton, on the coast of Africa? He had got himself into
          such a state by his sins, his drunkenness, his vice, that at last he
          was left on the coast of Africa, and virtually became a slave. Did
          John Newton dream, when he wandered up and down with a hungry belly,
          full of fever, and at death's door, that the day would come when he
          would be the companion and dear friend of Cowper, and when the church
          of St. Mary Woolnoth, over there in the city, would be crowded every
          time he stood up to preach of free grace and dying love? He did not
          think it, but it was so predestined. Something equally gracious may be
          ordered for you. Blasphemer, you may preach the gospel yet. O thou
          Magdalene, full of filthiness, thou wilt yet wash his feet with thy
          tears, and wipe them with the hairs of thy head. Thou black villain,
          thou mayest yet stand among that white-robed host, of whom the angel
          asked, |Who are these, and whence came they?| You, even you, will sing
          more sweet and loud than any of them unto him that loved you and
          washed you from your sins in his precious blood. God make it so, and
          unto his name shall be praise for ever and ever!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I have many more things to say, but I might weary you with them
          rather than bless you. The message was at first not received by Israel
          by reason of their anguish of soul, but IT WAS TRUE FOR ALL THAT, AND
          THE LORD MADE IT SO. What did the Lord do when he found that those
          people did not hearken to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
          bondage? What did the Lord do? He was not going to give them up
          because of their wretched condition. He had said, |I will bring them
          out,| and he meant to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing the Lord did to prove his persevering grace was to
          commission Moses again. (Ex.6:1; 7:2.) So the Lord God, in everlasting
          mercy, says to his minister, |You have to preach the gospel again to
          them. Again proclaim my grace.| It seems a terrible thing to have to
          pour our souls into deaf ears. Yet I shall not give it up, for I have
          done it with some here for nearly thirty-three years, and I may as
          well go on. Why should I lose so much labour? I will try again, like
          Peter, who, after toiling all night and taking nothing, yet let down
          the net at the Lord's bidding. One of these days those dead ears will
          be made to live. God in mercy says, |Go on with it. As long as there
          is breath in your body, tell them to believe in my Son, and they shall
          live. Tell them till you die that 'He that with his mouth confesseth,
          and with his heart believeth that God hath raised Christ from the dead
          shall be saved.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Lord did more than that for Israel. As these people had not
          listened to Moses, he called Moses and Aaron to him, and he renewed
          their charge. He laid it upon them -- gave them again their marching
          orders: |He gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto
          Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land
          of Egypt.| A monstrous thing it did look. They would not even hear
          Moses but the Lord will have his servants stand to their work. Moses
          and Aaron have to do it, however impossible it may appear. There is to
          be no backing out of it. They must know of a surety that Israel is to
          be delivered by their means. It is a grand point when the Lord lays
          the conversion of men on the hearts of his ministers, and makes them
          feel that they must win souls. Moses was bound to bring out Israel.
          |But there is Pharaoh| Pharaoh is included in the divine charge. They
          have to beat Pharaoh into submission. |But those children of Israel
          will not obey.| The Lord put them in the charge: did you not observe
          the words, |He gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and
          unto Pharaoh |? Moses and Aaron, you have to bring Israel out, Pharaoh
          is to let them go, and Israel is to go willingly. God has issued his
          royal decree, and be you sure it will stand. I believe that God is
          saying to his church |You have to do it. You have to gather out mine
          elect out of every nation under heaven.| To the church in London, he
          says, |Bring this people out of the bondage of sin.| That terrible
          London with all its poverty, its drunkenness, its infidelity, and
          licentiousness: you are to save it in the name of the Lord Jesus. Its
          darkness is dense; you are to shine till it is enlightened. You have
          to save London. So do not back out of it. |Oh,| says one man, who
          lives down some street near this place, |Sir, I can hardly live in the
          street. It teems with ill-living women.| You have to save them.
          Passing a little shop as I did the other day, I saw written up in the
          window, |If any poor girl that wishes to lead a better life will only
          step inside she will find a friend.| That is one of our dear members.
          I felt so pleased as I saw it. I should like to see such a notice in a
          great many windows. I would like to see you live among the wicked, and
          put up in your windows, |If anybody wants a friend, there is one
          inside. Come in.| You are called to save them! They must not be lost.
          Somebody says, |What are you talking about, Mr. Spurgeon? We cannot
          save them.| I am talking as God said, when be told Moses and Aaron
          that he gave them a charge to bring his people out of Egypt. They
          could not do it: but yet they did it. Anyone can do what he can do,
          but it is only God's servant that can do what he cannot do. We, my
          brethren, are called to perform the impossible; we are to be familiar
          with miracles. Look at Ezekiel. There is a valley full of dry bones.
          Ezekiel is to go and say to them, |Thus saith the Lord, Ye dry bones,
          live.| What a preposterous thing! An able divine of good repute once
          said that, to preach the gospel to dead sinners, was as preposterous
          as to wave a pocket-handkerchief over a grave. Ah, just so! Therefore,
          I would not have him do it. If the Lord has not sent him to do it he
          would do no good if he were to attempt to preach to the sinner dead in
          sin; but it is a different thing when it is my case, for I feel that I
          am sent to do it, and therefore I am not vexed at being thought to be
          acting absurdly. If God had sent me to wave a pocket-handkerchief over
          the dead in Nunhead cemetery, that they might live, I would go and
          wave that pocket-handkerchief, and they would live. To the eye of
          reason there is no use in preaching to men dead in sin. I freely admit
          that; but if it is a commission from God, then it is not ours to raise
          questions, but to do as we are bidden. God has commissioned his
          servants to preach the gospel to every creature. Whatever those
          creatures may be, we are to say to them, |He that believeth and is
          baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be dammed.|
          This is our message and our mission, and we are just to tell the
          truth, and leave God to apply it to the heart. Oh that he may give us
          grace to tell out the gospel, and to keep on doing it till he has
          brought his own elect out of the bondage of sin and Satan, and saved
          them with an everlasting salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more. As I told you in the reading, I greatly admire this
          chapter. I cannot help admiring the next thing that God did when he
          told his servant what to do. The Lord began to count the heads of
          those whom he would redeem out of bondage. You see the rest of the
          chapter is occupied with the children of Reuben, and the children of
          Simeon, and the children of Levi. God seemed to say, |Pharaoh, let my
          people go!| |I will not,| said the despot. Straightway the Lord goes
          right down into the brick-town where the poor slaves are at work, and
          he makes out a list of all of them, to show that he means to set free.
          So many there of Simeon. So many here of Reuben. So many here of Levi.
          The Lord is counting them. Moreover he numbers their cattle, for he
          declares, |There shall not a hoof be left behind.| Men say, |It is of
          no use counting your chickens before they are hatched|; but when it
          comes to God's counting those whom he means to deliver, it is another
          matter; for he knows what will be done, because he determines to do it
          and he is almighty. He knows what is to come of the gospel, and he
          knows whom he means to bless. And so let Satan rage, and let
          adversaries do what they will, |The foundation of God standeth sure,
          having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his|; and to prove
          this, he goes on writing down their names, and taking an account of
          them. |They shall be mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I make up
          my jewels.| Now, my hearers, if you do not come to Christ, it will be
          your own loss, and not his. If you refuse him, it will be because you
          are not Christ's sheep, as he said to you. He has a people, and he
          will save them, whether you, my hearer, believe in Jesus or wilfully
          refuse to do so. Out of the mass of mankind a company shall come to
          him, and shall glorify his name, as it is written, |This people have I
          formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.| Oh, that you had
          such a mind in you that you would accept his gospel! Will you do so
          even now? Trust Christ, and you are saved. Look unto him, and be ye
          saved The Lord bless you, for his name's sake. Amen.
