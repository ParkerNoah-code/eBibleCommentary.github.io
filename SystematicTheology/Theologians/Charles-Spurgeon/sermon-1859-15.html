        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.241)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 16th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." -- Romans 9:15.</p>
        <p>
          DO NOT IMAGINE for an instant that I pretend to be able thoroughly to
          elucidate the great mysteries of predestination. There are some men
          who claim to know all about the matter. They twist it round their
          fingers as easily as if it were an everyday thing; but depend upon it,
          he who thinks he knows all about this mystery, knows but very little.
          It is but the shallowness of his mind that permits him to see the
          bottom of his knowledge; he who dives deep, finds that there is in the
          lowest depth to which he can attain a deeper depth still. The fact is,
          that the great questions about man's responsibility, free-will, and
          predestination, have been fought over, and over, and over again, and
          have been answered in ten thousand different ways; and the result has
          been, that we know just as much about the matter as when we first
          began. The combatants have thrown dust into each other's eyes, and
          have hindered each other from seeing; and then they have concluded,
          that because they put other people's eyes out, they could therefore
          see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is one thing to refute another man's doctrine, but a very
          different matter to establish my own views. It is very easy to knock
          over one man's hypothesis concerning these truths, not quite so easy
          to make my own stand on a firm footing. I shall try to-night, if I
          can, to go safely, if I do not go very fast; for I shall endeavour to
          keep simply to the letter of God's Word. I think that if we kept more
          simply to the teachings of the Bible, we should be wiser than we are;
          for by turning from the heavenly light of revelation, and trusting to
          the deceitful will-o'-the-wisps of our own imagination, we thrust
          ourselves into quags and bogs where there is no sure footing, and we
          begin to sink; and instead of making progress, we find ourselves
          sticking fast. The truth is, neither you nor I have any right to want
          to know more about predestination than what God tells us. That is
          enough for us. If it were worth while for us to know more, God would
          have revealed more. What God has told us, we are to believe, but to
          the knowledge thus gained, we are too apt to add our own vague
          notions, and then we are sure to go wrong. It would be better, if in
          all controversies, men had simply stood hard and fast by "Thus saith
          the Lord," instead of having it said, "Thus and thus I think." I shall
          now endeavour, by the help of the Holy Spirit, to throw the light of
          God's Word upon this great doctrine of divine sovereignty, and give
          you what I think to be a Scriptural statement of the fact, that some
          men are chosen, other men are left, -- the great fact that is declared
          in this text, -- " Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a terrible text, and I will be honest with it if I can. One man
          says the word "hate" does not mean hate; it means "love less:" --
          "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I loved less." It may be so: but I
          don't believe it is. At any rate, it says "hate" here; and until you
          give me another version of the Bible, I shall keep to this one. I
          believe that the term is correctly and properly translated; that the
          word "hate" is not stronger than the original; but even if it be a
          little stronger, it is nearer the mark than the other translation
          which is offered to us in those meaningless words, "love less." I like
          to take it and let it stand just as it is. The fact is, God loved
          Jacob, and he did not love Esau; he did choose Jacob, but he did not
          choose Esau; he did bless Jacob, but he never blessed Esau; his mercy
          followed Jacob all the way of his life, even to the last, but his
          mercy never followed Esau; he permitted him still to go on in his
          sins, and to prove that dreadful truth, "Esau have I hated." Others,
          in order to get rid of this ugly text, say, it does not mean Esau and
          Jacob; it means the nation; it means Jacob's children and Esau's
          children; it means the children of Israel and Edom. I should like to
          know where the difference lies. Is the difficulty removed by extending
          it? Some of the Wesleyan brethren say, that there is a national
          election; God has chosen one nation and not another. They turn round
          and tell us it is unjust in God to choose one man and not another.
          Now, we ask them by everything reasonable, is it not equally unjust of
          God to choose one nation and leave another? The argument which they
          imagine overthrows us overthrows them also. There never was a more
          foolish subterfuge than that of trying to bring out national election.
          What is the election of a nation but the election of so many units, of
          so many people? and it is tantamount to the same thing as the
          particular election of individuals. In thinking, men cannot see
          clearly that if -- which we do not for a moment believe -- that if
          there be any injustice in God choosing one man and not another, how
          much more must there be injustice in his choosing one nation and not
          another. No! the difficulty cannot be got rid of thus, but is greatly
          increased by this foolish wresting of God's Word. Besides, here is the
          proof that that is not correct; read the verse preceding it. It does
          not say anything at all about nations, it says, "For the children
          being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the
          purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of
          him that calleth; It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the
          younger," -- referring to the children, not to the nations. Of course
          the threatening was afterwards fulfilled in the position of the two
          nations; Edom was made to serve Israel. But this text means just what
          it says; it does not mean nations, but it means the persons mentioned.
          "Jacob," -- that is the man whose name was Jacob -- " Jacob have I
          loved, but Esau have I hated." Take care my dear friends, how any of
          you meddle with God's Word. I have heard of folks altering passages
          they did not like. It will not do, you know, you cannot alter them;
          they are really just the same. Our only power with the Word of God is
          simply to let it stand as it is, and to endeavour by God's grace to
          accommodate ourselves to that. We must never try to make the Bible bow
          to us, in fact we cannot, for the truths of divine revelation are as
          sure and fast as the throne of God. If a man wants to enjoy a
          delightful prospect, and a mighty mountain lies in his path, does he
          commence cutting away at its base, in the vain hope that ultimately it
          will become a level plain before him? No, on the contrary, he
          diligently uses it for the accomplishment of his purpose by ascending
          it, well knowing this to be the only means of obtaining the end in
          view. So must we do; we cannot bring down the truths of God to our
          poor finite understandings; the mountain will never fall before us,
          but we can seek strength to rise higher and higher in our perception
          of divine things, and in this way only may we hope to obtain the
          blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall have two things to notice to-night. I have explained this
          text to mean just what it says, and I do not want it to be altered --
          " Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." To take off the edge of
          this terrible doctrine that makes real some people bite their lips so,
          I must just notice that this is a fact; and, after that, I shall try
          to answer the question, -- Why was it that God loved Jacob and hated
          Esau?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THIS IS FACT. Men say they do not like the doctrine of
          election. Verily, I do not want them to; but is it not a fact that God
          has elected some? Ask an Arminian brother about election, and at once
          his eye turns fiercely upon you, and he begins to get angry, he can't
          bear it; it is a horrible thing, like a war-cry to him, and he begins
          to sharpen the knife of controversy at once. But say to him, "Ah,
          brother! was it not divine grace that made you to differ? Was it not
          the Lord who called you out of your natural state, and made you what
          you are? "Oh, yes," he says," "I quite agree with you there." Now, put
          this question to him: "What do you think is the reason why one man has
          been converted, and not another?" "Oh," he says, "the Spirit of God
          has been at work in this man." Well, then, my brother, the fact is,
          that God does treat one man better than another; and is there anything
          wonderful in this fact? It is a fact we recognize every day. There is
          a man up in the gallery there, that work as hard as he likes, he
          cannot earn more than fifteen shillings a week; and here is another
          man that gets a thousand a year; what is the reason of this? One is
          born in the palaces of kings, while another draws his first breath in
          a roofless hovel What is the reason of this? God's providence. He puts
          one man in one position, and another man in another. Here is a man
          whose head cannot hold two thoughts together, do what you will with
          him; here is another who can sit down and write a book, and dive into
          the deepest of questions; what is the reason of it? God has done it.
          Do you not see the fact, that God does not treat every man alike? He
          has made some eagles, and some worms; some he has made lions, and some
          creeping lizards; he has made some men kings, and some are born
          beggars. Some are born with gigantic minds and some verge on the
          idiot. Why is this? Do you murmur at God for it? No, you say it is a
          fact, and there is no good in murmuring. What is the use of kicking
          against facts? It is only kicking against the pricks with naked feet,
          and you hurt yourself and not them. Well, then, election is a positive
          fact; it is as clear as daylight, that God does, in matters of
          religion, give to one man more than to another. He gives to me
          opportunities of hearing the word, which he does nor give to the
          Hottentot. He gives to me, parents who, from infancy, trained me in
          the fear of the Lord. He does not give that to many of you. He places
          me afterwards in situations where I am restrained from sin. Other men
          are cast into places where their sinful passions are developed. He
          gives, to one man a temper and disposition which keeps him back from
          some lust, and to another man he gives such impetuosity of spirit, and
          depravity turns that impetuosity so much aside, that the man runs
          headlong into sin. Again, he brings one man under the sound of a
          powerful ministry, while another sits and listens to a preacher whose
          drowsiness is only exceeded by that of his hearers. And even when they
          are hearing the gospel, the fact is God works in one heart when be
          does not in another. Though, I believe to a degree, the Spirit works
          in the hearts of all who hear the Word, so that they are all without
          excuse, yet I am sure he works in some so powerfully, that they can no
          longer resist him, but are constrained by his grace to cast themselves
          at his feet, and confess him Lord of all; while others resist the
          grace that comes into their hearts; and it does not act with the same
          irresistible force that it does in the other case, and they perish in
          their sins, deservedly and justly condemned. Are not these things
          facts? Does any man deny them? can any man deny them? What is the use
          of kicking against facts? I always like to know when there is a
          discussion, what is the fact. You have heard the story of King Charles
          the Second and the philosophers -- King Charles asked one of them,
          "What is the reason why, if you had a pail of water, and weighed it,
          and then put a fish into it, that the weight would be the same?" They
          gave a great many elaborate reasons for this. At last one of them
          said, "Is it the fact?" And then they found out that the water did
          weigh more, just as much more as the fish put into it. So all their
          learned arguments fell to the ground. So, when we are talking about
          election, the best thing is to say, "Put aside the doctrine for a
          moment, let us see what is the fact?" We walk abroad; we open our
          eyes; we see, there is the fact. What, then, is the use of our
          discussing any longer? We had better believe it, since it is an
          undeniable truth. You may alter an opinion, but you cannot alter a
          fact. You may change a mere doctrine, but you cannot possibly change a
          thing which actually exists. There it is -- God does certainly deal
          with some men better than he does with others. I will not offer an
          apology for God; he can explain his own dealings; he needs no defence
          from me,
        </p>
        <p>"God is his own interpreter,</p>
        <p>And he will make it plain;"</p>
        <p>
          but there stands the fact. Before you begin to argue upon the
          doctrine, just recollect, that whatever you may think about it, you
          cannot alter it; and however much you may object to it, it is actually
          true that God did love Jacob, and did not love Esau.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now look at Jacob's life and read his history; you are compelled
          to say that, from the first hour that he left his father's house, even
          to the last, God loved him. Why, he has not gone far from his father's
          house before he is weary, and he lies down with a stone for his
          pillow, and the hedges for his curtain, and the sky for his canopy;
          and he goes to sleep, and God comes and talks to him in his sleep; he
          sees a ladder, whereof the top reaches to heaven, and a company of
          angels ascending and descending upon it; and he goes on his journey to
          Laban. Laban tries to cheat him, and as often as Laban tries to wrong
          him, God suffers it not, but multiplies the different cattle that
          Laban gives him. Afterwards, you remember, when he fled unawares from
          Laban, and was pursued, that God appears to Laban in a dream, and
          charges him not to speak to Jacob either good or bad. And more
          memorable still, when his sons Levi and Simeon have committed murder
          in Shethem, and Jacob is afraid that he will be overtaken and
          destroyed by the inhabitants who were rising against him, God puts a
          fear upon the the people, and says to them, "Touch not mine anointed,
          and do my prophet no harm." And when a famine comes over the land, God
          has sent Joseph into Egypt, to provide corn in Goshen for his
          brethren, that they should live and not die. And see the happy end of
          Jacob -- " I shall see my son Joseph before I die." Behold the tears
          streaming down his aged cheeks, as he clasps his own Joseph to his
          bosom! See how magnificently he goes into the presence of Pharaoh, and
          blesses him. It is said, "Jacob blessed Pharoah." He had God's love so
          much in him, that he was free to bless the mightiest monarch of his
          times. At last he gave up the ghost, and it was said at once, "This
          was a man that God loved." There is the fact that God did love Jacob.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, there is the fact that God did not love Esau. He
          permitted Esau to become the father of princes, but he has not blessed
          his generation. Where is the house of Esau now? Edom has perished. She
          built her chambers in the rock, and cut out her cities in the flinty
          rock; but God has abandoned the inhabitants thereof, and Edom is not
          to be found. They became the bond-slaves of Israel; and the kings of
          Edom had to furnish a yearly tribute of wool to Solomon and his
          successors; and now the name of Esau is erased from the book of
          history. Now, then, I must say, again, this ought to take off at least
          some of the bitterness of controversy, when we recollect that it is
          the fact, let men say what they will, that God did love Jacob, and he
          did not love Esau.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now the second point of my subject is, WHY IS THIS? Why did
          God love Jacob? why did he hate Esau? Now, I am not going to undertake
          too much at once. You say to me, "Why did God love Jacob? and why did
          he hate Esau?" We will take one question at a time; for the reason why
          some people get into a muddle in theology is, because they try to give
          an answer to two questions. Now, I shall not do that; I will tell you
          one thing at a time. I will tell you why God loved Jacob; and, then, I
          will tell you why he hated Esau. But I cannot give you the same reason
          for two contradictory things. That is wherein a great many have
          failed. They have sat down and seen these facts, that God loved Jacob
          and hated Esau, that God has an elect people, and that there are
          others who are not elect. If, then, they try to give the same reason
          for election and non-election, they make sad work of it. If they will
          pause and take one thing at a time, and look to God's Word, they will
          not go wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first question is, why did God love Jacob? I am not at all puzzled
          to answer this, because when I turn to the Word of God, I read this
          text; -- "Not for your sakes, do I this saith the Lord God, be it
          known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways O house of
          Israel." I am not at a loss to tell you that it could not be for any
          good thing in Jacob, that God loved him, because I am told that "the
          children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil,
          that the purpose of God, according to election might stand, not of
          works but of him that calleth." I can tell you the reason why God
          loved Jacob; It is sovereign grace. There was nothing in Jacob that
          could make God love him; there was everything about him, that might
          have made God hate him, as much as he did Esau, and a great deal more.
          But it was because God was infinitely gracious, that he loved Jacob,
          and because he was sovereign in his dispensation of this grace, that
          he chose Jacob as the object of that love. Now, I am not going to deal
          with Esau, until I have answered the question on the side of Jacob. I
          want just to notice this, that Jacob was loved of God, simply on the
          footing of free grace. For, come now, let us look at Jacob's
          character; I have already said in the exposition, what I think of him.
          I do think the very smallest things of Jacob's character. As a natural
          man, he was always a bargain-maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was struck the other day with that vision that Jacob had at Bethel:
          it seemed to me a most extraordinary development of Jacob's
          bargain-making spirit. You know he lay down, and God was pleased to
          open the doors of heaven to him, so that he saw God sitting at the top
          of the ladder, and the angels ascending and descending upon it. What
          do you suppose he said as soon as he awoke? Well, he said, "Surely the
          Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said,
          How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God,
          and this is the gate of heaven." Why, if Jacob had had faith, he would
          not have been afraid of God: on the contrary, he would have rejoiced
          that God had thus permitted him to hold fellowship with him. Now, hear
          Jacob's bargain. God had simply said to him, "I am the Lord God of
          Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,
          to thee will I give it, and to thy seed." He did not say anything
          about what Jacob was to do: God only said, I will do it, -- "Behold I
          am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and
          will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until
          I have done that which I have spoken to thee of." Now, can you
          believe, that after God had spoken face to face with Jacob, that he
          would have had the impudence to try and make a bargain with God? But
          he did. He begins and says, "If -- " There now, the man has had a
          vision, and an absolute promise from God, and yet he begins with an
          "If." That is bargain-making with a vengeance! "If God will be with
          me, and will keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to
          eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my Father's house
          in peace, then" -- not without -- mark, he is going to hold God to his
          bargain -- "then shall, the Lord be my God: and this stone which I
          have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou
          shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee." I marvel at
          this! If I did not know something about my own nature, I should be
          utterly unable to understand it. What! a man that has talked with God,
          then begin to make a bargain with him! that has seen the only way of
          access between heaven and earth, the ladder Christ Jesus, and has had
          a covenant made between himself and God, a covenant that is all on
          God's part -- all a promise -- and yet wants after that to hold God to
          the bargain: as if he were afraid God would break his promise! Oh!
          this was vile indeed!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then notice his whole life. While he lived with Laban, what miserable
          work it was. He had got into the hands of a man of the world; and
          whenever a covetous Christian gets into such company, a terrible scene
          ensues! There are the two together, greedy and grasping. If an angel
          could look down upon them, how would he weep to see the man of God
          fallen from his high place, and become as bad as the other. Then, the
          device that Jacob used, when he endeavoured to get his wages was most
          extraordinary. Why did he not leave it to God, instead of adopting
          such systems as that? The whole way through we are ashamed of Jacob;
          we cannot help it. And then, there is that grand period in his life,
          the turning point, when we are told, that "Jacob wrestled with God,
          and prevailed." We will look at that -- I have carefully studied the
          subject, and I do not think so much of him as I did. I thought Jacob
          wrestled with God, but I find it is the contrary; he did not wrestle
          with God; God wrestled with him. I had always set Jacob up, in my
          mind, as the very model of a man wrestling in prayer; I do not think
          so now. He divided his family, and put a person in front to appease
          Esau. He did not go in front himself, with the holy trust that a
          patriarch should have felt; guarded with all the omnipotence of
          heaven, he might boldly have gone to meet his brother, but no! he did
          not feel certain that the latter would bow at his feet, although the
          promise said, "The elder shall serve the younger." He did not rest on
          that promise; it was not big enough for him. Then he went at night to
          the brook Jabbok. I do not know what for, unless he went to pray; but
          I am afraid it was not so. The text says, "And Jacob was left alone:
          and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day."
          There is a great deal of difference between a man wrestling with me,
          and my wrestling with him. When I strive with anyone, I want to gain
          something from him, and when a man wrestles with me, he wants to get
          something out of me. Therefore, I take it, when the man wrestled with
          Jacob, he wanted to get his cunning and deceit out of him, and prove
          what a poor sinful creature he was, but he could not do it. Jacob's
          craft was so strong, that he could not be overcome; at last, the angel
          touched his thigh, and showed him his own hollowness. And Jacob turned
          round and said, "Thou hast taken away my strength, now I will wrestle
          with thee;" and when his thigh was out of joint, when he fully felt
          his own weakness, then, and not till then, is he brought to say, "I
          will not let thee go, except thou bless me." He had had fall
          confidence in his own strength, but God at last humbled him, and when
          all his boasted power was gone, then it was that Jacob became a
          prevailing prince. But, even after that, his life is not clear. Then
          you find him an unbelieving creature; and we have all been as bad.
          Though we are blaming Jacob, brethren, we blame ourselves. We are hard
          with him, but we shall be harder with ourselves. Do you not remember
          the memorable speech of the patriarch, when he said, "Joseph is not,
          and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things
          are against me?" Ah, Jacob, why cannot you believe the promise? All
          other promises have been fulfilled. But no! he could not think of the
          promise; he was always wanting to live by sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I say if the character of Jacob, be as I have described it, and I
          am sure it is -- we have got it in God's word -- there was, there
          could have been nothing in Jacob, that made God love him; and the only
          reason why God loved him, must have been because of his own grace,
          because "he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy." And rest
          assured, the only reason why any of us can hope to be saved is this,
          the sovereign grace of God. There is no reason why I should be saved,
          or why you should be saved, but God's own merciful heart, and God's
          own omnipotent will. Now that is the doctrine; it is taught not only
          in this passage, but in multitudes of other passages of God's Word.
          Dear friends, receive it, hold fast by it, and never let it go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the next question is a different one: Why did God hate Esau? I am
          not going to mix this question up with the other, they are entirely
          distinct, and I intend to keep them so, one answer will not do for two
          questions, they must be taken separately, and then can be answered
          satisfactorily. Why does God hate any man? I defy anyone to give any
          answer but this, because that man deserves it; no reply but that can
          ever be true. There are some who answer, divine sovereignty; but I
          challenge them to look that doctrine in the face. Do you believe that
          God created man and arbitrarily, sovereignly -- it is the same thing
          -- created that man, with no other intention, than that of damning
          him? Made him, and yet, for no other reason than that of destroying
          him for ever? Well, if you can believe it, I pity you, that is all I
          can say: you deserve pity, that you should think so meanly of God,
          whose mercy endureth for ever. You are quite right when you say the
          reason why God loves a man, is because God does do so; there is no
          reason in the man. But do not give the same answer as to why God hates
          a man. If God deals with any man severely, it is because that man
          deserves all he gets. In hell there will not be a solitary soul that
          will say to God, O Lord, thou hast treated me worse than I deserve!
          But every lost spirit will be made to feel that he has got his
          deserts, that his destruction lies at his own door and not at the door
          of God; that God had nothing to do with his condemnation, except as
          the Judge condemns the criminal, but that he himself brought damnation
          upon his own head, as the result of his own evil works. Justice is
          that which damns a man; it is mercy, it is free grace, that saves;
          sovereignty holds the scale of love; it is justice holds the other
          scale. Who can put that into the hand of sovereignty? That were to
          libel God and to dishonour him;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us look at Esau's character, says one, "did he deserve that
          God should cast him away?" I answer, he did. What we know of Esau's
          character, clearly proves it. Esau lost his birthright. Do not sit
          down and weep about that, and blame God. Esau sold it himself; he sold
          it for a mess of pottage. Oh, Esau, it is in vain for thee to say, "I
          lost my birthright by decree." No, no. Jacob got it by decree, but you
          lost it because you sold it yourself -- didn't you? Was it not your
          own bargain? Did you not take the mess of red pottage of your own
          voluntary will, in lieu of the birthright? Your destruction lies at
          your own door, because you sold your own soul at your own bargain, and
          you did it yourself. Did God influence Esau to do that? God forbid,
          God is not the author of sin. Esau voluntarily gave up his own
          birthright. And the doctrine is, that every man who loses heaven gives
          it up himself. Every man who loses everlasting life rejects it
          himself. God denies it not to him -- he will not come that he may have
          life. Why is it that a man remains ungodly and does not fear God? It
          is because he says, "I like this drink, I like this pleasure, I like
          this sabbath-breaking, better than I do the things of God." No man is
          saved by his own free-will, but every man is damned by it that is
          damned. He does it of his own will; no one constrains him. You know,
          sinner, that when you go away from here, and put down the cries of
          conscience, that you do it yourself. You know that, when after a
          sermon you say, "I do not care about believing in Christ," you say it
          yourself -- You are quite conscious of it, and if not conscious of it,
          it is notwithstanding a dreadful fact, that the reason why you are
          what you are, is because you will to be what you are. It is your own
          will that keeps you where you are, the blame lies at your own door,
          your being still in a state of sin is voluntary. You are a captive,
          but you are a voluntary captive. You will never be willing to get free
          until God makes you willing. But you are willing to be a bond slave.
          There is no disguising the fact, that man loves sin, loves evil, and
          does not love God. You know, though heaven is preached to you through
          the blood of Christ, and though hell is threatened to you as the
          result of your sins, that still you cleave to your iniquities; you
          will not leave them, and will not fly to Christ. And when you are cast
          away, at last it will be said of you, "you have lost your birthright."
          But you sold it yourself. You know that the ball-room suits you better
          than the house of God: you know that the pot-house suits you better
          than the prayer-meeting; you know you trust yourself rather than trust
          Christ; you know you prefer the joys of the present time to the joys
          of the future. It is your own choice -- keep it. Your damnation is
          your own election, not God's; you richly deserve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, says one, "Esau repented." Yes, he did, but what sort of a
          repentance was it? Did you ever notice his repentance? Every man who
          repents and believes will be saved. But what sort of a repentance was
          his? As soon as he found that his brother had got the birthright, he
          sought it again with repentance, he sought it with tears, but he did
          not get it back. You know he sold his birthright for a mess of
          pottage; and he thought he would buy it back by giving his father a
          mess of pottage. "There," he says, "I will go and hunt venison for my
          father. I have got over him with my savoury meat, and he will readily
          give me my birthright again." That is what sinners say: "I have lost
          heaven by my evil works: I will easily get it again by reforming. Did
          I not lose it by sin? I will get it back by giving up my sins." "I
          have been a drunkard," says one, "I will give up drinking, and I will
          now be a teetotaller." Another says, "I have been an awful swearer; I
          am very sorry for it, indeed; I will not swear any more." So all he
          gives to his father is a mess of pottage, the same as that for which
          he sold it. No, sinner, you may sell heaven for a few carnal
          pleasures, but you cannot buy heaven by merely giving them up. You can
          get heaven only on another ground, viz., the ground of free-grace. You
          lose your soul justly, but you cannot get it back by good works, or by
          the renunciation of your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          You think that Esau was a sincere penitent. Just let me tell you
          another thing. This blessed penitent, when he failed to get the
          blessing, what did he say? "The days of mourning for my father are at
          hand: then will I slay my brother Jacob." There is a penitent for you.
          That is not the repentance that comes from God the Holy Spirit. But
          there are some men like that. They say they are very sorry they should
          have been such sinners as that, very sorry that they should have been
          brought into such a sad condition as that; and then they go and do the
          same that they did before. Their penitence does not bring them out of
          their sin, but it leaves them in it, and, perhaps, plunges them still
          deeper into guilt. Now, look at the character of Esau. The only
          redeeming trait in it was that he did begin with repentance, but that
          repentance was even an aggravation of his sin, because it was without
          the effects of evangelical repentance. And I say, if Esau sold his
          birthright he did deserve to lose it; and, therefore, am I not right
          in saying, that if God hated Esau, it was because he deserved to be
          hated. Do you observe how Scripture always guards this conclusion?
          Turn to the ninth chapter of Romans, where we have selected our text,
          see how careful the Holy Spirit is here, in the 22nd verse. "What if
          God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured
          with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
          And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of
          mercy, which he had afore preparded unto glory." But it does not say
          anything about fitting men for destruction; they fitted themselves.
          They did that: God had nothing to do with it. But when men are saved,
          God fits them for that. All the glory to God in salvation; all the
          blame to men in damnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of you want to know what I preach every day, and any stranger
          should say, "Give me a summary of his doctrine," say this, "He
          preaches salvation all of grace, and damnation all of sin. He gives
          God all the glory for every soul that is saved, but he won't have it
          that God is to blame for any man that is damned." That teaching I
          cannot understand. My soul revolts at the idea of a doctrine that lays
          the blood of man's soul at God's door. I cannot conceive how any human
          mind, at least any Christian mind, can hold any such blasphemy as
          that. I delight to preach this blessed truth -- salvation of God, from
          first to last -- the Alpha and the Omega; but when I come to preach
          damnation, I say, damnation of man, not of God; and if you perish, at
          your own hands must your blood be required. There is another passage.
          At the last great day, when all the world shall come before Jesus to
          be judged, have you noticed, when the righteous go on the right side,
          Jesus says, "Come, ye blessed of my father," -- ("of my father,"
          mark,) -- "inherit the kingdom prepared" -- (mark the next word) --
          "for you, from before the foundation of the world." What does he say
          to those on the left? "Depart, ye cursed." He does not say, "ye cursed
          of my father, but, ye cursed. "And what else does he say?" into
          everlasting fire, prepared" -- (not for you, but) -- "for the devil
          and his angels." Do you see how it is guarded, here is the salvation
          side of the question. It is all of God. "Come, ye blessed of my
          father." It is a kingdom prepared for them. There you have election,
          free grace in all its length and breadth. But, on the other hand, you
          have nothing said about the father -- nothing about that at all.
          "Depart, ye cursed." Even the flames are said not to be prepared for
          sinners, but for the devil and his angels. There is no language that I
          can possibly conceive that could more forcibly express this idea,
          supposing it to be the mind of the Holy Spirit, that the glory should
          be to God, and that the blame should be laid at man's door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, have I not answered these two questions honestly? I have
          endeavoured to give a scriptural reason for the dealings of God with
          man. He saves man by grace, and if men perish they perish justly by
          their own fault. "How," says some one, "do you reconcile these two
          doctrines?" My dear brethren, I never reconcile two friends, never.
          These two doctrines are friends with one another; for they are both in
          God's Word, and I shall not attempt to reconcile them. If you show me
          that they are enemies, then I will reconcile them. "But," says one,
          "there is a great deal of difficulty about them." Will you tell me
          what truth there is that has not difficulty about it? "But," he says,
          "I do not see it." Well, I do not ask you to see it; I ask you to
          believe it. There are many things in God's Word that are difficult,
          and that I cannot see, but they are there, and I believe them. I
          cannot see how God can be omnipotent and man be free; but it is so,
          and I believe it. "Well," says one, "I cannot understand it. My answer
          is, I am bound to make it as plain as I can, but if you have not any
          understanding, I cannot give you any; there I must leave it. But then,
          again, it is not a matter of understanding; it is a matter of faith.
          These two things are true; I do not see that they at all differ.
          However, if they did, I should say, if they appear to contradict one
          another, they do not really do so, because God never contradicts
          himself. And I should think in this I exhibited the power of my faith
          in God, that I could believe him, even when his word seemed to be
          contradictory. That is faith. Did not Abraham believe in God even when
          God's promise seemed to contradict his providence? Abraham was old,
          and Sarah was old, but God said Sarah should have a child. How can
          that be? said Abraham, for Sarah is old; and yet Abraham believed the
          promise, and Sarah had a son. There was a reconciliation between
          providence and promise; and if God can bring providence and promise
          together, he can bring doctrine and promise together. If I cannot do
          it, God can even in the world to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let me just practically preach this for one minute. Oh, sinners,
          if ye perish, on your own head must be your doom. Conscience tells you
          this, and the Word of God confirms it. You shall not be able to lay
          your condemnation at any man's door but your own. If you perish you
          perish by suicide. You are your own destroyers, because you reject
          Christ, because you despise the birthright and sell it for that
          miserable mess of pottage -- the pleasures of the world. It is a
          doctrine that thrills through me. Like a two-edged sword, I would make
          it pierce to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow. If you are
          damned it shall be your own fault. If you are found in hell, your
          blood shall be on your own head. You shall bring the faggots to your
          own burning; you shall dig the iron for your own chains; and on your
          own head will be your doom. But if you are saved, it cannot be by your
          merits, it must be by grace -- free, sovereign grace. The gospel is
          preached to you; it is this: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
          thou shalt be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          May grace now be given to you to bring you to yield to this glorious
          command. May you now believe in him who came into the world to save
          sinners, of whom I am chief. Free grace, who shall tell thy glories?
          who shall narrate thy achievements, or write thy victories? Thou hast
          carried the cunning Jacob into glory, and made him white as the angels
          of heaven, and thou shalt carry many a black sinner there also, and
          make him glorious as the glorified. May God prove this doctrine to be
          true in your own experience! If there still remains any difficulty
          upon your minds about any of these points, search the Word of God, and
          seek the illumination of his Spirit to teach you. But recollect after
          all, these are not the most important points in Scripture. That which
          concerns you most, is to know whether you have an interest in the
          blood of Christ? whether you really believe in the Lord Jesus. I have
          only touched upon these, because they cause a great many people a
          world of trouble, and I thought I might be the means of helping some
          of you to tread upon the neck of the dragon. May God grant that it may
