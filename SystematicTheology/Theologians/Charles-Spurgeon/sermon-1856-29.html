        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.83)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 1, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Then Job answered the Lord and said, Behold, I am vile." -- Job
          40:3-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          SURELY, if any man had a right to say, I am not vile, it was Job; for,
          according to the testimony of God himself, he was "a perfect and an
          upright man, one that feared God and eschewed evil." Yet we find even
          this eminent saint, when by his nearness to God he had received light
          enough to discover his own condition, exclaiming, "Behold I am vile."
          We are sure that what Job was forced to say, we may each of us assent
          unto, whether we be God's children or not; and if we be partakers of
          divine grace, it becomes a subject of great consideration for us,
          since even we, although we be regenerated, must exclaim, each one for
          himself, "Behold, I am vile."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a doctrine, as I believe, taught us in Holy Writ, that when a
          man is saved by divine grace, he is not wholly cleansed from the
          corruption of his heart. When we believe in Jesus Christ all our sins
          are pardoned; yet the power of sin, albeit that it is weakened and
          kept under by the dominion of the new-born nature which God doth
          infuse into our souls, doth not cease, but still tarrieth in us, and
          will do so to our dying day. It is a doctrine held by all the
          orthodox, that there dwelleth still in the regenerate, the lusts of
          the flesh, and that there doth still remain in the hearts of those who
          are converted by God's mercy, the evil of carnal nature. I have found
          it very difficult to distinguish, in experimental matters, concerning
          sin. It is usual with many writers, especially with hymn writers, to
          confound the two natures of a Christian. Now, I hold that there is in
          every Christian two natures, as distinct as were the two natures of
          the God-Man Christ Jesus. There is one nature which cannot sin,
          because it is born of God -- a spiritual nature, coming directly from
          heaven, as pure and as perfect as God himself, who is the author of
          it; and there is also in man that ancient nature which, by the fall of
          Adam, hath become altogether vile, corrupt, sinful, and devilish.
          There remains in the heart of the Christian a nature which cannot do
          that which is right, any more than it could before regeneration, and
          which is as evil as it was before the new birth -- as sinful, as
          altogether hostile to God's laws, as ever it was -- a nature which, as
          I said before, is curbed and kept under by the new nature in a great
          measure, but which is not removed and never will be until this
          tabernacle of our flesh is broken down, and we soar into that land
          into which there shall never enter anything that defileth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be my business this morning, to say something of that evil
          nature which still abides in the righteous. That is does remain, I
          shall first attempt to prove; and the other points I will suggest to
          you as we proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The FACT, the great and terrible fact, that EVEN THE RIGHTEOUS HAVE
          IN THEM EVIL NATURES. Job said, "Behold, I am vile." He did not always
          know it. All through the long controversy he had declared himself to
          be just and upright: he had said, "My righteousness I will hold fast,
          and I will not let it go;" and notwithstanding he did scrape his body
          with a potsherd, and his friends did vex his mind with the most bitter
          revilings, yet he still held fast his integrity, and would not confess
          his sin; but when God came to plead with him, he had no sooner
          listened to the voice of God in the whirlwind, and heard the question,
          "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" than at once he put
          his finger on his lips, and would not answer God, but simply said,
          "Behold, I am vile." Possibly some may say, that Job was an exception
          to the rule; and they will tell us, that other saints had not in them
          such a reason for humiliation; but we remind them of David, and we bid
          them read the 51st penitential Psalm, where we find him declaring that
          he was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did his mother conceive him;
          confessing, that he had sin within him. In many other places in the
          Psalms, David doth continually acknowledge and confess, that he is not
          perfectly rid of sin; that still the evil viper doth twist itself
          around his heart. Turn also, if you please, to Isaiah. There you have
          him, in one of his visions, saying that he was a man of unclean lips,
          and that he dwelt among a people of unclean lips. But more especially,
          under the gospel dispensation, you find Paul, in that memorable
          chapter we have been reading, declaring, that he found in "his members
          a law warring against the law of his mind, and bringing him into
          captivity to the law of sin." Yea, we hear that remarkable exclamation
          of struggling desire and intense agony, "O, wretched man that I am,
          who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Do you expect to
          find yourselves better saints than Job? do you imagine that the
          confession which befitted the mouth of David is too mean for you? are
          ye so proud, that ye will not exclaim with Isaiah, "I also am a man of
          unclean lips?" Or rather, have ye progressed so far in pride, that ye
          dare to exalt yourselves above the laborious Apostle Paul, and to hope
          that in you, that is, in your flesh, there dwelleth any good thing? If
          ye do think yourselves to be perfectly pure from sin, hear ye the word
          of God: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
          truth is not in us. If we say we have no sin, we make God a liar."
        </p>
        <p>
          But scarcely do I need to prove this, beloved; for all of you, I am
          sure, who know anything about the experience of a living child of God,
          have found that in your best and happiest moments sin still dwells in
          you; that when you would serve your God the best, sin frequently works
          in you the most furiously. There have been many saints of God who have
          abstained, for a time, from doing anything they have known to be sin;
          but still there has not been one who has been inwardly perfect. If a
          being were perfect, the angels would come down in ten minutes, and
          carry him off to heaven, for he would be ripe for it as soon as he had
          attained perfection. I have found in talking to men who have said a
          good deal about perfection, that after all they really did not believe
          in any such thing. They have taken with the word and attached a
          different meaning to it, and either then proved a doctrine which we
          all knew before, or else supposed a perfection so absurd and
          worthless, that I would not give three half-pence for it if I might
          have it. In many of them it is a fault, I believe, of their brains,
          rather than their hearts; and as John Berridge says, "God will wash
          their brains before they get to heaven." But why should I stay to
          prove this, when you have daily proofs of it yourselves? how many
          times do you feel that corruption is still within you? Mark how easily
          you are surprised into sin. You rise in the morning, and dedicate
          yourselves by fervent prayer to God, thinking what a happy day you
          have before you. Scarce have you uttered your prayer, when something
          comes to ruffle your spirit, your good resolutions are cast to the
          winds, and you say, "This day, which I thought would be such a happy
          one, has suffered, a terrific inroad; I cannot live to God as I
          would." Perhaps you have thought, "I will go up stairs, and ask my God
          to keep me." Well, you were in the main kept by the power of God, but
          on a sudden something came; an evil temper on a sudden surprised you;
          your heart was taken by storm, when you were not expecting an attack;
          the doors were broken open, and some unholy expression came forth from
          your lips, and down you went again on your knees in private,
          exclaiming, "Lord, I am vile." I have found out that I have a
          something in my heart, which, when I have bolted my doors, and think
          all is safe, creeps forth and undoes every bolt, and lets in the sin.
          Besides, beloved, you will find in your heart, even when you are not
          surprised into sin, such an awful tendency to evil, that it is as much
          as you can do to keep it in check, and to say, "Hitherto shalt thou
          come, but no further." Nay, you will find it more than you can do,
          unless a divine power is with you, and preventing grace restrains your
          passions and prevents you from indulging your inbred lusts. Ah,
          soldiers of Jesus, ye have felt -- I know ye have felt the uprisings
          of corruption, for ye know the Lord in sincerity and in truth; and ye
          dare not, unless you would make yourselves liars to your own hearts,
          hope to be in this world perfectly free from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having stated that fact, I must just make a remark upon it, and leave
          it. How wrong it is of any of us, from the fact of our possessing evil
          hearts, to excuse our sins. I have known some persons, who profess to
          be Christians, speak very lightly of sin. There was corruption still
          remaining, and therefore they said they could not help it. Such
          persons have no visible part nor lot in God's covenant. The truly
          loving child of God, though he knows sin is there, hates that sin; it
          is a pain and misery to him, and he never makes the corruption of his
          heart as an excuse for the corruption of his life; he never pleads the
          evil of his nature, as an apology for the evil of his conduct. If any
          man can, in the least degree, clear himself from the conviction of his
          own conscience, on account of his daily failings, by pleading the evil
          of his heart, he is not one of the broken-hearted children of God; he
          is not one of the tried servants of the Lord, for they groan
          concerning sin, and carry it to God's throne; they know it is in them
          -- they do not, therefore, leave it, but seek with all their minds to
          keep it down, In order that it may not rise and carry them away. Mind
          that, unless you should make what I say a cloak to your
          licentiousness, and a covering to your guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus we have mentioned the fact, that the best of men have sin
          still remaining in them. Now, I will tell you what are the doings of
          this sin. What does the sin which still remains in our hearts do? I
          answer --
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Experience will tell you that this sin exerts a checking power upon
          every good thing. You have felt, when you would do good, that evil was
          present with you. Just like the chariot, which might go swiftly down
          the hill, you have had a clog put upon your wheels; or, like the bird
          that would mount towards heaven, you have found your sins, like the
          wires of a cage, preventing your soaring towards the Most High. You
          have bent your knee in prayer, but corruption has distracted your
          thoughts. You have attempted to sin, but you have felt "hosannah's
          languish on your tongue." Some insinuation of Satan has taken fire,
          like a spark in tinder, and well nigh smothered your soul with its
          abominable smoke. You would run in your holy duties with all alacrity;
          but the sin that doth so easily beset you entangles your feet, and
          when you would be nearing the goal, it trips you up, and down you
          fall, to your own dishonor and pain. You will find indwelling sin
          frequently retarding you the most, when you are most earnest. When you
          desire to be most alive to God -- you will generally find sin most
          alive to repel you. The "evil heart of unbelief" puts itself straight
          in the road, and saith, "Thou shalt not come this way;" and when the
          souls says, "I will serve God -- I will worship in his temple," the
          evil heart saith, "Get thee to Dan and Beersheba, and bow thyself
          before false gods, but thou shalt not approach Jerusalem; I will not
          suffer thee to behold the face of the Most High." You have often felt
          this to be the case: a cold hand has been placed upon your hot spirit
          when you have been full of devotion and prayer. And when you have had
          the wings of the dove, and thought you could flee away and be at rest,
          a clog has been put upon your feet, so that you could not mount. Now,
          that is one of the effects of indwelling sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But indwelling sin does more than that: it not only prevents us
          from going forward, but at times even assails us, as well as seeks to
          obstruct us. It is not merely that I fight with indwelling sin; it is
          indwelling sin that sometimes makes an assault on me. You will notice,
          the Apostle says, "O, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
          from the body of this death?" Now, this proves that he was not
          attacking his sin, but that this sin was attacking him. I do not seek
          to be delivered from a man against whom I lead the attack: but it is
          the man who is opposing from whom I seek to be delivered. And so
          sometimes the sin that dwelleth in believers flies at us, like some
          foul tiger of the woods, or some demon, jealous of the celestial
          spirit within us. The evil nature riseth up: it doth not only seek to
          stop us in the way, but, like Amalek, it labours to destroy us and cut
          us off utterly. Did you ever feel, beloved, the attacks of inbred sin?
          It may be, you have not: but if not, depend upon it you will. Before
          you get all the way to heaven, you will be attacked by sin. It will
          not be simply your driving out the Canaanite; but the Canaanite, with
          chariot of iron, will attempt to overcome you, to drive you out, to
          kill your spiritual nature, damp the flame of your piety, and crush
          the new life which God has implanted in you.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The evil heart which still remaineth in the Christian, doth always,
          when it is not attacking or obstructing, still reign and dwell within
          him. My heart is just as bad when no evil emanates from it, as when it
          is all over vileness in its external developments. A volcano is ever a
          volcano; even when it sleeps, trust it not. A lion is a lion, even
          though he play like a kid; and a serpent, is a serpent, even though
          you may stroke it while for a season it slumbers; there is still a
          venom in its sting when its azure scales invite the eye. My heart,
          even though for an hour, it may not have had an evil thought, is still
          evil. If it were possible that I could live for days without a single
          temptation from my own heart to sin, it would be still just as evil as
          it was before; and it is always either displaying its vileness, or
          else preparing for another display. It is either loading its cannon to
          shoot against us, or else it is positively at warfare with us. You may
          rest assured that the heart is never other than it originally was; the
          evil nature is still evil; and when there is no blaze, it is heaping
          up the wood, wherewith it is to blaze another day. It is gathering up
          from my joys, from my devotions, from my holiness, and from all I do,
          some materials to attack me at some future period. The evil nature is
          only evil, and that continually, without the slightest mitigation or
          element of good. The new nature must always wrestle and fight with it;
          and when the two natures are not wrestling and fighting, there is no
          truce between them. When they are not in conflict, still they are
          foes. We must not trust our heart at any time; even when it speaks
          most fair, we must call it liar; and when it pretends to the most
          good, still we must remember its nature, for it is evil, and that
          continually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doings of indwelling sin I will not mention at length: but it is
          sufficient to let you recognize some of your own experience, that you
          may see that it is in keeping with that of the children of God, for
          that you may be as perfect as Job, and yet say, "Behold, I am vile."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Having mentioned the doings of indwelling sin, allow me to
          mention, in the third place, THE DANGER WE ARE UNDER FROM SUCH EVIL
          HEARTS. There are few people who think what a solemn thing it is to be
          a Christian. I guess there is not a believer in the world who knows
          what a miracle it is to be kept a believer. We little think the
          miracles that are working all around us. We see the flowers grow; but
          we do not think of the wondrous power that gives them life. We see the
          stars shine; but how seldom do we think of the hand that moves them.
          The sun gladdens us with his light; yet we little think of the
          miracles which God works to feed that sun with fuel, or to gird him
          like a giant to run his course. And we see Christians walking in
          integrity and holiness; but how little do we suspect what a mass of
          miracles a Christian is. There are as great a number of miracles
          expended on a Christian every day, as he hath hairs on his head. A
          Christian is a perpetual miracle. Every hour that I am preserved from
          sinning, is an hour of as divine a might as that which saw a new-born
          world swathed in its darkness, and heard "the morning stars sing for
          joy." Did ye never think how great is the danger to which a Christian
          is exposed from his indwelling sin? Come let me tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One danger to which we are exposed from indwelling sin arises from the
          fact that sin is within us, and therefore it has a great power over
          us. If a captain has a city, he may for a long preserve it from the
          constant attacks of enemies without. He may have walls so strong, and
          gates so well secured, that he may laugh at all the attacks of
          besiegers; and their sallies may have no more effect upon his walls
          than sallies of wit. But if there should happen to be a traitor inside
          the gates -- if there should be one who hath charge of the keys, and
          who could unlock every door and let in the enemy, how is the toil of
          the commander doubled! for he hath not merely to guard against foes
          without, but against foes within. And here is the danger of the
          Christian. I could fight the devil; I could overcome every sin that
          ever tempted me, if it were not that I had an enemy within. Those
          Diabolians within do more service to Satan than all the Diabolians
          without. As Bunyan says in his Holy War, the enemy tried to get some
          of his friends within the City of Mansoul, and he found his darlings
          inside the walls did him far more good than all those without. Ah!
          Christians, thou couldst laugh at thine enemy, if thou hadst not thine
          evil heart within; but remember, thine heart keeps the keys, because
          out of it are the issues of life. And sin is there. The worst thing
          thou has to fear is the treachery of thine own heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And moreover, Christian, remember how many backers thy evil nature
          has. As for thy gracious life, it finds few friends beneath the sky;
          but thine original sin hath allies in every quarter. It looks down to
          hell, and it finds them there, demons ready to let slip the dogs of
          hell upon thy soul. It looks out into the world, and sees "the lusts
          of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life." It looks
          around, and it seeth all kinds of men, seeking, if it be possible, to
          lead the Christian from his steadfastness. It looks into the Church,
          and it finds all manner of false doctrine ready to inflame lust, and
          guide the soul from the sincerity of its faith. It looks to the body,
          and it finds head, and hand, and foot, and all other members ready to
          be subservient to sin. I could overcome my evil heart if it had not
          such a mighty host of allies, but it makes my position doubly
          dangerous, to have foes without the gates, in league and amity with a
          foe more vile within.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I would have thee recollect, Christian, one more thing, and that
          is, that this evil nature of thine is very strong and very powerful --
          stronger than the new nature, if the new nature were not sustained by
          Divine power. How old is my old nature? "It is as old as myself," the
          aged saint may say, "and has become all the stronger from its age."
          There is one thing which seldom gets weaker through old age -- that
          is, old Adam; he is as strong in his old age as he is in his young
          age, just as able to lead us astray when our head is covered with grey
          hairs, as he was in our youth. We have heard it said that growing in
          grace will make our corruptions less mighty; but I have seen many of
          God's aged saints, and asked them the question, and they have said,
          "No," their lusts have been essentially as strong, when they have been
          many years in their Master's service, as they were at first, although
          more subdued by the new principle within. So far from becoming weaker,
          it is my firm belief that sin increases in power. A person who is
          deceitful becomes more deceitful by practising deceit. So with our
          heart. It did inveigle us at first, and easily entrapped us, but
          having learnt a thousand snares, it doth mislead us now perhaps more
          easily than before; and although our spiritual nature has been more
          fully developed, and grown in grace, yet still the old nature hath
          lost little of its energy. I do not know that the house of Saul waxeth
          weaker and weaker in our hearts; I know that the house of David waxeth
          stronger; but I do not know that my heart gets less vile, or that my
          corruptions become less strong. I believe that if I should ever say my
          corruptions are all dead, I should hear a voice, "The Philistines be
          upon thee, Samson;" or, "The Philistines be in thee, Samson."
          Notwithstanding all former victories, and all the heaps upon heaps of
          sins I may have slain, I should yet be overcome if Almighty mercy did
          not preserve me. Christian! mind thy danger! There is not a man in
          battle so much in danger from the shot, as thou art from thine own
          sin. Thou carriest in thy soul an infamous traitor, even when he
          speaks thee fair he is not to be trusted; thou hast in thy heart a
          slumbering volcano, but a volcano of such terrific force that it may
          shake thy whole nature yet; and unless thou art circumspect, and art
          kept by the power of God, thou hast a heart which may lead thee into
          sins the most diabolical, and crimes the most infamous. Take care, O
          take care, ye Christians! If there were no devil to tempt you, and no
          world to lead you astray, you would have need to take care of your own
          hearts. Look, therefore, at home. Your worst foes are the foes of your
          own households. "Keep thine heart with all diligence, for out of it
          are the issues of life," and out of it death may issue too, -- death
          which would damn thee if sovereign mercy did not prevent. God grant,
          my brethren, that we may learn our corruptions in an easy way, and not
          discover them by their breaking out into open sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I come to the fourth point, which is, THE DISCOVERY OF OUR
          CORRUPTION. Job said, "Behold, I am vile." That word "behold" implies
          that he was astonished. The discovery was unexpected. There are
          special times with the Lord's people, when they learn by experience
          that they are vile. They heard the minister assert the power of inbred
          lust, but perhaps they shook they heads and said, "I cannot go so far
          as that;" but after a little while they found, by some clearer light
          from heaven, that it was a truth after all -- "Behold, I am vile." I
          remember preaching a little while ago from some deep text concerning
          the desperate evil of the heart; and one of my most esteemed friends
          said, "Well, I have not discovered that," and I thought within myself,
          what a blessing, brother! I wish I had not; for it is a most fearful
          experience to pass through: I dare say there are many here now who say
          "I trust in no righteousness of my own. I trust in nothing in the
          world but the blood of Christ; but still I have not discovered the
          vileness of my heart in the way you have mentioned." Perhaps not,
          brother; but it may not be many years before you are made to learn it.
          You may be of a peculiar temperament. God has preserved from all
          contact with temptations which would have revealed your corruptions,
          or perhaps he has been pleased, as a reward of his grace for deeds
          which you have been enabled to do for him, to give you a peaceable
          life, so that you have not been often tossed about by the tumults of
          your own soul; but nevertheless, let me tell you, that you must expect
          to find, in the inmost depths of your heart, a lower depth still. God
          comfort you, and enable you, when you come out of the furnace, to lie
          lower than ever at the footstool of divine mercy! I believe we
          generally find out most of our failings when we have the greatest
          access to God. Job never had such a discovery of God as he had at this
          time. God spoke to him in the whirlwind, and then Job said, "I am
          vile." It is not so much when we are desponding, or unbelieving, that
          we learn our vileness; we do find out something of it then, but not
          all. It is when by God's grace we are helped to climb the mount, when
          we come near to God, and when God reveals himself to us, that we feel
          that we are not pure in his sight. We get some gleams of his high
          majesty; we see the brightness of his skirts, "dark -- with
          insufferable light;" and after having been dazzled by the sight, there
          comes a fall: as if, smitten by the fiery light of the sun, the eagle
          should fall from his lofty heights, even to the ground. So with the
          believer. He soars up to God, and on a sudden down he comes. "Behold,"
          he says, "I am vile. I had never known this if I had not seen God.
          Behold, I have seen him; and now I discover how vile I am." Nothing
          shows blackness like exposure to light. If I would see the blackness
          of my own character, I must put it side by side with spotless purity;
          and when the Lord is pleased to give us some special vision of
          himself, some sweet intercourse with his own blessed person, then it
          is that the soul learns, as it never knew before, with an agony
          perhaps which it never felt, even when at first convinced of sin,
          "Behold, I am vile." God is pleased to do this. Lest we should be
          "exalted above measure, by the abundance of the revelation," he sends
          us this "thorn in the flesh," to let us see ourselves after we have
          seen him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many men who never know much of their vileness till after
          the blood of Christ has been sprinkled on their consciences, or even
          till they have been many years God's children. I met, some time ago,
          with the case of a Christian, who was positively pardoned before he
          had a strong sense of sin. "I did not," he said, "feel my vileness,
          until I heard a voice, I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
          transgressions;' and after that, I thought how black I had been. I did
          not think of my filthiness," said he, "till after I saw that I had
          been washed." I think there are many of God's people, who, though they
          had some notion of their blackness before they came to Christ, never
          knew how thoroughly vile they were till afterwards. They thought then,
          "How great must have been my sin to need such a Saviour! how desperate
          my filth, to require such a washing! how awful my guilt, to need such
          an atonement as the blood of Christ." You may rest assured, that the
          more you know of God and of Christ, the more you will know of
          yourself; and you will be obliged to say, as you did before, "Behold,
          I am vile;" vile in an extraordinary sense, even as you never guessed
          or fancies until now. "Behold, I am vile!" "I am vile, indeed!" No
          doubt many of you will still think, that what I say concerning your
          evil nature is not true, and you may, perhaps, imagine that grace has
          cut your evil nature up; but you know little about spiritual life, if
          you suppose that. It will not be long before you find the old Adam as
          strong in you as ever; here will be a war carried on in your heart to
          your dying day, in which grace shall prevail, but not without sighs,
          and groans, and agonies, and wrestlings, and a daily death.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Here is the way in which God discovers our vileness to ourselves.
          Now, if it be true that we are still vile, WHAT ARE OUR DUTIES? And
          here let me solemnly speak to such of you as are heirs of eternal
          life, desiring as your brother in Christ Jesus to urge you to some
          duties which are most necessary, on account of the continual
          filthiness of your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, if your hearts be still vile, and there be still
          an evil nature in you, how wrong it is to suppose that all your work
          is done. There is one thing concerning which I have much reason to
          complain of some of you. Before your baptism you were extremely
          earnest; you were always attending the means of grace, and I always
          saw you here; but there are some, some even now in this place, who, as
          soon as they had crossed that rubicon, began from that moment to
          decrease in zeal, thinking that the work was over. I tell you
          solemnly, that I know there are some of you who were prayerful,
          careful, devout, living close and near to your God, until you joined
          the church; but from that time forth, you have gradually declined.
          Now, it really appears to me a matter of doubt whether such persons
          are Christians. I tell you I have very grave doubts of the sincerity
          of some of you. If I see a man less earnest after baptism, I think he
          had no right to be baptized; for if he had had a proper sense of the
          value of that ordinance, and had been rightly dedicated to God, he
          would not have turned back to the ways of the world. I am grieved,
          when I see one or two who once walked very consistently with us,
          beginning to slide away. I have no fault to find with the great
          majority of you, as to your firm adherence to God's word. I bless God,
          that for the space of two years and more you have held firm and fast
          by God. I have not seen you absent from the house of prayer, nor do I
          think your zeal has flagged; but there are some few who have been
          tempted by the world, who have been led astray by Satan, or who, by
          some change in their circumstances, or some removal to a distance,
          have become cold, and not diligent in the work of the Lord. There are
          some of my hearers who are not as earnest as they once were. My dear
          friends, if you know the vileness of your hearts, you would see the
          necessity of being as earnest now as ever you were. Oh! if, when you
          were converted, your old nature were cut up, there would be no need of
          watchfulness now. If all your lusts were entirely gone, and all the
          strength of corruption dead within you, there would be no need of
          perseverance; but it is just because ye have evil hearts, that I bid
          you be just as earnest as ever you were, to stir up the gift of God
          which is in you, and look as well to yourselves as ever you did. Fancy
          not the battle is over, man; it is but the first trump, summoning to
          the warfare. The trump has ceased, and thou thinkest the battle is
          over; I tell thee, nay, the fight has but now begun; the hosts are
          only just led forth, and thou hast newly put on thine harness; thou
          hast conflicts yet to come. Be thou earnest, or else that first love
          of thine shall die, and thou shalt yet "go out from us, proving that
          thou wast not of us." Take care, my dear friends, of backsliding; it
          is the easiest thing in the world, and yet the most dangerous thing in
          the world. Take care of giving up your first zeal; beware of cooling
          in the least degree. Ye were hot and earnest once; be hot and earnest
          still, and let the fire which once burnt within you still animate you.
          Be ye still men of might and vigour, men who serve their God with
          diligence and zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, if your evil nature is still within you, how watchful you ought
          to be! The devil never sleeps; your evil nature never sleeps; you
          ought never to sleep. "What I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch."
          These are Jesus Christ's words, and there is nothing needs repetition
          half so much as that word "watch." We can do almost anything better
          than watch; for watching is very wearisome work, especially when we
          have sleepy souls to watch with. Watching is very fatiguing work.
          There is little open honor got by it, and therefore we do not have the
          hope of renown to cheer us up. Watching is a work that few of us, I am
          afraid, rightly perform; but if the Almighty had not watched over you,
          the devil would have carried you away long ago. Dear friends, I bid
          you watch constantly. When the adjoining house is on fire, how
          speedily do persons rise from their beds, and if they have
          combustibles, move them from the premises, and watch, lest their house
          also should become a prey to the devouring element! You have
          corruption in your heart: watch for the first spark, lest it set your
          soul on fire. "Let us not sleep as do others." You might sleep over
          the crater of a volcano, if you liked; you might sleep with your head
          before the cannon's mouth; you might, if you pleased, sleep in the
          midst of an earthquake, or in a pest-house; but I beseech you, do not
          sleep while you have evil hearts. Watch your hearts; you may think
          they are very good, but they will be your ruin if grace prevent not.
          Watch daily; watch perpetually; guard yourselves, lest you sin. Above
          all, my dear brethren, if our hearts be, indeed, still full of
          vileness, how necessary it is that we should still exhibit faith in
          God. If I must trust my God when I first set out, because of the
          difficulties in the way, if those difficulties be not diminished, I
          ought to trust God just as much as I did before. Oh! beloved, yield
          your hearts to God. Do not become self-sufficient. Self-sufficiency is
          Satan's net, wherein he catcheth men, like poor silly fish, and doth
          destroy them. Be not self-sufficient. Think yourselves nothing, for ye
          are nothing, and live by God's help. The way to grow strong in Christ
          is to become weak in yourself. God poureth no power into man's heart
          till man's power is all poured out. Live, then, daily, a life of
          dependence on the grace of God. Do not set thyself up as if thou wast
          an independent gentleman; do not start in thine own concerns as if
          thou couldst do all things thyself; but live always trusting in God.
          Thou has as much need to trust him now as ever thou hadst; for, mark
          thee, although thou wouldst have been damned without Christ, at first,
          thou wilt be damned without Christ now, unless he still keeps thee,
          for thou has as evil a nature now as thou hadst then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dearly beloved, I have just one word to say, not to the saints, but to
          the ungodly -- one cheering word, sinner, poor lost sinner! You think
          you must not come to God because you are vile. Now, let me tell you,
          that there is not a saint in this place but is vile too. If Job, and
          Isaiah, and Paul, were all obliged to say, "I am vile," oh, poor
          sinner, wilt thou be ashamed to join the confession, and say, "I am
          vile," too? If I come to God this night in prayer, when I am on my
          knees by my bedside, I shall have to come to God as a sinner, vile and
          full of sin. My brother sinner! dost thou want to have any better
          confession than that? Thou wantest to be better, dost thou? Why,
          saints in themselves are no better. If divine grace does not eradicate
          all sin in the believer, how dost thou hope to do it thyself? and if
          God loves his people, while they are yet vile, dost thou think thy
          vileness will prevent his loving thee? Nay, vile sinner, come to
          Jesus! vilest of the vile! Believe on Jesus, thou off-cast of the
          world's society, thou who art the dung and dross of the streets, I bid
          thee come to Christ. Christ bids thee believe on him.
        </p>
        <p>"Not the righteous, not the righteous,</p>
        <p>Sinners, Jesus came to save."</p>
        <p>
          Come now; say, "Lord, I am vile; give me faith. Christ died for
          sinners; I am a sinner. Lord Jesus, sprinkle thy blood on me." I tell
          thee, sinner, from God, if thou wilt confess thy sin, thou shalt find
          pardon. If now with all thy heart thou wilt say, "I am vile; wash me;"
          thou shalt be washed now. If the Holy Spirit shall enable thee to say
          with thine heart now, "Lord, I am sinful --
        </p>
        <p>'Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bid'st me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come, I come.'"</p>
        <p>
          Thou shalt go out of this place with all thy sins pardoned; and though
          thou comest in here with every sin that man hath ever committed on thy
          head, thou shalt go out as innocent, yea, more innocent than the
          new-born babe. Though thou comest in here all over sin, thou shalt go
          out with a robe of righteousness, white as angels are, as pure as God
          himself, so far as justification is concerned. For "now," mark it "now
          is the accepted time," if thou believest on him who justifieth the
          ungodly. Oh! may the Holy Spirit give thee faith that thou mayest be
          saved now, for then thou wilt be saved for ever! may God add his
          blessing to this feeble discourse for his name's sake!
