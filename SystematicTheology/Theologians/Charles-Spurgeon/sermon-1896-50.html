          19. Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; and his
          kingdom ruleth over all.20. Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, who are
          mighty in strength, who do his commandment, in hearing the voice of
          his word.21. Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts; ye his ministers, who do
          his pleasure.22. Bless Jehovah, all ye his works in all places of his
          dominion: bless Jehovah, O my soul!

          19. Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens David having
          recounted the benefits by which God lays each of us in particular, and
          also the whole Church, under obligation to him, now extols in general
          his infinite glory. The amount is, that whenever God is mentioned, men
          should learn to ascend in their contemplations above the whole world,
          because his majesty transcends the heavens; and they should farther
          learn not to measure his power by that of man, since it has under its
          control all kingdoms and dominions. That none may think that earthly
          creatures only are here put in subjection to God, the Psalmist chiefly
          addresses the angels. In calling upon them to join in praising God, he
          teaches both himself and all the godly, that there is not a better nor
          a more desirable exercise than to praise God, since there is not a
          more excellent service in which even the angels are employed. The
          angels are doubtless too willing and prompt in the discharge of this
          duty, to stand in need of incitement from us. With what face then, it
          may be said, can we, whose slothfulness is so great, take it upon us
          to exhort them? But although these exalted beings run swiftly before
          us, and we with difficulty come lagging after them, yet David enjoins
          them to sing God's praises for our sake, that by their example he may
          awaken us from our drowsiness. The object he has in view, as I have
          adverted to before, is to be noted, which is, by addressing his
          discourse to the angels to teach us, that the highest end which they
          propose to themselves is to advance the divine glory. Accordingly,
          while in one sentence he clothes them with strength, in the
          immediately following, he describes them as hanging on God's word,
          waiting for his orders, -- Ye who do his commandment However great the
          power, as if he had said, with which you are endued, you reckon
          nothing more honorable than to obey God. And it is not only said that
          they execute God's commandments, but to express more distinctly the
          promptitude of their obedience, it is asserted, that they are always
          ready to perform whatever he commands them.

          21 Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts. By hosts is not to be understood
          the stars, as some explain it. The subject of the preceding verse is
          still continued. Nor is the repetition superfluous; for the word hosts
          teaches us that there are myriads of myriads who stand before the
          throne of God, ready to receive every intimation of his will. Again,
          they are called his ministers who do his pleasure, to intimate to us,
          that they are not there intent in idly beholding God's glory, but that
          having been appointed as our ministers and guardians, they are always
          ready for their work. Instead of word, the term pleasure is here used,
          and both are employed with much propriety; for although the sun, the
          moon, and the stars, observe the laws which God has ordained for them,
          yet being without understanding, they cannot properly be said to obey
          his word and his voice. The term obey is indeed sometimes transferred
          to the mute and insensible parts of creation. It is, however, only in
          a metaphorical sense that they can be said to hearken to God's voice,
          when by a secret instinct of nature they fulfill his purposes. But
          this in the proper sense is true of angels, who actively obey him upon
          their understanding from his sacred mouth what he would have them to
          do. The word pleasure expresses more plainly a joyful and cheerful
          obedience, implying that the angels not only obey God's commandments,
          but also willingly and with the greatest delight receive the
          intimations of his will, that they may perform what he would have them
          to do. Such is the import of the Hebrew noun, as has been stated
          elsewhere.

          22 Bless Jehovah, all ye his works The Psalmist in conclusion
          addresses all creatures; for although they may be without speech and
          understanding, yet they ought in a manner to re-echo the praises of
          their Creator. This he does on our account, that we may learn that
          there is not a corner in heaven or on earth where God is not praised.
          We have less excuse, if, when all the works of God by praising their
          Maker reproach us for our sloth we do not at least follow their
          example. The express mention of all places of his dominion, seems to
          be intended to stir up the faithful to greater ardor in this exercise;
          for if even those countries where his voice is unheard ought not to be
          mute in his praise, how can we lawfully remain silent to whom he opens
          his mouth, anticipating us by his own sacred voice? In short, David
          shows that his design in recounting God's benefits, and magnifying the
          extent of his empire, was to animate himself the more to the exercise
          of praising him.<br />
