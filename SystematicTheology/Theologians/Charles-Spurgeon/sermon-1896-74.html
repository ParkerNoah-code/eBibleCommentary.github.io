          16. And they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the saint of
          Jehovah.17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered over
          the tent of Abiram.18. And a fire was kindled in their assembly, and
          the flame consumed the wicked.19. They made a calf in Horeb, and
          worshipped before the molten image.20. And they changed their glory
          into the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.21. They forgot God their
          preserver, who had done great things in Egypt; 22. And wondrous works
          in the land of Ham, and terrible things at the Red Sea.
        </p>

          16. And they envied He refers here very shortly to another
          transgression, and that, too, in such a way as to furnish both to
          himself and others ample grounds for deep consideration. For, as the
          people, in devising from time to time new modes of sinning, displayed
          so much cunning in their attempts to provoke God's anger, so we ought
          the more to be filled with fear on that account. Moreover, when he
          says that they envied Moses and Aaron, his meaning is, that, acting
          under the influence of diabolic pride, they had risen up against God,
          and were endeavoring to throw off the yoke which he had laid upon
          them; according as Moses also said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "What am I, and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against us?" (Numbers
          16:11)
        </p>
        <p>
          As it was the will of God to rule the people by means of Moses and
          Aaron, not to submit to their rule was virtually to set themselves
          obstinately to resist the authority of God himself. There is therefore
          great importance attached to the term, envy, namely, that at the very
          time when God was treating the children of Israel with the utmost
          kindness and care, they yet were discontented with their lot, and
          rebelled against him. Could such madness serve any other purpose than
          to show, that, casting off all farther dependence upon the providence
          of God for their support, they aspire to rise above the very heavens?
          In this sense Aaron is called the saint of Jehovah, in order that we
          might know that both he and Moses were equally identified with God;
          for under the person of the one, the designation is applied to both,
          and in this way the prophet shows that they had been Divinely invested
          with that authority which they were exercising. In renouncing their
          authority, therefore, and, to the utmost of their power, dishonoring
          these saints, Dathan and Abiram were rebelling not against men, but
          against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          17 The earth opened The heinousness of their sin may be seen in the
          magnitude of the punishment by which it was visited. But the design of
          the prophet was to accuse and reprove publicly the obstinacy of the
          people, who, so far from being bettered by their corrections,
          (although the vengeance of God was so terrible as almost to move the
          very stones,) conducted themselves the more perversely. That was
          surely an awfully ominous event, when the earth swallowed up alive
          Dathan and Abiram, and all their accomplices; and when fire coming
          down from heaven consumed them, according to the saying of Moses,
        </p>
        <p>
          "If any thing common happen to these men, then believe not that God
          who ruleth in heaven rules over you and me; but if this new and
          extraordinary thing happen, namely, that the earth open her mouth and
          swallow them up, then indeed believe that I am sent by God," Numbers
          16:29
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Israelites were so infatuated as to rise in rebellion against
          God, then did the terrible nature of their distemper appear in that it
          could not be cured by the stringent remedy which was applied to it.
          And as even hypocrites are afraid when they feel the severity of God,
          it was the height of folly in them to fret and quarrel with God where
          he was visiting their iniquities with stripes. Should any one ask why
          God charges the faults of a few upon the whole body of the people? the
          answer is obvious; for although there were only two individuals who
          were the principal abettors of the conspiracy, and along with them two
          hundred and seventy seditious persons, yet it would seem, from the
          murmurings and cavillings of the whole congregation, that they also
          were affected with the same distemper. The punishment did not extend
          beyond the captains and ringleaders of this wicked conspiracy, it
          being the design of God to mitigate it, and to spare the people at
          large, who nevertheless had been most desirous of innovation, seeing
          they could not endure the authority of Moses and Aaron.
        </p>
        <p>
          19. They made a calf. Here he represents their rebellion as
          exceedingly base, in that they abandoned the true worship of God, and
          made to themselves a calf. For although it was their intention to
          worship God in this manner, yet the prophet reprehends their brutal
          stupidity, because they worshipped before the molten image, and
          represented God by the figure of an ox which eateth grass From this
          the prophet infers, that God had been robbed of his honor, and that
          all his glory had been tarnished. And surely it is so; for although
          the idolaters feign to serve God with great zeal, yet when, at the
          same time, they represent to themselves a God visible, they abandon
          the true God, and impiously make for themselves an idol. But he
          reproaches them with being guilty of still greater impiety, when he
          says, after the likeness of an ox that eateth grass; and contrasts
          with it their honor or glory. For seeing that God had clothed them
          with his own glory, what madness was it to substitute in place of him
          not only an ox, but the inanimate form of an ox, as if there were any
          resemblance between God who createth all kinds of food, and that
          stupid animal which feeds upon grass?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is necessary, however, to observe the design of the prophet, which
          is to point out the blindness of men as more base and abominable,
          because not contenting themselves with any common form of
          superstition, but casting off all sham they give themselves up to the
          most shocking forms of worshipping God. Had the people formed for
          themselves a likeness of God under the likeness of a man, even that
          would have been impiously robbing God of his due; how much more
          shameful was their conduct when they assimilated God to an ox? When
          men preserve their life by eating and drinking, they acknowledge how
          frail they are, because they derive from dead creatures the means of
          its continuation. How much greater is the dishonor done to God when he
          is compared to the brutal tribes? Moreover, the comparison referred to
          increases the enormity of their guilt. For what credit was it for a
          holy people to worship the inanimate likeness of an ox instead of the
          true God? But God had condescended to spread out the overshadowing
          wings of his glory upon the children of Abraham, that he might put on
          them the highest honor. Therefore, in denuding themselves of this
          honor, they had exposed their own baseness to the derision of all the
          nations of the earth. And hence Moses employs the phrase of nakedness,
          when he is showing that crime of idolatry:
        </p>
        <p>
          "And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had made
          them naked unto their shame among their enemies)"<br />Exodus 32:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should any one be disposed to say that the ark of the covenant was a
          representation of God, my answer is, That that symbol was given to the
          children of Israel, not to engross the whole of their attention, but
          only for the purpose of assisting and directing them in the spiritual
          worship of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. They forgot God The prophet again repeats that the people had
          sinned not simply through ignorance, but also wilfully, inasmuch as
          God had already given a very palpable manifestation of his power and
          glory. And as he makes himself known in the creation of the heavens
          and of the earth, the blindness of men is totally inexcusable. But far
          more aggravating is the sin of the children of Israel, who, after God
          had made himself known to them, in the most condescending manner, cast
          him off altogether, and gave themselves up to the practice of brutish
          idolatry. And God having from heaven put forth his Almighty power for
          their salvation, there must surely be no little importance attached to
          such displays of his power as proclaim the praise and honor of his
          great name. Had he merely given an ordinary token of his power, even
          that ought to have attracted so much consideration as should have kept
          the people in the fear and worship of God. Now, that these miracles
          were so very notable, or rather terrible and rare, the people acted a
          very base part to shut their eyes upon them, and give themselves over
          to idolatry. For as the darkness is dispelled by the beamy lustre of
          the sun, so all inventions and perverse errors should vanish before
          such knowledge of God.<br />
