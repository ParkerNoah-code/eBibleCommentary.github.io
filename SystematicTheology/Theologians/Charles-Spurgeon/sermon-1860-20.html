        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.306)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 1st, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body
          do they come; Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
          except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body
          that shall be but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of some other
          grain but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
          seed his own body." -- 1 Corinthians 15:35-38.
        </p>
        <p>
          We preach with words; God preacheth to us in acts and deeds. If we
          would but perceive it, creation and providence are two continual
          sermons, streaming from the mouth of God. The seasons are four
          evangelists, each of them having his testimony to utter to us. Doth
          not summer preach to us of God's bounty, of the richness of his
          goodness, of that lavish munificence with which he has been pleased to
          supply the earth, not simply with food for man, but with delights for
          both ear and eye in the beauteous landscape the melodious birds, and
          the flowers of various hue? Have you never heard the still small voice
          of autumn, who bears the wheatsheaf, and whispers to us in the
          rustling of the seer leaf? He bids us prepare to die. "All we," saith
          he, "do fade as a leaf, and all our righteousnesses are but as filthy
          rags." Then comes winter, crowned with snow, and he thunders out a
          most mighty sermon, which, if we would but listen to it, might well
          impress us with the terrors of God's vengeance, and let us see how
          soon he can strip the earth of all its pleasantries, and enrobe it in
          storm, when he shall come himself to judge the earth with
          righteousness, and the people with equity. But it seems to me that
          spring reads us a most excellent discourse upon the grand doctrine of
          revelation. This very month of April, which, if it be not the very
          entrance of spring, yet certainly introduces us to the fullness of it;
          this very month&gt; bearing by its name the title of the opening
          month, speaks to us of the resurrection. As we have walked through our
          gardens, fields, and woods, we have seen the flower-buds ready to
          burst upon the trees, and the fruit-blossoms hastening to unfold
          themselves; we have seen the buried flowers upstarting from the sod,
          and they have spoken to us with sweet, sweet voice, the words, "Thou
          too shalt rise again, thou too shalt be buried in the earth like seeds
          that are lost in winter, but thou shalt rise again, and thou shalt
          live and blossom in eternal spring."
        </p>
        <p>
          I propose this morning, as God shall enable, to listen to that voice
          of spring, proclaiming the doctrine of the resurrection, a meditation
          all the more appropriate from the fact, that the Sabbath before last
          we considered the subject of Death, and I hope that then very solemn
          impressions were made upon our minds. May the like impressions now
          return, accompanied with more joyous ones, when we shall look beyond
          the grave, through the valley of the shadow of death, to that bright
          light in the distance -- the splendours and glory of life and
          immortality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In speaking to you upon this text, I would remark in the outset, that
          the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead is a doctrine peculiar to
          Christianity. The heathen, by the feeble light of nature, were able to
          spell out the truth of the immortality of the soul. Those professors
          of religion who deny that immortality, are not so far advanced in
          learning as the heathen themselves. When you meet with any who think
          that the soul of man may possibly become annihilated, make them a
          present of that little catechism brought out by the Westminster
          Assembly, which bears the title, "Catechism for the Young and
          Ignorant." Let them read that through, and begin to understand that
          God hath not made man in vain. The resurrection of the body was that
          which was new in the apostolic times. When Paul stood up on Mars hill,
          in the midst of the learned assembly of the Areopagites, had he
          spoke." to them about the immortality of the soul, they would not have
          laughed; they would have respected him, for this was one of the
          sublime truths which their own wise men had taught, but when he event
          on to assert that the flesh and blood which was laid in the tomb
          should yet arise again, that bones which had become the dwelling place
          of worms, that flesh which had corrupted and decayed, should actually
          start afresh into life, that the body as well as the soul should live,
          some mocked' and others said, "We will hear thee again of this
          matter." The fact is, reason teaches the immortality of the spirit, it
          is revelation alone which teaches the immortality of the body. It is
          Christ alone who hath brought life and immortality to light by the
          gospel. He was the clearest proclaimer of that grand truth. Albeit
          that it had lain in the secret faith of many of the ancient people of
          God before, yet he it was who first set forth in clear terms the grand
          truth that there should be a resurrection of the dead, both of the
          just and of the unjust. AS far as I know, the doctrine has not been
          disputed in the Christian church. There have been some few heretics
          who have denied it at divers times, but they have been so few, so
          utterly insignificant, that it is not worth while to take any notice
          of their scruples, or of the objections which they have urged. Instead
          thereof, we will turn to our text; one will assume that the doctrine
          is true, and so proceed to utter some words of explanation upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, our text suggests the real indentity of the resurrection
          body. The apostle uses the figure of a seed, a shrivelled grain of
          wheat. It is put into the ground, there it dies all the farinaceous
          part of it decays and forms a peculiarly fine soil, into which the
          life-germ strikes itself, and upon which the lifegerm feeds. The seed
          itself dies, with the exception of a particle almost too small to be
          perceived, which is the real life contained within the wheat.
          By-and-bye we see a green blade upstarting: that grows, swells, and
          increases, until it comes to be corn in the ear, and afterwards the
          full corn in the ear. Now no one has any suspicion but that the same
          wheat arises from the soil into which it was cast. Put into the earth,
          we believe it springs up, and we are accustomed to talk of it in our
          ordinary language as being the very same seed which we sowed, although
          the difference is striking and marvellous. Here you have a plant some
          three feet high, bearing many grains of wheat, and there you had the
          other day a little shrivelled grain; yet no one doubts but that the
          two are the same. So shall it be in the resurrection of the dead. The
          body is here but as a shrivelled seed; there is no beauty in it that
          we should desire it. It is put into a grave, like wheat that is sown
          in the earth, there it rots and it decays, but God preserves within it
          a sort of life germ which is immortal, and when the trump of the
          archangel shall shake the heavens and the earth it shad expand to the
          full flower of manhood, which shall blossom from the earth. a far more
          glorious form than the manhood which was buried. You are, my brethren,
          today, but as a heap of wheat, a heap of poor shrivelled corn. Despite
          that earthly beauty which makes glad our countenances, we are after
          all shrivelled and worthless, compared with what your bodies shall be
          when they shall awake from their beds of silent dust and cold damp
          clay. Yet whole they shall be different, they shall be precisely the
          same, it shall be the same body; the identity shall be preserved.
          Though there shall seem to be but little similarity, yet shall no man
          doubt but that the very body which was sown in the earth hath sprung
          up to eternal life. I suppose that if I should bring here a certain
          grain of seed, and you had never seen the image of the plant into
          which it would ripen, and I should submit it to a thousand persona
          here present, and ask them this question -- "What form will this seed
          assume when it shall grow into a plant and bear a flower?" none of you
          could possibly tell what it would be like; yet when you saw it spring
          up you would say, "Well, I have no doubt that the heart's-ease sprang
          from its own seed. I am sure that a violet springs from a violet seed.
          I cannot doubt that the lily hath its own appropriate root." And
          another time, when you come to see the seed, you perhaps imagine you
          see some little likeness, at least you never mistrust the identity.
          Though there are wide extremes of difference between the tiny mustard
          seed and the great tree beneath the branches of which the birds of the
          air build their nests, yet you never for a moment question but what
          they are precisely the same. The identity is preserved. So shall it be
          in the resurrection of the dead. The difference shall be
          extraordinary, yet shall the body be still the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to affirm this, the ancient Christian church was in the habit
          in their creed of adding a sentence to the Article which runs thus: --
          "I believe in the resurrection of the dead." They added, in Latin
          words to this effect: -- "I believe in the resurrection of the dead,
          of this very flesh and blood." I do not know that the addition was
          ever authorized by the church, but it was continually used, especially
          at the time when there was a discussion as to the truth of the
          doctrine of the resurrection of the body. The very flesh and blood
          that is buried, the very eyes that are closed in death, the very hand
          which stiffens by my corpse, these very members shall live again --
          not the identical particles of the same matter any more than the
          self-same particles of the wheat spring up to make a blade, and to
          make full corn in the ear. Yet shall they be identical, in the true
          sense of the term, they shall spring up from this body -- shall be the
          true result and development of this poor flesh and blood, which we now
          drag about with us here below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ten thousand objections have been raised against this, but they are
          all readily answerable. Some have said, "But when men's bodies are
          dead, and are committed to the grave, they are often digged up, and
          the careless sexton mixes them up with common mould; nay, it sometimes
          happens that they are carted away from the churchyard, and strewn over
          the fields, to become a rich manure for wheat, so that the particles
          of the body are absorbed into the corn that is growing, and they
          travel round in a circle until they become the food of man. So that
          the particle which may have been in the body of one man enters into
          the body of another. Now," say they, "how can all these particles be
          tracked?" Our answer is if it were necessary, every atom could be
          traced. Omnipotence and Omniscience could do it. If it were needful
          that God should search and find out every individual atom that ever
          existed, he would be able to detect the present abode of every single
          particle. The astronomer is able to tell the position of one star by
          the aberration of the motion of another, by his calculation, apart
          from observation, he can discover an unknown orb; its hugeness puts it
          within his reach. But to God there is nothing little or great; he can
          find out the orbit of one atom by the aberration in the orbit of
          another atom -- he can pursue and overtake each separate particle. But
          recollect, this is not necessary at all, for, as I said before, the
          identity may be preserved without there being the same atoms. Just go
          back to the excellent illustration of our text. The wheat is just the
          same, but in the new wheat that has grown up there may not be one
          solitary particle of that matter which was in the seed cast into the
          ground. A little seed that shall not weigh the hundredth part of an
          ounce falls into the earth, and springs up and produces a forest tree
          that shall weigh two tons. Now, if there be any part of the original
          seed in the tree, it must be but in the proportional of a millionth
          part, or something less than that. And yet is the tree positively
          identical with the seed -- it is the same thing. And so there may only
          be a millionth part of the particles of my body in the new body which
          I shall wear but yet it may still be the same. It is not the identity
          of the matter that will make positive identity. And I shall show you
          that again. Are you not aware that our bodies are changing -- that in
          about every ten years we have different bodies from what we had ten
          years ago? That is to say, by decay, and the continual wearing away of
          our flesh, there is not in this body I have here, a single particle
          that was in my body ten years ago, and yet I am the same man. I know I
          am precisely the same. So you. You shall have been born in America,
          and lived there twenty years; you shall suddenly be transferred to
          India, and live there another twenty years; you come back to America
          to see your friends -- you are the same man, they know you, recognize
          you, you are precisely the same individual; but yet philosophy teaches
          us a fact which cannot be denied -- that your body would have changed
          twice in the time you have been absent from your friends; that every
          particle is gone, and has had its place supplied by another; and yet
          the body is the same. So that it is not necessary there should be the
          same particles; it is not needful that you should track every atom and
          bring it back in order that the body should preserve its identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you never heard the story of the wife of Peter Martyr, a
          celebrated reformer, who died some years before the time of Queen
          Mary? Since his enemies could not reach his body, they took up the
          body of his wife after she was dead, and buried it in a dunghill.
          During the reign of Elizabeth, the body was removed from its
          contemptuous hiding-place; it was then reduced to ashes. In order that
          the Romanists, if they should ever prevail again, might never do
          dishonor to that body, they took the ashes of Peter Martyr's wife, and
          mixed them with the reputed ashes of a Romish saint. Mixing the two
          together, they said, "Now these Romanists will never defile this body,
          because they will be afraid of desecrating the relics of their own
          saint." Perhaps some wiseacres man say, "How can these two be
          separated?" Why, they could be divided readily enough if God willed to
          do it; for granted that God is omniscient omnipotent, and you have
          never to ask how, for Omniscience and Omnipresence put the question
          out of court, and decide the thing at once. Besides, it is not
          necessary that it should be so. The life-germs of the two bodies may
          not have mixed together. God has set his angels to watch over them, as
          he set Michael to watch over the body of Moses, and he will bring out
          the two life-germs, and they shall be developed and the two bodies
          shall start up separately at the sound of the archangel's trump.
          Remember, then, and doubt not that the very body in which you sinned
          shall be the very body in which you shall suffer in hell; and the body
          in which you believe in Christ, and in which you yield yourselves to
          God, shall be the very body in which you shall walk the golden
          streets, and in which you shall praise the name of God for ever and
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much upon this first point. But observe, while the identity is
          real, the transformation is glorious. The body here is mortal, always
          subject to decay. We dwell in a poor uncomfortable tent, continually
          is the canvas being rent, the cords are being loosed, and the tent
          pins are being pulled up. We are full of sufferings, and aches, and
          pains, which are but the premonitions of coming death. We all know,
          some by our decayed teeth, which are, as I said the other day, but the
          emblems of a decayed man; others by those grey hairs which are
          scattered here and there; we all know that our bodies are so
          constituted that they cannot remain here except for a limited period,
          and they must -- so God has willed it -- return to their native dust.
          Not so, however, the new body: "It is sown in corruption, it is raised
          in incorruption. "It will be a body upon which the tooth of time can
          have no power, and into which the dart of death can never be thrust.
          Age shall roll after age, but that body shall exist in everlasting
          youth. It shall sing, but never shall its song be stayed by weakness;
          it shall fly, but never shall its flight flag with weariness. There
          shall be no signs of mortality; the shroud, the mattock, and the spade
          are never seen in heaven. Such a thing as an open grave shall never
          appear in the celestial kingdom, there they live, live, live, but
          never, never, never shall they die. See then, how different the body
          must be; for as this body is constituted, every nerve and every blood
          vessel tells me I must die. It cannot be otherwise. I must endure this
          stern decree, "Dust to dust, earth to earth, ashes to ashes," but in
          heaven every nerve of the new body shall cry, "Immortality." Every
          part of that new frame shall speak for itself, and tell to the
          immortal spirit that they are everlasting companions, managed in
          eternal wedlock.
        </p>
        <p>
          There shall be, moreover, a great change in the new body as to its
          beauty. "It is sown in dishonor; it shall be raised in glory." The old
          metaphor employed by all preachers upon this doctrine must be used
          again. You see here a crawling caterpillar, a picture of yourself, a
          creature that eats and drinks, and may readily be trodden on. Wait a
          few weeks, that caterpillar shall spin itself enshroud, lie down,
          become inactive, and sleep. A picture of what you shall do. You must
          spin your winding-sheet and then be laid in the tomb. But wait awhile;
          when the warmth of the sun shall come that apparently lifeless thing
          shall burst its sheath. The chrysalis shall fall off, and the insect
          fly forth equipped with glittering wings. Having arrived at its full
          state of perfection, the imago the very image of the creature shall be
          seen by us all dancing in the sunbeam. So shall we after passing
          through our wormhood here to our chrysalis state in the grave, burst
          our coffins and mount aloft glorious winged creatures made like unto
          the angels; -- the same creatures, but oh! so changed, so different,
          that we should scarce know our former selves if we could be able to
          meet them again after we have been glorified in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          There shall be a change, then, in our form and nature. Old master
          Spenser, who was a rare hand at making metaphors, says, "The body here
          is like an old rusty piece of iron, but Death shall be the blacksmith,
          he shall take it and he shall make it hot in his fire, until it shall
          sparkle and send forth burning heat and look bright and shining." And
          so surely is it. We are thrust into the earth as into the fire, and
          there shall we be made to sparkle and to shine and to be full of
          radiance, no more the rusty things that we once were, but fiery
          spirits, like the cherubim and the seraphim, we shall wear a power and
          a glory the like of which we have not even yet conceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, another transformation shall take place, namely, in power. "It
          is sown in weakness, it is raised in power." The same body that is
          weak, shall be raised in power. We are puny things here; there is a
          limit to our labors, and our usefulness is straightened by reason of
          our inability to perform what we would. And oh, bow weak we become
          when we die I A man must be carried by his own friends to his own
          grave; he cannot even lay himself down in his last resting-place.
          Passively he submits to be laid out, to be wrapped up in his winding
          sheet, and to be shut up in the darkness of the grave. Silently,
          passively he submits to be carried away with the pall covered over
          him, and to be put into the earth. The clods are shovelled over him,
          but he knows it not, neither could he resist his burial if he were
          conscious of it. But that powerless body shall be raised in power.
          That was a fine idea of Martin Luther, which he borrowed from St.
          Anselm, that the saints shall be so strong when they are risen from
          the dead, that if they chose they could shake the world; they could
          pull up islands by their roots, or hurl mountains into the air. Some
          modern writers, borrowing their ideas from Milton, where he speaks of
          the battles of the angels, where they plucked up the hills with all
          their shaggy loads, rivers and trees at once, and hurled them at the
          fallen spirits, have taught that we shall be clothed with gigantic
          forge. I think if we do not go the length of the poets, we have every
          reason to believe that the power of the risen body will be utterly
          inconceivable. These, however, are but guesses at the truth; this
          great mystery is yet beyond us. I believe that when I shall enter upon
          my new body, I shall be able to fly from one spot to another, like a
          thought, as swiftly as I will; I shall be here and there, swift as the
          rays of light. From strength to strength, my spirit shall be able to
          leap onward to obey the behests of God; upborne with wings of ether,
          it shall flash its way across that shoreless sea, and see the glory of
          God in all his works, and yet ever behold his face. For the eye shall
          then be strong enough to pierce through leagues of distance, and the
          memory shall never fail. The heart shall be able to love to a fiery
          degree, and the head to comprehend right thoroughly. It doth not yet
          appear what we shall be. But, brethren and sisters, to come back to
          reality, and leave fiction for a moment, though it doth not appear
          what we shad be, yet we know that when he shall appear, we shall be
          like him, for we shall see him as he is. And do you know what we shall
          be like, if we shall be like him? Behold the picture of what Jesus
          Christ is like, and we shall be like him. "I saw," saith John, "one
          like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and
          girt about the paps with a golden girdle His head. and his hairs were
          white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of
          fire, and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
          furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his
          right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
          sword, and his countenance was as tee sun shineth in his strength. And
          when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead." Such shall we be when we
          are like Christ; what tongue can tell, what soul can guess the glories
          that surround the saints when they' start from their beds of dust, and
          rise to immortality.

          But now, to turn away from these, which I fear to very many of you are
          rather uninteresting particulars, let me give you one or two figures
          which may show to you the change which shall take place in us on the
          day of resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you see yonder a beggar? he is picking rags from a dunghill, he
          pulls out piece after piece from the heap of dust, as he uses his
          rake, you may see the like any day, if you will go to those great
          dustyards in Agar Town. There he pulls out piece after piece, and puts
          it in his basket. What can be the value of those miserable old rags?
          He takes them away, they are carried off, picked, sorted, rag to its
          own rag, like to like. By-and-bye they are washed, they are put into
          the mill, they are beaten hard, they are smashed, they are ground to
          pulp, and what is that I see just coming out of yonder mill? A clear
          white sheet, without a stain and whence came this? "I am the son of
          the old rag," saith he, "nay, I am the identical rag that was but a
          few hours ago picked from the dung-heap." Oh! strange! Doth purity
          come out of impurity, and doth this beauty, this utility come out of
          that which was neither comely nor useful, but which men loathed, and
          cast away as a worthless thing? See here, brethren, the picture of
          yourselves; your bodies are like rags, put away into this vast
          dunghill earth" and there buried, but the angel shall come and sort
          you, body to its body, the righteous to the righteous, the wicked to
          the wicked, they shall come together, bone to his bone and flesh to
          his flesh; and what do I see? -- I behold a body like unto an angel,
          with eyes of fire, and a face like the brightness of the sun, and
          wings like lightnings for swiftness. Whence art thou, thou bright
          spirit? I am he that was buried, I am that thing that once was worms'
          meat, but now I am glorious through the name of Jesus' and through the
          power of God. You have there before you a picture of the resurrection,
          a homely picture, it is true, but one which may vividly convey the
          idea to homely minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another -- one used of old by that mighty preacher, Chrysostom --
          there is an old house, a straight and narrow cottage, and the
          inhabitant of it often shivers with the cold winter, and is greatly
          oppressed by the heat of summer; it is ill adapted to his wants, the
          windows are too small and very dark, he cannot keep his treasure
          safely therein; he is often a prisoner; and when I have passed by his
          house I have heard him sighing at the window: "Oh, wretched man that I
          am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death." The good master
          comes, the landlord of the house, he speaks to the tenant, and he bids
          him come away, "I am about to pull down thy old house," saith he, "and
          I would not have thee here while I am pulling it stone from stone,
          lest thou be hurt and injured. Come away with me and live in my
          palace, while I am pulling thy old house to pieces." He does so, and
          every stone of the old house is thrown down; it is levelled with the
          ground, and even the foundations are dug up. Another is built: it is
          of costly slabs of marble, the windows thereof are pure and clear, all
          its gates are of agate, and all its borders of precious stones, while
          all the foundations thereof are of chrysolite, and the roof thereof is
          of jasper. And now the master of the house speaks to the old
          inhabitant, "Come back, and I will show thee the house which I have
          built for thee." O what joy, when that inhabitant shall enter and find
          it so well adapted to his wants, where every power shall have full
          range, where he shall see God out of its windows, not as through a
          glass, darkly, but face to face, where he could invite even Christ
          himself to come and sup with him, and not feel that the house is
          beneath the dignity of the Son of Man. You know the parable, you know
          how your old house, this clay body, is to be pulled down, how your
          spirit is to dwell in heaven for a little while without a body, and
          how afterwards you are to enter into a house not made with hands,
          eternal in the heavens, a mansion which is holy, incorruptible, and
          undefiled, and which shall never decay.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use yet a fresh figure, I see a beggar passing by a rich man's
          door, that poor wretch is covered with filth, his garments are hanging
          about him in pieces as if the wind would blow all away, and drive both
          man and garments amongst the rags upon the dunghill. How he shivers,
          how he seeks to pull about him that scant cloak which will not meet
          around his loins, and will not shield him from the blast. As for his
          shoes, they are indeed old and clouted, and all his garments are of
          such a sort that one never could know the original, for they have been
          mended and patched a thousand times, and now they need to be mended
          and patched again. He is freely invited to come into the rich man's
          hall, we will not tell you what is done in the meantime, but we will
          see him come out of that door again, and would you know him. Would you
          believe that he is the same man? He has been washed and cleansed; on
          his back there hangs the imperial purple, while on his head glitters a
          brilliant crown; his feet are shod with silver, and on his hands there
          are rings of gold. About the paps he wears a golden girdle; and as he
          comes abroad bright spirits wait on him and do him honor angels wait
          to be his servants, and think it to be their highest pleasure to fly
          to do his will. Is this the same man and is this the same dress? It is
          the same. By some marvellous might, rather by a divine energy, God has
          received this beggar, taken him into the inner chamber of the grave;
          has washed him from all imperfections; and now he comes out as one of
          the princes of the blood royal of heaven. And as is his nature, such
          is his apparel; as is his dignity, such is his estate) and such the
          company of servants who wait upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to multiply illustrations, we will use but one more. I see before
          me an old and battered cup, which many a black lip hath touched, out
          of which many a villain's throat has received moisture. It is battered
          and covered over with filth. Who could tell what metal it is? It is
          brought in and given to the silversmith, he no sooner receives it,
          than he begins to break it into pieces, he dashes it into shivers
          again and again, he pounds it until he has broken it, and then puts it
          into his fining pot and melts it. Now you begin to see it sparkle
          again, and by and bye he beats it out and fashions it into a goodly
          chalice, out of which a king may drink. Is this the same? the very
          same thing, This glorious cup; is this the old battered silver we saw
          just now; silver did I say, it looked like battered filth. Yes it is
          the same, and we who are here below like vessels, alas! too unfit for
          the master's use; vessels which have even given comfort to the evil
          ones, and helped to do the work of Satan, we shall be put into the
          furnace of the grave, and be there melted down and friend and
          fashioned into a glorious wine cup that shall stand upon the
          banqueting table of the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus sought to illustrate the change, and now I will occupy
          your attention but one or two minutes on another thought which seems
          to lie within the range of my text. We have had the real identity
          under the glorious transformation. I bring you back to a thought
          kindred to the first. There will be in the bodies of the righteous an
          undoubted personality of character. If you sow barley, it will not
          produce wheat: if you sow tares, they will not spring up in the form
          of rye. Every grain hath its own peculiar form: God hath given to
          every seed his own body. So, my brothers and sisters, there are
          differences among us here; no two bodies are precisely alike: there
          are marks on our countenances, and in our bodily conformation, that
          show that we are different. We are of one blood, but not of one
          fashion. Well, when we are put into the grave we shall crumble back,
          and come to the same elements; but when we rise we shall every one of
          us rise diverse from the other. The body of Paul shall not produce a
          body precisely like that of Peter. Nor shall the flesh of Andrew bring
          forth a new body like that of the sons of Zebedee, but to every seed
          his own body. In the case of our blessed Lord and Master you win
          remember that when he rose himself from the dead he preserved his
          personality, there were still the wounds in his hands, and still there
          was the spear-mark in his side. I do not doubt that when he underwent
          his transfiguration, and at the time of his ascension up to heaven, he
          still retained the marks of his wounds. For do we not sing, and is not
          our song based upon Scripture? --
        </p>
        <p>He looks like a Lamb that has been slain,</p>
        <p>And wears his priesthood still.</p>
        <p>
          So, brethren, though of course we shall retain no weaknesses, nothing
          which will cause sorrow, yet every Christian will retain his
          individuality; he will be like and yet unlike all his fellows. As we
          know Isaiah from Jeremy here, so shall we know them above. As I differ
          from you here, if we two shall together praise God, there shall be
          some difference between us above. Not the difference in failings, but
          the difference in the perfections of the form of the new body. I
          sometimes think martyrs will wear their scars. And why should they
          not? It were a loss to them if they should lose their honors. Perhaps
          they shall wear their ruby crown in Paradise, and we shall know them
          --
        </p>
        <p>"Foremost mongst the sons of light</p>
        <p>'Midst the bright ones doubly bright."</p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the men who come from the catacombs of Rome will wear some
          sort of pallor on their brow that will show that they came from
          darkness, where they saw not the light of the sun. Perhaps the
          minister of Christ, though he shall not need to say to his fellows,
          "know the Lord," shall still be chief among the tellers out of the
          ways of God. Perhaps the sweet singer of Israel shall still be
          foremost in the choir of the golden harps, and loudest among them that
          shall lead the strain. And if these he fancies, yet am I sure that one
          star differeth from another star in glory. Orion shall not be
          confounded with Arcturus, nor shall Mazaroth for a moment be
          confounded with Orion. We shall an be separate and distinct. Perhaps
          we shall each one have our constellation there, as we shall cluster
          into our own societies, and gather around those whom we best have
          known on earth. Personality win be maintained. I do not doubt but what
          you will know Isaiah in heaven, and you will recognize the great
          preachers of the ancient Christian church; you will be able to speak
          with Chrysostom, and wilt talk with Whitfield. It may be you shall
          have for your companions those who were your companions here; those
          with whom you took sweet counsel, and walked to the house of God,
          shall be with you there, and you shall know them, and with
          transporting joy you shall there together tell your former trials and
          ancient triumphs, and the glories you are alike made to share.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treasure up, then, these things, the identity of your body after its
          glorious transformation, and, at the same time, the personality which
          will prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want, now, your solemn attention for some five minutes, while I
          sketch a most fearful contrast here. The things I have already spoken
          should make the children of God happy. At Stratford-on-Bow, in the
          days of Queen Mary, there was once a stake erected for the burning of
          two martyrs, one of them a lame man, the other a blind man. Just when
          the fire was lit, the lame man hurled away his staff, and turning
          round said to the blind man, "Courage, brother, this fire will cure us
          both." So can the righteous say of the grave, "Courage, the grave will
          cure us all, we shall leave our infirmities behind us." What patience
          this should give us to endure all our trials, for they are not of long
          duration. They are but as the carvings of the graver's tool, shaping
          these rough blocks of clay, to bring them into the right form and
          shape, that they may bear the image of the heavenly. But the contrast
          is awful. Brethren, the wicked must rise again from the dead. The lip
          with which you have drunk the intoxicating drink till you have reeled
          again, that lip shall be used in drinking down the fiery wrath of God.
          Remember, too, ungodly woman, the eyes that are full of lust will one
          be full of horror, the ear with which you listen to lascivious
          conversation must listen to the sullen moans, the hollow groans, and
          shrieks of tortured ghosts. Be not deceived; you sinned in your body,
          you will be damned in your body. When you die your spirit must suffer
          alone, that will be the beginning of hell, but your body must rise
          again, then this very flesh in which you have transgressed the laws of
          God this very body must smart for it. It must he in the fire and burn,
          and crack, and writhe throughout eternity. Your body will be raised
          incorruptible, otherwise the fire would consume it. It will become
          like the asbestos stone, which lies in the flame and yet is never
          consumed. If it were this flesh and blood it would soon die under the
          pangs we must endure, but it will be a body all but omnipotent. As I
          spoke of the righteous having such great power, so shall you have; but
          it will be power to agonize, power to suffer, power to die, and yet to
          live, uncrushed by the stern foot of death. Think of this, ye
          sensualists, who care not for your souls, but who pamper your bodies;
          you shall have that fair complexion scorched away; those members that
          have become instruments of lust, shall become instruments of hell.
          Rotting as they will do in the grave, they shall nevertheless rise
          with a fiery immortality about them, and endure an eternity of agony
          and unutterable woe and punishment. Is not that enough to make a man
          tremble and cry, "God be merciful unto me a sinner?"
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, remember that while your body shall be identically the
          same, yet it too will be transformed, and as the wheat brings forth
          the wheat, so the nettle seed brings forth the nettle. What your body
          will be like I cannot tell, but perhaps as the body of the righteous
          will come to be like Christ, yours may become like the body of the
          devil, whatever that may be -- the same hideous conformation, the same
          demon gaze and hellish stare which characterize that proud archangel
          shall characterize you; you shall have the image and the lineaments of
          the first traitor stamped upon your fire-enduring face. Seeds of sin,
          are ye prepared to ripen into the fun blown flower of destruction? Ye
          seeds of evil, are ye ready to be scattered now from Death's hand, and
          then to spring up an awful harvest of tormented ones? Yet so it must
          be unless you turn to God. Except you repent, he has said, and he will
          do it, he is able to cast both body and soul into hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let me remind you yet once again, that there will be in you an
          undoubted personality, you will be known in hell. The drunkard shall
          have the drunkard's punishment; the swearer shall have the swearer's
          corner to himself. "Bind them up in bundles to burn, and cast them
          into the fire." Thus saith the voice of inflexible justice. You shall
          not suffer in another man's body but in your own, and you shall be
          known to be the very man that sinned against God. You shall be looked
          at by one who sees you to-day, if you die impenitent, who will say to
          you, "We went up to that hall together; we heard a sermon on the
          resurrection which had a frightful ending; we laughed at it, but we
          have found out that it is true." And one will say to the other, "I
          should have known you though we had not met these many years till we
          met in hell. I should have known you, there is something about your
          new body which lets me know that it is the same body that you had on
          earth." And then you will mutually say to one another, "These pangs
          that we are now enduring, this horror of great darkness, these chains
          of fire that are reserved for us, are they not well deserved?" And you
          will curse God together again, and suffer together, and will be made
          to feel that you have only received the due reward of your deeds. "Did
          not the man warn us," you will say, "did he not warn us, did he not
          bid us fly to Christ for refuge? -- did we not despise it, and make a
          jeer of what he said? We are rightly punished; we damned ourselves, we
          cut our own throats, we kindled hell for ourselves, and found the fuel
          of our own burning for ever and ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! my dear hearers, I cannot bear to stay on this subject; let me
          finish with just this word. "Whoever believeth on the Lord Jesus
          Christ shall be saved." That means you poor man, though perhaps you
          were drunk last night, and scarcely got up time enough to come here
          this morning. If thou believest, William, thou shalt be saved. This
          means thee, poor woman, harlot though thou be -- if thou cast thyself
          on Christ thou art saved. This means thee, respectable man, thou who
          trustest in thine own works -- if thou reliest on Christ thou shalt be
          saved, but not if thou trustest in thyself. Oh! be wise, be wise. May
          God give us grace now to learn that highest wisdom, and may we now
          look to the cross and to the quivering Lamb that bleeds upon it, and
          see him as he rises from the dead and ascends up on high, and
          believing in him; may we receive the hope and the assurance of a
          blissful resurrection in him.
