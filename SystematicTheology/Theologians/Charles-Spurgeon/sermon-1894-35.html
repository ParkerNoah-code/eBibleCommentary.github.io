          <i>Men.</i> <i>For that the leaders took the lead in Israel -- </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i>
          <i>For that the people offered themselves willingly -- </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>Tutti.</i> <i>Bless ye the LORD!</i></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>PRELUDE</p>
        <p><i>Men.</i> Hear, O ye kings --</p>
        <p><i>Women.</i> Give ear, O ye princes --</p>
        <p><i>Men.</i> I, even I, will sing unto the LORD --</p>
        <p><i>Women.</i> I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Tutti.</i> Lord, when thou wentest forth out of Seir, When thou
          marchedst out of the field of Edom,<br />The earth trembled, the
          heavens also dropped,<br />Yea, the clouds dropped water.<br />The
          mountains flowed down at the presence of the LORD, Even yon Sinai at
          the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>1. THE DESOLATION</p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,<br />In the days
          of Jael,<br />The highways were unoccupied,<br />And the travellers
          walked through byways;<br />The rulers ceased in Israel,<br />They
          ceased --
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> Until that I, Deborah, arose,<br />That I arose a mother
          in Israel.<br />They chose new gods;<br />Then was war in the
          gates:<br />Was there a shield or spear seen<br />Among forty thousand
          in Israel?
        </p>
        <p><i>Men.</i> <i>My heart is toward the governors of Israel -- </i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i>
          <i>Ye that offered yourselves willingly among the people -- </i>
        </p>
        <p><i>Tutti.</i> <i>Bless ye the LORD!</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> <i>Tell of it, ye that ride on white asses,</i>
          <i>Ye that sit on rich carpets,</i><br /><i
            >And ye that walk by the way: --
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> <i>Far from the noise of archers,</i><br /><i
            >In the places of drawing water: --
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Tutti.</i>
          <i>There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,</i>
          <i>Even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.</i>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>2. THE MUSTER</p>
        <p>
          <i>Tutti.</i> Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates --
        </p>
        <p>
          (<i>Men.</i> <i>Awake, awake, Deborah,</i><br /><i
            >Awake, awake, utter a song: --
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> <i>Arise, Barak,</i><br /><i
            >And lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</i
          >)
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Tutti.</i> Then came down a remnant of the nobles,<br />The people
          of the LORD came down for me against the mighty.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> Out of Ephraim came down they whose root is in Amalek --
        </p>
        <p><i>Men.</i> After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples --</p>
        <p><i>Women.</i> Out of Machir came down governors --</p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal's staff
        </p>
        <p><i>Women.</i> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah --</p>
        <p><i>Men.</i> As was Issachar, so was Barak:</p>
        <p><i>Tutti.</i> Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> By the watercourses of Reuben<br />There were great
          resolves of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> Why satest thou among the sheepfolds,<br />To hear the
          pipings for the flocks?
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> At the watercourses of Reuben<br />There were great
          searchings of heart!
        </p>
        <p><i>Women.</i> Gilead abode beyond Jordan --</p>
        <p><i>Men.</i> And Dan, why did he remain in ships? --</p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,<br />And abode
          by his creeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the
          death,<br />And Naphtali upon the high places of the field.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>3. THE BATTLE AND ROUT</p>
        <p><i>Strophe</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> The kings came and fought;<br />Then fought the kings of
          Canaan,<br />In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: -- <br />They took
          no gain of money!
        </p>
        <p><i>Antistrophe</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> They fought from heaven,<br />The stars in their courses
          fought against Sisera.<br />The river Kishon swept them away, --
          <br />That ancient river, the river Kishon!
        </p>
        <p><i>Strophe</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> O my soul, march on with strength!<br />Then did the
          horsehoofs stamp<br />By reason of the pransings,<br />The pransings
          of their strong ones.
        </p>
        <p><i>Antistrophe</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, Curse ye
          bitterly the inhabitants thereof;<br />Because they came not to the
          help of the LORD,<br />To the help of the LORD against the mighty!
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>4. THE RETRIBUTION</p>
        <p><i>Strophe</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Men.</i> Blessed above women shall Jael be, the wife of Heber the
          Kenite,<br />Blessed shall she be above women in the tent!<br />He
          asked water, and she gave him milk;<br />She brought him butter in a
          lordly dish.<br />She put her hand to the nail,<br />And her right
          hand to the workman's hammer;<br />And with the hammer she smote
          Sisera.<br />She smote through his head,<br />Yea, she pierced and
          struck through his temples.<br />At her feet he bowed, he fell, he
          lay:<br />At her feet he bowed, he fell:<br />Where he bowed, there he
          fell down dead!
        </p>
        <p><i>Antistrophe</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>Women.</i> Through the window she looked forth, and cried, The
          mother of Sisera, through the lattice,<br />"Why is his chariot so
          long in coming?<br />Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?"<br />Her
          wise ladies answered her,<br />Yea, she returned answer to herself,<br />"Have
          they not found,<br />Have they not divided the spoil?<br />A damsel,
          two damsels to every man;<br />To Sisera a spoil of divers colours,<br />A
          spoil of divers colours of embroidery,<br />Of divers colours of
          embroidery on both<br />sides, on the necks of the spoil!"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Tutti.</i> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD:<br />But let
          them that love him be as the sun<br />when he goeth forth in his
          might!
