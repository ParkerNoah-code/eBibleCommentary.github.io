        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.503)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, April 5th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
          with him: knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no
          more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he
          died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
          Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
          alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." -- Romans 6:8-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostles never traveled far from the simple facts of Christ's
          life, death, resurrection, ascension, exaltation, and second advent.
          These things, of which they were the witnesses, constituted the staple
          of all their discourses. Newton has very properly said that the two
          pillars of our religion are, the work of Christ for us, and his work
          in us by the Holy Spirit. If you want to find the apostles, you will
          surely discover them standing between these two pillars; they are
          either discoursing upon the effect of the passion in our
          justification, or its equally delightful consequence in our death to
          the world and our newness of life. What a rebuke this should be to
          those in modern times who are ever straining after novelties. There
          may be much of the Athenian spirit among congregations, but that
          should be no excuse for its being tolerated among ministers; we, of
          all men, should be the last to spend our time in seeking something
          new. Our business, my brethren, is the old labor of apostolic tongues,
          to declare that Jesus, who is the same yesterday to-day and for ever.
          We are mirrors reflecting the transactions of Calvary, telex scopes
          manifesting the distant glories of an exalted Redeemer. The nearer we
          keep to the cross, the nearer, I think, we keep to our true vocation.
          When the Lord shall be pleased to restore to his Church once more a
          fervent love to Christ, and when once again we shall have a ministry
          that is not only flavoured with Christ, but of which Jesus constitutes
          the sum and substance, then shall the Churches revive -- then shall
          the set time to favor Zion come. The goodly cedar which was planted by
          the rivers of old, and stretched out her branches far and wide, has
          become in these modern days like a tree dwarfed by Chinese art; it is
          planted by the rivers as aforetime, but it does not flourish, only let
          God the Holy Spirit give to us once again the bold and clear preaching
          of Christ crucified in all simplicity and earnestness, and the dwarf
          shall swell into a forest giant, each expanding bud shall burst into
          foliage, and the cedar shall tower aloft again, until the birds of the
          air shall lodge in the branches thereof. I need offer you no apology,
          then, for preaching on those matters which engrossed all the time of
          the apostles, and which shall shower unnumbered blessings on
          generations yet to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THE FACTS REFERRED TO IN THESE FOUR VERSES CONSTITUE THE GLORIOUS
          GOSPEL WHICH WE PREACH.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The first fact here very clearly indicated is that Jesus died. He
          who was divine, and therefore immortal, bowed his head to death. He
          whose human nature was alhed to the omnipotence of his divine nature,
          was pleased voluntarily to submit himself to the sword of death. He
          who was pure and perfect, and therefore deserved not death, which is
          the wages of sin, nevertheless condescended for our sake to yield
          himself up to die. This is the second note in the Gospel scale. The
          first note is incarnation, Jesus Christ became a man; angels thought
          this worthy of their songs, and made the heavens ring with midnight
          melodies. The second note is this, I say, that, being found in fashion
          as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the
          death of the cross. He died as a sacrifice. Methinks, after many lambs
          from the flocks of men had poured out their blood at the foot of the
          altar, it was a strange spectacle-to see God's Lamb brought to that
          same altar to be sacrificed. He is without spot or blemish, or any
          such thing. He is the firstling of the flock; he is the only one of
          the Great Master; a right royal, heavenly lamb. Such a Lamb had never
          been seen before. He is the Lamb who is worshipped in heaven, and who
          is to be adored world without end. Will that sacred head condescend to
          feel the axe? Will that glorious victim really be slain? Is it
          possible that God's Lamb will actually submit to die? He does so
          without a struggle; he is dumb in the shambles before the
          slaughterers; he gives up the warm blood of his heart to the hand of
          the executioner, that he might expiate the wrath of God. Tell it. Let
          heaven ring with music, and let hell be filled with confusion! Jesus,
          the Eternal Son of God, the Lamb of Jehovah's Passover, died. His
          hands were pierced; and his heart was broken; to prove how surely the
          spear had struck the mark, the vital fluid flowed in a double flood,
          even to the ground: -- Jesus died. If there were any doubt about this,
          there were doubt about your salvation and mine. If there were any
          reason to question this fact, then we might question the possibility
          of salvation. But Jesus died, and sin is put away. The sacrifice
          smokes to heaven; Jehovah smelleth a sweet savor, and is pleased
          through Christ the victim to accept the prayers, the offerings, and
          the persons of his people. Nor did he die as a victim only. He died as
          a substitute. We were drawn as soldiers for the great warfare, and we
          could not go, for we were feeble, and should have fallen in the
          battle, and have left our bones to be devoured of the dogs of hell.
          But he, the mighty Son of God, became the substitute for us; entered
          the battle-field; sustained the first charge of the adversary in the
          wilderness; three times he repulsed the grim fiend and all his host,
          smiting his assailants with the sword of the Spirit, until the enemy
          fled, and angels waited upon the weary Victor. The conflict was not
          over, the enemy had but retired to forge fresh artillery and recruit
          his scattered forces for a yet more terrible affray. For three years
          the great Substitute kept the field against continual onslaughts from
          the advance guard of the enemy, remaining conqueror in every skirmish.
          No adversary dared to show his face, or if he shot an arrow at him
          from a distance, our substitute caught the arrow on his shield, and
          laughed his foes to scorn. Devils were cast out of many that were
          possessed; whole legions of them were compelled to find refuge in a
          herd of swine; and Lucifer himself fell like lightning from the heaven
          of his power. At last the time came when hell had gathered up all its
          forces, and now was also come the hour when Christ, as our substitute,
          must carry his obedience to the utmost length; he must be obedient
          unto death. He has been a substitute up till now; will he now throw
          down his vicarious character? Will he now renounce our
          responsibilities, and declare that we may stand for ourselves? Not he.
          He undertook, and must go through. Sweating great drops of blood, he
          nevertheless flinches not from the dread assault. Wounded in hands and
          in feet he still maintained his ground, and though, for obedience
          sake, he bowed his head to die, yet in that dying he slew death, put
          his foot upon the dragons' neck, crushed the head of the old serpent,
          and beat our adversaries as small as the dust of the threshing-floor.
          Yes, the blessed Substitute has died. I say if there were a question
          about this, then we might have to die, but inasmuch as he died for us,
          the believer shall not die. The debt is discharged to the utmost
          farthing; the account is cleared; the balance is struck; the scales of
          justice turn in our favor; God's sword is sheathed for ever, and the
          blood of Christ has sealed it in its scabbard. We are free, for Christ
          was bound; we live, for Jesus died. Dying thus as a sacrifice and as a
          substitute, it is a comfort to us to know that he also died as
          Mediator between God and man. There was a great gulf fixed, so that if
          we would pass to God we could not, neither could he pass to us if he
          would condescend to do so. There was no way of filling up this gulf,
          unless there should be found one who, like the old Roman, Curtius,
          would leap into it. Jesus comes, arrayed in his pontifical garments,
          wearing the breast-plate, bearing the ephod, a priest for ever after
          the order of Melchisidec: his kingly character is not forgotten, for
          his head is adorned with a glittering crown, and o'er his shoulders he
          bears the prophet's mantle. How shall I describe the matchless glories
          of the prophet-king, the royal priest? Will he throw himself into the
          chasm? He will. Into the grave he plunges, the abyss is closed! The
          gulf is bridged, and God can have communion with man! I see before me
          the heavy veil which shields from mortal eyes the place where God's
          glory shineth. No man may touch that veil or he must die. Is there any
          man found who can rend it? -- that man may approach the mercy-seat. O
          that the veil which parts our souls from him that dwelleth between the
          cherubims could be torn throughout its utmost length! Strong
          archangel, wouldest thou dare to rend it? Shouldest thou attempt the
          work, thine immortality were forfeited, and thou must expire. But
          Jesus comes, the King Immortal, Invisible, with his strong hands he
          rends the veil from top to bottom, and now men draw nigh with
          confidence, for when Jesus died a living way was opened. Sing, O
          heavens, and rejoice O earth! There is now no wall of partition, for
          Christ has dashed it down! Christ has taken away the gates of death,
          posts and bars, and all, and like another Samson carried them upon his
          shoulders far away. This, then, is one of the great notes of the
          Gospel, the fact that Jesus died. Oh! ye who would be save'd, believe
          that Jesus died; believe that the Son of God expired; trust that death
          to save you, and you are saved. Tis no great mystery; it needs no
          learned words, no polished plivases; Jesus died; the sacrifice smokes;
          the substitute bleeds; the Mediator fills up the gap; Jesus dies;
          believe and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But Jesus rises: this is no mean part of the Gospel. He dies; they
          lay him in the new sepulclive; they embalm his body in spices; his
          adversaries are careful that his body shall not be stolen away; the
          stone, the seal, the watch, all prove their vigilance. Aha! Aha! What
          do ye, men? Can ye imprison immortality in the tomb! The fiends of
          hell, too, I doubt not, watched the sepulclive, wondering what it all
          could mean. But the third day comes, and with it the messenger from
          heaven. He touches the stone; it rolls away; he sits upon it, as if he
          would defy the whole universe to roll that stone back again. Jesus
          awakes, as a mighty man from his slumber; unwraps the napkin from his
          head and lays it by itself; unwinds the cerements in which love had
          wrapped him, and puts them by themselves; for he had abundant leisure;
          he was in no haste; he was not about to escape like a felon who bursts
          the prison, but like one whose time of jail-deliverance has come, and
          lawfully and leisurely leaves his cell; he steps to the upper air,
          bright, shining, glorious, and fair. He lives. He died once, but he
          rose again from the dead. There is no need for us to enlarge here. We
          only pause to remark that this is one of the most jubilant notes in
          the whole gospel scale; for see, brethren, the rich mysteries, which,
          like the many seeds of the pomegranate, are all enclosed in the golden
          apple of resurrection. Death is overcome. There is found a man who by
          his own power was able to struggle with death, and hurl him down. The
          grave is opened; there is found a man able to dash back its bolts and
          to rifle its treasures; and thus, brethren, having delivered himself,
          he is able also to deliver others. Sin, too, was manifestly forgiven.
          Christ was in prison as a hostage, kept there as a surety; now that he
          is suffered to go free, it is a declaration on God's behalf that he
          has nothing against us; our substitute is discharged; we are
          discharged. He who undertook to pay our debt is suffered to go free;
          we go free in him. "He rose again for our justification." Nay more,
          inasmuch as he rises from the dead, he gives us a pledge that hell is
          conquered. This was the great aim of hell to keep Christ beneath its
          heel. "Thou shalt bruise his heel." They had gotten the heel of
          Christ, his mortal flesh beneath their power, but that bruised heel
          came forth unwounded; Christ sustained no injury by his dying; he was
          as glorious, even in his human nature, as he was before he expired.
          "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy
          holy One to see corruption." Beloved, in this will we triumph, that
          hell is worsted; Satan is put to confusion, and all his hosts are
          fallen before Immanuel. Sinner, believe this; it is the Gospel of thy
          salvation. Believe that Jesus of Nazareth rose again from the dead,
          and trust him, trust him to save thy soul. Because he burst the gates
          of the grave, trust him to bear thy sins, to justify thy person, to
          quicken thy spirit, and to raise thy dead body, and verily, verily, I
          say unto thee, thou shalt be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We now strike a third note, without which the gospel were not
          complete. Inasmuch as Jesus died, he is now living. He does not, after
          forty days, return to the grave; he departs from earth, but it is by
          another way. From the top of Olivet he ascends until a cloud receives
          him out of their sight. And now at this very day he lives. There at
          his Father's right hand he sits, bright like a sun; clothed in
          majesty; the joy of all the glorified spirits; his Father's intense
          delight. There he sits, Lord of Providence; at his girdle swing the
          keys of heaven, and earth, and hell. There he sits, expecting the hour
          when his enemies shall be made his footstool. Methinks I see him, too,
          as he lives to intercede. He stretches his wounded hands, points to
          his breastplate bearing the names of his people, and for Zion's sake
          he doth not hold his peace, and for Jerusalem's sake he doth not rest
          day nor night, but ever pleadeth -- "Oh God! bless thy heritage;
          gather together thy scattered ones; I will that they whom thou hast
          given me be with me where I am." Believer, this it a cluster of
          camphire to thee, a bundle of myrrh -- be thou comforted exceedingly.
        </p>
        <p>"He lives! the great Redeemer lives!</p>
        <p>What joy the blest assurance gives!"</p>
        <p>
          Trembling penitent, let a living Savior cheer thee. Exercise faith in
          him who only hath immortality. He lives to hear thy prayer; cry to
          him, he lives to present that prayer before his Father's face. Put
          yourself in his hands; he lives to gather together those whom he
          bought with his blood, to make those the people of his flock who were
          once the people of his purchase. Sinner, dost thou believe this as a
          matter of fact? If so, rest thy soul on it, and make it shine as a
          matter of confidence, and then thou art saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. One more note, and our gospel-song need not rise higher. Jesus
          died; he rose; he lives; and he lives for ever. He lives for ever. He
          shall not die again. "Death hath no more dominion over him." Ages
          shall follow ages, but his raven locks shall never be blanched with
          years. "Thou hast the dew of thy youth." Disease may visit the world
          and fill the graves, but no disease or plague can touch the immortal
          Savior. The shock of the last catastrophe shall shake both heaven and
          earth, until the stars shall fall like withered fig-leaves from the
          tree, but nothing shall move the unchanging Savior. He lives for ever.
          There is no possibility that he should be overcome by a new death.
        </p>
        <p>"No more the bloody spear,</p>
        <p>The cross and nails no more;</p>
        <p>For hell itself shakes at his name,</p>
        <p>And all the heavens adore."</p>
        <p>
          Would it not be a strange doctrine indeed if any man should dream that
          the Son of God would again offer his life a sacrifice. He dieth no
          more. This, too, reveals another part of our precious gospel, for now
          it is certain, since he lives for ever, that no foes can overcome him.
          He has so routed his enemies and driven his foes off the battle-field,
          that they will never venture to attack him again. This proves, too,
          that his people's eternal life is sure. Let Jesus die, and his people
          die. Let Christ leave heaven, and, O ye glorified ones! ye must all
          vacate your thrones, and leave your crowns without heads to wear them,
          and your harps untouched by fingers that shall wake them to harmony.
          He lives for ever. Oh! seed of Abraham, ye are saved with an
          everlasting salvation by the sure mercies of David. Your standing in
          earth and heaven has been confirmed eternally. God is honored, saints
          are comforted, and sinners are cheered, for "he is able also to save
          them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth
          to make intercession for them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I would to God that on one of these four anchor-holds your faith
          might be able to get rest. Jesus died, poor trembler; if he died and
          took thy griefs, will not his atonement save thee? Rest here. Milhons
          of souls have rested on nothing but Jesus' death, and this is a
          granite foundation; no storms of hell can shake it. Get a good
          handhold on his cross; hold it, and it will hold you. You cannot
          depend on his death and be deceived. Try it; taste and see, and you
          shall find that the Lord is good, and that none can trust a dying
          Savior without being with him in Paradise. But if this suffice you
          not, he rose again. Fasten upon this. He is proved to be victor over
          your sin and over your adversary; can you not, therefore, depend upon
          him? Doubtless there have been thousands of saints who have found the
          richest consolation from the fact that Jesus rose again from the dead.
          He rose again for our justification. Sinner, hang on that. Having
          risen he lives. He is not a dead Savior, a dead sacrifice. He must be
          able to hear our plea and to present his own. Depend on a living
          Savior; depend on him now. He lives for ever, and therefore it is not
          too late for him to save you. If thou criest to him he will hear thy
          prayer, even though it be in life's last moment, for he lives for
          ever. Though the ends of the earth were come, and you were the last
          man, yet he ever lives to intercede before his Father's face. Oh! gad
          not about to find any other hope! Here are four great stones for you;
          build your hope on these; you cannot want surer foundations -- he
          dies, he rises, he lives, he lives for ever. I tell thee, Soul, this
          is my only hope, and though I lean thereon with all my weight it bends
          not. This is the hope of all God's people, and they abide contented in
          it. Do thou, I pray thee, now come and rest on it. May the Spirit of
          God bring many of you to Christ. We have no other gospel. You thought
          it a hard thing, a scholarly thing, a matter that the college must
          teach you, that the university must give you. It is no such matter for
          learning and scholarship. Your little child knows it, and your child
          may be saved by it. You without education, you that can scarce read in
          the book, you can comprehend this. He dies; there is the cross. He
          rises; there is the open tomb. He lives; there is the pleading Savior.
          He lives for ever; there is the perpetual merit. Depend on him! Put
          your soul in his hand and you are saved.

          If I have brought you under the first head of my discourse to a
          sufficient height; you can now take another step, and mount to
          something higher; I do not mean higher as to real value, but higher as
          a matter of knowledge, because it follows upon the fact as a matter of
          experience.

          II. The great facts mentioned in our text represent THE GLORIOUS WORK
          WHICH EVERY BELIEVER FEELS WITHIN HIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the text we see death, resurrection, life, and life eternal. You
          observe that the Apostle only mentions these to show our share in
          them. I will read the text again -- "Now if we be dead with Christ, we
          believe that we shall also live with him: knowing that Christ being
          raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
          him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he
          liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye yourselves also to be
          dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, it seems that as Christ was, so we also are dead. We are
          dead to sin because sin can no more condemn us. All the sins which
          God's people have ever committed dare not accuse, much less can they
          condemn those for whom Jesus died. Sin can curse an unbeliever, but it
          has no power so much as to mutter half a curse against a man in
          Christ. I cannot claim a debt of a dead debtor, and although I be a
          debtor to the law, yet since I am dead, the law cannot claim anything
          of me, nor can sin infiict any punisliment upon me. He that is dead,
          as says the preceding verse, is freed from sin; being dead to sin we
          are free from all its jurisdiction; we fear not its curse; we defy its
          power. The true believer in the day when he first came to Christ died
          to sin as to its power. Sin had been sitting on a high throne in his
          heart, but faith pulled the tyrant down and rolled him in the dust,
          and though it still survives to vex us, yet its reigning power is
          destroyed. From the day of our new birth, if we be indeed true
          Christians, we have been dead to all sin's pleasures. Madame Bubble
          can no longer bewitch us. The varnish and gilt have been worn off from
          the palaces of sin. We defy sin's most skillful enchantments; it might
          warble sweetest music, but the dead ear is not to be moved by
          melodies. Keep thy bitter sweets, O earth, for those who know no
          better delicacies; our mouths find no flavour in your dainties. We are
          dead to sin's bribes. We curse the gold that would have bought us to
          be untrutliful, and abhor the comforts which might have been the
          reward of iniquity. We are dead to its threatenings, too. When sin
          curses us, we are as little moved by its curses as by its promises. A
          believer is mortified and dead to the world. He can sing with Cowper
          --
        </p>
        <p>"I thirst, but not as once I did</p>
        <p>The vain delights of earth to share;</p>
        <p>Thy wounds, Emmanuel all forbid</p>
        <p>That I should seek my pleasures there.</p>
        <p>It was the sight of thy dear cross</p>
        <p>First wean'd my soul from earthly things;</p>
        <p>And taught me to esteem as dross</p>
        <p>The mirth of fools and pomp of kings."</p>
        <p>
          I am compelled, however, to say that this mortification is not
          complete. We are not so dead to the world as we should be. Instead of
          saying here what the Christian is, I think I may rather say what he
          should be, for where am I to look for men that are dead to the world
          now-a-days? I see professing Christians quite as fond of riches; I see
          them almost as fond of gaiety and vanity. Do I not see those who wear
          the name of Jesus whose dress is as full of vanity as that of the
          worldling; whose conversation has no more savor of Christ in it than
          that of the open sinner? I find many who are conformed to this world,
          and who show but little renewing of their minds. Oh! how slight is the
          difference now-a-days between the Church and the world! We ought to
          be, in a spiritual sense, evermore Dissenters -- dissenting from the
          world, standing out and protesting against it. We must be to the
          world's final day Nonconformists, not conforming to its ways and
          vanities, but walking without the camp, bearing Christ's reproach. Do
          some of you recollect the day when you died to the world? Your friends
          thought you were mad. They said you knew nothing of life, so your
          ungodly friends put you in the sepulclive, and others of them rolled a
          great stone against you. They from that day put a ban upon you. You
          are not asked out now where you once were everybody. The seal is put
          upon you; they call you by some opprobrious epithet, and so far as the
          world is concerned, you are like the dead Christ; you are put into
          your grave, and shut out from the world's life. They do not want you
          any more at their merry-makings, you would spoil the party; you have
          now become such a Methodist, such a mean hypocrite, as they put it,
          that they have buried you out of sight, and rolled back the stone, and
          sealed it, and set watchers at the door to keep you there. Well, and
          what a blessed thing that is, for if you be dead with Christ you shall
          also live with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we be thus dead with Christ, let us see that we live with him. It
          is a poor thing to be dead to the world unless we are alive unto God.
          Death is a negative, and a negative in the world is of no great use by
          itself. A Protestant is less than a nobody if he only protests against
          a wrong; we want a proclaimer, one who proclaims the truth as well as
          protests against error. And so, if we be dead to sin we must have,
          also, the life of Christ, and I trust, beloved, we know, and it is not
          a matter of theory to us -- I trust we know that in us there is a new
          life to which we were strangers once. To our body and our soul there
          has been superadded a spirit, a spark of spiritual life. Just as Jesus
          had a new life after death, so have we a new life after death,
          wherewith I trust we rise from the grave. But we must prove it. Jesus
          proved his resurrection by infallible signs. You and I, too, must
          prove to all men that we have risen out of the grave of sin. Perhaps
          our friends did not know us when we first rose from the dead. Like
          Mary, they mistook us for somebody else. They said, "What! Is this
          Wilham who used to be such a hectoring, proud, ill-humoured,
          domineering fellow? Can he put up with our jokes and jeers so
          patiently?" They supposed us to he somebody else, and they were not
          far from the mark, for we were new creatures in Christ Jesus. We
          talked with some of our friends, and they found our conversation so
          different from what it used to be that it made their hearts burn
          within them, just as Jesus Christ's disciples when they went to
          Emmaus. But they did not know our secret; they were strangers to our
          new life. Do you recollect, Christians, how you first revealed
          yourselves unto your brethren, the Church? In the breaking of bread
          they first knew you. That night when the right-hand of fellowship was
          given to you the new life was openly recognized, and they said --
          "Come in thou blessed of the Lord, wherefore standest thou without?" I
          trust, in resurrection-life you desire to prove to all men that this
          is not the common life you lived before, a life which made you serve
          the flesh and the lusts thereof; but that you are living now with
          higher aims, and purer intentions, by a more heavenly rule, and with
          the prospect of a diviner result. As we have been dead with Christ,
          dear brethren, I hope we have also, in our measure, learned to live
          with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, remember, Christ lives for ever, and so do we. Christ being
          raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
          him. The fourteenth verse is wonderfully similar -- "Sin shall not
          have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under
          grace." Sin made us die once in Adam, but we are not to be slain by it
          again. If Christ could die now, we could die, but since Christ can
          never die again, so the believer can never again go back to his old
          sin. He dies to sin no more; he lives, and sin hath no more dominion
          over him. Oh! this is a delightful theme! I know not how to express
          the joy my own heart feels at the sense of security arising from the
          fact that Christ dies no more. Death hath no more dominion over him;
          and sin hath no more dominion over me, if I be in Christ. Suppose, my
          brethren, suppose for a moment that Christ could die again. Bring out
          your funeral music! Let the muffled drums beat the Dead march! Let the
          heavens be clothed in sackcloth, and let the verdant earth be robed in
          blackness, for the atonement, earth's great hope, is incomplete!
          Christ must die again. The adversaries we thought were routed have
          gathered their strength again. Death is not dead; the grave is not
          open; there will be no resurrection! The saints tremble; even in
          heaven they fear and quake; the crowns upon glorified heads are
          trembling; the hearts that have been overflowing with eternal bliss
          are filled with anxiety, for the throne of Christ is empty; angels
          suspend their songs; the howlings of hell have silenced the shouts of
          heaven: the fiends are holding high holiday, and they sliviek for very
          joy -- "Jesus dies again! Jesus dies again! Prepare your arrows! Empty
          your Quivers! Come up, Ye legions of hell! The famous conqueror must
          fight, and bleed, and die again, and we shall overcome him yet!" God
          is dishonored, the foundations of heaven are removed, and the eternal
          throne quivers with the shock of Christ subjected to a second death!
          Is it blasphemy to suppose the case? Yet, my brethren, it were equal
          blasphemy to suppose a true believer going back again to his old lusts
          and dying again by sin, for that were to suppose that the atonement
          were incomplete. I can prove that it involves the very same things; it
          supposes an unfinished sacrifice, for if the sacrifice be finished,
          then those for whom it was offered must be saved. It supposes hell
          triumphant -- Christ had bought the soul, and the spirit had renewed
          it, but the devil wipes away the blood of Christ, expels the spirit of
          the living God, and gets to himself the victory. A saint perish! Then
          God's promise is not true, and Christ's word is false -- "I give unto
          my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish;" then the
          foundations are removed; eternal justice is a name, and the divine
          honesty is suspected; the purposes of God are frustrated, and the
          crown of sovereignty rolls in the mire. Weep angels! Be astonished, O
          heavens! Rock, O ye hills with earthquake! and hell come up and hold
          riot! for God himself has ceased to be God, since his people perish!
          "Because I live ye shall live also" is a divine necessity, and if
          dominion can ever be had by sin over a believer again, then, mark you,
          death can again have dominion over Christ; but that is impossible;
          therefore rejoice and be glad, ye servants of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will notice, that as they live, so, like Jesus Christ, they live
          unto God. This completes the parallel. "In that he liveth he liveth
          unto God." So do we. The forty days which Christ spent on earth he
          lived unto God, comforting his saints, manifesting his person, giving
          forth gospel precepts. For the few days we have to live here on earth
          we must live to comfort the saints, to set forth Christ, and to preach
          the gospel to every creature. And now that Christ has ascended he
          lives unto God; what does that mean? He lives, my brethren, to
          manifest the divine character. Christ is the permanent revelation of
          an invisible God. We look at Christ and we see justice, truth, power,
          love; we see the whole of the divine attributes in him. Christian, you
          are to live unto God; God is to be seen in you; you are to show forth
          the divine bowels of compassion, longsuffering, tenderness, kindness,
          patience; you are to manifest God; living unto God. Christ lives unto
          God, for he completes the divine purpose by pleading for his people,
          by carrying on his people's work above. You are to live for the same,
          by preaching, that sinners may hear and that the elect may live; by
          teaching that the chosen may be saved; teaching by your life, by your
          actions, that God's glory may be known, and that his decrees may be
          fulfilled. Jesus lives unto God, delighting himself in God. The
          immeasurable joy of Christ in his Father no tongue can tell. Live in
          the same way, Christian. Delight thyself in the Lord! Be blessed; be
          happy; rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice. Our
          Redeemer lives unto God, that is he lives in constant fellowship with
          God. Cannot you do so too by the Holy Spirit? You are dead to sin; see
          to it that you live for ever in fellowship with the Father, and with
          his Son Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have been talking riddles to some of you. How many of you
          understand these things? If any are troubled because they understood
          the first part and they do trust in Christ's death, but they do not
          understand the second part -- ah! beloved, you shall comprehend one of
          these days; if you are resting on Christ's death, that death shall yet
          be made mighty in you. But you that have known something of this, I
          pray you struggle after more. Ask the Lord to mortify you altogether,
          to fill you with the divine life, and to help you to persevere unto
          the end. Pray that you may live unto God and unto God alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Having brought you thus far, there is only one other step to
          take, and then we have done; let us notice that the facts of which we
          have spoken are PLEDGES OF THE GLORY WHICH IS TO BE REVEALED IN US.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ died. Possibly we shall die. Perhaps we shall not; we may be
          alive and remain at the coming of the Son of man; but it may be we
          shall die. I do not think we should be so certain of death as some
          Christians are, because the Lord's coming is much more certain than
          our dying. Our dying is not certain, for he may come before we die.
          However, suppose we shall die: Christ rose, and so shall we.
        </p>
        <p>"What though our inbred sins require</p>
        <p>Our flesh to see the dust,</p>
        <p>Yet as the Lord our Savior rose,</p>
        <p>So all his followers must."</p>
        <p>
          Do not, my brethren, think of the cemetery with tears, nor meditate
          upon the coffin and the shroud with gloomy thoughts. You only sojourn
          there for a little season, and to you it will not appear a moment.
          Your body will sleep, and if men sleep all through a long night it
          only seems an hour to them, a very short moment. The sleeping-time is
          forgotten, and to your sleeping-body it will seem no time at all,
          while to your glorified soul it will not seem long because you will be
          so full of joy that a whole eternity of that joy would not be too
          long. But you shall rise again. I do not think we get enough joy out
          of our resurrection. It will probably be our happiest moment, or
          rather the beginning of the happiest life that we shall ever know.
          Heaven is not the happiest place. Heaven at present is happy, but it
          is not the perfection of happiness, because there is only the soul
          there, though the soul is full of pleasure; but the heaven that is to
          be when body and soul will both be there surpasses all thought.
          Resurrection will be our marriage-day. Body and soul have been
          separated, and they shall meet again to be re-married with a golden
          ring, no more to be divorced, but as one indissolubly united body to
          go up to the great altar of immortality, and there to be espoused unto
          Christ for ever and ever. I shall come again to this flesh, no longer
          flesh that can decay, no longer bones that ache -- I shall come back
          to these eyes and these ears, all made channels of new delight. Say
          not this is a materialistic view of the matter. We are at least
          one-half material, and so long as there is material about us we must
          always expect joy that shall not only give spiritual but even material
          delight to us. This body shall rise again. "Can these dry bones live?"
          is the question of the unbeliever. "They must live," is the answer of
          faith. Oh! let us expect our end with joy, and our resurrection with
          transport. Jesus was not detained a prisoner, and therefore no worm
          can keep us back, no grave, no tomb can destroy our hope. Having he
          lives, and we shall rise to live for ever. Anticipate, my brethren,
          that happy day. No sin, no sorrow, no care, no decay, no approaching
          dissolution! Be lives for ever in God: so shall you and I; close to
          the Eternal; swallowed up in his brightness, glorified in his glory,
          overflowing with his love! I think at the very prospect we may well
          say --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh! long-expected day begin,</p>
        <p>Dawn on these realms of woe and sin."</p>
        <p>
          We may well cry to him to bid his chariots hasten and bring the joyous
          season! He comes, he comes, believer! Rejoice with joy unspeakable!
          Thou hast but a little time to wait, and when thou hast fallen asleep
          thou shalt leap
        </p>
        <p>"From beds of dust and silent clay,</p>
        <p>To realms of everlasting day;"</p>
        <p>and thou,</p>
        <p>"Far from a world of grief and sin</p>
        <p>With God eternally shut in,</p>
        <p>Shalt be for ever blest!"</p>
        <p>May the Lord add his blessing, for Jesu's sake. Amen.</p>
