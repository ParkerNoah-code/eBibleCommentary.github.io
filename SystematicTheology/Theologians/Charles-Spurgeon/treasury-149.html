          TITLE. A Psalm of David. It is so much like other Davidic psalms, that
          we accept the title without a moment's hesitation. David's history
          illustrates it, and his spirit breathes in it. Why it has been set
          down as one of the seven Penitential Psalms we can hardly tell; for it
          is rather a vindication of his own integrity, and an indignant prayer
          against his slanderers, than a confession of fault.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is true the second verse proves that he never dreamed of justifying
          himself before the Lord; but even in it there is scarcely the
          brokenness of penitence. It seems to us rather <i>martial </i>than
          penitential, rather a
          <i>supplication for deliverance from trouble </i>than a weeping
          acknowledgment of transgression. We suppose that seven penitentials
          were needed by ecclesiastical rabbis, and therefore this was impressed
          into the service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In truth, it is a mingled strain, a box of ointment composed of divers
          ingredients, sweet and bitter, pungent and precious. It is
          <i
            >the outcry of an overwhelmed spirit, unable to abide in the highest
            state of spiritual prayer, again and again descending to bewail its
            deep temporal distress</i
          >; yet evermore struggling to rise to the best things. The singer
          moans at intervals; the petitioner for mercy cannot withhold his cries
          for vindication. His hands are outstretched to Heaven, but at his belt
          hangs a sharp sword, which rattles in its scabbard as he closes his
          psalm.

          DIVISION. This psalm is divided by the <i>Selah</i>. We prefer to
          follow the natural cleavage, and therefore have made no other
          dissection of it. May the Holy Spirit lead us into its inner
          meaning.<br />

            Verse 1. Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications.
          </p></b
        >
        In the preceding psalm he began by declaring that he had cried unto the
        Lord. Here he begs to be favorably regarded by Jehovah the living God,
        whose memorial is that he hears prayer. He knew that Jehovah heard
        prayer, and therefore he entreated him to hear his supplication, however
        feeble and broken it might be. In two forms he implores the one blessing
        of gracious audience: "hear" and "give ear."
        <p align="justify">
          Gracious men are so eager to be heard in prayer that they double their
          entreaties for that blessing. The Psalmist desires to be heard and to
          be considered; hence he cries, "hear", and then "give ear."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our case is difficult, and we plead for special attention. Here it is
          probable that David wished his suit against his adversaries to be
          heard by the righteous Judge; confident that if he had a hearing in
          the matter whereof he was slanderously accused, he would be
          triumphantly acquitted. Yet while somewhat inclined thus to lay his
          case before the Court of King's Bench, he prefers rather to turn it
          all into a petition, and present it before the Court of Requests,
          hence he cries rather "hear my prayer" than "hear my suit."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Indeed David is specially earnest that he himself, and the whole of
          his life, may not become the subject of trial, for in that event he
          could not hope for acquittal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observe that he offered so much pleading that his life became one
          continual prayer; but that petitioning was so varied in form that it
          broke out in many supplications.
        </p>

        Saints desire to be <i>answered </i>as well as <i>heard</i>. They long
        to find the Lord faithful to his promise and righteous in defending the
        cause of justice. It is a happy thing when we dare appeal even to
        righteousness for our deliverance; and this we can do upon gospel
        principles, for "if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to
        forgive us our sins."

          <p align="justify">
            Even the sterner attributes of God are upon the side of the man who

        >It is a sign of our safety when our interests and those of
        righteousness are blended. With God's <i>faithfulness </i>and
        <i>righteousness </i>upon our side, we are guarded on the right hand and
        on the left. These are active attributes, and fully equal to the
        answering of any prayer which it would be light to answer. Requests
        which do not appeal to either of these attributes, it would not be for
        the glory of God to hear, for they must contain desires for things not
        promised, and unrighteous.

        None can stand before God upon the footing of the law. God's sight is
        piercing and discriminating; the slightest flaw is seen and judged; and

        <i>that glance reads all the secrets of the soul. </i>
        <p align="justify">
          In this verse David told out the doctrine of universal condemnation by
          the law, long before Paul had taken his pen to write the same truth.
          To this day it stands true even to the same extent as in David's day:
          no man living even at this moment may dare to present himself for
          trial before the throne of the Great King on the footing of the
          <i>law</i>.

        <p align="justify">
          This foolish age has produced specimens of n pride so rank that men
          have dared to claim perfection in the flesh; but these vain glorious
          boasters are no exception to the rule here laid down—they are but men,
          and poor specimens of men. When their lives are examined they are
          frequently found to be more faulty than the humble penitents before
          whom they vaunt their superiority.

        The existence of David was made bitter by the cruelty of his enemy; he
        was as one who was hurled down and made to lie upon the ground, where he
        could be trampled on by his assailant.
        <i> <p align="justify">Slander</p></i>has a very depressing effect upon

          David was driven by Saul's animosity to haunt caverns and holes; like

          David! He was qualified to bless the house of the living, but he was

          Such may be our case, and yet we may be very dear to the Lord. One
          thing is certain, the Lord who permits us to dwell in darkness among

          those who enjoy life eternal.

        David was no stoic: he felt his banishment, and smarted under the cruel
        assaults which were made upon his character. He felt perplexed and
        overturned, lonely and afflicted. He was a man of thought and feeling,
        and suffered both in spirit and in heart from the undeserved and
        unprovoked hostility of his persecutors.
        <p align="justify">
          Moreover, he labored under the sense of fearful loneliness; he was for
          a while forsaken by his God, and his soul was exceeding heavy, even
          unto death. Such words our Lord Jesus might have used—in this the Head
          is like the members, and the members are as the Head.

        once had merry days, days of deliverance, and joy and thanksgiving; why
        not again? Jehovah rescued his people in the ages centuries ago; why
        should he not do the like again? We ourselves have a rich past to look
        back upon; we have sunny memories, sacred memories, satisfactory
        memories, and
        <i

        own works reproach me, your works refresh me. If at the first view the
        deeds of the Lord do not encourage us, let us think them over again,
        ruminating and considering the histories of divine providence. We ought
        to take a wide and large view of all God's works; for as a whole they
        work together for good, and in each part they are worthy of reverent
        study.
        <b> <p align="justify">I muse on the work of your hands.</p></b>This he
        had done in former days, even in his most trying hours. Creation had
        been the book in which he read of the wisdom and goodness of the Lord.
        He repeats his perusal of the <i>page of nature</i>, and counts it a
        balm for his wounds, a cordial for his cares, to see what the Lord has
        made by his skillful hands. When the work of our own hand grieves us,

        As the soil cracks, and yawns, and thus opens its mouth in silent
        pleadings—so did the Psalmist's soul break with longings. No heavenly
        shower had refreshed him from the sanctuary: banished from the means of
        grace, his soul felt parched and dry, and he cried out, "My soul thirsts
        for you"; nothing would content him but the presence of his God. Not
        alone did he extend his <i> hands</i>, but his <i>heart </i>was
        stretched out towards the Lord. He was athirst for the Lord. If he could
        but feel the presence of his God he would no longer be overwhelmed or
        dwell in darkness; nay, everything would turn to peace and joy.
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> It was time to pause, for the

          The Psalmist lifts up his soul: faith is good at a dead lift. The soul
          that trusts, will rise. We will not allow our hope to sink, but we
          will strive to get up and rise out of our daily griefs. This is wise.
          When David was in any difficulty as to his way, he lifted his soul
          towards God himself, and then he knew that he could not go very far
          wrong. If the soul will not rise of itself, we must lift it—lift it up
          unto God. This is good argument in prayer: surely the God to whom we
          endeavor to lift up our soul will condescend to show us what he would
          have us to do. Let us attend to David's example, and when our heart is
          low, let us heartily endeavor to lift it up, not so much to comfort,
          as to the Lord himself.

          here he prays, "Hide <i>me.</i>" Note also how often he uses the words
          "unto you"; he is after his God. He must travel in that direction by
          some means, even though he may seem to be beating a retreat; his whole
          being longs to be near the Lord. Is it possible that such
          <i>thirsting for God </i>will be left unsupplied? Never, while the
          Lord is love.

        He believes that it will be so, and thus prophesies the event; for the
        words may be read as a declaration, and it is better so to understand
        them.

          We could not pray just so with our Christian light; but under Old
          Testament arrangements, the spirit of it was congruous to the law. It
          is a petition which justice sanctions, but the spirit of love is not
          at home in presenting it. We, as Christians, turn the petition to
          <i>spiritual use </i>only. Yet David was of so generous a mind, and
          dealt so tenderly with Saul, that he could hardly have meant all that
          his words are made in our version to say.

        <b> <p align="justify">For I am your servant.</p></b>Therefore I hope
        that my Master will protect me in his service, and grant me victory
        while I fight his battles. It is a warrior's prayer, and smells of the
        dust and smoke of battle. It was heard, and therefore it was not asking
        amiss. Still there is a more excellent way.
