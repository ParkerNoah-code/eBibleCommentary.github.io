          Abgar, having gone to the East, finds on the throne of Persia
          Ardachès, son of Archavir, and the brothers of Ardachès contending
          against him: for this prince thought to reign over them in his
          posterity, and they would not consent to it. Ardachès therefore hems
          them in on all sides, hangs the sword of death over their heads;
          distractions and dissension were between their troops and their other
          relations and allies: for King Archavir had three sons and one
          daughter; the first of these sons was King Ardachès himself, the
          second Garene, the third Sourene; their sister, named Gochm, was wife
          of the general of all the Ariks, a general chosen by their father
          Archavir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abgar prevails on the sons of Archavir to make peace; he arranges
          between them the conditions and stipulations: Ardachès is to reign
          with his posterity as he proposed, and his brothers are to be called
          Bahlav, from the name of their town and their vast and fertile
          country, so that their satrapies shall be the first, higher in rank
          than all the satrapies of Persia, as being truly a race of kings.
          Treaties and oaths stipulated that in case of the extinction of male
          children of Ardachès, his brothers should come to the throne; after
          the reigning race of Ardachès, his brothers are divided into three
          races named thus: the race of Garene Bahlav, the race of Sourene
          Bahlav, and the race of their sister, the race of Asbahabied Bahlav, a
          race thus called from the name of the domain of her husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          St. Gregory is said to have sprung from the race Sourene Bahlav, and
          the Gamsarians from the race Garene Bahlav. We will relate in the
          sequel the circumstances of the coming of these personages, only
          mentioning their names here in connection with Ardachès, in order that
          you may know that these great races are indeed the blood of
          Vagharchag, that is to say, the posterity of the great Archag, brother
          of Vagharchag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything being thus arranged, Abgar takes with him the letter of the
          treaties, and returns to his dominions; not in perfect health, but a
          prey to severe suffering.<br />
