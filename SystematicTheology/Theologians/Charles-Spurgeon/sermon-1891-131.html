          1. Now I shall simply say, in opposition to all the heretics, and
          principally against the followers of Marcion, and against those who
          are like to these, in maintaining that the prophets were from another
          God [than He who is announced in the Gospel], read with earnest care
          that Gospel which has been conveyed to us by the apostles, and read
          with earnest care the prophets, and you will find that the whole
          conduct, and all the doctrine, and all the sufferings of our Lord,
          were predicted through them. But if a thought of this kind should then
          suggest itself to you, to say, What then did the Lord bring to us by
          His advent? -- know ye that He brought all [possible] novelty, by
          bringing Himself who had been announced. For this very thing was
          proclaimed beforehand, that a novelty should come to renew and quicken
          mankind. For the advent of the King is previously announced by those
          servants who are sent [before Him], in order to the preparation and
          equipment of those men who are to entertain their Lord. But when the
          King has actually come, and those who are His subjects have been
          filled with that joy which was proclaimed beforehand, and have
          attained to that liberty which He bestows, and share in the sight of
          Him, and have listened to His words, and have enjoyed the gifts which
          He confers, the question will not then be asked by any that are
          possessed of sense what new thing the King has brought beyond [that
          proclaimed by] those who announced His coming. For He has brought
          Himself, and has bestowed on men those good things which were
          announced beforehand, which things the angels desired to look into.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But the servants would then have been proved false, and not sent by
          the Lord, if Christ on His advent, by being found exactly such as He
          was previously announced, had not fulfilled their words. Wherefore He
          said, "Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets;
          I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Until
          heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from
          the law and the prophets till all come to pass." For by His advent He
          Himself fulfilled all things, and does still fulfil in the Church the
          new covenant foretold by the law, onwards to the consummation [of all
          things]. To this effect also Paul, His apostle, says in the Epistle to
          the Romans, "But now, without the law, has the righteousness of God
          been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; for the
          just shall live by faith." But this fact, that the just shall live by
          faith, had been previously announced by the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But whence could the prophets have had power to predict the advent
          of the King, and to preach beforehand that liberty which was bestowed
          by Him, and previously to announce all things which were done by
          Christ, His words, His works, and His sufferings, and to predict the
          new covenant, if they had received prophetical inspiration from
          another God [than He who is revealed in the Gospel], they being
          ignorant, as ye allege, of the ineffable Father, of His kingdom, and
          His dispensations, which the Son of God fulfilled when He came upon
          earth in these last times? Neither are ye in a position to say that
          these things came to pass by a certain kind of chance, as if they were
          spoken by the prophets in regard to some other person, while like
          events happened to the Lord. For all the prophets prophesied these
          same things, but they never came to pass in the case of any one of the
          ancients. For if these things had happened to any man among them of
          old time, those [prophets] who lived subsequently would certainly not
          have prophesied that these events should come to pass in the last
          times. Moreover, there is in fact none among the fathers, nor the
          prophets, nor the ancient kings, in whose case any one of these things
          properly and specifically took place. For all indeed prophesied as to
          the sufferings of Christ, but they themselves were far from enduring
          sufferings similar to what was predicted. And the points connected
          with the passion of the Lord, which were foretold, were realized in no
          other case. For neither did it happen at the death of any man among
          the ancients that the sun set at mid-day, nor was the veil of the
          temple rent, nor did the earth quake, nor were the rocks rent, nor did
          the dead rise up, nor was any one of these men [of old] raised up on
          the third day, nor received into heaven, nor at his assumption were
          the heavens opened, nor did the nations believe in the name of any
          other; nor did any from among them, having been dead and rising again,
          lay open the new covenant of liberty. Therefore the prophets spake not
          of any one else but of the Lord, in whom all these aforesaid tokens
          concurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If any one, however, advocating the cause of the Jews, do maintain
          that this new covenant consisted in the rearing of that temple which
          was built under Zerubbabel after the emigration to Babylon, and in the
          departure of the people from thence after the lapse of seventy years,
          let him know that the temple constructed of stones was indeed then
          rebuilt (for as yet that law was observed which had been made upon
          tables of stone), yet no new covenant was given, but they used the
          Mosaic law until the coming of the Lord; but from the Lord's advent,
          the new covenant which brings back peace, and the law which gives
          life, has gone forth over the whole earth, as the prophets said: "For
          out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from
          Jerusalem; and He shall rebuke many people; and they shall break down
          their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks,
          and they shall no longer learn to fight." If therefore another law and
          word, going forth from Jerusalem, brought in such a [reign of] peace
          among the Gentiles which received it (the word), and convinced,
          through them, many a nation of its folly, then [only] it appears that
          the prophets spake of some other person. But if the law of liberty,
          that is, the word of God, preached by the apostles (who went forth
          from Jerusalem) throughout all the earth, caused such a change in the
          state of things, that these [nations] did form the swords and
          war-lances into ploughshares, and changed them into pruning-hooks for
          reaping the corn, [that is], into instruments used for peaceful
          purposes, and that they are now unaccustomed to fighting, but when
          smitten, offer also the other cheek, then the prophets have not spoken
          these things of any other person, but of Him who effected them. This
          person is our Lord, and in Him is that declaration borne out; since it
          is He Himself who has made the plough, and introduced the
          pruning-hook, that is, the first semination of man, which was the
          creation exhibited in Adam, and the gathering in of the produce in the
          last times by the Word; and, for this reason, since He joined the
          beginning to the end, and is the Lord of both, He has finally
          displayed the plough, in that the wood has been joined on to the iron,
          and has thus cleansed His land; because the Word, having been firmly
          united to flesh, and in its mechanism fixed with pins, has reclaimed
          the savage earth. In the beginning, He figured forth the pruning-hook
          by means of Abel, pointing out that there should be a gathering in of
          a righteous race of men. He says, "For behold how the just man
          perishes, and no man considers it; and righteous men are taken away,
          and no man layeth it to heart." These things were acted beforehand in
          Abel, were also previously declared by the prophets, but were
          accomplished in the Lord's person; and the same [is still true] with
          regard to us, the body following the example of the Head.
        </p>

          5. Such are the arguments proper [to be used] in opposition to those
          who maintain that the prophets [were inspired] by a different God, and
          that our Lord [came] from another Father, if perchance [these
          heretics] may at length desist from such extreme folly. This is my
          earnest object in adducing these Scriptural proofs, that confuting
          them, as far as in me lies, by these very passages, I may restrain
          them from such great blasphemy, and from insanely fabricating a
          multitude of gods.<br />
