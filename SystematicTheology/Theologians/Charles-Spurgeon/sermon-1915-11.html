          |For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
          it is the gift of God.| -- Ephesians 2:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          OF THE THINGS which I have spoken unto you these many years, this is
          the sum. Within the circle of these words my theology is contained, so
          far as it refers to the salvation of men. I rejoice also to remember
          that those of my family who were ministers of Christ before me
          preached this doctrine, and none other. My father, who is still able
          to bear his personal testimony for his Lord, knows no other doctrine,
          neither did his father before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am led to remember this by the fact that a somewhat singular
          circumstance, recorded in my memory, connects this text with myself
          and my grandfather. It is now long years ago. I was announced to
          preach in a certain country town in the Eastern Counties. It does not
          often happen to me to be behind time, for I feel that punctuality is
          one of those little virtues which may prevent great sins. But we have
          no control over railway delays, and breakdowns; and so it happened
          that I reached the appointed place considerably behind the time. Like
          sensible people, they had begun their worship, and had proceeded as
          far as the sermon. As I neared the chapel, I perceived that someone
          was in the pulpit preaching, and who should the preacher be but my
          dear and venerable grandfather! He saw me as I came in at the front
          door and made my way up the aisle, and at once he said, |Here comes my
          grandson! He may preach the gospel better than I can, but he cannot
          preach a better gospel; can you, Charles?| As I made my way through
          the throng, I answered, |You can preach better than I can. Pray go
          on.| But he would not agree to that. I must take the sermon, and so I
          did, going on with the subject there and then, just where he left off.
          |There,| said he, |I was preaching of 'For by grace are ye saved.' I
          have been setting forth the source and fountain-head of salvation; and
          I am now showing them the channel of it, through faith. Now you take
          it up, and go on.| I am so much at home with these glorious truths
          that I could not feel any difficulty in taking from my grandfather the
          thread of his discourse, and joining my thread to it, so as to
          continue without a break. Our agreement in the things of God made it
          easy for us to be joint-preachers of the same discourse. I went on
          with |through faith,| and then I proceeded to the next point, |and
          that not of yourselves.| Upon this I was explaining the weakness and
          inability of human nature, and the certainty that salvation could not
          be of ourselves, when I had my coat-tail pulled, and my well-beloved
          grandsire took his turn again. |When I spoke of our depraved human
          nature,| the good old man said, |I know most about that, dear
          friends|; and so he took up the parable, and for the next five minutes
          set forth a solemn and humbling description of our lost estate, the
          depravity of our nature, and the spiritual death under which we were
          found. When he had said his say in a very gracious manner, his
          grandson was allowed to go on again, to the dear old man's great
          delight; for now and then he would say, in a gentle tone, |Good!
          Good!| Once he said, |Tell them that again, Charles,| and, of course,
          I did tell them that again. It was a happy exercise to me to take my
          share in bearing witness to truths of such vital importance, which are
          so deeply impressed upon my heart. While announcing this text I seem
          to hear that dear voice, which has been so long lost to earth, saying
          to me, |TELL THEM THAT AGAIN.| I am not contradicting the testimony of
          forefathers who are now with God. If my grandfather could return to
          earth, he would find me where he left me, steadfast in the faith, and
          true to that form of doctrine which was once delivered to the saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall handle the text briefly, by way of making a few statements.
          The first statement is clearly contained in the text: --
        </p>
        <p>I. There Is Present Salvation.</p>
        <p>
          The apostle says, |Ye are saved.| Not |ye shall be,| or |ye may be|;
          but |ye are saved.| He says not, |Ye are partly saved,| nor |in the
          way to being saved,| nor |hopeful of salvation|; but |by grace are ye
          saved.| Let us be as clear on this point as he was, and let us never
          rest till we know that we are saved. At this moment we are either
          saved or unsaved. That is clear. To which class do we belong? I hope
          that, by the witness of the Holy Ghost, we may be so assured of our
          safety as to sing, |The Lord is my strength and my song; he also is
          become my salvation.| Upon this I will not linger, but pass on to note
          the next point.
        </p>
        <p>II. A Present Salvation Must Be Through Grace.</p>
        <p>
          If we can say of any man, or of any set of people, |Ye are saved,| we
          shall have to preface it with the words |by grace.| There is no other
          present salvation except that which begins and ends with grace. As far
          as I know, I do not think that anyone in the wide world pretends to
          preach or to possess a present salvation, except those who believe
          salvation to be all of grace. No one in the Church of Rome claims to
          be now saved -- completely and eternally saved. Such a profession
          would be heretical. Some few Catholics may hope to enter heaven when
          they die, but the most of them have the miserable prospect of
          purgatory before their eyes. We see constant requests for prayers for
          departed souls, and this would not be if those souls were saved, and
          glorified with their Saviour. Masses for the repose of the soul
          indicate the incompleteness of the salvation Rome has to offer. Well
          may it be so, since Papal salvation is by works, and even if salvation
          by good works were possible, no man can ever be sure that he has
          performed enough of them to secure his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among those who dwell around us, we find many who are altogether
          strangers to the doctrine of grace, and these never dream of present
          salvation. Possibly they trust that they may be saved when they die;
          they half hope that, after years of watchful holiness, they may,
          perhaps, be saved at last; but, to be saved now, and to know that they
          are saved, is quite beyond them, and they think it presumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          There can be no present salvation unless it be upon this footing --
          |By grace are ye saved.| It is a very singular thing that no one has
          risen up to preach a present salvation by works. I suppose it would be
          too absurd. The works being unfinished, the salvation would be
          incomplete; or, the salvation being complete, the main motive of the
          legalist would be gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation must be by grace. If man be lost by sin, how can he be saved
          except through the grace of God? If he has sinned, he is condemned;
          and how can he, of himself, reverse that condemnation? Suppose that he
          should keep the law all the rest of his life, he will then only have
          done what he was always bound to have done, and he will still be an
          unprofitable servant. What is to become of the past? How can old sins
          be blotted out? How can the old ruin be retrieved? According to
          Scripture, and according to common sense, salvation can only be
          through the free favour of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation in the present tense must be by the free favour of God.
          Persons may contend for salvation by works, but you will not hear
          anyone support his own argument by saying, |I am myself saved by what
          I have done.| That would be a superfluity of naughtiness to which few
          men would go. Pride could hardly compass itself about with such
          extravagant boasting. No, if we are saved, it must be by the free
          favour of God. No one professes to be an example of the opposite view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation to be complete must be by free favour. The saints, when they
          come to die, never conclude their lives by hoping in their good works.
          Those who have lived the most holy and useful lives invariably look to
          free grace in their final moments. I never stood by the bedside of a
          godly man who reposed any confidence whatever in his own prayers, or
          repentance, or religiousness. I have heard eminently holy men quoting
          in death the words, |Christ Jesus came into the world to save
          sinners.| In fact, the nearer men come to heaven, and the more
          prepared they are for it, the more simply is their trust in the merit
          of the Lord Jesus, and the more intensely do they abhor all trust in
          themselves. If this be the case in our last moments, when the conflict
          is almost over, much more ought we to feel it to be so while we are in
          the thick of the fight. If a man be completely saved in this present
          time of warfare, how can it be except by grace. While he has to mourn
          over sin that dwelleth in him, while he has to confess innumerable
          shortcomings and transgressions, while sin is mixed with all he does,
          how can he believe that he is completely saved except it be by the
          free favour of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul speaks of this salvation as belonging to the Ephesians, |By grace
          are ye saved.| The Ephesians had been given to curious arts and works
          of divination. They had thus made a covenant with the powers of
          darkness. Now if such as these were saved, it must be by grace alone.
          So is it with us also: our original condition and character render it
          certain that, if saved at all, we must owe it to the free favour of
          God. I know it is so in my own case; and I believe the same rule holds
          good in the rest of believers. This is clear enough, and so I advance
          to the next observation: --
        </p>
        <p>III. Present Salvation by Grace Must Be Through Faith.</p>
        <p>
          A present salvation must be through grace, and salvation by grace must
          be through faith. You cannot get a hold of salvation by grace by any
          other means than by faith. This live coal from off the altar needs the
          golden tongs of faith with which to carry it. I suppose that it might
          have been possible, if God had so willed it, that salvation might have
          been through works, and yet by grace; for if Adam had perfectly obeyed
          the law of God, still he would only have done what he was bound to do;
          and so, if God should have rewarded him, the reward itself must have
          been according to grace, since the Creator owes nothing to the
          creature. This would have been a very difficult system to work, while
          the object of it was perfect; but in our case it would not work at
          all. Salvation in our case means deliverance from guilt and ruin, and
          this could not have been laid hold of by a measure of good works,
          since we are not in a condition to perform any. Suppose I had to
          preach that you as sinners must do certain works, and then you would
          be saved; and suppose that you could perform them; such a salvation
          would not then have been seen to be altogether of grace; it would have
          soon appeared to be of debt. Apprehended in such a fashion, it would
          have come to you in some measure as the reward of work done, and its
          whole aspect would have been changed. Salvation by grace can only be
          gripped by the hand of faith: the attempt to lay hold upon it by the
          doing of certain acts of law would cause the grace to evaporate.
          |Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace.| |If by grace,
          then it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if
          it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more
          work.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Some try to lay hold upon salvation by grace through the use of
          ceremonies; but it will not do. You are christened, confirmed, and
          caused to receive |the holy sacrament| from priestly hands, or you are
          baptized, join the church, sit at the Lord's table: does this bring
          you salvation? I ask you, |have you salvation?| |You dare not say.| If
          you did claim salvation of a sort, yet I am sure it would not be in
          your minds salvation by grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, you cannot lay hold upon salvation by grace through your
          feelings. The hand of faith is constructed for the grasping of a
          present salvation by grace. But feeling is not adapted for that end.
          If you go about to say, |I must feel that I am saved. I must feel so
          much sorrow and so much joy or else I will not admit that I am saved,|
          you will find that this method will not answer. As well might you hope
          to see with your ear, or taste with your eye, or hear with your nose,
          as to believe by feeling: it is the wrong organ. After you have
          believed, you can enjoy salvation by feeling its heavenly influences;
          but to dream of getting a grasp of it by your own feelings is as
          foolish as to attempt to bear away the sunlight in the palm of your
          hand, or the breath of heaven between the lashes of your eyes. There
          is an essential absurdity in the whole affair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the evidence yielded by feeling is singularly fickle. When
          your feelings are peaceful and delightful, they are soon broken in
          upon, and become restless and melancholy. The most fickle of elements,
          the most feeble of creatures, the most contemptible circumstances, may
          sink or raise your spirits: experienced men come to think less and
          less of their present emotions as they reflect upon the little
          reliance which can be safely placed upon them. Faith receives the
          statement of God concerning His way of gracious pardon, and thus it
          brings salvation to the man believing; but feeling, warming under
          passionate appeals, yielding itself deliriously to a hope which it
          dares not examine, whirling round and round in a sort of dervish dance
          of excitement which has become necessary for its own sustaining, is
          all on a stir, like the troubled sea which cannot rest. From its
          boilings and ragings, feeling is apt to drop to lukewarmness,
          despondency, despair and all the kindred evils. Feelings are a set of
          cloudy, windy phenomena which cannot be trusted in reference to the
          eternal verities of God. We now go a step further: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. Salvation by Grace, Through Faith, Is Not of Ourselves.</p>
        <p>
          The salvation, and the faith, and the whole gracious work together,
          are not of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they are not of our former deservings: they are not the reward
          of former good endeavours. No unregenerate person has lived so well
          that God is bound to give him further grace, and to bestow on him
          eternal life; else it were no longer of grace, but of debt. Salvation
          is given to us, not earned by us. Our first life is always a wandering
          away from God, and our new life of return to God is always a work of
          undeserved mercy, wrought upon those who greatly need, but never
          deserve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not of ourselves, in the further sense, that it is not out of
          our original excellence. Salvation comes from above; it is never
          evolved from within. Can eternal life be evolved from the bare ribs of
          death? Some dare to tell us that faith in Christ, and the new birth,
          are only the development of good things that lay hidden in us by
          nature; but in this, like their father, they speak of their own. Sirs,
          if an heir of wrath is left to be developed, he will become more and
          more fit for the place prepared for the devil and his angels! You may
          take the unregenerate man, and educate him to the highest; but he
          remains, and must forever remain, dead in sin, unless a higher power
          shall come in and save him from himself. Grace brings into the heart
          an entirely foreign element. It does not improve and perpetuate; it
          kills and makes alive. There is no continuity between the state of
          nature and the state of grace: the one is darkness and the other is
          light; the one is death and the other is life. Grace, when it comes to
          us, is like a firebrand dropped into the sea, where it would certainly
          be quenched were it not of such a miraculous quality that it baffles
          the water-floods, and sets up its reign of fire and light even in the
          depths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation by grace, through faith is not of ourselves in the sense of
          being the result of our own power. We are bound to view salvation as
          being as surely a divine act as creation, or providence, or
          resurrection. At every point of the process of salvation this word is
          appropriate -- |not of yourselves.| From the first desire after it to
          the full reception of it by faith, it is evermore of the Lord alone,
          and not of ourselves. The man believes, but that belief is only one
          result among many of the implantation of divine life within the man's
          soul by God Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the very will thus to be saved by grace is not of ourselves, but
          it is the gift of God. There lies the stress of the question. A man
          ought to believe in Jesus: it is his duty to receive him whom God has
          set forth to be a propitiation for sins. But man will not believe in
          Jesus; he prefers anything to faith in his redeemer. Unless the Spirit
          of God convinces the judgment, and constrains the will, man has no
          heart to believe in Jesus unto eternal life. I ask any saved man to
          look back upon his own conversion, and explain how it came about. You
          turned to Christ, and believed in his name: these were your own acts
          and deeds. But what caused you thus to turn? What sacred force was
          that which turned you from sin to righteousness? Do you attribute this
          singular renewal to the existence of a something better in you than
          has been yet discovered in your unconverted neighbour? No, you confess
          that you might have been what he now is if it had not been that there
          was a potent something which touched the spring of your will,
          enlightened your understanding, and guided you to the foot of the
          cross. Gratefully we confess the fact; it must be so. Salvation by
          grace, through faith, is not of ourselves, and none of us would dream
          of taking any honour to ourselves from our conversion, or from any
          gracious effect which has flowed from the first divine cause. Last of
          all: --
        </p>
        <p>
          V. |By Grace Are Ye Saved Through Faith; and That Not of Yourselves:
          It Is the Gift of God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation may be called Theodora, or God's gift: and each saved soul
          may be surnamed Dorothea, which is another form of the same
          expression. Multiply your phrases, and expand your expositions; but
          salvation truly traced to its well-head is all contained in the gift
          unspeakable, the free, unmeasured benison of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation is the gift of God, in opposition to a wage. When a man pays
          another his wage, he does what is right; and no one dreams of
          belauding him for it. But we praise God for salvation because it is
          not the payment of debt, but the gift of grace. No man enters eternal
          life on earth, or in heaven, as his due: it is the gift of God. We
          say, |nothing is freer than a gift|. Salvation is so purely, so
          absolutely a gift of God, that nothing can be more free. God gives it
          because he chooses to give it, according to that grand text which has
          made many a man bite his lip in wrath, |I will have mercy on whom I
          will have mercy, I will have compassion on whom I will have
          compassion.| You are all guilty and condemned, and the great King
          pardons whom he wills from among you. This is his royal prerogative.
          He saves in infinite sovereignty of grace.

          Salvation is the gift of God: that is to say completely so, in
          opposition to the notion of growth. Salvation is not a natural
          production from within: it is brought from a foreign zone, and planted
          within the heart by heavenly hands. Salvation is in its entirety a
          gift from God. If thou wilt have it, there it is, complete. Wilt thou
          have it as a perfect gift? |No; I will produce it in my own workshop.|
          Thou canst not forge a work so rare and costly, upon which even Jesus
          spent his life's blood. Here is a garment without seam, woven from the
          top throughout. It will cover thee and make thee glorious. Wilt thou
          have it? |No; I will sit at the loom, and I will weave a raiment of my
          own!| Proud fool that thou art! Thou spinnest cobwebs. Thou weavest a
          dream. Oh! that thou wouldst freely take what Christ upon the cross
          declared to be finished.
        </p>

          It is the gift of God: that is, it is eternally secure in opposition
          to the gifts of men, which soon pass away. |Not as the world giveth,
          give I unto you,| says our Lord Jesus. If my Lord Jesus gives you
          salvation at this moment, you have it, and you have it forever. He
          will never take it back again; and if he does not take it from you,
          who can? If he saves you now through faith, you are saved -- so saved
          that you shall never perish, neither shall any pluck you out of his
          hand. May it be so with every one of us! Amen.<br />
