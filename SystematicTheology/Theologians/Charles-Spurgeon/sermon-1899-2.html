          And it came to pass in those days, when Philip entered into the city
          of Athens called Hellas, there assembled to him three hundred
          philosophers, saying: Let us go and see what his wisdom is; for they
          say about the wise men of Asia, that their wisdom is great. For they
          thought that Philip was a philosopher, since he was travelling in the
          dress of a recluse; and they did not know that he was an apostle of
          Christ. For the dress which Jesus gave to His disciples was a mantle
          only, and a linen cloth. Thus, then, Philip was going about. On this
          account, therefore, when the philosophers of Hellas saw him, they were
          afraid. They assembled therefore into one place, and said to each
          other: Come, let us look into our books, lest somehow this stranger
          overcome us, and put us to shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          And having done so, they came together to the same place, and say to
          Philip: We have doctrines of our fathers in which we are pleased,
          seeking after knowledge; but if thou hast anything new, O stranger,
          show it to us without envy boldly: for we have need of nothing else,
          but only to hear something new.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Philip answering, said to them: O philosophers of Hellas, if you
          wish to hear some new thing, and are desirous of something new, you
          ought to throw away from you the disposition of the old man; as my
          Lord said, It is impossible to put new wine into old bottles, since
          the bottle is burst, and the wine spilled, and the bottle destroyed.
          But they put new wine into fresh bottles, so that both may be
          preserved. And these things the Lord said in parables, teaching us in
          His holy wisdom, that many will love the new wine, not having a bottle
          fresh and new. And I love you, O men of Hellas, and I congratulate you
          for having said, We love something new. For instruction really new and
          fresh my Lord has brought into the world, in order that He might sweep
          away all worldly instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The philosophers say: Who is it that thou callest thy Lord? Philip
          says: My Lord is Jesus in heaven. And they said to him: Show him to
          our comprehension without envy, that we also may believe in him. And
          Philip said: He with whom I am about to make you acquainted as Lord,
          is above every name; there is no other. And this only I say: As you
          have said, Do not refuse us through envy, let it not be that I should
          refuse you; but rather in great exultation and in great joy I have to
          reveal to you that name, for I have no other work in this world than
          this proclamation. For when my Lord came into this world, He chose us,
          being twelve in number, having filled us with the Holy Spirit; from
          His light He made us know who He was, and commanded us to preach all
          salvation through Him, because there is no other name named out of
          heaven than this. On this account I have come to you, to make you
          fully assured, not in word only, but also in the showing forth of
          wonderful works in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when the philosophers heard this, they say to Philip: This name
          that has been heard of by us from thee we have never found in the
          books of our fathers; now, therefore, how can we know about thy words?
          And moreover, in addition, they say to him: Allow us three days, that
          we may consult with each other about this name; for we lay no little
          stress upon this -- to apostatize from our fathers' religion. Philip
          therefore says to them: Consult as you wish; for there is no deceit in
          the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the three hundred philosophers having assembled, spoke with each
          other, saying: You know that this man has brought a strange
          philosophy, and the words spoken by him bring us to distraction. What,
          then, shall we do about him, or about the name of him who is called
          Jesus, the king of the ages, whom he speaks of? And moreover they say
          to each other: Assuredly we cannot reason with him, but the high
          priest of the Jews can. If therefore it seem good, let us send to him,
          in order that he may stand up to this stranger, and that we may learn
          accurately the name that is preached.
        </p>
        <p>
          They wrote therefore to Jerusalem after this manner: -- The
          philosophers of Hellas to Ananias, the great high priest of the Jews
          in Jerusalem. There being between thee and us at all times great ...as
          thou knowest that we Athenians are searchers after truth. A certain
          foreigner has come to Hellas, Philip by name; and, in a word, he has
          disturbed us exceedingly, both by words and by extraordinary miracles,
          and he introduces a glorious name, Jesus, professing himself to be his
          disciple. And he does also wonders of which we write to you, in that
          he has cast out demons that have been long in men, and makes the deaf
          hear, the blind see; and what is more wonderful -- which also we
          should have first mentioned -- he has raised up men after they were
          dead, that have fairly completed the number of their days. And the
          fame of him has gone abroad into all Hellas and Macedonia; and there
          are many coming to him from the cities round about, bringing those who
          are ill with various diseases, and he heals them all through the name
          of Jesus. On this account, therefore, come to us without any
          reluctance, that thou thyself mayst announce to us what Jesus, this
          name which he teaches, means. For on this account also we have sent
          this letter to thee, O high priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when he had read, he was filled with great wrath, and rent his
          clothes, and said: Has that deceiver gone even to Athens, among the
          philosophers, to lead them astray? And the Mansemat -- that is, Satan
          -- entered into Ananias unawares, and filled him with anger and rage;
          and he said: If I allow that Philip himself, and those with him, to
          live, the law will be entirely destroyed, and their teaching will
          likely fill the whole earth. And the high priest went into his own
          house, and the teachers of the law, and the Pharisees; and they
          consulted with each other, saying: What shall we do about these
          things? And they say to the high priest Ananias: Stand up and arm
          thyself, and five hundred able men out of the people, and go away to
          Athens, and by all means kill Philip, and thus thou shalt overturn his
          teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          And having put on the high priest's robe, he came to Hellas in great
          pomp, with the five hundred men. And Philip was in the house of a
          certain chief man of the city, with the brethren who had believed. And
          the high priest and those with him, and the three hundred
          philosophers, went up to the gateway of the house where Philip was;
          and it was told Philip that they were outside. And he rose up and went
          out. And when the high priest saw him, he says to him: O Philip,
          sorcerer and magician, for I know thee, that in Jerusalem thy master
          the deceiver called thee Son of Thunder. Was not the whole of Jud√¶a
          sufficient for you, but you have come here also to deceive men who are
          searchers after wisdom? And Philip said: Would that, O Ananias, thy
          covering of unbelief were taken away from thy heart, that thou mightst
          know my words, and from them learn whether I am a deceiver, or thou!
        </p>
        <p>
          Ananias having heard this, said to Philip: I shall give answer to all.
          And Philip said: Speak. The high priest says: O men of Hellas, this
          Philip believes in a man called Jesus, who was born among us, who also
          taught this heresy, and destroyed the law and the temple, and brought
          to nought the purification through Moses, and the new moons, because
          he says, These have not been commanded by God. And when we saw that he
          thus destroyed the law, we stood up against him, and crucified him,
          that his teaching might not be fulfilled. For many changes were
          brought in by him; and he gave an evil testimony, for he ate all
          things in common, and mixed with blood, after the manner of the
          Gentiles. And having given him up, we put him to death, and buried him
          in a tomb; and these disciples of his having stolen him, have
          proclaimed everywhere that he has risen from the dead, and have led
          astray a great multitude by professing that he is at the right hand of
          God in heaven. But now these men, themselves having the circumcision
          as we also have, have not followed it, since they began to do many
          deeds of power in Jerusalem through the name of Jesus; and having been
          cast out of Jerusalem, they go about the world, and deceive all men by
          the magic of that Jesus, as also now this Philip has come to you to
          deceive you by the same means. But I shall carry him away with myself
          to Jerusalem, because Archelaus the king is also searching for him to
          kill him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when the multitude standing round heard this, those indeed who had
          been confirmed in the faith were not shaken nor made to waver; for
          they knew that Philip would conquer in the glory of Jesus. Philip
          therefore stated his case in the power of Christ with great boldness,
          exulting and saying: I, O men of Athens, and those of you who are
          philosophers, have come to you, not to teach you with words, but by
          the showing forth of miracles; and in part you have quickly seen the
          things that have come to pass through me, in that name by which the
          high priest himself is cast off. For, behold, I shall cry to my God,
          and teach you, and you will prove the words of both.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high priest having heard this, ran to Philip, wishing to scourge
          him, and that same hour his whole hand was dried up, and his eyes were
          blinded; and in like manner also the five hundred who were with him
          were also themselves blinded. And they reviled and cursed the high
          priest, saying: Coming out of Jerusalem we said to thee, Refrain; for,
          being men, we cannot fight against God. But we entreat thee, O Philip,
          apostle of the God Jesus, give us the light that is through him, that
          we also may truly be his slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Philip, having seen what had come to pass, said: O weak nature!
          which has thrown itself upon us, but straightway has been brought down
          low into itself; O bitter sea! which rouses its waves against us, and
          thinks to cast us out, but which by itself lulls its waves to rest.
          Now therefore, O our good steward Jesus, the holy light, Thou hast not
          overlooked us who are all together crying up to Thee in all good
          works, but hast come to finish them through us. Now therefore come,
          Lord Jesus; reprove the folly of these men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high priest says to Philip: Dost thou then think to turn us away
          from the traditions of our fathers, and the God of the desert, and
          Moses; and dost thou imagine that thou wilt make us followers of Jesus
          the Nazarene? Then Philip says to him: Behold, I shall pray to my God
          to come and manifest Himself before thee and the five hundred, and
          before all here; for perhaps thou wilt change thy mind, and believe.
          But if even to the end thou remain in unbelief, there is coming upon
          thee an extraordinary thing, which shall be spoken of to generations
          of generations -- that also thou shalt go down alive, down into Hades,
          before the face of all seeing thee, because thou yet abidest in
          unbelief, because also thou seekest to turn away this multitude from
          the true life. And Philip prayed, saying: O holy Father of the holy
          Son Jesus Christ, who hast granted to me to believe in Him, send Thy
          beloved Son Jesus Christ to reprove the unbelieving high priest, that
          Thy name may be glorified in Christ the Beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while Philip was yet crying out this, suddenly the heavens were
          opened, and Jesus appeared coming down in most excellent glory, and in
          lightning; and His face was shining sevenfold more than the sun, and
          His garments were whiter than snow, so that also all the idols of
          Athens fell suddenly to the ground. And the people fled in anguish;
          and the demons dwelling among them cried out: Behold, we also flee
          because of Him who has appeared to the city, Jesus the Son of God.
          Then Philip says to the high priest: Hearest thou the demons crying
          out because of Him who has been seen, and believest thou not in Him
          who is present that He is Lord of all? The high priest says: I have no
          other God than the one in the desert.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as Jesus was going up into heaven there happened a very great
          earthquake, so that the place on which they stood was cleft; and the
          crowds ran and fell at the feet of the apostle, crying out: Have mercy
          upon us, O man of God! In like manner also the five hundred men cried
          out themselves also again: Have mercy upon us, O Philip, that we may
          know thee, and through thee Jesus the light of life: for we said to
          this unbelieving high priest, Being sinful men, we cannot fight
          against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Philip says: There is no hatred in us, but the grace of Christ
          will make you receive your sight; but I will make the high priest
          receive his sight before you, that at this you may the more believe.
          And a voice out of heaven was brought to Philip: O Philip, son once of
          thunder, but now of meekness, whatever thou mayst ask of my Father, He
          shall do for thee. And all the crowd was terror-struck at the voice,
          for the sound of it was greater than that of thunder. Then Philip says
          to the high priest: In the name of the power of the voice of my Lord,
          receive thy sight, Ananias. And immediately he received his sight, and
          looked round, and said: What is there in the magic of Jesus, that this
          Philip within a short time has made me blind, and again within a short
          time has made me receive my sight? Dost thou then, said Philip,
          believe in Jesus? The high priest says: You do not think, do you, that
          you can bewitch me, and persuade me? And the five hundred who were
          with him, having heard that their high priest, having received his
          sight, was yet unbelieving, said to the bystanders to pray Philip that
          he should make them receive their sight, that, said they, we may cut
          off this unbelieving high priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Philip said: Do not avenge yourselves upon the wicked. And he says
          to the high priest: There will be a certain great sign upon thee. He
          says to Philip: I know that thou art a sorcerer and a disciple of
          Jesus: thou dost not bewitch me. And the apostle said to Jesus:
          Sabarthan, sabathabt, bramanuch, come quickly. And immediately the
          earth was cleft in the place where Ananias was, and swallowed him up
          as far as the knees. And Ananias cried out: O great is the power of
          the true witchcraft, because it has cleft the earth, when Philip
          threatened it in Hebrew, and adjured it; and it holds me even to the
          knees, and by the heels some hooks as it were drag me downwards, that
          I may believe in Philip; but he cannot persuade me, for from Jerusalem
          I know his magic tricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Philip, enraged, said: O earth, lay fast hold of him, even to the
          navel. And immediately it dragged him down. And he said: The one of my
          feet underneath is turned into ice, and the other is frightfully hot;
          but by thy magic, Philip, I will not be overcome. Except, therefore,
          that I am sore tortured underneath, I do not believe at all. And the
          crowds wished to stone him. And Philip says: Not so; for this has in
          the meantime happened, that he has been swallowed up as far as the
          navel, that the salvation of your souls may be effected, because he
          would almost have drawn you by his wicked words into unbelief. But if
          even he repented, I should bring him up out of the earth to the
          salvation of his soul; but assuredly he is not worthy of salvation.
          If, then, he remain in unbelief, you shall see him sunk down into the
          abyss, unless the Lord intends to raise those who are in Hades, that
          they may confess that Jesus is Lord. For in that day every tongue
          shall confess that Jesus is Lord, and that there is one glory of the
          Father, and the Son, with the Holy Spirit for evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Philip, having said this, extended his right hand, stretching it
          through the air over the five hundred men in the name of Jesus. And
          their eyes were opened, and they all praised God with one mouth,
          saying: We bless Thee, O Christ Jesus, the God of Philip, that thou
          hast driven the blindness away from us, and hast given us Thy light,
          the Gospel. And Philip rejoiced exceedingly at their words, because
          they were thus confirmed in the faith. And after this, Philip, having
          turned to the high priest, said: Confess thou also in a pure heart
          that Jesus is Lord, that thou mayst be saved, like those with thee.
          But the high priest laughed at Philip, and remained in unbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philip then, seeing that he remained in unbelief, having looked at
          him, says to the earth: Open thy mouth, and swallow him up as far as
          his neck in the presence of those who have believed in Christ Jesus.
          And in the same hour the earth, having opened its mouth, received him
          as far as the neck. And the multitude communed with each other on
          account of the wonders that had happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          A certain chief man of the city came crying out, and saying: O blessed
          apostle, a certain demon has assailed my son, and cried out, saying to
          me, Since thou hast allowed a foreigner to come into your city, thou
          who hast been the first to do away with our worship and our
          sacrifices, what shall I do for thee, except to kill this thine only
          begotten son? And after he said this, he strangled my son. Now
          therefore, I beseech thee, O apostle of Christ, do not allow my joy to
          be turned into sorrow, because I also have believed thy words.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the apostle, having heard this, said: I wonder at the activity of
          the demons, that it is active in every place, and dares to assail
          those to whose help I have not been able to come, as now they have
          tried you, wishing to cause you to offend. And he says to the man:
          Bring me thy son, and I will give him to thee alive, through my
          Christ. And rejoicing, he ran to bring his son. And when he came near
          his house, he cried out, saying: My son, I have come to thee to carry
          thee to the apostle, so that he may present thee to me living. And he
          ordered his slaves to carry the bed; and his son was twenty-three
          years old. And when Philip saw him, he was moved; and he turned to the
          high priest, and said: This has happened as a chance for thee: if,
          therefore, I shall raise him up, wilt thou henceforth believe? And he
          says: I know your magic arts, that thou wilt raise him up; but I will
          not believe thee. And Philip, enraged, said: A curse upon thee! then
          go down altogether into the abyss before the face of all these. And at
          the same hour he went down into Hades alive, except that the high
          priest's robe flew off from him; and because of this, from that day,
          no one knew what became of the priest's robe. And the apostle turned
          round and prayed for the boy; and having driven the demon away from
          him, he raised him up, and set him beside his father alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the multitude having beheld this, cried out: The God of Philip is
          the only God, who has punished the unbelief of the high priest, and
          driven away the demon from the young man, and raised him up from the
          dead. And the five hundred having seen the high priest swallowed up
          into the abyss, and the other miracles, besought Philip, and he gave
          them the seal in Christ. And Philip abode in Athens two years; and
          having founded a church, appointed a bishop and a presbyter, and so
          went away to Parthia, preaching Christ. To whom be glory for ever.
          Amen.
