        <p>"Christ is all" -- Colossians 3:11.</p>
        <p>
          MY text is so very short that you cannot forget it; and, I am quite
          certain, if you are Christians at all, you will be sure to agree with
          it. What a multitude of religions there is in this poor wicked world
          of ours! Men have taken it into their heads to invent various systems
          of religion and if you look round the world, you will see scores of
          different sects; but it is a great fact that, while there is a
          multitude of false religions, there is but one that is true. While
          there are many falsehoods, there can be but one truth; real religion
          is, therefore, one. There is but one gospel -- the gospel of our Lord
          Jesus Christ. What a wonderful thing it is that Jesus Christ, the Son
          of God, should be born of humble parents, and live as a poor man in
          this world, for the purpose of our salvation! He lived a life of
          suffering and trial, and at length, through the malignity of his
          enemies, was crucified on Calvary as an outcast of society. "Now,"
          said they, "there is an end of his religion; now it will be such a
          contemptible thing, that nobody will ever call himself a Christian; it
          will be discreditable to have anything to do with the name of the man
          Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth." But it is a wonderful fact that this
          religion has not only lived, but is at this hour as strong as ever.
          Yes! the religion he founded still exists, and is still powerful, and
          constantly extending. While other religions have sunk into the
          darkness of the past, and the idols have been cast to the moles and to
          the bats, the name of Jesus is still mighty; and it shall continue to
          be a blessed power so long as the universe shall endure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The religion of Jesus is the religion of God; hence, notwithstanding
          all the obloquy and persecution which it has had to encounter, it
          still exists, and still flourishes. It is this religion which I shall
          attempt to preach to you -- the one gospel of our Lord and Saviour,
          Jesus Christ -- and the text embraces it all in the most comprehensive
          manner, "Christ is all."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall use it, first as a test to try you, and, afterwards, as a
          motive to encourage you. I want, first, to sift you, to see how many
          of you are the people of God, and how many are not. I shall make my
          text a great sieve, and put you in it to see which is wheat and which
          is chaff. We must consider this passage in two or three senses in
          order, first, to use it as: --
        </p>
        <p>I. A TEST TO TRY YOU.</p>
        <p>
          Christ must be all, as your Great Master and Teacher. There are some
          who set up a certain man as their authority; they regard him as their
          master, they look up to him as their teacher, and whatever he says is
          right; it is the truth, and is not to be disputed. Or, perhaps, they
          have taken a certain book, other than the Bible, and say, "We will
          judge all things by this book"; and if the preacher does not teach
          exactly the creed written in that book, he is set down as not sound in
          the faith, and this they do not hesitate to say at once, because he
          does not come up to the standard of their little book! We meet with
          many people in this world who make their creed, their one little
          narrow creed, everything, and they measure everything and everybody by
          that. But, my friends, I must have you say that "Christ is all," and
          not any man, however good or great, before I can allow that you are
          Christians. We have not to follow men. Our faith stands not in the
          wisdom of man, but in the power of God. We are to follow no man,
          except so far as he follows Christ, who alone is our Master. Be not
          deceived; submit not yourselves to creeds, to books, or to men; give
          yourselves to the study of God's Word, derive your creed and the
          doctrines of your faith from it alone, and then you will be able to
          say: --
        </p>
        <p>"Should all the forms that men devise</p>
        <p>Assault my faith with treacherous art,</p>
        <p>I'd call them vanity and lies,</p>
        <p>And bind the gospel to my heart."</p>
        <p>
          Let Christ be your only Master, and say, in the words of our text,
          "Christ is all." Now can you say this, or are you boasting, "The
          Baptists are all" -- "The Wesleyans are all" -- "The Church of England
          is all"? As the Lord lives, if you are saying that, you do not know
          his truth; because you are not testifying that "Christ is all," but
          simply uttering the Shibboleth of your little party. I should like to
          see the word party blotted out from the vocabulary of the Christian
          Church. I thank God that I have no sympathy whatever with that which
          is merely sectarian, and have grace given me to protest against it,
          and to exclaim: --
        </p>
        <p>"Let party names no more</p>
        <p>The Christian world o'erspread";</p>
        <p>since: --</p>
        <p>"Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,</p>
        <p>Are one in Christ, their Head."</p>
        <p>
          If "Christ is all" to you, you are Christians; and I, for one, am
          ready to give you the right hand of brotherhood. I do not mind what
          place of worship you attend, or by what distinctive name you may call
          yourselves, we are brethren; and I think, therefore, that we should
          love one another. If, my friends, you cannot embrace all who love the
          Lord Jesus Christ, no matter to what denomination they may belong, and
          as belonging to the universal Church, you have not hearts large enough
          to go to heaven; because, if such be your contracted views, you cannot
          possibly say, "Christ is all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, Christ must be all, as your principal object in life -- your
          chief good. Your great aim must be to glorify Christ on the earth, in
          the hope and expectation of enjoying him for ever above. But as it
          regards some of you, Christ is not your all. You think more of your
          shop than you do of him. You are up early in the morning looking at
          your ledgers, and all day long toiling at your business. Do not
          mistake me: I dislike lazy people, who let the grass grow over their
          shoes; and God disapproves of them too. We want no lazy gospellers.
          The true Christian will say, "I know that I am bound to be diligent in
          business; but I want to work for eternity as well as for time. I need
          something besides earthly riches; I want an inheritance not made with
          hands, a mansion not built by man, a possession in the skies." Are you
          making this world you all? Poor souls, if you are, the world and the
          fashion thereof are passing away; your all will soon be gone. I fancy
          I see a rich man, one whose gold is his all, when he gets into the
          next world, looking for his gold, and wondering where it is, and being
          at length compelled to exclaim, in despair, "Oh! my all is gone!" But
          if you can say that Christ is your all, then your treasure will never
          be gone; for he will never leave you, nor forsake you. Not only in
          this world, but also in that which is to come, you shall be happy and
          blessed, for you shall be crowned with glory, and made to sit with
          Christ on his throne for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," says some easy-going gentleman, "I do not make business my
          all, I assure you; not I: my maxim is, let us enjoy this life, let us
          fill the glass to the brim, and live in pleasure while we may." I have
          a word also for you Do you think that such a course of conduct will
          fit you for heaven, for the enjoyments of eternity? Do you imagine
          that, when you come to die, it will be any pleasure for you to think
          of your drunkenness? When you are lying on a sick bed, will your oaths
          bring you any peace, as they reverberate upon your conscience, just as
          I hear my voice, at this moment, echoing back to my ears the words I
          am saying? I think I see you starting up as you hear your blasphemies
          against God thus returning upon you, while, with a mind oppressed with
          anguish, and eyes starting from their sockets, you exclaim in your
          terror, "I hear my own oaths again! God is coming to call me to
          judgment; to demand of me why I dare blaspheme his name!" and the
          Judge will say, "You, with oaths and curses, profaned my holy name;
          you asked me to curse your soul, and now I will do it; you prayed in
          your profane moments that you might be lost, and now you shall be."
          How horrible that would be! You who say pleasure is all, let me warn
          you that you will have to drink the bitter dregs of the cup of
          pleasure to all eternity, no matter how sweet the draught may now be
          to your taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are some more moderate people, who are by no means
          extravagant in their pleasures, and are great sticklers for religion;
          they go to church or chapel every Sunday, and believe themselves to be
          very good sort of people, and such as will be accepted at the last
          day, and placed on the right hand of the throne. Again I put the
          question, can you say, "Christ is all"? No; you cannot say that. Many
          of you make the externals of religion your all, resting in the letter,
          but knowing or caring nothing for the spirit. This will not do; and
          you are not such Christians as Christ will own if you are making
          anything your all but himself. Religion is not to be stowed away in
          the dark garret of the brain. Christianity is a heart religion, and if
          you cannot say, from the very depths of your being, "Christ is all,"
          you have neither part nor lot in the blessings and privileges of the
          gospel, and your end will be destruction, everlasting banishment from
          the presence of the Lord. God grant it may not be so; but that in both
          your lives and mine we may each be enabled to say of a truth, "Christ
          is all"; and that we may meet again around the eternal throne!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, Christ will be all, as the source of your joy. Some people seem
          to think that Christians are a very melancholy sort of folk, that they
          have no real happiness. I know something about religion, and I will
          not admit that I stand second to any man in respect of being happy. So
          far as I know religion, I have found it to be a very happy thing.
        </p>
        <p>"I would not change my blest estate,</p>
        <p>For all that earth calls good or great."</p>
        <p>
          I used to think that a religious man must never smile; but, on the
          contrary, I find that religion will make a man's eye bright, and cover
          his face with smiles, and impart comfort and consolation to his soul,
          even in the deepest of his earthly tribulations. In illustration of
          this, I might tell you the story of a poor man who lives in one of the
          courts in Holborn, who experiences great joy in religion, even in the
          midst of the deepest poverty. A Christian visitor, going up into the
          poor man's room at the top of the house, said, "My friend, how long
          have you been in this place?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have not been downstairs, nor walked across the room, these twelve
          months."
        </p>
        <p>"Have you anything to depend upon?"</p>
        <p>
          "Nothing," he replied; but recollecting himself, he added, "I have a
          good Father up in heaven, and I depend upon him entirely, and he never
          lets me want. Some kind Christian friends are sure to call, and they
          never go away without leaving me something; and I get enough to live
          on and pay my rent, and I am very happy. I would not change places
          with anybody in the world, for I have Jesus Christ with me, and my
          heavenly Father will take me home by-and-bye, and then I shall be as
          rich as any of them -- shall I not, sir? Sometimes I get very low, and
          Satan tells me that I am not a child of God, and that I had better
          give up all as lost; but I tell him that he is a great coward to come
          and meddle with a poor weak creature like me; and I show him the
          blood, sir; and I tell him the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from
          all sin; and when I show Satan the precious blood, sir, he leaves off
          tempting me, and flees directly, for he cannot bear the sight of the
          Saviour's blood."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see that true religion can cheer the sick man's couch, can
          make the poor man feel that he is rich, and bid him be joyful in the
          Lord. Well did the old man say that the devil cannot bear the sight of
          the Saviour's blood; and if, beloved friends, you can take Christ's
          blood, and put it on your conscience, however sinful you may have
          been, you will be able to sing of Christ as all your hope, all your
          joy, and all your support. I ask you who love Jesus, does religion
          ever make you unhappy? Does love to Jesus distress you, and make you
          miserable? It may bring you into trouble sometimes, and cause you to
          endure persecution for his name's sake. If you are a child of God, you
          will have to suffer tribulation; but all the afflictions which you may
          be called upon to endure for him will work for your good, and are not
          worthy to be compared with the glory which is to be revealed
          hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, let me ask, could you go with me while I have been
          speaking? Can you now say that Christ is your only Master, your chief
          good, your only joy? "Oh! yes; I do love Jesus, because he first loved
          me." Then, welcome, brother; you are one with Jesus, and we are one
          with each other. But if you cannot say it, how terrible it shall be
          with some of you, when you shall find your gourds wither, the props
          whereon you now lean struck down at a blow, your false refuges swept
          away, and, deprived of all your feathers and finery, your soul will
          appear before God in its true character! May it not be so with any of
          you, but may you be united to Christ by living faith, which works by
          love, and purifies the heart! Secondly, I shall now consider the text
          as: --
        </p>
        <p>II. A MOTIVE TO ENCOURAGE YOU.</p>
        <p>
          "Christ is all." My beloved friends, in what is he all? Christ is all
          in the entire work of salvation. Let me just take you back to the
          period before this world was made. There was a time when this great
          world, the sun, the moon, the stars, and all which now exist
          throughout the whole of the vast universe, lay in the mind of God,
          like unborn forests in an acorn cup. There was a time when the Great
          Creator lived alone, and yet he could foresee that he would make a
          world, and that men would be born to people it; and in that vast
          eternity a great scheme was devised, whereby he might save a fallen
          race. Do you know who devised it? God planned it from first to last.
          Neither Gabriel nor any of the holy angels had anything to do with it.
          I question whether they were even told how God might be just, and yet
          save the transgressors. God was all in the drawing up of the scheme,
          and Christ was all in carrying it out. There was a dark and doleful
          night! Jesus was in the garden, sweating great drops of blood, which
          fell to the ground; nobody then came to bear the load that had been
          laid upon him. An angel stood there to strengthen him, but not to bear
          the sentence. The cup was put into his hands, and Jesus said, "Father,
          must I drink it?" and his Father replied, "If thou dost not drink,
          sinners cannot be saved"; and he took the cup and drained it to its
          very dregs. No man helped him. And when he hung upon that accursed
          tree of Calvary, when his precious hands were pierced, when: --
        </p>
        <p>"From his head, his hands, his feet,</p>
        <p>Sorrow and love flowed mingled down,"</p>
        <p>
          there was nobody to help him. He was "all" in the work of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, my friends, if any of you shall be saved, it must be by Christ
          alone. There must be no patchwork; Christ did it all, and will not be
          helped in the matter. Christ will not allow you, as some say, to do
          what you can, and leave him to make up the rest. What can you do that
          is not sinful? Christ has done all for us; the work of redemption is
          all finished. Christ planned it all, and worked out all; and we,
          therefore, preach a full salvation through Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          What could we poor mortals do towards saving ourselves? Our best works
          are but mean and worthless to that great end; I am sure I could not do
          it. My preaching -- I am ashamed of that, and there are a thousand
          faults in my prayers. God wants nothing of us by way of "making up"
          Christ's work; but he cancels all the sins, and blots out all the
          transgressions of everyone who trusts to his Son's death.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I have found Christ, I have found all. "I have not strong faith,"
          say you. Never mind; Christ is all. "I do not feel my sins
          sufficiently"; but Christ is all. Many people think they must feel a
          load of repentance before they may hope Christ will receive them. I
          know every child of God will repent; but we are not all brought to the
          cross by the terrors of the law. It is not your feelings, my friends,
          that will save you; but Christ only, Christ standing in your stead,
          Christ being your Substitute. If, feeling your need of his grace to
          pardon you, and his righteousness to justify you before God, you can
          but just look to Christ, though you have nothing good about you, you
          will have done all that is necessary to carry you to heaven; because
          it is not your act that can save you, but the act of Christ alone. A
          little while ago, I had a conversation with an Irishman, who had been
          to hear me preach. He had come to ask me, he said, the way of
          salvation. "What troubles me," said he, "is this: God says that he
          will condemn the sinner, and punish him; then how can God forgive,
          because he must punish if he would keep his word?" I placed before him
          the Scriptural view of the atonement, in the substitution of Christ
          for the sinner; and the poor man was astonished and delighted beyond
          measure, never having understood the beauty and simplicity of the
          gospel way of salvation before. "Is it really so?" said he. "It is in
          the Bible," I replied. "Then the Bible must be true," said he, "for
          nobody but God could have thought it."
        </p>
        <p>
          If Jesus Christ is our Surety, friends, we are safe from the demands
          of the law. If Christ is our Substitute, we shall not suffer the
          penalty due to sin; for God will never punish the same sin twice. If I
          have nothing but Christ, I do not want anything else, for Christ is
          all. If Christ is your all, you will not want anything to help you,
          either in living or in dying. Now for two thoughts before I close.

          1. If a man has Christ, then what does he want else? If a man has
          Christ, he has everything. If I want perfection, and I have Christ, I
          have absolute perfection in him. If I want righteousness, I shall find
          in him my beauty and my glorious dress. I want pardon, and if I have
          Christ, I am pardoned. I want heaven, and if I have Christ, I have the
          Prince of heaven, and shall be there by-and-bye, to live with Christ,
          and to dwell in his blessed embrace for ever. If you have Christ, you
          have all. Do not be desponding, do not give ear to the whisperings of
          Satan that you are not the children of God; for if you have Christ,
          you are his people, and other things will come by-and-bye. Christ
          makes you complete in himself; as the apostle says, "Ye are complete
          in him." I think of poor Mary Magdalene; she would have nothing to
          bring of her own; she would remember that she had been a harlot; but
          when she comes to heaven's gates, she will say, "I have Christ," and
          the command will go forth, "Let her in, Gabriel; let her in." Here
          comes a poor squalid wretch, what has he been doing? He has never
          learned to write, he scarcely went even to a Ragged- school, but he
          has Christ in his heart. "Gabriel, let him in." Next comes a rich bad
          man, with rings on his fingers, and fine clothes upon his person; but
          the command is, "Shut the gates, Gabriel; he has no business here."
          Then comes a fine flaming professor of the gospel; but he never knew
          Christ in his heart. "Shut the gate, Gabriel." If a man has Christ, he
          has all for eternity; and if he has not Christ, he is poor, and blind,
          and naked, and will be miserable for ever. Will not you, then, who are
          listening to me now, resolve, in the strength of the Lord, to seek him
          at once, and make him your Friend? No matter what may be your state or
          condition, you are invited to come to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye blind, ye lame, who are far from Christ, come to him, and receive
          your sight, and obtain strength! He is made your all; you need bring
          nothing in your hand to come to him. "Ah!" says one, "I am not good
          enough yet." Beggars do not talk thus: they consider that, the more
          needy they are, the more likely are they to obtain that for which they
          ask. The worse the dress, the better for begging. It is the same with
          respect to the gospel; and you are invited to come to Christ just as
          you are, naked and miserable, that he may clothe and comfort you.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. My last thought is this: How poor is that man who is destitute of
          Christ! If I were to say to some one of you that you are poor, you
          would reply, "I am not poor; I have 250 pounds a year coming in, a
          decent house, and an excellent situation." And yet, if you have not
          Christ, you are a poor man indeed. Look at that poor worldling with a
          load of 10,000 pounds upon his back, a quantity of stocks and
          annuities in one hand, policies and railway scrip in the other; but he
          is wretched with all his wealth, though he can hardly carry it. There
          is a poor beggar-woman, who says to him, "Let me take a part of your
          burden"; but the miserable man refuses all assistance, and resolves to
          carry all his load himself. But by-and-bye he comes to a great gulf,
          and, instead of finding these riches help him, they hang around his
          neck like millstones, and weigh him down. Yet there are some who would
          do anything for gold. If there be one man more miserable than another
          in hell, it must be the man who robbed his neighbours to feather his
          own nest; such feathers will help the flight of the arrows which shall
          pierce his soul to all eternity. No matter what your wealth, if you
          have not Christ, you are miserably poor; but with Christ, you are rich
          to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methinks I see one of you ungodly ones in your last moments; someone
          stands by your bedside, and watches your face; the death-sweat comes
          over you, and the big drops stand on your brow; the strong man is
          bowed down, and the mighty one falls; and now the eye closes, and the
          hand falls powerless -- life is fled. Ah! but the soul never dies! Up
          it flies to appear at God's bar. How will it appear there? Oh! the
          poor soul without Christ! It will be a naked soul; it will have no
          garment to cover it -- it will be a perishing soul, no salvation for
          it. Mercy cannot be secured then; it will be in vain to pray then,
          because the lamp will be put out in eternal darkness. And the Judge
          will say, in tones that will pierce you to the quick, "Depart from me,
          ye cursed."
        </p>
        <p>
          May God give all of you grace to repent, and to embrace the salvation
          which is revealed in the gospel! Every sin-sick soul may have Christ;
          but as for you who are Pharisees, and trusting in yourselves that you
          are righteous, if you know nothing about sin, you can know nothing
          about Christ. The way to be saved is to believe on the Lord Jesus
          Christ. "But what is it to believe?" you say. I have heard of a
          captain who had a little son, and this little boy was very fond of
          climbing aloft. One day he climbed to the mast-head, and the father
          saw that, if the boy attempted to return, he would be dashed to
          pieces; he, therefore, shouted to him not to look down, but to drop
          into the sea. The poor boy kept fast hold of the mast; but the father
          saw it was his only chance of safety, and he shouted once more, "Boy,
          the next time the ship lurches, drop, or I will shoot you." The boy is
          gone; he drops into the sea, and is saved. Had he not dropped, he must
          have perished. This is just your condition: so long as you cling to
          works and ceremonies, you are in the utmost peril; but when you give
          yourselves up entirely to the mercy of Christ, you are safe. Try it,
          sinner; try it, that is all. "He that believeth and is baptized shall
          be saved," is Christ's promise, and it shall never fail you. The
          invitation is to all who thirst. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.
          And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come,
          and take the water of life freely." I have heard that, in the deserts
          where they can only get water at long intervals, they send a man on a
          camel in search of it; when he sees a pool, he springs off his beast,
          and before he himself drinks he calls out, "Come," and there is
          another man at a little distance, and he shouts, "Come," and one
          further away still repeats the word, "Come," until the whole desert
          resounds with the cry, "Come," and they come rushing to the water to
          drink. Now I do not make the gospel invitation wider than the
          declaration of the Word of God, "Whosoever will, let him take the
          water of life freely." Whosoever you are, and whatsoever you may have
          been, if you feel your need of Christ, "Come," and he will receive
          you, and give you to drink of the water of life freely.
        </p>
        <p>Colossians 3; 4:1-4. Psalm 28:1-6.</p>
        <p>
          Verse 1. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
          above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! how often we need to be called to this, for the flesh is
          grovelling, and it holds down the spirit; and very often we are
          seeking the things below as if we had not yet attained to the new
          life, and did not know anything about the resurrection power of Christ
          within the soul. Now, if it be that you, believers, have risen with
          Christ, do not live as if you had never done so, but "seek those
          things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
          God."
        </p>
        <p>2. Set your affection.</p>
        <p>
          Not "your affections." Tie them up into one bundle. Make one of them.
        </p>
        <p>2. On things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
        <p>
          You say that you were dead with Christ, and that you have risen with
          Christ. Live, then, the risen life, and not the life of those who have
          never undergone this matchless process. Live above.
        </p>
        <p>3. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
        <p>
          The old life is dead. You are dead to it. You will not be consumed by
          it: you cannot be controlled by it. You have a newer and higher life.
          Let it have full scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
          appear with him in glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ was hidden while he was here. The world knew him not. So is
          your life. But there is to be a glorious manifestation. When Christ is
          made manifest, so shall you be. Wait for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
          fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,
          and covetousness, which is idolatry:
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you are dead, let all the lusts of the flesh be put to death.
          Kill those. They were once a part of you. Your nature lusted this way.
          Mortify them. Do not merely restrain them and try to keep them under.
          These things you are to have nothing to do with.
        </p>
        <p>
          6, 7. For which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
          disobedience: In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When ye lived in them" But now you do not live in them. You are dead
          to them. If it should ever come to pass that you fall into any of
          these things, you will loathe yourself with bitterest repentance that
          you could find comfort, satisfaction, life in them. You are dead to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          8-10. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
          blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to
          another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds: And
          have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image
          of him that created him:
        </p>
        <p>
          No lies. Such communications are filthy. But you put these things away
          through your union with Christ in his risen life. Therefore, abhor
          them. Avoid the very appearance of them, and cry for grace to be kept
          from them, for you have been "renewed in knowledge after the image of
          him that created him."
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
          uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all,
          and in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the new life there is no distinction of race and nationality. We
          are born into one family; we become members of Christ's body; and this
          is the one thing we have got to keep up -- separation from all the
          world beside: no separations in the church, no disunion, nothing that
          would cause it, for we are one in Christ, and Christ is all. Now, as
          we have to put off these things, that is the negative side: that is
          the law's side, for the law says, "Thou shalt not" -- "Thou shalt
          not." But now look at the positive side.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
          mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering:
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what you have got to wear, even on the outside -- to put it
          on; not to have a latent kindness in your heart, and a degree of
          humbleness deep down in your soul if you could get at it; but you are
          to put it on. It is to be the very dress you wear. These are the
          sacred vestments of your daily priesthood. Put them on.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have
          a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as readily, just as freely, just as heartily, just as completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          14-15 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
          perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that is the great foundation of every godly fruit. We are in such
          a hurry, in such dreadful haste, so selfish, so discontented, so
          impetuous, and the major part of our sins spring from that condition
          of mind. But if we were godly, restful, peaceful, how many sins we
          should avoid! "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts."
        </p>
        <p>
          15. To the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
        </p>
        <p>
          It looks like a very small virtue to be thankful. Yet, dear friends,
          the absence of it is one of the grossest of vices. To be ungrateful is
          a mean thing: to be ungrateful to God is a base thing. And yet how
          many may accuse themselves of it! Who among us is as grateful as he
          should be? Be thankful.
        </p>
        <p>16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you.</p>
        <p>
          Alexander had a casket of gold studded with gems to carry Homer's
          works. Let your own heart be a casket for the command of Christ. "Let
          the word of Christ dwell in you."
        </p>
        <p>
          16-18 Richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in
          psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your
          hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in
          the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by
          him. Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in
          the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how our being Christians does not relax the bonds of our Christian
          relationship, but it calls us to the higher exercise of the
          responsibilities and duties connected therewith.
        </p>
        <p>19. Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
        <p>
          Oh! there are some spirits that are very bitter. A little thing puts
          them out, and they would take delight in a taunt which grieves the
          spirit. I pity the poor woman who has such bitterness where she ought
          to have sweetness: yet there be some such husbands.
        </p>
        <p>
          20-21 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well
          pleasing unto the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger,
          lest they be discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The duties are mutual. Scripture maintains an equilibrium. It does not
          lay down commands for one class, and then leave the other to exercise
          whatever tyrannical oppression it may please. The child is to obey,
          but the father must not provoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          22. Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh;
          not with eyeservice, as menpleasers;
        </p>
        <p>
          How much there is of that! How quickly the hands go when the master's
          eye looks on! But the Christian servant remembers God's eye, and is
          diligent always. "Not with eye service as men-pleasers."
        </p>
        <p>
          22. Chap.4:2 But in singleness of heart, fearing God: And whatsoever
          ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; Knowing that
          of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye
          serve the Lord Christ. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the
          wrong which he hath done; and there is no respect of persons. Masters,
          give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye
          also have a Master in heaven. Continue in prayer, and watch in the
          same with thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how he keeps putting that in -- "Be ye thankful" -- "with
          thanksgiving." Why, that is the oil that makes the machinery go round
          without its causing obstruction. May we have much of that
          thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          3, 4. Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door
          of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in
          bonds: that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the preacher of the gospel asks your prayers: and it is a part of
          the duties arising out of the relationship between Christian men that
          those who are taught should pray for those who teach God's Word.
