          v 41. And let thy mercies come to me, O Jehovah! and thy salvation,
          according to thy word. v 42. And I will answer a word to him who
          reproacheth me, because I have trusted in thy word. v 43. And take not
          the word of truth too long out, of my mouth, because I hope for thy
          judgments. v 44. And I will keep thy law always, even for ever and
          ever. v 45. And I will walk at ease; because I have sought thy
          statutes. v 46. And I will speak of thy testimonies before kings, and
          will not be ashamed. v 47. And 1f will delight myself in thy
          commandments, which I have loved. v 48. And I will lift up my hands to
          thy statutes, which I have loved, and will meditate on thy precepts.

          41. Let thy mercies come to me There can be no doubt, that, in
          mentioning the mercy of God first, and afterwards his salvation, the
          Psalmist, according to the natural order, puts the cause before the
          effect. By adopting this arrangement, he acknowledges that there is no
          salvation for him but in the pure mercy of God. And while he desires a
          gracious salvation, he, at the same time, relies on the promise, as we
          have already elsewhere seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second verse he boasts that he is furnished with the best
          defense against the calumnies of his enemies, arising from his trust
          in the word of God. We may resolve the future tense into the optative
          mood, as many do: O Lord, since I have trusted in thy word, grant that
          my mouth with all boldness may repel the slanders which they utter
          against me, and suffer me not to be silent when they load me with
          unmerited reproach." Whichever of these meanings we adopt, we are
          taught that there will always be evil-speakers, who will not cease to
          defame the children of God, though they be entirely undeserving of
          such treatment. It is somewhat dubious to what particular kind of
          reproach he refers; for the ungodly not only cover the children of God
          with ignominy, but also make their faith the subject of ridicule. I
          prefer the following interpretation, because it agrees best with the
          context, and David is here placing his trust in God in opposition to
          their derision. "I shall have something to reply to the base mockery
          of the enemies who injure me without cause, in that God never
          disappoints those who place their confidence in him." If any one be
          inclined to consider the passage as embracing both meanings, I offer
          no objection to it. Besides, he does not simply say, that he trusted
          in God, but that he also trusted in his word, which is the ground of
          his trust. We must carefully attend to the correspondence and mutual
          relation between the term word, in the first part of the verse, and
          that in the other. Were not God, by his Word, to furnish us with
          another word for our defense, we would instantly be overwhelmed with
          the insolence of our enemies. If, then, we wish to be proof against
          the attacks of the world, the commencement and foundation of our
          magnanimity is here pointed out to us, -- our trusting in God's word,
          guarded by which, the Spirit of God calls upon us boldly to contemn
          the virulent blasphemies of the ungodly. And to qualify us for
          repelling such blasphemies, he connects the word of hope with the word
          of confession.
        </p>
        <p>
          43. Take not the word of truth too long out of my mouth It may be
          asked, why he demands rather to have his tongue filled with, than his
          heart fortified by, the word of truth; inasmuch as the latter takes
          the precedence, both in point of order and of excellence. What will it
          profit us to be fluent and eloquent in speech, if our hearts are
          destitute of faith? On the other hand, wherever there is firm faith,
          there to speech will flow ultroneously. My reply is, that David was
          not so concerned about outward confession as not to give the
          preference to the faith of the heart; but considering that he is
          making his address to God, there is nothing strange in his making
          mention only of the former, under which, however, he includes also the
          latter. "Lord, support not only my heart by faith, lest I be
          overwhelmed with temptation, but grant me also freedom of speech, that
          I may fearlessly sound forth thy praises among men." We observe, when
          he asks to be endued with boldness of speech, that he begins with the
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be farther inquired here, why he says too long, just as if he
          were not afraid of being deprived of the word of truth for a short
          time. Such a supposition were most absurd, seeing we must watch every
          moment lest we be overtaken by the enemy, when we are unarmed and
          powerless. The solution of this difficulty must be drawn from our own
          experience; for in this, the infirmity of our flesh, it is almost
          impossible but that, occasionally, even the stoutest heart will quail
          under the violent assaults of Satan. And although their faith fails
          not, yet it shakes, and they do not find such presence of mind, as
          that there is constantly a uniform train of speech, and a prompt reply
          to the derision's of the ungodly; but, on the contrary, they rather
          begin to stagger and quake for a short time. Conscious of this
          weakness, which is perceptible in all mankind, he accommodates his
          prayer in the following manner: "Though I am not always prepared with
          that boldness of speech which is desirable, suffer me not to continue
          long silent." By this language the prophet tacitly admits, that he had
          not been so steadfast and bold as was requisite, but that he was, as
          it were, struck speechless by reason of fear. Whence we may learn,
          that the faculty of speaking freely is no more in our power than are
          the affections. of the heart. As far, then, as God directs our
          tongues, they are prepared for ready utterance; but no sooner does he
          withdraw the spirit of magnanimity, than not only our hearts faint, or
          rather fail, but also our tongues become mute. The cause of this is
          subjoined in these words, for I have waited for thy judgments for so
          he literally expresses himself. From which we conclude, that judgments
          refer not merely to the precepts of the law, but also to the promises,
          which constitute the true foundation of our confidence. Some render
          it, I was afraid of thy. judgments, deriving the word here employed
          from the root chvl chul; which translation I am unable to say whether
          it be suitable or not. But of this I am certain, that to understand
          judgments as equivalent to punishments, is quite foreign to the design
          of the prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
          44. I will keep thy law continually He resolves to devote himself to
          the study of the law, not for a short time only, but even to the
          termination of his life. The employing of three synonymous words,
          tmyd, tamid, vlm, olam, d, ed, so far from being viewed as a
          superfluous accumulation of terms, contains an implied indication,
          that, unless the faithful make a strenuous and steady opposition, the
          fear of God may be gradually effaced from their minds by various
          temptations, and they will lose the affection which they bear for the
          law. In order, therefore, that he may be the better prepared for
          meeting these trials, he alludes to the difficulty and danger
          connected with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next verse may be read as expressing a desire that he might walk.
          Be this as it may, we retain the commonly received reading, That David
          exults at the thought of his path becoming plain and easy, in
          consequence of his seeking diligently after God's precepts; that is,
          to walk at ease The ways of men are frequently rugged and obstructed,
          because they themselves lay various stumblingblocks in them, or
          entangle themselves in many inextricable windings. Hence it comes to
          pass, that while none will submit to the word of God as their rule,
          every man endures the punishment legitimately due to such arrogance.
          On all sides God lays snares for us, puts pitfalls in our way, causes
          us to fall in with paths broken and rugged, and at last shuts us up in
          a bottomless pit: and by how much the more politic a mart is, by so
          much the more will he meet with obstructions in his path.
        </p>
        <p>
          This verse teaches us that, if any man yield implicit obedience to
          God, he will receive this as his reward, that he shall walk with a
          calm and composed mind; and should he meet with difficulties, he will
          find the means of surmounting them. The faithful, however readily and
          submissively they give themselves up to God, may happen to find
          themselves involved in perplexity; nevertheless, the end contemplated
          by Paul is accomplished, that though they be in trouble and toil, yet
          they do not continue in irremediable distress, because it is the duty
          (so to speak) of God to point out a way for them where there seems to
          be no way, (2 Corinthians 4:8.) Moreover, when grievously oppressed,
          even then they walk at ease, for they commit the doubtful issue of
          events to God in such a manner, that, having him for their guide, they
          have no doubt they will come out boldly from the depths of distress.
        </p>

          46. And I will steal, of thy testimonies before kings In these words
          he seems to believe that he is in possession of that which he formerly
          prayed for. Having said, "Take not away the word out of my mouths" and
          now, as if he had obtained what he requested, he rises up, and
          maintains he will not be dumb, even were he called upon to speak in
          the presence of kings. There can be no question that he affirms he
          would willingly stand forward in vindication of the glory of God in
          the face of the whole world. He selects kings, who are generally more
          to be dreaded than other men, and haughtily shut the mouths of God's
          witnesses. Sometimes, indeed, it happens we will not hold out even in
          the presence of men in the humblest ranks of life. The moment a man
          sets himself in opposition to the word of God, we instinctively shrink
          back from fear; and that boldness of speech, of which we boasted at
          first, instantly disappears: but our want of courage is most palpable
          when we are summoned before the thrones of kings. And this is the
          reason why David asserts, that he will not only hold out against
          enemies among the meanest of men, but also will remain firm and
          fearless before kings. These words inform us that we have profited
          well and truly by God's word, when our hearts are so completely
          fortified against the fear of man, that we do not dread the presence
          of kings, even though all the world attempts; to fill us with
          dejection and dismay. It is most unbecoming that God's glory should be
          obscured by their empty splendor.
        </p>

          47. And I will delight myself The sentiment contained in this verse is
          similar to that which he had previously mentioned. The amount is, he
          held the commandments of God in such high esteem, that he experienced
          nothing more pleasant to him than the making of them his constant
          theme of meditation. By the term delight, he expresses the intensity
          of his love. The phrase I will lift up my hands, refers, to the same
          thing. It is a sure indication that we eagerly desire a thing when we
          stretch out the hands to grasp and enjoy it. This simile, therefor
          denotes the ardor of his desire. If a man, by his mien and gait
          pretend any such affection for the law of God, and yet pay no regard
          to it in the affairs of life, he would be justly chargeable with the
          basest hypocrisy. Again, he affirms, that that affection, so earnest
          and so ardent, springs from the sweetness of the law of God having
          knit our hearts to it. Finally, he says, he would meditate on God's
          testimonies. Along with the majority of commentators, I have no doubt
          that the word svch shuach, denotes that silent and secret musing in
          which the children of God exercise themselves.<br />
