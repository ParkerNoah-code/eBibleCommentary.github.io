          [a.d.140.] Aristo of Pella is supposed to have been a Jew, whose work
          was designed to help the failing Judaism of his country. Though his
          work is lost, alike the original and the Latin translation of one
          |Celsus,| it seems to have been a popular tract among Christians of
          Cyprian's time, and the Latin preface is often suffixed to editions of
          that Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work of Aristo is known as the Disputation of Papiscus and Jason,
          and Celsus tells us that Jason was a Hebrew Christian, while his
          opponent was a Jew of Alexandria. Now, Papiscus owns himself convinced
          by the arguments of Jason, and concludes by a request to be baptized.
          Celsus, who seems to have been a heathen or an Epicurean, derides the
          work with scornful commiseration; but Origen rebukes this, and affirms
          his respect for the work. All this considered, one must think Aristo
          was |almost persuaded to be a Christian,| and deserves a place among
          Christian writers.
        </p>
        <p>From the Disputation of Jason and Papiscus.</p>
        <p>
          |I remember,| says Jerome (Comm. ad Gal., cap. iii. comm.13), |in the
          Dispute between Jason and Papiscus, which is composed in Greek, to
          have found it written: The execration of God is he that is hanged.'|
        </p>
        <p>From the Same Work.</p>
        <p>
          Jerome likewise, in his Hebrew Questions on Genesis, says: |In the
          beginning God made the heaven and the earth. The majority believe, as
          it is affirmed also in the Dispute between Jason and Papiscus, and as
          Tertullian in his book Against Praxeas contends, and as Hilarius too,
          in his exposition of one of the Psalms, declares, that in the Hebrew
          it is: In the Son, God made the heaven and the earth.' But that this
          is false, the nature of the case itself proves.|
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps from the Same Work.</p>
        <p>
          ...And when the man himself who had instigated them to this folly had
          paid the just penalty (says Eusebius, Hist., iv.6), |the whole nation
          from that time was strictly forbidden to set foot on the region about
          Jerusalem, by the formal decree and enactment of Adrian, who commanded
          that they should not even from a distance look on their native soil!|
          So writes Aristo of Pella.
        </p>
        <p>From the Same Work.</p>
        <p>
          I have found this expression Seven heavens (says Maximus, in Scholia
          on the work concerning the Mystical Theology, ascribed to Dionysius
          the Areopagite, cap. i.) also in the Dispute between Papiscus and
          Jason, written by Aristo of Pella, which Clement of Alexandria, in the
          sixth book of the Outlines, says was composed by Saint Luke.
        </p>
        <p>Concerning the Same Work.</p>
        <p>
          Thus writes Origen: ...in which book a Christian is represented
          disputing with a Jew from the Jewish Scriptures, and showing that the
          prophecies concerning the Christ apply to Jesus: although his opponent
          addresses himself to the argument with no common ability, and in a
          manner not unbefitting his Jewish character.
