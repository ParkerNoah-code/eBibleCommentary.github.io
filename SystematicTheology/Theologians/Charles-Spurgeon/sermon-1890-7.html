        <p>To Bishop Benedictus.</p>
        <p>
          On the Fasts of the Four Seasons, and that no one should take up an
          accusation against a doctor (teacher).
        </p>
        <p>
          Callistus, archbishop of the Church Catholic in the city of Rome, to
          Benedictus, our brother and bishop, greeting in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the love of the brotherhood we are bound, and by our apostolic rule
          we are constrained, to give answer to the inquiries of the brethren,
          according to what the Lord has given us, and to furnish them with the
          authority of the seal of the apostles.
