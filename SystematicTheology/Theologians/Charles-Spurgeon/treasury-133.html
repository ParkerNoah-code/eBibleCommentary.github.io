<p align="justify">Title. A Song of Degrees for Solomon. It was meet that 
    the builder of the holy house should be remembered by the pilgrims to its 
    sacred shrine. The title probably indicates that David wrote it for his wise 
    son, in whom he so greatly rejoiced, and whose name Jedidiah, or "beloved of 
    the Lord," is introduced into Psalm 127:2. The spirit of his name, "Solomon, 
    or peaceable," breathes through the whole of this most charming song. If 
    Solomon himself was the author, it comes fitly from him who reared the house 
    of the Lord. Observe how in each of these songs the heart is fixed upon 
    Jehovah only. Read the first verses of these Psalms, from Psalm 120:1-7 to 
    the present song, and they run thus: "I cried unto the Lord, I will lift up 
    mine eyes to the hills, Let us go unto the house of the Lord,.... Unto you 
    will I lift up mine eyes,.... If it had not been the Lord,.... They that 
    trust in the Lord,.... When the Lord turned again the captivity." The Lord 
    and the Lord alone is thus lauded at each step of these songs of the 
    ascents. O for a life whose every halting-place shall suggest a new song 
    unto the Lord!</p>
<p align="justify">Subject. God's blessing on his people as their one great 
    necessity and privilege is here spoken of. We are here taught that builders 
    of houses and cities, systems and fortunes, empires and churches all labor 
    in vain without the Lord; but under the divine favor they enjoy perfect 
    rest. Sons, who are in the Hebrew called "builders," are set forth as 
    building up families under the same divine blessing, to the great honor and 
    happiness of their parents. It is the Builder's Psalm. "Every house is built 
    by some man, but he who built all things is God," and unto God be praise.
    </p>
<p align="justify">1 Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain 
    that build it, except the Lord keep the city, the watchman wakes but in 
    vain.</p>
<p align="justify">2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to 
    eat the bread of sorrows; for so he gives his beloved sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit 
    of the womb is his reward.</p>
<p align="justify">4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are 
    children of the youth.</p>
<p align="justify">5 Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them—they 
    shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.<br/>

<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 127:1<br/>
    "Except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it."</p></b> The 
    word vain is the key-note here, and we near it ring out clearly three times. 
    Men desiring to build know that they must labor, and accordingly they put 
    forth all their skill and strength; but let them remember that if Jehovah is 
    not with them, their designs will prove failures. 
<p align="justify">So was it with the Babel builders; they said, "Go to, let 
    us build us a city and a tower"; and the Lord returned their words into 
    their own bosoms, saying, "Go to, let us go down and there confound their 
    language." In vain they toiled, for the Lord's face was against them. </p>
<p align="justify">When Solomon resolved to build a house for the Lord, 
    matters were very different, for all things united under God to aid him in 
    his great undertaking: even the heathen were at his beck and call that he 
    might erect a temple for the Lord his God.</p>
<p align="justify">In the same manner God blessed him in the erection of his 
    own palace; for this verse evidently refers to all sorts of house-building.
    </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Without God we are nothing. </p></i>Great houses have been 
    erected by ambitious men; but like the baseless fabric of a vision they have 
    passed away, and scarce a stone remains to tell where once they stood. The 
    wealthy builder of a Palace, could he revisit the glimpses of the moon, 
    would be perplexed to find a relic of his former pride: he labored in vain, 
    for the place of his travail knows not a trace of his handiwork. 
<p align="justify">The like may be said of the builders of castles and 
    abbeys: when the mode of life indicated by these piles ceased to be 
    endurable by the Lord, the massive walls of ancient architects crumbled into 
    ruins, and their toil melted like the froth of vanity. Not only do we now 
    spend our strength for nothing without Jehovah, but all who have ever 
    labored apart from him come under the same sentence. Trowel and hammer, saw 
    and plane are instruments of vanity unless the Lord be the Master-builder.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman wakes but in 
    vain."</p></b> Around the wall the sentinels pace with constant step; but yet 
    the city is betrayed unless the unsleeping Watcher is with them. We are not 
    safe because of watchmen if Jehovah refuses to watch over us. Even if the 
    guards are wakeful, and do their duty, still the place may be surprised if 
    God is not there. "I, the Lord, do keep it," is better than an army of 
    sleepless guards. 
<p align="justify">Note that the Psalmist does not bid the builder cease 
    from laboring, nor suggest that watchmen should neglect their duty, nor that 
    men should show their trust in God by doing nothing: nay, he supposes that 
    they will do all that they can do, and then he forbids their fixing their 
    trust in what they have done, and assures them that all creature effort will 
    be in vain unless the Creator puts forth his power, to render second causes 
    effectual. </p>
<p align="justify">Holy Scripture endorses the order of Cromwell, "Trust in 
    God, and keep your powder dry" only here the sense is varied, and we are 
    told that the dried powder will not win the victory unless we trust in God. 
    Happy is the man who hits the golden mean by so working as to believe in 
    God, and so believing in God as to work without fear.</p>
<p align="justify">In Scriptural phrase, a dispensation or system is called 
    a house. Moses was faithful as a servant over all his house; and as long as 
    the Lord was with that house it stood and prospered; but when he left it, 
    the builders of it became foolish and their labor was lost. They sought to 
    maintain the walls of Judaism, but sought in vain: they watched around every 
    ceremony and tradition, but their care was idle. Of every church, and every 
    system of religious thought, this is equally true: unless the Lord is in it, 
    and is honored by it, the whole structure must sooner or later fall in 
    hopeless ruin. Much can be done by man; he can both labor and watch; but 
    without the Lord he has accomplished nothing, and his wakefulness has not 
    warded off evil.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 127:2<br/>
    "It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of 
    sorrows." </p></b>Because the Lord is mainly to be rested in, all carking care 
    is mere vanity and vexation of spirit. We are bound to be diligent, for this 
    the Lord blesses; we ought not to be anxious, for that dishonors the Lord, 
    and can never secure his favor. Some deny themselves needful rest; the 
    morning sees them rise before they are rested, the evening sees them toiling 
    long after the curfew has tolled the knell of parting day. They threaten to 
    bring themselves into the sleep of death by neglect of the sleep which 
    refreshes life. Nor is their sleeplessness the only index of their daily 
    fret; they stint themselves in their meals, they eat the commonest food, and 
    the smallest possible quantity of it, and what they do swallow is washed 
    down with the salt tears of grief, for they fear that daily bread will fail 
    them. Hard earned is their food, scantily rationed, and scarcely ever 
    sweetened, but perpetually smeared with sorrow; and all because they have no 
    faith in God, and find no joy except in hoarding up the gold which is their 
    only trust.
<p align="justify">Not thus, not thus, would the Lord have his children 
    live. He would have them, as princes of the blood, lead a happy and restful 
    life. Let them take a fair measure of rest and a due portion of food, for it 
    is for their health. Of course the true believer will never be lazy or 
    extravagant; if he should be he will have to suffer for it; but he will not 
    think it needful or right to be worried and miserly. Faith brings calm with 
    it, and banishes the disturbers who both by day and by night murder peace.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"For so he gives his beloved sleep."</p></b> Through faith 
    the Lord makes his chosen ones to rest in him in happy freedom from care. 
    The text may mean that God gives blessings to his beloved in sleep, even as 
    he gave Solomon the desire of his heart while he slept. The meaning is much 
    the same - those whom the Lord loves are delivered from the fret and fume of 
    life, and take a sweet repose upon the bosom of their Lord. 
<p align="justify">He rests them; blesses them while resting; blesses them 
    more in resting than others in their moiling and toiling. God is sure to 
    give the best thing to his beloved, and we here see that he gives them sleep 
    - that is a laying aside of care, a forgetfulness of need, a quiet leaving 
    of matters with God, this kind of sleep is better than riches and honor.</p>
<p align="justify">Note how Jesus slept amid the hurly-burly of a storm at 
    sea. He knew that he was in his Father's hands, and therefore he was so 
    quiet in spirit that the billows rocked him to sleep - it would be much 
    oftener the same with us if we were more like him.</p>
<p align="justify">It is to be hoped that those who built Solomon's temple 
    were allowed to work at it steadily and joyfully. Surely such a house was 
    not built by unwilling laborers. One would hope that the workmen were not 
    called upon to hurry up in the morning nor to protract their labors far into 
    the night; but we would gladly believe that they went on steadily, resting 
    duly, and eating their bread with joy. So, at least, should the spiritual 
    temple be erected; though, truth to tell, the workers upon its walls are all 
    too apt to grow cumbered with much serving, all too ready to forget their 
    Lord, and to dream that the building is to be done by themselves alone. </p>
<p align="justify">How much happier might we be if we would but trust the 
    Lord's house to the Lord of the house! What is far more important, how much 
    better would our building and watching be done, if we would but confide in 
    the Lord who both builds and keeps his own church!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 127:3<br/>
    "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord."</p></b> This points to another mode 
    of building up a house, namely, by leaving descendants to keep our name and 
    family alive upon the earth. Without this what is a man's purpose in 
    accumulating wealth? To what purpose does he build a house if he has none in 
    his household to hold the house after him? What boots it that he is the 
    possessor of broad acres if he has no heir? Yet in this matter a man is 
    powerless without the Lord. 
<p align="justify">The great Napoleon, with all his sinful care on this 
    point, could not create a dynasty. Hundreds of wealthy persons would give 
    half their estates if they could hear the cry of a babe born of their own 
    bodies. Children are a heritage which Jehovah himself must give, or a man 
    will die childless, and thus his house will be unbuilt.</p>
<p align="justify">"And the fruit of the womb is his reward," or a reward 
    from God. He gives children, not as a penalty nor as a burden, but as a 
    favor. They are a token for good if men know how to receive them, and 
    educate them. They are "doubtful blessings" only because we are doubtful 
    persons. Where society is rightly ordered children are regarded, not as an 
    encumbrance, but as an inheritance; and they are received, not with regret, 
    but as a reward. </p>
<p align="justify">If we are over-crowded in England, and so seem to be 
    embarrassed with too large an increase, we must remember that the Lord does 
    not order us to remain in this narrow island, but would have us fill those 
    boundless regions which wait for the axe and the plow. Yet even here, with 
    all the straits of limited incomes, our best possessions are our own dear 
    offspring, for whom we bless God every day.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 127:4<br/>
    "As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth."</p></b> 
    Children born to men in their early days, by God's blessing become the 
    comfort of their riper years. A man of war is glad of weapons which may fly 
    where he cannot: good sons are their father's arrows speeding to hit the 
    mark which their sires aim at. 
<p align="justify">What wonders a good man can accomplish if he has 
    affectionate children to second his desires, and lend themselves to his 
    designs! To this end we must have our children in hand while they are yet 
    children, or they are never likely to be so when they are grown up; and we 
    must try to point them and straighten them, so as to make arrows of them in 
    their youth, lest they should prove crooked and unserviceable in after life. 
    Let the Lord favor us with loyal, obedient, affectionate offspring, and we 
    shall find in them our best helpers. We shall see them shot forth into life 
    to our comfort and delight, if we take care from the very beginning that 
    they are directed to the right point.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 127:5<br/>
    "Happy is the man that has his quiver full of them." </p></b>Those who have no 
    children bewail the fact; those who have few children see them soon gone, 
    and the house is silent, and their life has lost a charm; those who have 
    many gracious children are upon the whole the happiest.
<p align="justify">Of course a large number of children means a large number 
    of trials; but when these are met by faith in the Lord it also means a mass 
    of love, and a multitude of joys. The writer of this comment gives it as his 
    own observation, that he has seen the most frequent unhappiness in marriages 
    which are unfruitful; that he has himself been most grateful for two of the 
    best of sons; but as they have both grown up, and he has no child at home, 
    he has without a tinge of murmuring, or even wishing that he were otherwise 
    circumstanced, felt that it might have been a blessing to have had a more 
    numerous family - he therefore heartily agrees with the Psalmist's verdict 
    herein expressed. </p>
<p align="justify">He has known a family in which there were some twelve 
    daughters and three sons, and he never expects to witness upon earth greater 
    domestic felicity than fell to the lot of their parents, who rejoiced in all 
    their children, as the children also rejoiced in their parents and in one 
    another. When sons and daughters are arrows, it is well to have a quiver 
    full of them; but if they are only sticks, knotty and useless, the fewer of 
    them the better. While those are blessed whose quiver is full, there is no 
    reason to doubt that many are blessed who have no quiver at all; for a quiet 
    life may not need such a warlike weapon. Moreover, a quiver may be small and 
    yet full; and then the blessing is obtained. In any case we may be sure that 
    a man's life consists not in the abundance of children that he possesses.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the 
    enemies in the gate." </p></b>They can meet foes both in law and in fight. 
    Nobody cares to meddle with a man who can gather a clan of brave sons about 
    him. He speaks to purpose, whose own sons make his words emphatic by the 
    resolve to carry out their father's wishes. 
<p align="justify">This is the blessing of Abraham, the old covenant 
    blessing, "Your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies"; and it is sure 
    to all the beloved of the Lord in some sense or other.</p>
<p align="justify">Does not the Lord Jesus thus triumph in his seed? Looked 
    at literally, this favor comes of the Lord - without his will there would be 
    no children to build up the house, and without his grace there would be no 
    good children to be their parent's strength. </p>
<p align="justify">If this must be left with the Lord, let us leave every 
    other thing in the same hands. He will undertake for us and prosper our 
    trustful endeavors, and we shall enjoy a tranquil life, and prove ourselves 
    to be our Lord's beloved by the calm and quiet of our spirit. We need not 
    doubt that if God gives us children as a reward he will also send us the 
    food and clothing which he knows they need.</p>
<p align="justify">He who is the father of a host of spiritual children is 
    unquestionably happy. He can answer all opponents by pointing to souls who 
    have been saved by his means. Converts are emphatically the heritage of the 
    Lord, and the reward of the preacher's soul travail. By these, under the 
    power of the Holy Spirit, the city of the church is both built up and 
    watched, and the Lord has the glory of it. </p>
