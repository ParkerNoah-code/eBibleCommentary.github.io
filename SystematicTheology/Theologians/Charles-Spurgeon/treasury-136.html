          TITLE. A Song of Degrees. It would be hard to see any upward step from
          the preceding to the present Psalm, and therefore it is possible that
          the steps or ascents are in the song itself. Certainly it does rise
          rapidly out of the depths of anguish, to the heights of assurance. It
          follows well upon 129—when we have overcome the trials which arise
          from man we are the better prepared to meet those sharper sorrows
          which arise out of our matters towards God. He who has borne the
          scourges of the wicked, is trained in all patience to wait the
          dealings of the Holy Lord. We name this the <i>DE PROFUNDIS PSALM</i>.
          "Out of the depths" is the leading word of it: out of those depths we
          cry, wait, watch, and hope. In this Psalm we hear of the pearl of
          redemption, Perhaps the sweet singer would never have found that
          precious thing had he not been cast into the depths. "Pearls lie
          deep."

            Verse 1. Out of the depths have I cried unto you, O LORD.
          </p></b
        >
        This is the Psalmist's statement and plea—he had never ceased to pray
        even when brought into the lowest state. The depths usually silence all
        they engulf, but they could not close the mouth of this servant of the
        Lord. On the contrary, it was in the abyss itself that he cried unto
        Jehovah. Beneath the floods prayer lived and struggled; yes, above the
        roar of the billows rose the cry of faith.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            It little matters where we are if we can pray; but prayer is never
            more real and acceptable than when it rises out of the worst places
          </p></i
        >.<i>
          Deep places beget deep devotion. Depths of earnestness are stirred by
          depths of tribulation</i
        >. Diamonds sparkle most amid the darkness. The more distressed we are,
        the more excellent is the faith which trusts bravely in the Lord, and
        therefore appeals to him, and to him alone.
        <p align="justify">
          Godly men may be in the depths of temporal and spiritual trouble; but
          in such cases they look only to their God, and they stir themselves up
          to be more instant and earnest in prayer than at other times. The
          depth of their distress moves the depths of their being; and from the
          bottom of their hearts an exceeding great and bitter cry rises unto
          the one living and true God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David had often been in the deep, and as often had he pleaded with
          Jehovah, his God, in whose hand are all deep places. He prayed, and
          remembered that he had prayed, and pleaded that he had prayed; hoping
          before long to receive an answer. It would be dreadful to look back on
          trouble and feel forced to own that we did not cry unto the Lord in
          it; but it is most comforting to know that whatever we did not do, or
          could not do—yet we did pray, even in our worst times. He who prays in
          the depth, will not sink out of his depth. He who cries out of the
          depths, shall soon sing in the heights.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. Lord, hear my voice.</p></b> It is all
        we ask; but nothing less will content us. If the Lord will but hear us
        we will leave it to his superior wisdom to decide whether he will answer
        us or not. It is better for our prayer to be heard, than answered. If
        the Lord were to make an absolute promise to answer all our requests, it
        might be rather a curse than a blessing, for it would be casting the
        responsibility of our lives upon ourselves, and we would be placed in a
        very anxious position: but now the Lord hears our desires, and that is
        enough; we only wish him to grant them <i>if </i>his infinite wisdom
        sees that it would be for our good and for his glory.
        <p align="justify">
          Note that the Psalmist spoke audibly in prayer. This is not at all
          needful, but it is exceedingly helpful; for the use of the voice
          assists the thoughts. Still, there is a voice in silent supplication,
          a voice in our weeping, a voice in that sorrow which cannot find a
          tongue—that voice the Lord will hear if its cry is meant for his ear.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
          </p></b
        >
        The Psalmist's cry is a <i>beggar's petition</i>; he begs the great King
        and Lord to lend an ear to it. He has supplicated many times, but always
        with one voice, or for one purpose; and he begs to be noticed in the one
        matter which he has pressed with so much importunity. He would have the
        King hearken, consider, remember, and weigh his request. He is confused,
        and his prayer may therefore be broken, and difficult to understand; he
        begs therefore that his Lord will give the more earnest and
        compassionate heed to the voice of his many and painful pleadings.
        <p align="justify">
          When we have already prayed over our troubles, it is well to pray over
          our prayers. If we can find no more words, let us entreat the Lord to
          hear those petitions which we have already presented. If we have
          faithfully obeyed the precept by praying without ceasing—we may be
          confident that the Lord will faithfully fulfill the promise by helping
          us without fail. Though the Psalmist was under a painful sense of sin,
          and so was in the depth—his faith pleaded in the teeth of conscious
          unworthiness; for well he knew that the Lord's keeping his promise
          depends upon his own character and not upon that of his erring
          creatures.

        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. If you, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
            stand.
          </p></b
        >
        If JAH, the all seeing, should in strict justice, call every man to
        account for every want of conformity to righteousness, where would any
        one of us be? Truly, he does record all our transgressions; but as yet
        he does not act upon the record, but lays it aside until another day. If
        men were to be judged upon no system but that of works, who among us
        could answer for himself at the Lord's bar, and hope to stand clear and
        accepted?
        <p align="justify">
          This verse shows that the Psalmist was under a sense of sin, and felt
          it imperative upon him not only to cry as a suppliant but to confess
          as a sinner. Here he owns that he cannot stand before the great King
          in his own righteousness, and he is so struck with a sense of the
          holiness of God, and the rectitude of the law that he is convinced
          that no man of mortal race can answer for himself before a Judge so
          perfect, concerning a law so divine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Well does he cry, "O Lord, who shall stand?" None can do so. There is
          none that does good; no, not one. Iniquities are matters which are not
          according to equity—what a multitude we have of these!
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            Jehovah, who sees all, and is also our Adonai, or Lord, will
            assuredly bring us into judgment concerning those thoughts, and
            words, and works which are not in exact conformity to his law.
          </p></i
        >Were it not for the Lord Jesus, could we hope to stand? Dare we meet
        him in the dread day of account on the footing of law and equity? What a
        mercy it is that we need not do so, for the next verse sets forth
        another way of acceptance to which we flee.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 4. But there is forgiveness with you.</p></b
        >Blessed <i>BUT</i>. Free, full, sovereign pardon is in the hand of the
        great King: it is his prerogative to forgive, and he delights to
        exercise it. Because his nature is mercy, and because he has provided a
        sacrifice for sin, therefore forgiveness is with him for all that come
        to him confessing their sins. The power of pardon is permanently
        resident with God: he has forgiveness ready to his hand at this instant.
        <b> <p align="justify">"That you may be feared."</p></b
        ><i>
          This is the fruitful root of piety. None fear the Lord like those who
          have experienced his forgiving love. Gratitude for pardon produces far
          more fear and reverence of God than all the dread which is inspired by
          punishment. </i
        >If the Lord were to execute justice upon all, there would be none left
        to fear him; if all were under apprehension of his deserved wrath,
        despair would harden them against fearing him: it is grace which leads
        the way to a holy regard of God, and a fear of grieving him.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. I wait for the LORD, my soul does wait.
          </p></b
        >
        Expecting him to come to me in love, I quietly wait for his appearing; I
        wait upon him in service, and for him in faith. For God I wait and for
        him only: if he will manifest himself I shall have nothing more to wait
        for; but until he shall appear for my help I must wait on, hoping even
        in the depths.

        <p align="justify">
          This waiting of my is no mere formal act, my very soul is in it, "my
          <i>soul </i>does wait." I wait and I wait—mark the repetition! "My
          soul waits", and then again, "My soul waits"; to make sure work of the
          waiting.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is well to deal with the Lord intensely. Such repetitions are the
          reverse of vain repetitions. If the Lord Jehovah makes us wait, let us
          do so with our whole hearts; for blessed are all they that wait for
          him. He is worth waiting for.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            The waiting itself is beneficial to us: it tries faith, exercises
            patience, trains submission, and endears the blessing when it comes.
          </p></i
        >
        The Lord's people have always been a waiting people. They waited for the
        First Advent, and now they wait for the Second. They waited for a sense
        of pardon, and now they wait for perfect sanctification. They waited in
        the depths, and they are not now wearied with waiting in a happier
        condition. They have cried and they do wait; probably their past prayer
        sustains their present patience.
        <b> <p align="justify">And in his word do I hope.</p></b> This is the
        source, strength, and sweetness of waiting. Those who do not hope cannot
        wait; but if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait
        for it. God's word is a true word, but at times it tarries; if ours is
        true faith it will wait the Lord's time. A word from the Lord is as
        bread to the soul of the believer; and, refreshed thereby, it holds out
        through the night of sorrow expecting the dawn of deliverance and
        delight.
        <p align="justify">
          Waiting, we study the word, believe the word, hope in the word, and
          live on the word; and all because it is "his word,"—the word of him
          who never speaks in vain. Jehovah's word is a firm ground for a
          waiting soul to rest upon.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. My soul waits for the Lord morn than those who watch for
            the morning.
          </p></b
        >
        Men who guard a city, and women who wait by the sick, long for daylight.
        Worshipers tarrying for the morning sacrifice, the kindling of the
        incense and the lighting of the lamps, mingle fervent prayers with their
        holy vigils, and pine for the hour when the lamb shall smoke upon the
        altar.
        <p align="justify">
          David, however, waited more than these, waited longer, waited more
          longingly, waited more expectantly. He was not afraid of the great
          Adonai before whom none can stand in their own righteousness, for he
          had put on the righteousness of faith, and therefore longed for
          gracious audience with the Holy One.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God was no more dreaded by him than light is dreaded by those engaged
          in a lawful calling. He pined and yearned after his God. I say, more
          than those who watch for the morning. The figure was not strong
          enough, though one can hardly think of anything more vigorous: he felt
          that his own eagerness was unique and unrivaled.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Oh to be thus hungry and thirsty after God! Our version spoils the
          abruptness of the language; the original runs thus, "My soul for the
          Lord more than those watching for the morning—watching for the
          morning." This is a fine poetical repeat. We long for the favor of the
          Lord more than weary sentinels long for the morning light, which will
          release them from their tedious watch. Indeed this is true. He who has
          once rejoiced in communion with God is sorely tried by the hidings of
          his face, and grows faint with strong desire for the Lord's appearing,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "When will you come unto me, Lord?<br />
          Until you do appear,<br />
          I count each moment for a day,<br />
          Each minute for a year."
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 7. Let Israel hope in the LORD.</p></b>
        Jehovah is Israel's God; therefore, let Israel hope in him. What one
        Israelite does he wishes all Israel to do. That man has a just right to
        exhort others, who is himself setting the example. Israel of old waited
        upon Jehovah and wrestled all the night long, and at last he went his
        way succored by the Hope of Israel: the like shall happen to all his
        seed.

        <i

          his mercy</i
        >. With us there is sin; but hope is ours, because "with the Lord there
        is mercy." Our comfort lies not in that which is with us, but in that
        which is with our God.

        nay, their redemption is already wrought out and laid up with him, so
        that he can at any time give his waiting ones the full benefit thereof.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            The attribute of mercy, and the fact of redemption, are two most
            sufficient reasons for hoping in Jehovah

        >; and the fact that there is no mercy or deliverance elsewhere should
        effectually wean the soul from all idolatry. Are not these deep things
        of God a grand comfort for those who are crying out of the depths? Is it
        not better to be in the deeps with David, hoping in God's mercy, than up
        on the mountaintops, boasting in our own imagined righteousness?

        Our iniquities are our worst dangers. If saved from these, we are saved
        altogether; but there is no salvation from them except by redemption.
        What a blessing that this is here promised in terms which remove it out
        of the region of question. The Lord shall certainly redeem his believing
        people from all their sins.
        <p align="justify">
          Well may the redemption be plenteous since it concerns all Israel and
          all iniquities! Truly, our Psalm has ascended to a great height in
          this verse: this is no cry out of the depths, but a chorale in the
          heights. Redemption is the top of covenant blessings. When it shall be
          experienced by all Israel, the latter day glory shall have come, and
          the Lord's people shall say, "Now, Lord, what do we wait for?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is not this a clear prophecy of the coming of our Lord Jesus the first
          time? and may we not now regard it as the promise of his second and
          more glorious coming for the redemption of the body? For this our soul
          does wait: yes, our heart and our flesh cry out for it with joyful
          expectation.
