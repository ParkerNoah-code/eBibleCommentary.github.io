          1. The Church, though dispersed through our the whole world, even to
          the ends of the earth, has received from the apostles and their
          disciples this faith: [She believes] in one God, the Father Almighty,
          Maker of heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in
          them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who became incarnate
          for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who proclaimed through the
          prophets the dispensations of God, and the advents, and the birth from
          a virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the dead, and the
          ascension into heaven in the flesh of the beloved Christ Jesus, our
          Lord, and His [future] manifestation from heaven in the glory of the
          Father "to gather all things in one," and to raise up anew all flesh
          of the whole human race, in order that to Christ Jesus, our Lord, and
          God, and Saviour, and King, according to the will of the invisible
          Father, "every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
          earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should
          confess" to Him, and that He should execute just judgment towards all;
          that He may send "spiritual wickednesses," and the angels who
          transgressed and became apostates, together with the ungodly, and
          unrighteous, and wicked, and profane among men, into everlasting fire;
          but may, in the exercise of His grace, confer immortality on the
          righteous, and holy, and those who have kept His commandments, and
          have persevered in His love, some from the beginning [of their
          Christian course], and others from [the date of] their repentance, and
          may surround them with everlasting glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As I have already observed, the Church, having received this
          preaching and this faith, although scattered throughout the whole
          world, yet, as if occupying but one house, carefully preserves it. She
          also believes these points [of doctrine] just as if she had but one
          soul, and one and the same heart, and she proclaims them, and teaches
          them, and hands them down, with perfect harmony, as if she possessed
          only one mouth. For, although the languages of the world are
          dissimilar, yet the import of the tradition is one and the same. For
          the Churches which have been planted in Germany do not believe or hand
          down anything different, nor do those in Spain, nor those in Gaul, nor
          those in the East, nor those in Egypt, nor those in Libya, nor those
          which have been established in the central regions of the world. But
          as the sun, that creature of God, is one and the same throughout the
          whole world, so also the preaching of the truth shineth everywhere,
          and enlightens all men that are willing to come to a knowledge of the
          truth. Nor will any one of the rulers in the Churches, however highly
          gifted he may be in point of eloquence, teach doctrines different from
          these (for no one is greater than the Master); nor, on the other hand,
          will he who is deficient in power of expression inflict injury on the
          tradition. For the faith being ever one and the same, neither does one
          who is able at great length to discourse regarding it, make any
          addition to it, nor does one, who can say but little diminish it.
        </p>

          3. It does not follow because men are endowed with greater and less
          degrees of intelligence, that they should therefore change the
          subject-matter [of the faith] itself, and should conceive of some
          other God besides Him who is the Framer, Maker, and Preserver of this
          universe, (as if He were not sufficient for them), or of another
          Christ, or another Only-begotten. But the fact referred to simply
          implies this, that one may [more accurately than another] bring out
          the meaning of those things which have been spoken in parables, and
          accommodate them to the general scheme of the faith; and explain [with
          special clearness] the operation and dispensation of God connected
          with human salvation; and show that God manifested longsuffering in
          regard to the apostasy of the angels who transgressed, as also with
          respect to the disobedience of men; and set forth why it is that one
          and the same God has made some things temporal and some eternal, some
          heavenly and others earthly; and understand for what reason God,
          though invisible, manifested Himself to the prophets not under one
          form, but differently to different individuals; and show why it was
          that more covenants than one were given to mankind; and teach what was
          the special character of each of these covenants; and search out for
          what reason "God hath concluded every man in unbelief, that He may
          have mercy upon all;" and gratefully describe on what account the Word
          of God became flesh and suffered; and relate why the advent of the Son
          of God took place in these last times, that is, in the end, rather
          than in the beginning [of the world]; and unfold what is contained in
          the Scriptures concerning the end [itself], and things to come; and
          not be silent as to how it is that God has made the Gentiles, whose
          salvation was despaired of, fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and
          partakers with the saints; and discourse how it is that "this mortal
          body shall put on immortality, and this corruptible shall put on
          incorruption;" and proclaim in what sense [God] says, "That is a
          people who was not a people; and she is beloved who was not beloved;"
          and in what sense He says that "more are the children of her that was
          desolate, than of her who possessed a husband." For in reference to
          these points, and others of a like nature, the apostle exclaims: "Oh!
          the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how
          unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!" But
          [the superior skill spoken of] is not found in this, that any one
          should, beyond the Creator and Framer [of the world], conceive of the
          Enthymesis of an erring Æon, their mother and his, and should thus
          proceed to such a pitch of blasphemy; nor does it consist in this,
          that he should again falsely imagine, as being above this [fancied
          being], a Pleroma at one time supposed to contain thirty, and at
          another time an innumerable tribe of Æons, as these teachers who are
          destitute of truly divine wisdom maintain; while the Catholic Church
          possesses one and the same faith throughout the whole world, as we
          have already said.<br />
