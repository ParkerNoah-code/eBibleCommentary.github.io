          The wisdom of the scribe cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that
          hath little business shall become wise. How shall he become wise that
          holdeth the plow, that glorieth in the shaft of the goad, that driveth
          oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose discourse is of the
          stock of bulls? He will set his heart upon turning his furrows; and
          his wakefulness is to give his heifers their fodder. So is every
          artificer and workmaster, that passeth his time by night as by day;
          they that cut gravings of signets, and his diligence is to make great
          variety; he will set his heart to preserve likeness in his
          portraiture, and will be wakeful to finish his work. So is the smith
          sitting by the anvil, and considering the unwrought iron; the vapour
          of the fire will waste his flesh, and in the heat of the furnace will
          he wrestle with his work; the noise of the hammer will be ever in his
          ear, and his eyes are upon the pattern of the vessel; he will set his
          heart upon perfecting his works, and he will be wakeful to adorn them
          perfectly. So is the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel
          about with his feet, who is alway anxiously set at his work, and all
          his handywork is by number; he will fashion the clay with his arm, and
          will bend its strength in front of his feet; he will apply his heart
          to finish the glazing, and he will be wakeful to make clean the
          furnace. All these put their trust in their hands; and each becometh
          wise in his own work. Without these shall not a city be inhabited, and
          men shall not sojourn nor walk up and down therein. They shall not be
          sought for in the council of the people, and in the assembly they
          shall not mount on high, they shall not sit on the seat of the judge,
          and they shall not understand the covenant of judgement; neither shall
          they declare instruction and judgement, and where parables are they
          shall not be found. But they will maintain the fabric of the world;
          and in the handywork of their craft is their prayer.

          Not so he that hath applied his soul, and meditateth in the law of the
          Most High. He will seek out the wisdom of all of the ancients, and
          will be occupied in prophecies. He will keep the discourse of the men
          of renown, and will enter in amidst the subtilties of parables. He
          will seek out the hidden meaning of proverbs, and be conversant in the
          dark sayings of parables. He will serve among great men, and appear
          before him that ruleth. He will travel through the land of strange
          nations; for he hath tried good things and evil among men. He will
          apply his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will
          make supplication before the Most High, and will open his mouth in
          prayer, and will make supplication for his sins. If the great Lord
          will, he shall be filled with the spirit of understanding: he shall
          pour forth the words of his wisdom, and in prayer give thanks unto the
          Lord. He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets
          shall he meditate. He shall shew forth the instruction which he hath
          been taught, and shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.
          Many shall commend his understanding, and so long as the world
          endureth, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial shall not depart,
          and his name shall live from generation to generation; nations shall
          declare his wisdom, and the congregation shall tell out his praise. If
          he continue, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand: and if he
          die, he addeth thereto.
