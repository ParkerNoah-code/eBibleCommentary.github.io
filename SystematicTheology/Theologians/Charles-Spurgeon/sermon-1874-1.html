        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1162-3)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, March 15, 1874, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Thy faith hath saved thee." -- Luke 7:50; and Luke 18:42.</p>
        <p>
          I do not remember that this expression is found anywhere else in the
          Word of God. It is found in these two places in the Gospel by Luke,
          but not in any other Gospel. Luke also gives us in two other places a
          kindred, and almost identical expression, "Thy faith hath made thee
          whole." This you will find used in reference to the woman whose issue
          of blood had been staunched (Luke 8:48), and in connection with that
          one of the ten lepers who returned to praise the Saviour for the cure
          he had received (Luke 17:19). You will find the expression, "Thy faith
          hath made thee whole" once in Matthew and twice in Mark, but you find
          it twice in Luke, and together therewith the twice repeated words of
          our text, "Thy faith hath saved thee." Are we wrong in supposing that
          the long intercourse of Luke with the apostle Paul led him not only to
          receive the great doctrine of justification by faith which Paul so
          plainly taught, and to attach to faith that high importance which Paul
          always did, but also to have a peculiar memory for those expressions
          which were used by the Saviour, in which faith was manifestly honoured
          to a very high degree. Albeit Luke would not have written anything
          which was not true for the sake of maintaining the grand doctrine so
          clearly taught by the apostle, yet I think his full conviction of it
          would help to recall to his memory more vividly those words of the
          Lord Jesus from which it could be more clearly learned or illustrated.
          Be that as it may, we know that Luke was inspired, and that he has
          written neither more nor less than what the Saviour actually said, and
          hence we may be quite sure that the expression, "Thy faith hath saved
          thee," fell from the Redeemer's lips, and we are bound to accept it as
          pure unquestionable truth, and we may repeat it ourselves without fear
          of misleading others, or trenching upon any other truth. I mention
          this because the other day I heard an earnest friend say that faith
          did not save us, at which announcement I was rather surprised. The
          brother, it is true, qualified the expression, and showed that he
          meant to make it clear that Jesus saved us, and not our own act of
          faith. I agreed with what he meant, but not with what he said, for he
          had no right to use an expression which was in flat contradiction to
          the distinct declaration of the Saviour, "Thy faith hath saved thee."
          We are not to strain any expression to make it mean more than the
          speaker intended, and it is well to guard words from being
          misunderstood; but on the other hand, we may not quite go so far as
          absolutely to negative a declaration of the Lord himself, however we
          may mean to qualify it. It is to be qualified if you like, but it is
          not to be contradicted, for there it stands, "Thy faith hath saved
          thee." Now we shall this morning, by God's help, inquire what was it
          that saved the two persons whose history will come before us? It was
          their faith. Our second inquiry will be what kind of faith was it
          which saved them? and then thirdly, what does this teach us in
          reference to faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. WHAT WAS IT THAT SAVED the two persons whose history we are about
          to consider?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the penitent woman's case, her great sins were forgiven her and she
          became a woman of extraordinary love: she loved much, for she had much
          forgiven. I feel, in thinking of her, something like an eminent father
          of the church who said, "This narrative is not one which I can well
          preach upon; I had far rather weep over it in secret." That woman's
          tears, that woman's unbraided tresses wiping the Saviour's feet, her
          coming so near to her Lord in such company, facing such proud
          cavillers, with such fond and resolute intent of doing honour to
          Jesus; verily, among those that have loved the Saviour, there hath not
          lived a greater than this woman who was a sinner. Yet for all that
          Jesus did not say to her, "Thy love hath saved thee." Love is a golden
          apple of the tree of which faith is the root, and the Saviour took
          care not to ascribe to the fruit that which belongs only to the root.
          This loving woman was also right notable for her repentance. Mark ye
          well those tears. Those were no tears of sentimental emotion, but a
          rain of holy heart-sorrow for sin. She had been a sinner and she knew
          it; she remembered well her multitude of iniquities, and she felt each
          sin deserved a tear, and there she stood weeping herself away, because
          she had offended her dear Lord. Yet it is not said, "Thy repentance
          hath saved thee." Her being saved caused her repentance, but
          repentance did not save her. Sorrow for sin is an early token of grace
          within the heart, yet it is nowhere said, "Thy sorrow for sin hath
          saved thee." She was a woman of great humility. She came behind the
          Lord and washed his feet, as though she felt herself only able to be a
          menial servant to perform works of drudgery, and to find a pleasure in
          so serving her Lord. Her reverence for him had reached a very high
          point; she regarded him as a king, and she did what has sometimes been
          done for monarchs by zealous subjects -- she kissed the feet of her
          heart's Lord, who well deserved the homage. Her loyal reverence led
          her to kiss the feet of her Lord, the Sovereign of her soul, but I do
          not find that Jesus said, "Thy humility hath saved thee;" or that he
          said, "Thy reverence hath saved thee;" but he put the crown upon the
          head of her faith, and said expressly, "Thy faith hath saved thee; go
          in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of the blind man to whom my second text refers -- this man
          was notable for his earnestness; he cried, and cried aloud, "Son of
          David, have mercy on me." He was notable for his importunity, for they
          who would have silenced him rebuked him in vain; he cried so much the
          more, "Son of David, have mercy on me." But I do not discover that
          Christ attributed his salvation to his prayers, earnest and
          importunate though they were. It is not written, "Thy prayers have
          saved thee"; it is written, "Thy faith hath saved thee." He was a man
          of considerable and clear knowledge, and he had a distinct
          apprehension of the true character of Christ: he scorned to call him
          Jesus of Nazareth, as the crowd did, but he proclaimed him "Son of
          David," and in the presence of that throng he dared avow his full
          conviction that the humble man, dressed in a peasant's garb, who was
          threading his way through the throng, was none other than the royal
          heir of the royal line of Judah, and was indeed the fulfiller of the
          type of David, the expected Messiah, the King of the Jews, the Son of
          David. Yet I do not find that Jesus attributed his salvation to his
          knowledge, to his clear apprehension, or to his distinct avowal of his
          Messiahship; but he said to him, "Thy faith hath saved thee," laying
          the entire stress of his salvation upon his faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being so in both cases, we are led to ask, what is the reason for
          it? What is the reason why in every case, in every man that is saved,
          faith is the great instrument of salvation? Is it not first because
          God has a right to choose what way of salvation he pleases, and he has
          chosen that men should be saved, not by their works, but by their
          faith in his dear Son? God has a right to give his mercy to whom he
          pleases; he has a right to give it when he pleases; he has a right to
          give it in what mode he pleases; and know ye this, O sons of men, that
          the decree of heaven is immutable, and standeth fast forever -- "He
          that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; he that believeth not
          shall be damned." To this there shall be no exception; Jehovah has
          made the rule and it shall stand. If thou wouldst have salvation,
          "believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"; but if
          not, salvation is utterly impossible to thee. This is the appointed
          way; follow it, and it leads to heaven; refuse it, and thou must
          perish. This is God's sovereign determination, "He that believeth on
          him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already,
          because he hath not believed on the Son of God." Jehovah's will be
          done. If this be his method of grace, let us not kick against it. If
          he determines that faith shall save, so let it be; only, Good Master,
          create and increase our faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while I attribute this to the sovereign choice of God, I do see,
          for Scripture plainly indicates it, a reason in the nature of things
          why faith should thus have been selected. The apostle tells us it is
          of faith that it might be of grace. If the condition of salvation had
          been either feeling or working, then, such is the depravity of our
          nature, that we should inevitably have attributed the merit of
          salvation to the working or the feeling. We should have claimed
          something whereof to glory. It matters not how low the condition may
          have been, man would have still considered that there was something
          required of him, that something came from him, and that, therefore, he
          might take some credit to himself. But no man, unless he be demented,
          ever claims credit for believing the truth. If he hears that which
          convinces him, he is convinced; and if he be persuaded, he is
          persuaded; but he feels that it could not well be otherwise. He
          attributes the effect to the truth and the influence used. He does not
          go about and boast because he believes what is so clear to him that he
          cannot doubt it. If he did so boast of spiritual faith, all thinking
          men would say at once, "Wherefore dost thou boast in the fact of
          having believed, and especially when this believing would never have
          been thine if it had not been for the force of the truth which
          convinced thee, and the working of the Spirit of God which constrained
          thee to believe?" Faith is chosen by Christ to wear the crown of
          salvation because -- let me contradict myself -- it refuses to wear
          the crown. It was Christ that saved the penitent woman, it was Christ
          that saved that blind beggar, but he takes the crown from off his own
          head, so dear is faith to him, and he puts the diadem upon the head of
          faith and says, "Thy faith hath saved thee," because he is absolutely
          certain that faith will never take the glory to herself, but will
          again lay the crown at the pierced feet, and say, "Not unto myself be
          glory, for thou hast done it; thou art the Saviour, and thou alone."
          In order, then, to illustrate and to protect the interests of
          sovereign grace, and to shut out all vain glorying, God has been
          pleased to make the way of salvation to be by faith, and by no other
          means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all. It is clear to every one who chooses to think that in
          order to the renewal of the heart, which is the chief part of
          salvation, it is well to begin with the faith; because faith once
          rightly exercised becomes the mainspring of the entire nature. The man
          believes that he is forgiven. What then? He feels gratitude to him who
          has pardoned him. Feeling gratitude, it is but natural that he should
          hate that which displeases his Saviour, and should love intensely that
          which is pleasing to him who saved him, so that faith operates upon
          the entire nature, and becomes the instrument in the hand of the
          regenerating Spirit by which all the faculties of the soul are put
          into the right condition. As a man thinketh in his heart so is he, but
          his thinkings come out of his believings; if he be put right in his
          believings, then his understanding will operate upon his affections,
          and all the other powers of his manhood, and old things will pass
          away, all things will become new through the wonderful effect of the
          faith, which is of the operation of God. Faith works by love, and
          through love it purifies the soul, and the man becomes a new creature.
          See ye then the wisdom of God? He may choose what way he will, but he
          chooses a way which at once guards his grace from our felonious
          boastings, and on the other hand produces in us a holiness which other
          wise never would have been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith in salvation, however, is not the meritorious cause; nor is it
          in any sense the salvation itself. Faith saves us just as the mouth
          saves from hunger. If we be hungry, bread is the real cure for hunger,
          but still it would be right to say that eating removes hunger, seeing
          that the bread itself could not benefit us, unless the mouth should
          eat it. Faith is the soul's mouth, whereby the hunger of the heart is
          removed. Christ also is the brazen serpent lifted up; all the healing
          virtue is in him; yet no healing virtue comes out of the brazen
          serpent to any who will not look; so that the looking is rightly
          considered to be the act which saves. True, in the deepest sense it is
          Christ uplifted who saves, to him be all the glory; but without
          looking to him ye cannot be saved, so that
        </p>
        <p>"There is life in a look,"</p>
        <p>
          as well as life in the Saviour to whom you look. Nothing is yours
          until you appropriate it. If you be enriched, the thing appropriated
          enriches you; yet it is not incorrect but strictly right to say it is
          the appropriation of the blessing which makes you rich. Faith is the
          hand of the soul. Stretched out, it lays hold of the salvation of
          Christ, and so by faith we are saved. "Thy faith hath saved thee." I
          need not dwell longer on that point. It is self-evident from the text
          that faith is the great means of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. WHAT KIND OF FAITH WAS IT that saved these people? I will mention,
          first, the essential agreements; and then, secondly, the differentia,
          or the points in which this faith differed in its external
          manifestations in the two cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the instances of the penitent woman and the blind beggar, their
          faith was fixed alone in Jesus. You cannot discover anything floating
          in their faith in Jesus which adulterated it; it was unmixed faith in
          him. the woman pressed forward to him, her tears fell on him; her
          ointment was for him; her unloosed tresses were a towel for his; feet
          she cared for no one else, not even for the disciples whom she
          respected for his sake; her whole spirit and soul were absorbed in
          him. He could save her; he could blot out her sins. She believed him;
          she did it unto him. The same was the case with that blind man. He had
          no thought of any ceremonies to be performed by priests; he had no
          idea of any medicine which might be given him by physicians. His cry
          was, "Son of David, Son of David." The only notice he took of others
          was to disregard them, and still to cry, "Son of David, Son of David."
          "What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?" was the Lord's question,
          and it answered to the desire of his soul, for he knew that if
          anything were done it must be done by the Son of David. It is
          essential that our faith must rest alone on Jesus. Mix anything with
          Christ, and you are undone. If your faith shall stand with one foot
          upon the rock of his merits, and the other foot upon the sand of your
          own duties, it will fall, and great will be the fall thereof. Build
          wholly on the rock, for if so much as a corner of the edifice shall
          rest on anything beside, it will ensure the ruin of the whole: --
        </p>
        <p>&lt;&gt;"None but Jesus, none but Jesus</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good."</p>
        <p>All true faith is alike in this respect.</p>
        <p>
          The faith of these two was alike in its confession of unworthiness.
          What meant her standing behind? What meant her tears, her everflowing
          tears, but that she felt unworthy to draw near to Jesus? And what
          meant the beggar's cry, "Have mercy on me?" Note the stress he lays
          upon it. "Have mercy on me." He does not claim the cure by merit, nor
          ask it as a reward. To mercy he appealed. Now I care not whose faith
          it is, whether it be that of David in his bitter cries of the
          fifty-first Psalm, or whether it be that of Paul in his highest
          exaltation upon being without condemnation through Christ, there is
          always in connection with true faith a thorough and deep sense that it
          is mercy, mercy alone, which saves us from the wrath to come. Dear
          hearer, do not deceive yourself. Faith and boasting are as opposite to
          one another as the two poles. If you come before Christ with your
          righteousness in your hand, you come without faith; but if you come
          with faith you must also come with confession of sin, for true faith
          always walks hand in hand with a deep sense of guiltiness before the
          Most High. This is so in every case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their faith was alike, moreover, in defying and conquering opposition.
          Little do we know the inward struggles of the penitent as she crossed
          the threshold of Simon's house. "He will repel thee," the stern, cold
          Pharisee will say, "Get thee gone, thou strumpet; how darest thou
          defile the doors of honest men." But whatever may happen she passes
          through the door, she comes to where the feet of the Saviour are
          stretched out towards the entrance as he is reclining at the table,
          and there she stands. Simon glanced at her: he thought the glance
          would wither her, but her love to Christ was too well rooted to be
          withered by him. No doubt he made many signs of his displeasure, and
          showed that he was horrified at such a creature being anywhere near
          him, but she took no notice of him. Her Lord was there, and she felt
          safe. Timid as a dove, she trembled not while he was near; but she
          returned no defiant glances for Simon's haughty looks; her eyes were
          occupied with weeping. She did not turn aside to demand an explanation
          of his unkind motions, for her lips were all engrossed with kissing
          those dear feet. Her Lord, her Lord, was all to her. She overcame
          through faith in him, and held her ground, and did not leave the house
          till he dismissed her with "Go in peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the same with the blind man. He said, "Son of David, have mercy
          on me." They cried, "Hush! Why these clamours, blind beggar? His
          eloquence is music; do not interrupt him. Never man spake as he is
          speaking. Every tone rings like the harps of the angels. Hush! How
          darest thou spoil his discourse?" But over and above them all went up
          the importunate prayer, "Son of David, have mercy upon me," and he
          prevailed. All true faith is opposed. If thy faith be never tried it
          is not born of the race of the church militant. "This is the victory
          that overcometh the world, even our faith," but it is indicated in
          that very declaration that there must be something to overcome, and
          that faith must wage war for its existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, the faith of these two persons was alike in being openly
          avowed. I will not say that the avowal took the same form in both, for
          it did not; but still it was equally open. There is the Saviour, and
          there comes the weeping penitent. She loves him. Is she ashamed to say
          so? It may bring her reproach; it will certainly rake up the old
          reproaches against her, for she has been a sinner. Never mind what she
          has been, nor who may be present to see her. She loves her Lord, and
          she will show it. She will bring the ointment and she will anoint his
          feet, even in the presence of Pharisees, Pharisees who would say, "Is
          this one of the disciples of Christ? A pretty convert to boast of! A
          fine conquest this, for his kingdom! A harlot becomes a disciple! What
          next and what next?" She must have known and felt all that, but still
          there was no concealment. She loved her Lord, and she would avow it,
          and so in the very house of the Pharisee, there being no other
          opportunity so convenient, she comes forward, and without words, but
          with actions far more eloquent than words, she says, "I love him.
          These tears shall show it; this ointment shall diffuse the knowledge
          of it, as its sweet perfume fills the room; and every lock of my hair
          shall be a witness that I am my Lord's and he is mine." She avowed her
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so did the blind man. He did not sit there and say, "I know he is
          the Son of David, but I must not say it." They said, some of them
          contemptuously, and others indifferently, "It is Jesus of Nazareth."
          But he will not have it so. "Thou Son of David," saith he; and loud
          above their noise I hear him cry, like a herald proclaiming the King,
          "Son of David." Why, sirs, it seems to me he was exalted to a high
          office: he became the herald of the King, and proclaimed him, and this
          belongs to a high officer of State in our country. The blind beggar
          showed great decision and courage. He cried in effect, "Son of David
          thou art; Son of David I proclaim thee; Son of David thou shalt be
          proclaimed, whoever may gainsay it; only turn thine eyes and have
          mercy upon me." Are there any of you here who have a faith in Christ
          which you are ashamed of? I also am ashamed of you, and so also will
          Christ be ashamed of you when he cometh in the glory of his Father and
          all his holy angels with him. Ashamed to claim that you are honest?
          Then methinks you must live in bad company, where to be a rogue is to
          be famous; and if you are ashamed to say, "I love my Lord," methinks
          you are courting the friendship of Christ's enemies, and what can you
          be but an enemy yourself: If you love him, say it. Put on your
          Master's regimentals, enlist in his army, and come forward and
          declare, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." Their faith
          was alike then in these four particulars, it was fixed alone on him,
          it was accompanied with a sense of unworthiness, it struggled and
          conquered opposition, and it openly declared itself before all comers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By your patience I shall now try to show the differences between the
          same faith as to its manifestations. First, the woman's faith acted
          like a woman's faith. She showed tender love, and the affections are
          the glory and the strength of women. They were certainly such in her.
          Her love was intense, womanly love, and she poured it out upon the
          Saviour. The man's faith acted like a man's in its determination and
          strength. He persisted in crying, "Thou Son of David." There was as
          much that was masculine about his faith as there was of the feminine
          in the penitent's faith, and everything should be in its order and
          after its season. It would not have been meet for the woman's voice to
          be heard so boldly above the crowd; it would have seemed out of place
          for a man's tears to have been falling upon the Saviour's feet. Either
          one or the other might have been justifiable, but they would not have
          been equally suitable. But now they are as suitable as they are
          excellent. The woman acts as a godly woman should. The man like a
          godly man. Never let us measure ourselves by other people. Do not, my
          brother, say, "I could not shed tears." Who asked thee to do so? A
          man's tears are mostly within, and so let them be: it is ours to use
          other modes of showing our love. And, my sister, do not say, "I could
          not act as a herald and publicly proclaim the King." I doubt not thou
          couldest do so if there were need, but thy tears in secret, and those
          wordless tokens of love to Jesus which thou are rendering, are not
          less acceptable because they are not the same as a man would give.
          Nay, they are the better because they are more suitable to thee. Do
          not think that all the flowers of God's garden must bloom in the same
          colour or shed the same perfume.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice next that the woman acted like a woman who had been a sinner.
          What more meet than tears? What more fitting place for her than at the
          Saviour's feet? She had been a sinner, she acts like a sinner; but the
          man who had been a beggar acted like a beggar. What does a beggar do
          but clamour for alms? Did he not beg gloriously? Never one plied the
          trade more earnestly than he. "Son of David," said he, "have mercy on
          me." I should not have liked to have seen the beggar sitting there
          weeping; nor to have heard the penitent woman shouting. Neither would
          have been natural or seemly. Faith works according to the condition,
          circumstances, sex, or ability of the person in whom it lives, and it
          best shows itself in its own form, not in an artificial manner, but in
          the natural outflow of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, also, that the woman did not speak. There is something very
          beautiful in the golden silence of the woman, which was richer than
          her silver speech would have been. But the man was not silent; he
          spoke; he spoke out, and his words were excellent. I venture to say
          that the woman's silence spoke as powerfully as the man's voice. Of
          the two I think I find more eloquence in the tears bedewing, and
          unbraided hair wiping the Saviour's feet, than in the cry, "Son of
          David, have mercy on me." Yet both forms of expression were equally
          good, the silence best in the woman with her tears, and the speech
          best in the man with his confident trust in Christ. Do not think it
          necessary, dear friend, in order to serve, to do other people's work.
          What thine own hand findeth to do, do it with thy might. If you think
          you can never honour Christ till you enter a pulpit, it may be just
          possible that you will afterwards honour him best by getting out of it
          as quickly as you can. There have been persons well qualified to adorn
          the religion of Christ with a lapstone on their lap who have thought
          it necessary to mount a pulpit, and in that position have been a
          hindrance to Christ and his gospel. Sister, there is a sphere for you;
          keep to it, let none push you out of it; but do not think there is
          nothing else to do except the work which some other woman does. God
          has called her, let her follow God's voice; he calls you in another
          direction, follow his voice thither. You will be most like that other
          excellent woman when you are most different from her: I mean, you will
          be most truly obedient to Christ, as she is, if you pursue quite
          another path.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a difference, again, in this. The woman gave -- she brought
          her ointment. The man did the opposite -- he begged. There are various
          ways of showing love to Christ, which are equally excellent tokens of
          faith. To give him of her ointment, and give him of her tears, and
          give him the accommodation of her hair, was well; it showed her faith,
          which worked by love: to give nothing, for the beggar had nothing to
          give, but simply to honour Christ by appealing to his bounty and his
          royal power, was best in the beggar. I can commend neither above the
          other, for I doubt not that both the penitent and the beggar gave
          Christ their whole heart, and what more does Jesus ask for from any
          one?
        </p>
        <p>
          The thoughts of the woman and the thoughts of the beggar were
          different too. Her thoughts were mainly about the past, and her sins
          -- hence her tears. To be forgiven, that was her point. His thoughts
          were mainly about the present, and did not so much concern his sin as
          his deficiency, infirmity, and inability, and so he came with
          different thoughts. I do not doubt that he thought of sin, as I dare
          say she also thought of infirmity; but in her case the thought of sin
          was uppermost, and hence the tears; in his the infirmity was
          uppermost, and hence the prayer, "Lord, that I might receive my
          sight." Do not, then, compare your experience with that of another.
          God is a God of wonderful variety. The painter who repeats himself in
          many pictures has a paucity of conception, but the master artist
          scarcely ever sketches the same thing a second time. There is a
          boundless variety in genius, and God who transcends all the genius of
          men, creates an infinite variety in the works of his grace. Look not,
          therefore, for likeness everywhere. The woman, it is said, loved much,
          and she proved her love by her acts; but the man loved much too, and
          showed his love by actions which were most admirable, for he followed
          Jesus in the way, glorifying God. Yet they were different actions. I
          do not find that he brought any box of ointment, or anointed Christ's
          feet, neither do I find that she literally followed Christ in the way,
          though no doubt she followed him in the spirit; neither did she with a
          loud voice glorify God as the restored blind beggar did. There are
          differences of operation, but the same Lord; there are differences of
          capacity and differences of calling, and by this reflection I hope you
          will be enabled to deliver yourselves from the fault of judging one by
          another, and that you will look for the same faith, but not for the
          same development of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So interesting is this subject that I want you to follow me while I
          very rapidly sketch the woman's case, and then the man's, not
          mentioning the differences one by one, but allowing the two pictures
          to impress themselves separately upon your minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe this woman. What a strange compound she was. She was
          consciously unworthy, and therefore she wept, yet she drew very near
          to Jesus. Her acts were those of nearness and communion; she washed
          his feet with her tears, she wiped them with the hairs of her head,
          and meanwhile she kissed them again and again. "She hath not ceased,"
          said Christ, "to kiss my feet." A sense of unworthiness, and the
          enjoyment of communion, were mixed together. Oh, divine faith which
          blends the two! She was shamefaced, yet was she very bold. She dared
          not look the Master in the face as yet; she approached him from
          behind; yet she dared face Simon, and remain in his room, whether he
          frowned or no. I have known some who have blushed in the face of
          Christ who would not have blushed before a judge, nor at the stake, if
          they had been dragged there for Christ's sake. Such a woman was Anne
          Askew, humble before her Master, but like a lioness before the foes of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The penitent woman wept, she was a mourner, yet she had a deep joy; I
          know she had, for every kiss meant joy. Every time she lifted that
          blessed foot, and kissed it, her heart leaped with the transport of
          love. Her heart knew bitterness for sin, but it knew also the
          sweetness of pardon. What a mixture! Faith made the compound. She was
          humble, never one more so; yet see how she takes upon herself to deal
          with the King himself. Brethren, you and I are satisfied, and well we
          may be, if we may wash the saints' feet, but she was not. Oh, the
          courage of this woman! She will pass through the outer court, and get
          right to the King's own throne, and there pay her homage, in her own
          person, to his person, and wash the feet of the wonderful, the
          Counsellor, the mighty God. I know not that an angel ever performed
          such suit and service, and therefore this woman takes preeminence as
          having done for Jesus what no other being ever did. I have said that
          she was silent, and yet she spake; I will add, she was despised, but
          Christ set her high in honour, and made Simon, who despised her, to
          feel little in her presence. I will also add she was a great sinner,
          but she was a great saint. Her great sinnership, when pardoned, became
          the raw stuff out of which great saints are made by the mighty power
          of God. Finally she was saved by faith, so says the text, but if ever
          there was a case in which James could not have said, "Shall faith save
          thee?" and in which he must have said, "Here is one that shows her
          faith by her works," it was the case of this woman. There she is
          before you. Imitate her faith itself, though you cannot actually copy
          her deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now look at the man. He was blind, but he could see a great deal more
          than the Pharisees, who said they could see. Blind, but his inward
          optics saw the king in his beauty, saw the splendour of his throne,
          and he confessed it. He was a beggar, but he had a royal soul, and a
          strong sovereign determination which was not to be put down. He had
          the kind of mind which dwells in men who are princes among their
          fellows. He is not to be stopped by disciples, nay, nor by apostles.
          He has begun to pray, and pray he will till he obtains the boon he
          seeks. Note well that what he knew he avowed, what he desired he
          pleaded for, and what he needed he understood. "Lord, that I might
          receive my sight;" he was clear about his needs, and clear about the
          only person who could supply them. What he asked for he expected, for
          when he was bidden to come he evidently expected that his sight would
          be restored, for we are told by another Evangelist that he cast away
          his beggar's cloak. He felt he should never want to beg again. He was
          sure his eyes were about to be opened. Lastly, what he received he was
          grateful for, for as soon as he could walk without a guide he took
          Christ to be his guide, and followed him in the way, glorifying him.
          Look on both pictures. May you have the shadows and the lights of
          both, as far as they would tend to make you also another and distinct
          picture by the selfsame artist, whose hand alone can produce such
          wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. WHAT DOES THIS TEACH US IN REFERENCE TO FAITH? It teaches us
          first that faith is all important. Do, I pray you, my hearers, see
          whether you have the precious faith, the faith of God's elect.
          Remember there are not many things in Scripture called precious, but
          there is the precious blood, and there goes with it the precious
          faith. If you have not that you are lost; if you have not that you are
          neither fit to live nor fit to die; if you have not that, your eternal
          destiny will be infinite despair; but if you have faith, though it be
          as a grain of mustard seed, you are saved. "Thy faith hath saved
          thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn next that the main matter in faith is the person whom you
          believe. I do not say in whom you believe. That would be true, but not
          quite so scriptural an expression. Paul does not say, as I hear most
          people quote it, "I know in whom I have believed." Faith believes
          Christ. Your faith must recognise him as a person, and come to him as
          a person, and rest not in his teaching merely, or his work only, but
          in him. "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
          will give you rest." A personal Saviour for sinners! Are you resting
          on him alone? Do you believe him? You know the safety of the building
          depends mainly upon the foundation, and if the foundation be not
          right, you may build as you will, it will not last. Do you build,
          then, on Christ alone? Inquire about that as a special point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe next, that we must not expect exactly the same manifestation
          in each convert. Let not the elders of the church expect it, let not
          parents require it from their children; let not anxious friends look
          for it; do not expect it in yourself. Biographies are very useful, but
          they may become a snare. I must not judge that I am not a child of God
          because I am not precisely like that good man whose life I have just
          been reading. Am I resting in Christ? Do I believe him? Then it may be
          the Lord's grace is striking out quite a different path for me from
          that which has been trodden by my brother, that it may illustrate
          other phases of its power, and show to principalities and powers the
          exceeding riches of divine love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, the matter which sums up all is this, if we have faith in
          Jesus we are saved, and ought not to talk or act as if there were any
          question about it. "THY FAITH HATH SAVED THEE." Jesus says it.
          Granted, you have faith in Christ, and it is certain that faith hath
          saved you. Do not, therefore, go on talking and acting and feeling as
          if you were not saved. I know a company of saved people who say every
          Sabbath, "Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners"; but they are
          not miserable sinners if they are saved, and for them to use such
          words is to throw a slight upon the salvation which Christ has given
          them. If they are saved sinners they ought to be rejoicing saints.
          What some say others do not say, but they act as if it were so. They
          go about asking God to give them the mercy they have already obtained,
          hoping one day to receive what Christ assures them is already in their
          possession, talking to others as if it were a matter of question
          whether they were saved or not, when it cannot be a matter of
          question. "Thy faith hath saved thee." Fancy the poor penitent woman
          turning round and saying to the Saviour, "Lord, I humbly hope that it
          is true." There would have been neither humility nor faith in such an
          expression. Imagine that blind man, when Christ said, "Thy faith hath
          saved thee," saying "I trust that in future years it will be found to
          be so." It would be a belying at once of his own earnest character and
          of Christ's honesty of speech. If thou hast believed, thou art saved.
          Do not talk as if thou wert not, but now down from the willows take
          thy harp, and sing unto the Lord a new song. I have noticed in many
          prayers a tendency to avoid speaking as if facts were facts. I have
          heard this kind of expression, "The Lord hath done great things for
          us, whereof we desire to be glad." The text is, "The Lord hath done
          great things for us, whereof we are glad;" and if the Lord has done
          these great things for us our right is to be glad about them, not to
          go with an infamous "if" upon our lips before the Lord who cannot lie.
          If ye are dealing with your fellow creatures, suspect them, for they
          mostly deserve it; if ye are listening to their promises, doubt them,
          for their promises go to be broken; but if ye are dealing with your
          Lord and Master, never suspect him, for he is beyond suspicion; never
          doubt his promises, for heaven and earth and hell shall pass away, but
          not one jot or tittle of his word shall fail. I claim for Christ that
          ye cast away forever all the talk which is made up of "buts," and
          "ifs," and "peradventures," and "I hope," and "I trust." You are in
          the presence of One who said, "Verily, verily," and meant what he
          said, who is "the Amen, the faithful and true witness."
        </p>
        <p>
          You would not spit in his face if he were here, yet your "ifs" and
          "buts" are so much insult cast upon his truth. You would not scourge
          him, but what do your doubts do but vex him and put him to shame? If
          he lies, never believe him; if he speaks the truth, never doubt him.
          Then shall ye know when ye have cast aside your wicked unbelief, that
          your faith has saved you, and ye will go in peace.
