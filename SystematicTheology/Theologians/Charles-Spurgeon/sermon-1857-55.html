          |Therefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be
          sober.| -- 1 Thessalonians 5:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHAT SAD things sin hath done. This fair world of ours was once a
          glorious temple, every pillar of which reflected the goodness of God,
          and every part of which was a symbol of good, but sin has spoiled and
          marred all the metaphors and figures that might be drawn from earth.
          It has so deranged the divine economy of nature, that those things
          which were inimitable pictures of virtue, goodness, and divine
          plenitude of blessing, have now become the figures and representatives
          of sin. Tis strange to say, but it is strangely true, that the very
          best gifts of God have by the sin of man become the worst pictures of
          man's guilt. Behold the flood! breaking forth from its fountains, it
          rushes across the fields, bearing plenty on its bosom; it covers them
          awhile, and anon it doth subside and leaves upon the plain a fertile
          deposit, into which the farmer shall cast his seed and reap an
          abundant harvest. One would have called the breaking forth of water a
          fine picture of the plenitude of providence, the magnificence of God's
          goodness to the human race; but we find that sin has appropriated that
          figure to itself. The beginning of sin is like the breaking forth of
          waters. See the fire! how kindly God hath bestowed upon us that
          element, to cheer us in the midst of winter's frosts. Fresh from the
          snow and from the cold we rush to our household fire, and there by our
          hearth we warm our hands, and glad are we. Fire is a rich picture of
          the divine influences of the Spirit, a holy emblem of the zeal of the
          Christian; but, alas! sin hath touched this, and the tongue called |a
          fire;| |it is set on fire of hell,| we are told, and it is so
          evidently full often, when it uttereth blasphemy and slanders; and
          Jude lifts up his hand and exclaims, when he looks upon the evils
          caused by sin, |Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.| And
          then there is sleep, one of the sweetest of God's gifts, fair sleep
        </p>
        <p>|Tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep.|</p>
        <p>
          Sleep God hath selected as the very figure for the repose of the
          blessed. |They that sleep in Jesus,| saith the Scripture. David puts
          it amongst the peculiar gift's of grace: |So he giveth his beloved
          sleep.| But alas! sin could not let even this alone. Sin did over-ride
          even this celestial metaphor; and though God himself had employed
          sleep to express the excellence of the state of the blessed, yet sin
          must have even this profaned, ere itself can be expressed. Sleep is
          employed in our text as a picture of a sinful condition. |Therefore
          let us not sleep as do others; but let us watch and be sober.|
        </p>
        <p>
          With that introduction, I shall proceed at once to the text. The
          |sleep| of the text is an evil to be avoided. In the second place, the
          word |therefore| is employed to show us that there are certain reasons
          for the avoiding of this sleep. And since the apostle speaks of this
          sleep with sorrow, it is to teach us that there are some, whom he
          calls |others,| over whom it is our business to lament, because they
          sleep, and do not watch, and are not sober.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We commence, then, in the first place, by endeavoring to point out
          the EVIL WHICH THE APOSTLE INTENDS TO DESCRIBE UNDER THE TERM SLEEP.
          The apostle speaks of |others| who are asleep. If you turn to the
          original you will find that the word translated |others| has a more
          emphatic meaning. It might be rendered (and Horne so renders it) |the
          refuse,| -- |Let us not sleep as do the refuse,| the common herd, the
          ignoble spirits, those who have no mind above the troubles of earth.
          |Let us not sleep as do the others,| the base ignoble multitude who
          are not alive to the high and celestial calling of a Christian. |Let
          us not sleep as do the refuse of mankind.| And you will find that the
          word |sleep,| in the original, has also a more emphatic sense. It
          signifies a deep sleep, a profound slumber; and the apostle intimates,
          that the refuse of mankind are now in a profound slumber. We will now
          try if we can explain what he meant by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the apostle meant, that the refuse of mankind are in a state of
          deplorable ignorance. They that sleep know nothing. There may be
          merriment in the house, but the sluggard shareth not in its gladness;
          there may be death in the family but no tear bedeweth the cheek of the
          sleeper. Great events may have transpired in the world's history, but
          he wots not of them. An earthquake may have tumbled a city from its
          greatness, or war may have devastated a nation, or the banner of
          triumph may be waving in the gale, and the clarions of his country may
          be saluting us with victory, but he knoweth nothing.
        </p>
        <p>|Their labor and their love are lost,</p>
        <p>Alike unknowing and unknown.|</p>
        <p>
          The sleeper knoweth not anything. Behold how the refuse of mankind are
          alike in this! Of some things they know much, but of spiritual things
          they know nothing; of the divine person of the adorable Redeemer they
          have no idea; of the sweet enjoyments of a life of piety they can not
          even make a guess; toward the high enthusiasms and the inward raptures
          of the Christian they can not mount. Talk to them of divine doctrines,
          and they are to them a riddle; tell them of sublime experiences, and
          they seem to them to be enthusiastic fancies. They know nothing of the
          joys that are to come; and alas! for them, they are oblivious of the
          evils which shall happen to them if they go on in their iniquity. The
          mass of mankind are ignorant; they know not; they have not the
          knowledge of God, they have no fear of Jehovah before their eyes; but,
          blind-folded by the ignorance of this world, they march on through the
          paths of lust to that sure and dreadful end, the everlasting ruin of
          their souls. Brethren, if we be saints, let us not be ignorant as are
          others. Let us search the Scriptures, for in them we have eternal
          life, for they do testify of Jesus. Let us be diligent; let not the
          Word depart out of our hearts; let us meditate therein both by day and
          night, that we may be as the tree planted by the rivers of water. |Let
          us not sleep as do others.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, sleep pictures a state of insensibility. There may be much
          knowledge in the sleeper, hidden, stored away in his mind, which might
          be well developed, if he could but be awakened. But he hath no
          sensibility, he knoweth nothing. The burglar hath broken into the
          house; the gold and silver are both in the robbers hands; the child is
          being murdered by the cruelty of him that hath broken in; but the
          father slumbereth, though all the gold and silver that he hath, and
          his most precious child, are in the hands of the destroyer. He is
          unconscious, how can he feel, when sleep had utterly sealed his
          senses! Lo! in the street there is mourning. A fire hath just now
          burned down the habitation of the poor, and houseless beggars are in
          the street. They are crying at his window, and asking him for help.
          But he sleeps, and what wots he, though the night be cold, and though
          the poor are shivering in the blast? He hath no consciousness; he
          feeleth not for them. There! take the title-deed of his estate, and
          burn the document. There! set light to his farm-yard! burn up all that
          he hath in the field; kill his horse and destroy his cattle; let now
          the fire of God descend and burn up his sheep; let the enemy fall upon
          all that he hath and devour it. He sleeps as soundly as if he were
          guarded by the angel of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are the refuse of mankind. But alas! that we should have to
          include in that word |refuse| the great bulk thereof! How few there
          are that feel spiritually! They feel acutely enough any injury to
          their body, or to their estate; but alas! for their spiritual concerns
          they have no sensation whatever! They are standing on the brink of
          hell, but they tremble not; the anger of God is burning against them,
          but they fear not; the sword of Jehovah is unsheathed, but terror doth
          not seize upon them. They proceed with the merry dance; they drink the
          bowl of intoxicating pleasure; they revel and they riot, still do they
          sing the lascivious song; yea, they do more than this; in their vain
          dreams they do defy the Most High, whereas, if they were once awakened
          to the consciousness of their state, the marrow of their bones would
          melt, and their heart would dissolve like wax in the midst of their
          bowels. They are asleep, indifferent and unconscious. Do what you may
          to them; let every thing be swept away that is hopeful, that might
          give them cheer when they come to die, yet they feel it not; for how
          should a sleeper feel anything? But, |Therefore let us not sleep, as
          do others; but let us watch and be sober.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: the sleeper cannot defend himself. Behold yonder prince, he is
          a strong man, ay, and a strong man armed. He hath entered into the
          tent. He is wearied. He hath drunken the woman's milk; he hath eaten
          her |butter in a lordly dish;| he casteth himself down upon the floor,
          and he slumbereth. And now she draweth nigh. She hath with her her
          hammer and her nail. Warrior! thou couldst break her into atoms with
          one blow of thy mighty arm; but thou canst not now defend thyself. The
          nail is at his ear, the woman's hand is on the hammer, and the nail
          hath pierced his skull; for when he slept he was defenseless. The
          banner of Sisera had waved victoriously over mighty foes; but now it
          is stained by a woman. Tell it, tell it, tell it! The man, who when he
          was awake, made nations tremble, dies by the hand of a feeble woman
          when he sleepeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are the refuse of mankind. They are asleep; they have no power to
          resist temptation. Their moral strength is departed, for God is
          departed from them. There is the temptation to lust. They are men of
          sound principle in business matters, and nothing could make them
          swerve from honesty; but lasciviousness destroyeth them; they are
          taken like a bird in the snare; they are caught in a trap; they are
          utterly subdued. Or, mayhap, it is another way that they are
          conquered. They are men that would not do an unchaste act, or even
          think a lascivious thought, they scorn it. But they have another weak
          point, they are entrapped by the glass. They are taken and they are
          destroyed by drunkenness. Or, if they can resist these things, and are
          inclined neither to looseness of life nor to excess in living, yet
          mayhap covetousness entereth into them; by the name of prudence it
          slideth into their hearts, and they are led to grasp after treasure
          and to heap up gold, even though that gold be wrung out of the veins
          of the poor, and though they do suck the blood of the orphan. They
          seem to be unable to resist their passion. How many times have I been
          told by men, |I can not help it, sir, do what I may; I resolve, I
          re-resolve, but I do the same; I am defenseless; I can not resist the
          temptation!| Oh, of course you can not, while you are asleep. O Spirit
          of the living God! wake up the sleeper! Let sinful sloth and
          presumption both be startled, lest haply Moses should come their way,
          and finding them asleep should hang them on the gallows of infamy for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I come to give another meaning to the word |sleep.| I hope there
          have been some of my congregation who have been tolerable easy whilst
          I have described the first three things, because they have thought
          that they were exempt in those matters. But sleep signifies also
          inactivity. The farmer can not plow his field in his sleep, neither
          can he cast the grain into the furrows, nor watch the clouds, nor reap
          his harvest. The sailor can not reef his sail, nor direct his ship
          across the ocean, whilst he slumbereth. It is not possible that on the
          Exchange, or the mart, or in the house of business, men should
          transact their affairs with their eyes fast closed in slumber. It
          would be a singular thing to see a nation of sleepers; for they would
          be a nation of idle men. They must all starve; they would produce no
          wealth from the soil; they would have nothing for their backs, nought
          for clothing and nought for food. But how many we have in the world
          that are inactive through sleep! Yes, I say inactive. I mean by that,
          that they are active enough in one direction, but they are inactive in
          the right. Oh how many men there are that are totally inactive in
          anything that is for God's glory, or for the welfare of their fellow
          creatures! For themselves, they can |rise up early, and sit up late,
          and eat the bread of carefulness;| -- for their children, which is an
          alias for themselves, they can toil until their fingers ache -- they
          can weary themselves until their eyes are red in their sockets, till
          the brain whirls, and they can do no more. But for God they can do
          nothing. Some say they have no time, others frankly confess that they
          have no will: for God's church they would not spend an hour, whilst
          for this worlds pleasure they could lay out a month. For the poor they
          can not spend their time and attention. They may haply have time to
          spare for themselves and for their own amusment; but for holy works,
          for deeds of charity, and for pious acts they declare they have no
          leisure; whereas, the fact is, they have no will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold ye, how many professing Christians there are that are asleep in
          this sense! They are inactive. Sinners are dying in the street by
          hundreds; men are sinking into the flames of eternal wrath, but they
          fold their arms, they pity the poor perishing sinner, but they do
          nothing to show that their pity is real. They go to their places of
          worship; they occupy their well-cushioned easy pew; they wish the
          minister to feed them every Sabbath; but there is never a child taught
          in the Sunday-school by them; there is never a tract distributed at
          the poor man's house; there is never a deed done which might be the
          means of saving souls. We call them good men; some of them we even
          elect to the office of deacons; and no doubt good men they are; they
          are as good as Anthony meant to say that Brutus was honorable, when he
          said, |So are we all, all honorable men.| So are we all, all good, if
          they be good. But these are good, and in some sense -- good for
          nothing; for they just sit and eat the bread, but they do not plow the
          field; they drink the wine, but they will not raise the vine that doth
          produce it. They think that they are to live unto themselves,
          forgetting that |no man liveth unto himself, and no man dieth unto
          himself.| Oh, what a vast amount of sleeping we have in all our
          churches and chapels; for truly if our churches were once awake, so
          far as material is concerned, there are enough converted men and
          women, and there is enough talent with them, and enough money with
          them, and enough time with them, God granting the abundance of His
          Holy Spirit, which he would be sure to do if they were all zealous --
          there is enough to preach the gospel in every corner of the earth. The
          church does not need to stop for want of instruments, or for want of
          agencies; we hare everything now except the will; we have all that we
          may expect to give for the conversion of the world, except just a
          heart for the work, and the Spirit of God poured out into our midst.
          Oh! brethren, |let us not sleep as do others.| You will find the
          |others| in the church and in the world: |the refuse| of both are
          sound asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ere, however, I can dismiss this first point of explanation, it is
          necessary for me just to say that the apostle himself furnishes us
          with part of an exposition; for the second sentence, |let us watch and
          be sober,| implies that the reverse of these things is the sleep,
          which he means. |Let us watch.| There are many that never watch. They
          never watch against sin; they never watch against the temptations of
          the enemy; they do not watch against themselves, nor against |the
          lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life.| They
          do not watch for opportunities to do good; they do not watch for
          opportunities to instruct the ignorant, to confirm the weak, to
          comfort the afflicted, to succor them that are in need; they do not
          watch for opportunities of glorifying Jesus, or for times of
          communion; they do not watch for the promises; they do not watch for
          answers to their prayers; they do not watch for the second coming of
          our Lord Jesus. These are the refuse of the world: they watch not
          because they are asleep. But let us watch: so shall we prove that we
          are not slumberers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: let us |be sober.| Albert Barnes says, this most of all refers
          to abstinence, or temperance in eating and drinking, Calvin says, not
          so; this refers more especially to the spirit of moderation in the
          things of the world. Both are right; it refers to both. There be many
          that are not sober; they sleep because they are not so; for insobriety
          leadeth to sleep. They are not sober -- they are drunkards, they are
          gluttons. They are not sober -- they can not be content to do a little
          business -- they want to do a great deal. They are not sober -- they
          can not carry on a trade that is sure -- they must speculate. They are
          not sober -- if they lose their property, their spirit is cast down
          within them, and they are like men that are drunken with wormwood. If
          on the other hand, they get rich, they are not sober: they so set
          their affections things on earth that they become intoxicated with
          pride, because of their riches -- become purse-proud, and need to have
          the heavens lifted up higher, lest their heads should dash against the
          stars. How many people there are that are not sober! Oh! I might
          especially urge this precept upon you at this time, my dear friends.
          We have hard times coming, and the times are hard enough now. Let us
          be sober. The fearful panic in America has mainly risen from
          disobedience to this command -- |Be sober;| and if the professors of
          America had obeyed this commandment, and had been sober, the panic
          might at any rate have been mitigated, if not totally avoided. Now, in
          a little time, you who have any money laid by will be rushing to the
          bank to have it drawn out, because you fear that the bank is
          tottering. You will not be sober enough to have a little trust in your
          fellow-men, and help them through their difficulty, and so be a
          blessing to the commonwealth. And you who think there is anything to
          be got by lending your money at usury will not be content with lending
          what you have, but you will be extorting and squeezing your poor
          debtors, that you may get the more to lend. Men are seldom content to
          get rich slowly, but he that hasteth to be rich shall not be innocent.
          Take care, my brethren -- if any hard times should come, if commercial
          houses should smash, and banks be broken -- take care to be sober.
          There is nothing will get us over a panic so well as every one of us
          trying to keep our spirits up -- just rising in the morning and
          saying; |Times are very hard, and to-day I may lose my all; but
          fretting will not help it; so just let me set a bold heart against
          hard sorrow, and go to my business. The wheels of trade may stop; I
          bless God, my treasure is in heaven; I can not be bankrupt. I have set
          my affections on the things of God; I can not lose those things. There
          is my jewel; there is my heart!| Why, if all men could do that, it
          would tend to create public confidence; but the cause of the great
          ruin of many men is the covetousness of all men, and the fear of some.
          If we could all go through the world with confidence, and with
          boldness, and with courage, there is nothing in the world that could
          avert the shock so well. Come, I suppose, the shock must; and there
          are many men now present, who are very respectable, who may expect to
          be beggars ere long. Your business is, so to put your trust in Jehovah
          that you may be able to say, |Though the earth be removed, and though
          the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, God is my refuge
          and strength, a very present help in trouble; therefore will I not
          fear;| and doing that, you will be creating more probabilities for the
          avoidance of your own destruction than by any other means which the
          wisdom of man can dictate to you. Let us not be intemperate in
          business, as are others; but let us awake. |Let us not sleep| -- not
          be carried away by the somnambulism of the world, for what it is
          better than that? -- activity and greed in sleep; |but let us watch
          and be sober.| Oh, Holy Spirit, help us to watch and be sober.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus I have occupied a great deal of time in explaining the first
          point -- What was the sleep which the apostle meant? And now you will
          notice that the word |therefore| implies that there are CERTAIN
          REASONS FOR THIS. I shall give you these reasons; and if I should cast
          them somewhat into a dramatic form, you must not wonder; they will the
          better perhaps, be remembered. |Therefore,| says the apostle, |let us
          not sleep.|
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall first look at the chapter itself for our reasons. The first
          reason precedes the text. The apostle tells us that |we are all the
          children of the light and of the day; therefore let us not sleep as do
          others.| I marvel not when, as I walk through the streets after
          nightfall, I see every shop closed and every window-blind drawn down;
          and I see the light in the upper room significant of retirement to
          rest. I wonder not that a half an hour later my footfall startles me,
          and I find none in the streets. Should I ascend the staircase, and
          look into the sleeper's placid countenances, I should not wonder; for
          it is night, the proper time for sleep. But if, some morning, at
          eleven or twelve o'clock, I should walk down the streets and find
          myself alone, and notice every shop closed, and every house straitly
          shut up, and hearken to no noise, should say, |Tis strange, tis
          passing strange, tis wonderful. What are these people at? Tis
          day-time, and yet they are all asleep. I should be inclined to seize
          the first rapper I could find, and give a double knock, and rush to
          the next door, and ring the bell, and so all the way down the street,
          or go to the police station, and wake up what man I found there, and
          bid them make a noise in the street; or go for the fire-engine, and
          bid the firemen rattle down the road and try to wake these people up.
          For I should say to myself, |There is some pestilence here; the angel
          of death must have flown through these streets during the night and
          killed all these people, or else they would have been sure to have
          been awake.| Sleep in the daytime is utterly incongruous. |Well, now,|
          says the apostle Paul, |ye people of God, it is day time with you; the
          sun of righteousness has risen upon you with healing in his wings; the
          light of God's Spirit is in your conscience; ye have been brought out
          of darkness into marvelous light; for you to be asleep, for a church
          to slumber, is like a city a-bed in the day, like a whole town
          slumbering when the sun is shining. It is untimely and unseemly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, if you look to the text again, you will find there another
          argument. |Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
          breastplate of faith and love.| So, then, it seems, it is war-time;
          and therefore, again, it is unseemly to slumber. There is a fortress,
          yonder, far away in India. A troop of those abominable Sepoys have
          surrounded it. Blood thirsty hell-hounds, if they once gain admission,
          they will rend the mother and her children, and cut the strong man in
          pieces. They are at the gates: their cannon are loaded, their bayonets
          thirst for blood, and their swords are hungry to slay. Go through the
          fortress, and the people are all asleep. There is the warder on the
          tower, nodding on his bayonet. There is the captain in his tent, with
          his pen in his hand, and his dispatches before him, asleep at the
          table. There are soldiers lying down in their tents, ready for the
          war, but all slumbering. There is not a man to be seen keeping watch
          there is not a sentry there. All are asleep. Why, my friends, you
          would say, |Whatever is the matter here? What can it be? Has some
          great wizard been waving his wand, and put a spell upon them all? Or
          are they all mad? Have their minds fled? Sure, to be asleep in wartime
          is indeed outrageous. Here! take down that trumpet; go close up to the
          captain's ear, and blow a blast, and see if it does not awake him in a
          moment. Just take away that bayonet from the soldier that is asleep on
          the walls, and give bin a sharp prick with it, and see if he does not
          awake.| But surely, surely, nobody can have patience with people
          asleep, when the enemy surround the walls and are thundering at the
          gates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Christians, this is your case. Your life is a life of warfare;
          the world, the flesh, and the devil; that hellish trinity, and your
          poor flesh is a wretched mudwork behind which to be intrenched. Are
          you asleep? Asleep, when Satan has fire-balls of lust to hurl into the
          windows of your eyes -- when he has arrows of temptation to shoot into
          your heart -- when he has snares into which to trap your feet? Asleep,
          when he has undermined your very existence, and when he is about to
          apply the match with which to destroy you, unless sovereign grace
          prevents? Oh! sleep not, soldier of the cross! To sleep in war-time is
          utterly inconsistent. Great Spirit of God forbid that we should
          slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, leaving the chapter itself, I will give you one or two other
          reasons that will, I trust, move Christian people to awake out of
          their sleep. |Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead! Bring out your
          dead!| Then comes the ringing of a bell. What is this? Here is a door
          marked with a great white cross. Lord, have mercy upon us! All the
          houses down that street seem to be marked with that white death cross.
          What is this? Here is the grass growing in the streets; here are
          Cornhill and Cheapside deserted; no one is found treading the solitary
          pavement there is not a sound to be heard but those horse-hoofs like
          the hoofs of death's pale horse upon the stones, the ringing of that
          bell that sounds the death-knell to many, and the rumbling of the
          wheels of that cart, and the dreadful cry, |Bring out your dead! Bring
          out your dead! Bring out your dead!| Do you see that house? A
          physician lives there. He is a man who has great skill, and God has
          lent him wisdom. But a little while ago, whilst in his study, God was
          pleased to guide his mind, and he discovered the secret of the plague.
          He was plague-smitten himself, and ready to die; but he lifted the
          blessed phial to his lips, and he drank a draught and cured himself.
          Do you believe what I am about to tell you? Can you imagine it? That
          man has the prescription that will heal all these people; he has it in
          his pocket. He has the medicine which, if once distributed in those
          streets, would make the sick rejoice, and put that dead man's bell
          away. And he is asleep! he is asleep! He is asleep! O ye heavens! why
          do ye not fall and crush the wretch? O earth! how couldst thou bear
          this demon upon thy bosom? Why not swallow him up quick? He has the
          medicine; he is too lazy to go and tell forth the remedy. He has the
          cure, and is too idle to go out and administer it to the sick and the
          dying! No, my friends, such an inhuman wretch could not exist! But I
          can see him here to-day. There are you! You know the world is sick
          with the plague of sin, and you yourself have been cured by the remedy
          which has been provided. You are asleep, inactive, loitering. You do
          not go forth to
        </p>
        <p>|Tell to others round,</p>
        <p>What a dear Saviour you have found.|</p>
        <p>
          There is the precious gospel; you do not go and put it to the lips of
          a sinner. There is the all-precious blood of Christ; you never go to
          tell the dying what they must do to be saved. The world is perishing
          with worse than plague: and you are idle! And you are a minister of
          the gospel; and you have taken that holy office upon yourself; and you
          are content to preach twice on a Sunday, and once on a weekday, and
          there is no remonstrance within you. You never desire to attract the
          multitudes to hear you preach; you had rather keep your empty benches,
          and study propriety, than you would once, at the risk of appearing
          over-zealous, draw the multitude and preach the word to them. You are
          a writer; you have great power in writing; you devote your talents
          alone to light literature, or to the production of other things which
          may furnish amusement, but which can not benefit the soul. You know
          the truth, but you do not tell it out. Yonder mother is a converted
          woman: you have children, and you forget to instruct them in the way
          to heaven. You, yonder, are a young man, having nothing to do on the
          Sabbath-day, and there is the Sunday school; you do not go to tell
          those children the sovereign remedy that God has provided for the cure
          of sick souls. The death-bell is ringing even now; hell is crying out,
          howling with hunger for the souls of men. |Bring out the sinner! Bring
          out the sinner! Bring out the sinner! Let him die and be damned!| And
          there are you, professing to be a Christian, and doing nothing which
          might make you the instrument of saving souls -- never putting out
          your hand to be the means in the hand of the Lord, of plucking sinners
          as brands from the burning! Oh! May the blessing of God rest on you,
          to turn you from such an evil way, that you may not sleep as do
          others, but may watch and be sober. The world's eminent danger demands
          that we should be active and not be slumbering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hark how the mast creaks! See the sails there, rent to ribbons.
          Breakers ahead! She will be on the rocks directly. Where is the
          captain? Where is the boatswain? Where are the sailors? Ahoy there!
          Where are you? Here's a storm come on. Where are you? You are down in
          the cabin. And there is the captain in a soft sweet slumber. There is
          the man at the wheel, as sound asleep as ever he can be; and there are
          all the sailors in their hammocks. What! and the breakers ahead? What!
          the lives of two hundred passengers in danger, and here are these
          brutes asleep? Kick them out. What is the good of letting such men as
          these be sailors, in such a time as this especially? Why, out with
          you! If you had gone to sleep in fine weather we might have forgiven
          you. Up with you, captain! What have you been at? Are you mad? But
          hark! the ship has struck; she will be down in a moment. Now you will
          work, will you? Now you will work, when it is of no use, and when the
          shrieks of drowning women shall toll you into hell for your most
          accursed negligence, in not having taken care of them. Well, that is
          very much line a great many of us, in these times too.
        </p>
        <p>
          This proud ship of our commonwealth is reeling in a storm of sin; the
          very mast of this great nation is creaking under the hurricane of vice
          that sweeps across the noble vessel; every timber is strained, and God
          help the good ship, or alas! none can save her. And who are her
          captain and her sailors, but ministers of God, the professors of
          religion? These are they to whom God gives grace to steer the ship.
          |Ye are the salt of the earth;| ye preserve and keep it alive, O
          children of God. Are ye asleep in the storm? Are ye slumbering now? If
          there were no dens of vice, if there were no harlots, if there were no
          houses of profanity, if there were no murders and no crimes, oh! ye
          that are the salt of the earth, ye might sleep; but to-day the sin of
          London crieth in the ears of God. This behemoth city is covered with
          crime, and God is vexed with her. And are we asleep, doing nothing?
          Then God forgive us! But sure of all the sins he ever doth forgive,
          this is the greatest, the sin of slumbering when a world is damning --
          the sin of being idle when Satan is busy, devouring the souls of men.
          |Brethren, let us not sleep| in such times as these; for if we do, a
          curse must fall upon us, horrible to bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a poor prisoner in a cell. His hair is all matted, over his
          eyes. A few weeks ago the judge put on the black cap, and commanded
          that he should be taken to the place from whence he came, and hung by
          the neck until dead. The poor wretch has his heart broken within him,
          whilst he thinks of the pinion, of the gallows, and of the drop, and
          of after-death. . O! who can tell how his heart is rent and racked,
          whilst he thinks of leaving all, and going he knoweth not where! There
          is a man there, sound asleep upon a bed. He has been asleep there
          these two days, and under his pillow he has that prisoners free
          pardon. I would horsewhip that scoundrel, horsewhip him soundly, for
          making that poor man have two days of extra misery. Why, if I had had
          that man's pardon, I would have been there, if I rode on the wings of
          lightning to get at him, and I should have thought the fastest train
          that ever run but slow, if I had so sweet a message to carry, and such
          a poor heavy heart to carry it to. But that man, that brute, is sound
          asleep, with a free pardon under his pillow, whilst that poor wretch's
          heart is breaking with dismay! Ah! do not be too hard with him: he is
          here today. Side by side with you this morning there is sitting a poor
          penitent sinner; God has pardoned him, and intends that you should
          tell him that good news. He sat by your side last Sunday, and he wept
          all the sermon through, for he felt his guilt. If you had spoken to
          him then, who can tell? He might have had comfort; but there he is now
          -- you do not tell him the good news. Do you leave that to me to do?
          Ah! sirs, but you can not serve God by proxy; what the minister does
          is nought to you; you have your own personal duty to do, and God has
          given you a precious promise. It is now on your heart. Will you not
          turn round to your next neighbor, and tell him that promise? O! there
          is many an aching heart that aches because of our idleness in telling
          the good news of this salvation. |Yes,| says one of my members, who
          always comes to this place on a Sunday, and looks out for young men
          and young women whom he has seen in tears the Sunday before, and who
          brings many into the church, |yes, I could tell you a story. He looks
          a young man in the face, and says, |Haven't I seen you here a great
          many times?| | Yes.| |I think you take a deep interest in the service,
          do you not?| |Yes, I do: what makes you ask me that question?|
          |Because I looked at your face last Sunday, and I thought there was
          something at work with you.| |O! sir,| he says, |nobody has spoken to
          me ever since I have been here till now, and I want to say a word to
          you. When I was at home with my mother, I used to think I had some
          idea of religion; but I came away, and was bound apprentice with an
          ungodly lot of youths, and have done everything I ought not to have
          done. And now, sir, I begin to weep, I begin to repent. I wish to God
          that I knew how I might be saved! I hear the word preached, sir, but I
          want something spoken personally to me by somebody.| And he turns
          round; he takes him by the hand and says, |My dear young brother, I am
          so glad I spoke to you; it makes my poor old heart rejoice to think
          that the Lord is doing something here still. Now, do not be cast down;
          for you know, |This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.'|
          The young man puts his handkerchief to his eyes, and after a minute,
          he says, |I wish you would let me call and see you, sir.| | O! you
          may,| he says. He talks with him, he leads him onward, and at last by
          God's grace the happy youth comes forward and declares what God has
          done for his soul, and owes his salvation as much to the humble
          instrumentality of the man that helped him as he could do to the
          preaching of the minister.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved brethren, the bridegroom cometh! Awake! Awake! The earth must
          soon be dissolved, and the heavens must melt! Awake! Awake! O Holy
          Spirit arouse us all, and keep us awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I have no time for the last point, and therefore I shall
          not detain you. Suffice me to say in warning, there is AN EVIL HERE
          LAMENTED. There are some that are asleep, and the apostle mourns it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My fellow sinner, thou that art this day unconverted, let me say six
          or seven sentences to thee, and thou shalt depart. Unconverted man!
          unconverted woman! you are asleep today, as they that sleep on the top
          of the mast in time of storm; you are asleep, as he that sleeps when
          the water-floods are out, and when his house is undermined, and being
          carried down the stream far out to sea; you are asleep, as he who in
          the upper chamber, when his house is burning and his own locks are
          singeing in the fire, knows not the devastation around him; you are
          asleep -- asleep as he that lies upon the edge of a precipice, with
          death and destruction beneath him. One single start in his sleep would
          send him over, but he knows it not. Thou art asleep this day; and the
          place where thou steepest has so frail a support that when once it
          breaks thou shalt fall into hell: and if thou wakest not till then,
          what a waking it will be! |In hell he lifted up his eyes, being in
          torment;| and he cried for a drop of water, but it was denied him. |He
          that believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ, and is baptized shall be
          saved; he that believeth not shall be damned.| This is the gospel.
          Believe ye in Jesus, and ye shall |rejoice with joy unspeakable and
          full of glory.|
