        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3467)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, July 15th, 1915.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "He that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new." --
          Revelation 21:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          MEN GENERALLY venerate antiquity. It were hard to say which has the
          stronger power over the human mind -- antiquity or novelty. While men
          will frequently dote upon the old, they are most easily dazzled by the
          new. Anything new has at least one attraction. Restless spirits
          consider that the new must be better than the old. Though often
          disappointed, they are still ready to be caught by the same bait, and,
          like the Athenians of Mars Hill, spend their time in nothing else but
          either to tell or to hear some new thing. And as for ourselves, dear
          friends, mournfully as we sometimes think of the flight of time, we
          are wont cheerfully to look out upon the new epochs as they begin to
          dawn upon us. If our calendar suggests some dismal memories in the
          past, our calculation forestalls some happier prospects in the future.
          And it will sometimes happen that we leave so much anxiety, adversity,
          and chastisement behind us, that it is a relief to hope that the tide
          has turned, and that a course of comfort, prosperity, and mercy lies
          before us. One weeps over the past and the lost. I suppose the best of
          men must do so at times. I am sure those of us who are not the best,
          feel often constrained to pour out some such a lamentation as this: --
        </p>
        <p>"Much of our time has run to waste;</p>
        <p>Our sins, how great the sum!</p>
        <p>Lord, give us pardon for the past,</p>
        <p>And strength for days to come."</p>
        <p>
          I do not know but it is sometimes as well, when one has been plunged
          in sorrow, or feels ashamed of his past life -- after having regretted
          that which is bygone and repented of it, and sorrowed over it -- to
          feel as if he breathed another atmosphere, and had started on a fresh
          career. Having thrown away the old sword, he is now about to see what
          he can do with the new: having put off an old garment, he is desirous
          to walk more worthily of his vocation with fresh ones that are
          provided for him. Perhaps the thought of freshness, the fact of new
          time having dawned on our path, may be a little help to those of us
          who are dull and heavy, and we may be stirred up to action, or, if not
          to action, it may awaken earnest hope that the infusion of a new start
          into our lives, new vigour instead of the old lethargy, new love
          instead of the old lukewarmness, new zeal instead of the old
          deathlikeness; new, pertinacious, persevering industry for Christ,
          instead of the old idleness, may result. God grant that it may be so!
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the text in this light, I think it speaks to everyone here
          present -- Would you begin anew, lo, there is one who can help you to
          do so! From the throne where sits the once crucified but now glorified
          Saviour, there comes a whisper of hope to each and every soul who
          would be made new, and would begin life anew. "Behold I make all
          things new." In trying to bring out the thoughts contained in this
          exclamation from the throne, from the Emperor of the Universe, from
          the court of the King of Kings, we shall first speak, very briefly, of
          the new creation; secondly, we should bid you adore the great
          Regenerator; and, in the third place, we shall ask you to behold with
          attention the fact before you, with a view of receiving benefit from
          it. Observe the text speaks of: --
        </p>
        <p>I. A NEW CREATION.</p>
        <p>
          "I make." That is a divine word. "I make all things." That, also, is
          divine. "I make all things new." This our Lord Jesus Christ has done
          upon the greatest scale. We must view his purpose. It is the purpose
          and intention of the Lord Jesus to make this world entirely new. You
          recollect how it was made at first -- pure and perfect. It sang with
          its sister-spheres the song of joy and reverence. It was a fair world,
          full of everything that was lovely, beautiful, happy, holy. And if we
          might be permitted to dream for a moment of what it would have been if
          it had continued as God created it, one might fancy what a blessed
          world it would be at this moment. Had it possessed a teeming
          population like its present one, and if, one by one, those godly ones
          had been caught away, like Elijah, without knowing death, to be
          succeeded by pious descendants -- oh! what a blessed world it would
          have been! A world where every man would have been a priest, and every
          house a temple, and every garment a vestment, and every meal a
          sacrifice, and every place holiness to the Lord, for the tabernacle of
          God would have been among them, and God himself would have dwelt among
          them! What songs would have hailed the rising of the sun -- the birds
          of paradise carolling on every hill and in every dale their Maker's
          praise! What songs would have ushered in the stillness of the night!
          Ay, and angels, hovering over this fair world, would oft have heard
          the strain of joy breaking the silence of midnight, as glad and pure
          hearts beheld the eyes of the Creator beaming down upon them from the
          stars which stud the vault of heaven. But there came a serpent, and
          his craft spoiled it all. He whispered into the ears of a mother Eve;
          she fell, and we fell with her, and what a world this now is! If a man
          walks about in it with his eyes open, he will see it to be a horrible
          sphere. I do not mean that its rivers, its lakes, its valleys, its
          mountains are repulsive. Nay, it is a world fit for angels, naturally;
          but it is a horrible world morally. As I walked the other day down the
          streets of Paris, and saw the soldiers with their pretty dresses, and
          the knives and forks which they carried with them to carve men and
          make a meal for death, I could not help thinking -- this is a pretty
          world, this is. Only let one man lift his finger, and a hundred
          thousand men are ready to meet a hundred thousand other men, all
          intent upon doing -- what? Why, upon cutting each other's throats,
          upon tearing out each other's bleeding hearts, and wading up to their
          knees in each other's gore, till the ditches be full of blood, horses
          and men all mingled, and left to be food for dogs and for carrion
          crows. And then the victors on either side in the fray, return, and
          beat the drums, and sound the trumpets, and say, "Glory! glory! see
          what we have done." Devils could not be worse than men when their
          passions are let loose. Dogs would scarce tear each other as men do.
          Men of intellect sit down, and put their fingers to their foreheads,
          racking their brains to find out new ways of using gunpowder, and
          shot, and shell, so as to be able to blow twenty thousand souls into
          eternity as easily as twenty might be massacred by present appliances.
          And he is considered a clever man, a patriot, a benefactor of his own
          nation, who, by dint of genius, can discover some new way of
          destroying his fellow creatures. Oh! it is a horrible world, appalling
          to think of. When God looks at it, I wonder he does not stamp it out,
          just as you and I do a spark of coal that flies upon our carpet from
          the fire. It is a dreadful world. But Jesus Christ, who knew that we
          should never make this world much better, let us do what we would with
          it, designed from the very first to make a new world of it. Truly,
          truly, this seems to me to be a glorious purpose. To make a world is
          something wonderful, but to make a world new is something more
          wonderful still. When God spake and said, "Let there be light," it was
          a fiat which showed him to be divine. Yet there was nothing then to
          resist his will; he had no opponent; he could build as he pleased, and
          there was none to pluck down. But when Jesus Christ comes to make a
          new world, there is everything opposed to him. When he saith, "Let
          there be light," darkness saith, "There shall not be light." When he
          says, "Let there be order," chaos says, "Nay, I will maintain
          confusion." When he says, "Let there be holiness, let there be love,
          let there be truth," the principalities and powers of evil withstand
          him, and say, "There shall not be holiness, there shall be sin; there
          shall not be love, there shall be hate; there shall not be truth,
          there shall be error; there shall not be the worship of God, there
          shall be the worship of stocks and stones; men shall bow down before
          idols which their own hands have made." And yet, for all that, Jesus
          Christ, coming in the form of a man, revealing himself as the Son of
          God, determines to make all things new; and be assured, brethren and
          sisters, he will do it. What though he pleases to take his time, and
          to use humble instrumentalities to effect his purposes, yet do it he
          will. The day shall come when this world shall be as fair as it was at
          the primeval Sabbath; when there shall be a new heaven and a new
          earth, wherein shall dwell righteousness. The ancient prophecy shall
          be fulfilled to the letter. God shall dwell among men, peace shall be
          domiciled on earth, and glory shall be ascribed to God in the highest.
          This great work of Christ, this grand design of making this old world
          into a new one, shall be carried into effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to accomplish this, it hath come to pass that Christ has made
          for us a new covenant. The old covenant was, "Do this and live." That
          covenant was a sentence of death upon us all. We could not do,
          therefore we could not live, and so we died. The new covenant has
          nothing in it contingent upon creature doing, but it bases all its
          provisions upon Christ having done the world. "I will, and you shall,"
          this is the language of the new covenant. The covenant of law, in
          which we were weak through the flesh, left us mangled and broken. The
          covenant of grace reveals God's kindness towards us, and our part
          thereof has been fulfilled for us by our surety, Christ Jesus. Thus it
          runs, "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more for
          ever; a new heart also will I give them, and a right spirit will I put
          within them." The old world is still under the old covenant of works,
          and its children perish, for they cannot carry out the conditions of
          the covenant, they cannot keep God's law, they break it constantly,
          and they die. But the children of grace are under the new covenant of
          grace, and through the precious blood, which is the penalty of the old
          broken covenant, and through the spotless righteousness of Christ,
          which is the fulfilment and magnifying of the old covenant, the
          Christian stands secure, and rejoices that he is saved. Christ has
          thus made his people dwell under a new covenant, instead of under the
          old one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the new covenant, Christ has been pleased to make us
          new men. His saints are "new creatures in Christ Jesus." They have a
          new nature. God has breathed into them a new life. The Holy Spirit,
          though the old nature is still there, has been pleased to put within
          them a new nature. There is now a contending force within them -- the
          old carnal nature inclining to evil, and the new God-given nature
          panting after perfection. They are new men, "begotten again unto a
          lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." This
          new nature is moved by new principles. The old nature needed to be
          awed with threatenings, or bribed with rewards; the new nature feels
          the impulse of love. Gratitude is its mainspring: "We love him because
          he first loved us." No mercenary motive now stirs the new creature: --
        </p>
        <p>"My God, I love thee -- not because</p>
        <p>I hope for heaven thereby,</p>
        <p>Nor yet because who love thee not</p>
        <p>Must burn eternally."</p>
        <p>
          I love thee, O my Saviour, because on the cross thou didst bear shame,
          and spitting, and manifold disgrace for me. New principles stir the
          new nature which God has given. And this new nature is conscious of
          new emotions. It loves what once it hated; it hates what once it
          loved. It finds blight where once it sought for bliss, and finds bliss
          where once it found nothing but bitterness. It leaps at the sound
          which was once dull to its ears -- the name of a precious Christ. It
          rejoices in hopes which once seemed idle as dreams. It is filled with
          a divine enthusiasm which it once rejected as fanatical. It is
          conscious now of living in a new element, breathing a fresh air,
          partaking of new food, drinking out of new wells not digged by men or
          filled from the earth. The man is new -- new in principles, and new in
          emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now the man is also new in relationship. He was an heir to wrath;
          he is now a child of God. He was a bond-slave; he is now a freeman. He
          was the Ishmael who dwelt in the wilderness; he is now the Isaac, and
          dwells with Sarah after the tenor of the new covenant. He rejoices in
          Christ Jesus, and feasts to the full. He was the citizen of earth
          once; he is now a citizen of heaven. He once found his all beneath the
          clouds; but now his all is beyond the stars. He has new relationships.
          Christ is his brother; God is his father; the angels are his friends;
          and the despised people of God are his best and nearest kinsfolk. And
          hence the man has new aspirations. He now pants to glorify God. What
          cared he about the glory of God once? He now pants to see God; once he
          would have paid the fare, if it had cost his life, that he might
          escape from the presence of the Lord. Now he hungers and thirsts after
          the living God; yea, if his soul had wings, and he could break the
          fetters of this mortality, he would mount at once to dwell where Jesus
          is. Dear friends, are you new men? If you are, you understand what it
          is; if you are not, I know I cannot explain it to you. Oh! to be born
          again is a great mystery; blessed is the soul that comprehends it! But
          he that knows it not will never learn it by the lip; he can only know
          it by the Spirit of God causing him also to be made a new creature in
          Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far I have said that the object of Christ was to make a new
          world, and he began by making a new covenant. Then, through his
          Spirit, he goes on to make new men under the new covenant, and you
          will see that by this means he makes a new society. Swelling words
          have been spoken and great attempts taken in hand to renovate society,
          but you can never renovate society till you have renovated the
          individual members who compose society. You may build a brick house,
          if you please; but, build it as you like, it will be a house of brick
          upon whatever principles of architecture it may be constructed; not
          until that brick shall be transformed to marble can you hope to "dwell
          in marble halls." So men may launch their divers theories, and patent
          their social inventions, but after they have re-shaped the society of
          sinners, they will leave it a sinful society still. It is otherwise
          with Christ. By making new men he makes a new society, which society
          he calls his "Church". That Church he sends into the world to act upon
          the rest of mankind. Verily the day will come -- whether it shall be
          at his second advent or before his second advent, I do not know -- the
          day when from the east to the west, and from the north to the south,
          there shall be a new world as far as men are concerned. There shall be
          no injustice towards the poor; there shall be no envying of the rich;
          there shall be no law to make men slaves; there shall be no power to
          oppress, because there shall be no will to do it. Our Lord Jesus
          Christ shall put a new heart into earth's kings, and then he shall
          come himself to take their thrones and their crowns, and to be himself
          our Universal King, and in his day shall the righteous flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I believe the way for us to regard that happy day in which he will
          make all things new; that happy day when the lion shall eat straw like
          the ox, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, when the sword
          shall be turned into the sickle, and the spear into the pruning hook
          -- the way for us to regard that day, I think, is not standing with
          our mouths open expecting it, but by setting to work after the
          Master's own fashion, seeking to bring it about, to gather out the
          elect from mankind, to illustrate the gospel practically in our lives,
          and so to do as Jesus did among the sons of men; promoting light, and
          peace, and truth, and holiness, and happiness as God may help us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish we had more time to enter fully into this part of the subject.
          We have not, and, therefore, we must leave it, but may you and I have
          a part in this new creation! Turning to our second point, I want you
          to: --
        </p>
        <p>II. ADORE THIS GREAT REGENERATOR.</p>
        <p>
          He says, "Behold I make all things new." Behold him! He is a man
          dressed in the common garments of the poor! He hath no form nor
          comeliness, and when you shall see him there is no beauty in him that
          you should desire him. He has come to make the world new. He has no
          soldiery, no book of laws, no new philosophy. He had come to make the
          world new, and to do this he has brought with him -- what? Why,
          himself. He spends a life of weariness and sorrow amongst those who
          despise him, and if you want to know first and foremost how he makes
          all things new, you must see him sweating great drops of blood in the
          garden -- that is the blood of the new world which he is pouring
          forth! You must see him bound, scourged, spat upon, led to the
          accursed tree. While God's wrath for sin is yet unspent, the world
          cannot be new; but when that wrath on account of sin is all poured
          upon the head of the great Substitute, then the world stands in a new
          relation to God, and it can be a new world. See the Saviour then, in
          groans and pangs which cannot be described, bearing the curse of God,
          for he made him to be sin for us, though he knew no sin. The curse
          fell on him, as it is written, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
          tree." It pleased the Father to bruise him; he hath put him to grief;
          he hath made his soul to be an offering for sin." That dolorous pain,
          then, of the Master was the world's new- making. It was then and there
          that the world was born again. No mother's pangs, when she brought
          forth a man-child, were such as those of Christ when he brought forth
          the new creation. It was there in the travail of his soul -- did you
          ever catch that idea, the travail of his soul? -- it was there that
          the new world was born! "Behold I make all things new" is a mysterious
          voice from the broken heart of a dying Saviour. From the empty tomb,
          as he rises, I hear it come in silvery notes, "Behold I make all
          things new." You must trace the birth of the new creation up to the
          grave of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the place where the cross stood,
          and where his body lay.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the actual operations of new-making the world takes place through
          the truth which Christ promulgated. After the relation of the world to
          God had been changed by the sufferings of Jesus, the world's thought
          concerning God came to be changed by the preaching of Jesus. He came
          and revealed God to man as man had never seen God before. It was
          through him we learned that "God is love." It was through him that we
          understood that "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
          Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
          everlasting life." It is the preaching of the cross of Jesus that is
          to make the world new. It is not the philosophies of men, but the
          wisdom of God which effects the change. In the presence of Christ your
          philosophies must sink into darkness as stars in the presence of the
          sun.

        <p>
          And it is also by the giving of the Holy Ghost, as the result of the
          ascension of Christ on high, that the world is made new. Thus he gives
          power to the ministry. There were three thousand new creations in one
          day when Peter preached the gospel under the influence of the Holy
          Spirit. And that blessed Spirit of God is here tonight. Oh! I would
          that there might be some new creations tonight, that that divine
          heavenly Spirit would come into some of your souls, and drop there
          that vital spark of heavenly flame which shall never be quenched, but
          shall burn brightly in heaven for ever. Wherever the gospel is
          preached, the Spirit is present in that gospel, and he gives faith to
          men, gives life to men, and so they are made new, and the new-making
          thus goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not time -- though thoughts crowd into my mind -- to speak
          about the way in which Christ thus new-makes the world. It is quite
          certain that three parts of his history are connected with it. I have
          only referred to his death, his burial, and his resurrection, but I
          might go on to speak of his constant and prevalent intercessions, for
          his pleading before the throne is also a part of the mighty operation;
          nor can I doubt but that his Second Advent will be the bringing out of
          the topstone with shoutings of "Grace, grace unto it!" Then shall be
          fulfilled -- finally and exhaustively fulfilled -- the saying that is
          written, "Behold I make all things new." The text begins with
          "Behold!" and I am going to close with that same note of admiration. I
          want you to: --
        </p>
        <p>III. BEHOLD AND TO BELIEVE.</p>
        <p>
          Behold, the Lord Jesus is now enthroned in heaven. He it is who makes
          all things new. Is not this what some of you here present deeply need?
          If you look within, yourselves will see much to disgust and alarm you.
          Peradventure, you dare not take stock of yourselves now; you dare not
          consider where you are, nor what you are, nor whither you are bound.
          "To speak candidly," you say, "I want reforming." Very likely, but you
          want a great deal more than mere reformation. I have heard of a being
          who used habitually to swear, "God mend me!" Somebody said, "Better
          make a new one." That is the case with full many of you. You are
          saying, "Well, I will turn over a new leaf." You had better shut the
          book up altogether, and never turn over any more leaves, for all the
          pages are alike bad. "Oh! well," says one, "I shall try if I cannot
          alter." I wish you would try God's altering of you, instead of
          altering yourselves. "Well, but surely, surely, I may wash and be
          clean; I will try to make myself as clean as possible?" Yes, yes, that
          is all very well; but what if you have a corpse in the house? I would
          have you make it clean, yet that will not make it live. However much
          you may wash it, it is corrupt still. You may reform yourselves as
          much as ever you please, all your reformation will be futile; you need
          more, a great deal more than that. The fact is, you must be made new.
          Nothing less will do; you must be made new; you must be born again.
          "Ah!" says one, "if I could be made new, there might be a chance for
          me." Well now, Christ looks down from this throne in heaven, and he
          says, "Behold I will make all things new." "Yes," you say, "but he
          will not make me new." Why not? Does he not say, "I make all things
          new"? "But my heart is as hard as a rock," say you. Well, but he says,
          "I will make all things new," so he can give you a new heart. "Oh! but
          I am so very stubborn. Aye, aye, but he makes all things new, and he
          can make you as tender and sensitive as a little child. Oftentimes a
          grey-headed sinner has looked back to his childhood, and remembered
          the time when he used to sing his little hymn at his mother's knee,
          and he has said, 'Ah! I have been in many strange places since then,
          and my heart has got seared and hard; I wish I could get back to what
          I was then!" Well, you can, you can. Christ can bring you there. Nay,
          he can bring you to something better than you ever were when those
          golden ringlets hung so plentifully about that pretty little head of
          yours, for you were not so innocent then as you now think you were.
          Christ can make you really pure in heart; he can make you a new
          creature, so that you shall be converted and become as a little child.
          "Oh!" say you, "how can I get it? How can I prepare myself for him?"
          You do not want to prepare yourself for him. God to him just as you
          are; trust him to do it, and he will do it. That is faith, you know --
          trust, dependence. Canst thou believe that Christ can save thee? Oh!
          thou canst believe that; well now, wilt thou trust him to save thee?
          Wilt thou trust him to deliver thee from thy drunkenness, from thine
          angry temper, thy pride, thy love of self, thy lusts? Dost thou desire
          to be a new creature in Christ Jesus? If so, that very desire must
          have come from heaven. I could fain hope that he has already begun the
          good work in you, and he that begins it will carry it on. Do not be
          afraid, however bad thy character, or however vicious thy disposition.
          "Behold," says Christ, "I make all things new." What a wonder it is
          that a man should ever have a new heart! You know if a lobster loses
          its claw in a fight it can get a new claw, and that is thought to be
          very marvellous. It would be very wonderful if men should be able to
          grow new arms and new legs, but who ever heard of a creature who grew
          a new heart? You may have seen a bough lopped off a tree, and you may
          have thought that, perhaps, the tree will sprout again, and there will
          be a new limb, but who ever heard of old trees getting new sap and a
          new core? But my Lord and Master, the crucified and exalted Saviour,
          has given new hearts and new cores; he has put the vital substance
          into man afresh, and made new creatures of them. I am glad to notice
          the tear in your eye, when you think on the past, but wipe it away
          now, and look up to the cross and say: --
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bid'st me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb, O God, I come."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh! make me a new creature!" If you have said that from your heart,
          you are a new creature, dear brother, and we will rejoice together in
          this regenerating Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me just say a few words to those of you who love the Lord. You may
          have some very bad children, or you have some relatives who are going
          on in sin from bad to worse. I earnestly recommend you attentively to
          consider my text. "Behold," says Christ, "I make all things new." "No,
          no," says the old father, "I used to pray for my boy; he broke my
          heart; he brought his mother's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave;
          but he has gone away, and I have not heard of him for years, and I am
          almost afraid to wish I ever may hear of him again, for he did seem so
          reckless, that my only comfort is in trying to forget him." "Yes,"
          says a husband here, "I have prayed for my wife o many times, that I
          do feel tempted to give it up; it is not likely that I shall ever live
          to see her saved." Oh! but, brethren and sisters, we do not know;
          since the Lord saved us, there cannot be any limits as to what he can
          do. Look at the text, "Behold I make all things new." I will pray,
          "Lord, make my children new." You shall pray, "Lord, make my wife
          new." You godly wives, who have ungodly husbands, you shall pray,
          "Lord, make our husbands new." You who have dear friends who lie upon
          your bosom, as you anxiously think of them, pray the Lord Jesus to
          make them new. When our friends are made new, oh! what a great comfort
          they are; just as much so as they formerly were a sorrow. The greater
          the sinner, the greater the joy to loving believers when they see him
          saved. "Behold," says Christ -- I do like that word -- "Behold it!
          Stand and look at it! See how I took the man when he was up to his
          neck in sin, and made him preach the gospel. Can I not do the same
          again? Look there and see the dying thief upon the cross, black with a
          thousand crimes: I washed him and took him to Paradise the same day;
          what can I not do? Behold I make all things new." Courage, my brethren
          and sisters. We will not entertain any more doubt about Christ's power
          to save. Rather, by God's grace, may we henceforth believe more in
          him, and, according to our faith, so shall it be done unto us. If we
          can only trust him for those of our friends whose faults seem to us
          few and light, our little trust will reap little reward; but if we can
          go with strong faith in a great God, and bring great sinners in our
          arms, and put them down before this mighty Regenerator of men, and
          say, "Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make them new"; and if we will
          never cease the pleading till we get the blessing, then we shall see
          ever-accumulating illustrations of the fact that Jesus makes all
          things new; and calling up the witnesses of his redeeming power, we
          shall cry in the ears of a drowsy Church and an incredulous world,
          "Behold, behold, behold! He makes all things new." The Lord give us
          eyes to see it. Amen.<br />
