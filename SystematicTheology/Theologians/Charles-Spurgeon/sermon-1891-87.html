          1. It certainly was in the power of the apostles to declare that
          Christ descended upon Jesus, or that the so-called superior Saviour
          [came down] upon the dispensational one, or he who is from the
          invisible places upon him from the Demiurge; but they neither knew nor
          said anything of the kind: for, had they known it, they would have
          also certainly stated it. But what really was the case, that did they
          record, [namely,] that the Spirit of God as a dove descended upon Him;
          this Spirit, of whom it was declared by Isaiah, "And the Spirit of God
          shall rest upon Him," as I have already said. And again: "The Spirit
          of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me." That is the
          Spirit of whom the Lord declares, "For it is not ye that speak, but
          the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." And again, giving to
          the disciples the power of regeneration into God, He said to them, "Go
          and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
          of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." For [God] promised, that in the
          last times He would pour Him [the Spirit] upon [His] servants and
          handmaids, that they might prophesy; wherefore He did also descend
          upon the Son of God, made the Son of man, becoming accustomed in
          fellowship with Him to dwell in the human race, to rest with human
          beings, and to dwell in the workmanship of God, working the will of
          the Father in them, and renewing them from their old habits into the
          newness of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This Spirit did David ask for the human race, saying, "And stablish
          me with Thine all-governing Spirit;" who also, as Luke says, descended
          at the day of Pentecost upon the disciples after the Lord's ascension,
          having power to admit all nations to the entrance of life, and to the
          opening of the new covenant; from whence also, with one accord in all
          languages, they uttered praise to God, the Spirit bringing distant
          tribes to unity, and offering to the Father the first-fruits of all
          nations. Wherefore also the Lord promised to send the Comforter, who
          should join us to God. For as a compacted lump of dough cannot be
          formed of dry wheat without fluid matter, nor can a loaf possess
          unity, so, in like manner, neither could we, being many, be made one
          in Christ Jesus without the water from heaven. And as dry earth does
          not bring forth unless it receive moisture, in like manner we also,
          being originally a dry tree, could never have brought forth fruit unto
          life without the voluntary rain from above. For our bodies have
          received unity among themselves by means of that laver which leads to
          incorruption; but our souls, by means of the Spirit. Wherefore both
          are necessary, since both contribute towards the life of God, our Lord
          compassionating that erring Samaritan woman -- who did not remain with
          one husband, but committed fornication by [contracting] many marriages
          -- by pointing out, and promising to her living water, so that she
          should thirst no more, nor occupy herself in acquiring the refreshing
          water obtained by labour, having in herself water springing up to
          eternal life. The Lord, receiving this as a gift from His Father, does
          Himself also confer it upon those who are partakers of Himself,
          sending the Holy Spirit upon all the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Gideon, that Israelite whom God chose, that he might save the
          people of Israel from the power of foreigners, foreseeing this
          gracious gift, changed his request, and prophesied that there would be
          dryness upon the fleece of wool (a type of the people), on which alone
          at first there had been dew; thus indicating that they should no
          longer have the Holy Spirit from God, as saith Esaias, "I will also
          command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it," but that the dew,
          which is the Spirit of God, who descended upon the Lord, should be
          diffused throughout all the earth, "the spirit of wisdom and
          understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
          knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of God." This Spirit,
          again, He did confer upon the Church, sending throughout all the world
          the Comforter from heaven, from whence also the Lord tells us that the
          devil, like lightning, was cast down. Wherefore we have need of the
          dew of God, that we be not consumed by fire, nor be rendered
          unfruitful, and that where we have an accuser there we may have also
          an Advocate, the Lord commending to the Holy Spirit His own man, who
          had fallen among thieves, whom He Himself compassionated, and bound up
          his wounds, giving two royal denaria; so that we, receiving by the
          Spirit the image and superscription of the Father and the Son, might
          cause the denarium entrusted to us to be fruitful, counting out the
          increase [thereof] to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Spirit, therefore, descending under the predestined
          dispensation, and the Son of God, the Only-begotten, who is also the
          Word of the Father, coming in the fulness of time, having become
          incarnate in man for the sake of man, and fulfilling all the
          conditions of human nature, our Lord Jesus Christ being one and the
          same, as He Himself the Lord doth testify, as the apostles confess,
          and as the prophets announce, -- all the doctrines of these men who
          have invented putative Ogdoads and Tetrads, and imagined subdivisions
          [of the Lord's person], have been proved falsehoods. These men do, in
          fact, set the Spirit aside altogether; they understand that Christ was
          one and Jesus another; and they teach that there was not one Christ,
          but many. And if they speak of them as united, they do again separate
          them: for they show that one did indeed undergo sufferings, but that
          the other remained impassible; that the one truly did ascend to the
          Pleroma, but the other remained in the intermediate place; that the
          one does truly feast and revel in places invisible and above all name,
          but that the other is seated with the Demiurge, emptying him of power.
          It will therefore be incumbent upon thee, and all others who give
          their attention to this writing, and are anxious about their own
          salvation, not readily to express acquiescence when they hear abroad
          the speeches of these men: for, speaking things resembling the
          [doctrine of the] faithful, as I have already observed, not only do
          they hold opinions which are different, but absolutely contrary, and
          in all points full of blasphemies, by which they destroy those persons
          who, by reason of the resemblance of the words, imbibe a poison which
          disagrees with their constitution, just as if one, giving lime mixed
          with water for milk, should mislead by the similitude of the colour;
          as a man superior to me has said, concerning all that in any way
          corrupt the things of God and adulterate the truth, "Lime is wickedly
          mixed with the milk of God."<br />
