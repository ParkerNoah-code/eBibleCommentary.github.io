          15. And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings
          of the earth thy glory.16. For Jehovah hath built up Zion, and hath
          appeared in his glory.17. He hath regarded the prayer of the solitary,
          and hath not despised their prayers. 18. This shall be registered for
          the generation that is to come: and the people to be created shall
          praise him.

          15. And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah The prophet here
          describes the fruit which would result from the deliverance of the
          ancient tribes; which is, that thereby God's glory would be rendered
          illustrious among nations and kings. He tacitly intimates, that when
          the Church is oppressed, the Divine glory is at the same time debased;
          even as the God of Israel was, no doubt, at the period referred to,
          derided by the ungodly, as if he had been destitute of the power to
          succor his people. It is therefore declared, that if he redeem them,
          it will afford such a remarkable proof of his power as to constrain
          the Gentiles to reverence him whom they contemned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concluding part of the 16th verse, He hath appeared in his glory,
          refers to the manifestation which God made of himself when he brought
          forth his Church from the darkness of death; even as it is said in
          another place concerning her first deliverance, |Judah was his
          sanctuary, and Israel his dominions| (Psalm 114:2) In like manner in
          the present passage, by again gathering to himself his people who were
          dispersed, and by raising his Church, as it were, from death to life,
          he appeared in his glory. It is surely no ordinary consolation to know
          that the love of God towards us is so great, that he will have his
          glory to shine forth in our salvation. It is true, that when the pious
          Jews were in the midst of their afflictions, the working of divine
          power was hidden from them; but they nevertheless always beheld it by
          the eye of faith, and in the mirror of the divine promises.

          17 He hath regarded the prayer of the solitary It is worthy of notice,
          that the deliverance of the chosen tribes is ascribed to the prayers
          of the faithful. God's mercy was indeed the sole cause which led him
          to deliver his Church, according as he had graciously promised this
          blessing to her; but to stir up true believers to greater earnestness
          in prayer, he promises that what he has purposed to do of his own good
          pleasure, he will grant in answer to their requests. Nor is there any
          inconsistency between these two truths, that God preserves the Church
          in the exercise of his free mercy, and that he preserves her in answer
          to the prayers of his people; for as their prayers are connected with
          the free promises, the effect of the former depends entirely upon the
          latter. When it is said, that the prayers of the solitary were heard,
          it is not to be understood of one man only, (for in the clause
          immediately following, the plural number is used;) but all the Jews,
          so long as they remained ejected from their own country, and lived as
          exiles in a strange land, are called solitary, because, although the
          countries of Assyria and Chaldea were remarkably fertile and
          delightful, yet these wretched captives, as I have previously
          observed, wandered there as in a wilderness. And as at that time this
          solitary people obtained favor by sighing, so now when the faithful
          are scattered, and are without their regular assemblies, the Lord will
          hear their groanings in this desolate dispersion, provided they all
          with one consent, and with unfeigned faith, earnestly breathe after
          the restoration of the Church.

          18. This shall be registered for the generation that is to come The
          Psalmist magnifies still more the fruit of the deliverance of his
          people, for the purpose of encouraging himself and others in the hope
          of obtaining the object of their prayers. He intimates, that this will
          be a memorable work of God, the praise of which shall be handed down
          to succeeding ages. Many things are worthy of praise, which are soon
          forgotten; but the prophet distinguishes between the salvation of the
          Church, for which he makes supplication, and common benefits. By the
          word register, he means that the history of this would be worthy of
          having a place in the public records, that the remembrance of it might
          be transmitted to future generations. There is in the words a
          beautiful contrast between the new creation of the people and the
          present destruction; of which interpreters improperly omit to take any
          notice. When the people were expelled from their country, the Church
          was in a manner extinguished. Her very name might seem to be dead,
          when the Jews were mingled among the heathen nations, and no longer
          constituted a distinct and united body. Their return was accordingly
          as it were a second birth. Accordingly, the prophet with propriety
          expects a new creation. Although the Church had perished, he was
          persuaded that God, by his wonderful power, would make her rise again
          from death to renovated life. This is a remarkable passage, showing
          that the Church is not always so preserved, as to continue to outward
          appearance to survive, but that when she seems to be dead, she is
          suddenly created anew, whenever it so pleases God. Let no desolation,
          therefore, which befalls the Church, deprive us of the hope, that as
          God once created the world out of nothing, so it is his proper work to
          bring forth the Church from the darkness of death.<br />
