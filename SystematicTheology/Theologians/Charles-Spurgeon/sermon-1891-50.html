          1. But if they will not yield assent to any one of these conclusions,
          since in that case they would be proved by us as incapable of
          rendering any reason for such a production of their Pleroma, they will
          of necessity be shut up to this -- that they confess that, above the
          Pleroma, there was some other system more spiritual and more powerful,
          after the image of which their Pleroma was formed. For if the Demiurge
          did not of himself construct that figure of creation which exists, but
          made it after the form of those things which are above, then from whom
          did their Bythus -- who, to be sure, brought it about that the Pleroma
          should be possessed of a configuration of this kind -- receive the
          figure of those things which existed before Himself? For it must needs
          be, either that the intention [of creating] dwelt in that god who made
          the world, so that of his own power, and from himself, he obtained the
          model of its formation; or, if any departure is made from this being,
          then there will arise a necessity for constantly asking whence there
          came to that one who is above him the configuration of those things
          which have been made; what, too, was the number of the productions;
          and what the substance of the model itself? If, however, it was in the
          power of Bythus to impart of himself such a configuration to the
          Pleroma, then why may it not have been in the power of the Demiurge to
          form of himself such a world as exists? And then, again, if creation
          be an image of those things [above], why should we not affirm that
          those are, in turn, images of others above them, and those above these
          again, of others, and thus go on supposing innumerable images of
          images?

          2. This difficulty presented itself to Basilides after he had utterly
          missed the truth, and was conceiving that, by an infinite succession
          of those beings that were formed from one another, he might escape
          such perplexity. When he had proclaimed that three hundred and
          sixty-five heavens were formed through succession and similitude by
          one another, and that a manifest proof [of the existence] of these was
          found in the number of the days of the year, as I stated before; and
          that above these there was a power which they also style Unnameable,
          and its dispensation -- he did not even in this way escape such
          perplexity. For, when asked whence came the image of its configuration
          to that heaven which is above all, and from which he wishes the rest
          to be regarded as having been formed by means of succession, he will
          say, from that dispensation which belongs to the Unnameable. He must
          then say, either that the Unspeakable formed it of himself, or he will
          find it necessary to acknowledge that there is some other power above
          this being, from whom his unnameable One derived such vast numbers of
          configurations as do, according to him, exist.

          3. How much safer and more accurate a course is it, then, to confess
          at once that which is true: that this God, the Creator, who formed the
          world, is the only God, and that there is no other God besides Him --
          He Himself receiving from Himself the model and figure of those things
          which have been made -- than that, after wearying ourselves with such
          an impious and circuitous description, we should be compelled, at some
          point or another, to fix the mind on some One, and to confess that
          from Him proceeded the configuration of things created.

          4. As to the accusation brought against us by the followers of
          Valentinus, when they declare that we continue in that Hebdomad which
          is below, as if we could not lift our minds on high, nor understand
          those things which are above, because we do not accept their monstrous
          assertions: this very charge do the followers of Basilides bring in
          turn against them, inasmuch as they (the Valentinians) keep circling
          about those things which are below, [going] as far as the first and
          second Ogdoad, and because they unskilfully imagine that, immediately
          after the thirty Æons, they have discovered Him who is above all
          things Father, not following out in thought their investigations to
          that Pleroma which is above the three hundred and sixty-five heavens,
          which is above forty-five Ogdoads. And any one, again, might bring
          against them the same charge, by imagining four thousand three hundred
          and eighty heavens, or Æons, since the days of the year contain that
          number of hours. If, again, some one adds also the nights, thus
          doubling the hours which have been mentioned, imagining that [in this
          way] he has discovered a great multitude of Ogdoads, and a kind of
          innumerable company of Æons, and thus, in opposition to Him who is
          above all things Father, conceiving himself more perfect than all
          [others], he will bring the same charge against all, inasmuch as they
          are not capable of rising to the conception of such a multitude of
          heavens or Æons as he has announced, but are either so deficient as to
          remain among those things which are below, or continue in the
          intermediate space.<br />
