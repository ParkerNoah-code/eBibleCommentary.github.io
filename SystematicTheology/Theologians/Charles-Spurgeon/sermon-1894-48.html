        <p>Prelude to the Rhapsody of 'Zion Redeemed'</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>JEHOVAH</p>
        <p>
          Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably
          to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that
          her iniquity is pardoned; that she hath received of the LORD'S hand
          double for all her sins.
        </p>
        <p>[Voices carry on the tidings across the desert to Jerusalem</p>
        <p>A VOICE OF ONE CRYING</p>
        <p>
          Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of the LORD,<br />Make straight
          in the desert a high way for our God. Every valley shall be
          exalted,<br />And every mountain and hill shall be made low:<br />And
          the crooked shall be made straight,<br />And the rough places
          plain:<br />And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,<br />And all
          flesh shall see it together:<br />For the mouth of the LORD hath
          spoken it.
        </p>
        <p>A SECOND VOICE (in the distance)</p>
        <p>Cry!</p>
        <p>A DESPAIRING VOICE</p>
        <p>
          What shall I cry?<br />All flesh is grass,<br />And all the goodliness
          thereof is as the flower of the field: The grass withereth,<br />The
          flower fadeth,<br />Because the breath of the LORD bloweth upon it:<br />Surely
          the people is grass!
        </p>
        <p>THE SECOND VOICE</p>
        <p>
          The grass withereth,<br />The flower fadeth:<br />But the word of our
          God shall stand for ever.
        </p>
        <p>FOURTH VOICE (still more distant)</p>
        <p>
          O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion,<br />Get thee up into the
          high mountain;<br />O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem,<br />Lift
          up thy voice with strength;<br />Lift it up, be not afraid;<br />Say
          unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
        </p>
        <p>FIFTH VOICE</p>
        <p>
          Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a mighty one,<br />And his arm shall
          rule for him:<br />Behold, his reward is with him,<br />And his
          recompence before him.<br />He shall feed his flock like a
          shepherd,<br />He shall gather the lambs in his arm,<br />And carry
          them in his bosom,<br />And shall gently lead those that give suck.
