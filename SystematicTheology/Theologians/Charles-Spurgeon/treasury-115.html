 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">TITLE. There is no title to this psalm—but it is an 
    alphabetical hymn of praise, having for its subject the works of the Lord in
    <i>creation</i>, <i>providence</i>, and <i>grace</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The sweet singer dwells upon the one idea that God should 
    be known by his people, and that this knowledge when turned into practical 
    piety is man's true wisdom, and the certain cause of lasting adoration. </p>
<p align="justify">Many are ignorant of what their Creator has done, and 
    hence they are foolish in heart, and silent as to the praises of God: this 
    evil can only be removed by a remembrance of God's works, and a diligent 
    study of them; to this, therefore, the psalm is meant to arouse us. It may 
    be called: "The Psalm of God's Works" intended to excite us to the work of 
    praise.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. The psalmist begins with an invitation to 
    praise, Verse 1; </p>
<p align="justify">and then proceeds to furnish us with matter for adoration 
    in God's works and his dealings with his people, Verses 2-9. </p>
<p align="justify">He closes his song with a commendation of the worship of 
    the Lord, and of the men who practice it.</p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Praise the LORD!</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or, Hallelujah! All you his saints unite in adoring 
    Jehovah, who works so gloriously. Do it now, do it always, do it heartily, 
    do it unanimously, do it eternally. Even if others refuse, take care that 
    you have always a song for your God. Put away all doubt, question, 
    murmuring, and rebellion, and give yourselves up to the praising of Jehovah, 
    both with your <i>lips </i>and in your <i>lives</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will praise the Lord with my whole heart. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The sweet singer commences the song, for his heart is all 
    on flame. Whether others will follow him or not, he will at once begin and 
    long continue. <i>What we preach we should practice</i>. <i>The best way to 
    enforce an exhortation is to set an example</i>. But we must let that 
    example be of the best kind, or we may lead others to do the work in a 
    limping manner. David brought nothing less than his whole heart to the duty; 
    all his love went out towards God, and all his zeal, his skill, and his 
    ardor went with it. </p>
<p align="justify">Jehovah the one and undivided God cannot be acceptably 
    praised with a divided heart, neither should we attempt so to dishonor him; 
    for our whole heart is little enough for his glory, and there can be no 
    reason why it should not all be lifted up in his praise. All his works are 
    praiseworthy, and therefore all our nature should adore him. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Whether with few or with many he would pour forth his 
    whole heart and soul in praise, and whether the company was made up of 
    select spirits or of the general mass of the people he would continue in the 
    same exercise. For the choicest society there can be no better engagement 
    than praise, and for the general assembly nothing can be more fitting.</p>
<p align="justify">For the church and for the congregation, for the family 
    or the community, for the private chamber of pious friendship, or the great 
    hall of popular meeting, the praise of the Lord is suitable; and at the very 
    least the true heart should sing hallelujah in any and every place. </p>
<p align="justify">Why should we fear the presence of men? The best of men 
    will join us in our song, and if the common sort, will not do so, our 
    example will be a needed rebuke to them. In any case let us praise God, 
    whether the hearers be a little band of saints or a mixed multitude. Come, 
    dear reader, he who pens this comment is in his heart magnifying the 
    Lord—will you not pause for a moment and join in the delightful exercise?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. The works of the LORD are great. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In design, in size, in number, in excellence, all the 
    works of the Lord are great. <i>Even the little things of God are great</i>. 
    In some point of view or other each one of the productions of his power, or 
    the deeds of his wisdom, will appear to be great to the wise in heart. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Sought out by all those who have pleasure therein. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Those who love their Maker delight in his handiwork, they 
    perceive that there is more in them than appears upon the surface, and 
    therefore they bend their minds to study and understand them. </p>
<p align="justify">The devout naturalist ransacks nature, the earnest 
    student of history pries into hidden facts and dark stories, and the <i>man 
    of God digs into the mines of Scripture, and hoards up each grain of its 
    golden truth</i>. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">God's </p></i>works are worthy of our researches, they yield 
    us <i>instruction </i>and <i>pleasure </i>wonderfully blended, and they grow 
    upon us, appearing to be far greater, after investigation than before. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Men's </p></i>works are noble from a distance; God's works 
    are great when sought out. Delitzsch reads the passage, "Worthy of being 
    sought after in all their purposes," and this also is a grand truth, for the 
    end and design which God has in all that he makes or does is equally 
    admirable with the work itself. The hidden wisdom of God is the most 
    marvelous part of his works, and hence those who do not look below the 
    surface miss the best part of what he would teach us. Because the works are 
    great they cannot be seen all at once—but must be looked into with care, and 
    this seeking out is of essential service to us by educating our faculties, 
    and strengthening our spiritual eye gradually to bear the light of the 
    divine glory. 
<p align="justify">It is well for us that all things cannot be seen at a 
    glance, for the search into their mysteries is as useful to us as the 
    knowledge which we thereby attain. The history of the Lord's dealings with 
    his people is especially a fit subject for the meditation of reverent minds 
    who find therein a sweet solace, and a never failing source of delight.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. His work is honorable and glorious. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His one special work, the salvation of his people, is 
    here mentioned as distinguished from his many other works. This reflects 
    honor and glory upon him. It is deservedly the theme of the highest praise, 
    and compels those who understand it and experience it to ascribe all honor 
    and glory unto the Lord. Its conception, its sure foundations, its gracious 
    purpose, its wise arrangements, its gift of Jesus as Redeemer, its 
    application of redemption by the Holy Spirit in regeneration and 
    sanctification, and all else which make up the one glorious whole 
    salvation—all redound to the infinite honor of Him who contrived and carried 
    out so astounding a method of salvation. </p>
<p align="justify">No other work can be compared with it: it honors both the 
    Savior and the saved, and while it brings glory to God it also brings us to 
    glory. There is none like the <i>God of Jeshurun</i>, and there is no 
    salvation like that which he has wrought for his people. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his righteousness endures forever. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In the work of grace righteousness is not forgotten, nor 
    deprived of its glory; rather, it is honored in the eyes of the intelligent 
    universe. The bearing of guilt by our great Substitute proved that not even 
    to effect the purposes of his grace, would the Lord forget his 
    righteousness; no future strain upon his justice can ever be equal to that 
    which it has already sustained in the bruising of his dear Son; it must 
    henceforth assuredly endure forever. </p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, the righteousness of God in the whole plan can 
    never now be suspected of failure, for all that it requires is already 
    performed, its demands are satisfied by <i>the double deed of our Lord in 
    enduring the vengeance due, and in rendering perfect obedience to the law</i>.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Caprice does not enter into the government of the Lord, 
    the rectitude of it is and must forever be beyond all question. In no single 
    deed of God can unrighteousness be found, nor shall there ever be: this is 
    the very glory of his work, and even its adversaries cannot gainsay it. Let 
    believers, therefore, praise him evermore, and never blush to speak of that 
    work which is so honorable and glorious.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. He has made his wonderful works to be 
    remembered. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He meant them to remain in the recollection of his 
    people, and they do so. Partly because they are in themselves memorable, and 
    because also he has taken care to record them by the pen of inspiration, and 
    has written them upon the hearts of his people by his Holy Spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">By the ordinances of the Mosaic law, the coming out of 
    Egypt, the sojourn in the wilderness, and other memorabilia of Israel's 
    history were constantly brought before the minds of the people, and their 
    children were by such means instructed in the wonders which God had wrought 
    in old time. </p>
<p align="justify">Deeds such as God has wrought are not to be admired for 
    an hour and then forgotten, they are meant to be perpetual signs and 
    instructive tokens to all coming generations; and especially are they 
    designed to confirm the faith of his people in the divine love, and to make 
    them know that <b>the Lord is gracious and full of compassion</b>. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">They need not fear to trust his grace for the future, for 
    they remember it in the past.</p></i> Grace is as conspicuous as righteousness 
    in the great work of God; yes, a fullness of tender love is seen in all that 
    he has done. He treats his people with great consideration for their 
    weakness and infirmity; having the same pity for them as a father has 
    towards his children. Should we not praise him for this? 
<i>
<p align="justify">A silver thread of loving-kindness runs through the 
    entire fabric of God's work of salvation and providence, and never once is 
    it left out in the whole piece.</p></i> Let the memories of his saints bear 
    witness to this fact with grateful joy.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. He has given food unto those who fear him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or spoil, as some read it, for the Lord's people both in 
    coming out of Egypt and at other times have been enriched from their 
    enemies. Not only in the wilderness with manna—but <i>everywhere else by his 
    providence he has supplied the necessities of his believing people</i>. 
    Somewhere or other they have had food necessary for them, and that in times 
    of great scarcity. </p>
<p align="justify">As for spiritual food, that has been plentifully 
    furnished them in Christ Jesus; they have been fed with the finest of the 
    wheat, and made to feast on royal dainties. <i>His word is as nourishing to 
    the soul as bread to the body, and there is such an abundance of it that no 
    heir of Heaven shall ever be famished. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom, since it secures to 
    a man the supply of all that he needs for soul and body. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He will ever be mindful of his covenant.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">He could not let his people lack food because he was in 
    covenant with them, and they can never want in the future, for he will 
    continue to act upon the terms of that covenant. No promise of the Lord 
    shall fall to the ground, nor will any part of the great compact of eternal 
    love be revoked or allowed to sink into oblivion. </p>
<p align="justify">The covenant of grace is the plan of the great work which 
    the Lord works out for his people, and it will never be departed from. The 
    Lord has set his hand and seal to it, his glory and honor are involved in 
    it—yes, his very name hangs upon it, and he will not even in the least jot 
    or tittle cease to be mindful of it. </p>
<p align="justify">Of this the feeding of his people is the pledge—he would 
    not so continually supply their needs if he meant after all to destroy them. 
    Upon this most blessed pledge let us settle our minds; let us rest in the 
    faithfulness of the Lord, and praise him with all our hearts every time that 
    we eat bread or feed upon his word.</p>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. He has showed his people the power of his works.
    </p>
<p align="justify">They have seen what he is able to do and what force he is 
    prepared to put forth on their behalf. This power Israel saw in physical 
    works, and we in spiritual wonders, for we behold the matchless energy of 
    the Holy Spirit and feel it in our own souls. </p>
<p align="justify">In times of dire distress the Lord has put forth such 
    energy of grace that we have been astonished at his power. This was part of 
    his intent in bringing us into such conditions that he might reveal to us 
    the arm of his strength. Could we ever have known it so well if we had not 
    been in pressing need of his help? <i>We may well turn this verse into a 
    prayer </i>and ask to see more and more the power of the Lord at work among 
    us in these latter days. </p>
<p align="justify">O Lord, let us now see how mightily you can work in the
    <i>saving </i>of sinners and in preserving and delivering your own people.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That he may give them the heritage of the heathen. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He put forth all his power to drive out the Canaanites 
    and bring in his people. Even thus may it please his infinite wisdom to give 
    to his church the heathen for her inheritance in the name of Jesus. Nothing 
    but great power can effect this—but it will surely be accomplished in due 
    season.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. The works of his hands are verity and judgment.
    </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Truth </p></i>and <i>justice </i>are conspicuous in all that 
    Jehovah does. Nothing like artifice or crooked policy can ever be seen in 
    his proceedings; he acts faithfully and righteously towards his people, and 
    with justice and impartiality to all mankind. <i>This also should lead us to 
    praise him, since it is of the utmost advantage to us to live under a 
    sovereign whose laws, decrees, acts, and deeds are the essence of truth and 
    justice.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">All his commandments are sure.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">All that he has appointed or decreed shall surely stand, 
    and his precepts which he has proclaimed shall be found worthy of our 
    obedience, for surely they are founded in justice and are meant for our 
    lasting good. </p>
<p align="justify">He is no fickle despot, commanding one thing one day and 
    another another—but his commands remain absolutely unaltered, their 
    necessity equally unquestionable, their excellence permanently proven, and 
    their reward eternally secure. </p>
<p align="justify">Take the word commandments to relate either to his 
    decrees or his precepts, and we have in each case an important sense; but it 
    seems more in accordance with the connection to take the first sense and 
    consider the words to refer to the ordinances, appointments, or decrees of 
    the great King.</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever the mighty Lord decrees,<br/>
    Shall stand forever sure.<br/>
    The settled purpose of his heart<br/>
    To ages shall endure!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. They stand fast forever and ever. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">That is to say, his purposes, commands, and courses of 
    action. The Lord is not swayed by transient motives, or moved by the 
    circumstances of the hour. Immutable principles rule in the courts of 
    Jehovah, and he pursues his eternal purposes without the shadow of a 
    turning. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Our works</p></i> are too often as wood, hay, and stubble—but
    <i>his doings </i>are as gold, silver, and precious stones. We take up a 
    purpose for a while and then exchange it for another—but he is of one mind, 
    and none can turn him. He acts in eternity and for eternity, and hence what 
    he works abides forever. 
<p align="justify">Much of this lasting character arises out of the fact 
    which is next mentioned, namely, that <b>they are done in truth and 
    uprightness</b>. Nothing stands but that which is upright. Falsehood soon 
    vanishes, for it is a mere show—but truth has salt in it which preserves it 
    from decay.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">God always acts according to the glorious principles of 
    truth and integrity, and hence there is no need of alteration or revocation; 
    his works will endure until the end of time.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. He sent redemption unto his people. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When they were in Egypt he sent not only a deliverer—but 
    an actual deliverance; not only a redeemer—but complete redemption. He has 
    done the like spiritually for all his people, having first by <i>blood 
    purchased </i>them out of the hand of the enemy, and then by <i>power 
    rescued </i>them from the bondage of their sins. Redemption we can sing of 
    as an accomplished act: it has been wrought for us, sent to us, and enjoyed 
    by us, and we are in very deed the Lord's redeemed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He has commanded his covenant forever. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His divine decree has made the covenant of his grace a 
    settled and eternal institution. Redemption by blood proves that the 
    covenant cannot be altered, for it ratifies and establishes it beyond all 
    recall. </p>
<p align="justify">This, too, is reason for the loudest praise. Redemption 
    is a fit theme for the heartiest music, and when it is seen to be connected 
    with gracious engagements from which the Lord's truth cannot swerve, it 
    becomes a subject fitted to arouse the soul to an ecstasy of gratitude. 
    Redemption and the covenant are enough to make the tongue of the dumb sing!
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Holy and reverend is his name. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Well may he say this. The whole name or character of God 
    is worthy of profoundest awe, for it is perfect and complete, whole or holy.<i> 
    It ought not to be spoken without solemn thought, and never heard without 
    profound homage. </i>His name is to be trembled at, it is something very 
    solemn; even those who know him best rejoice with trembling before him. </p>
<p align="justify">How religious men can endure to be called "reverend" we 
    know not. Being unable to discover any reason why our fellow men should 
    reverence <i>us</i>—we half suspect that in other men there is not very much 
    which can entitle them to be called reverend, very reverend, right reverend, 
    and so on. It may seem a trifling matter—but for that very reason we would 
    urge that the foolish custom should be allowed to fall into disuse.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of 
    wisdom. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is its first principle—but it is also its head and 
    chief attainment. The word "beginning" in Scripture sometimes means the <i>
    chief</i>; and true religion is at once the first element of wisdom, and its 
    chief fruit. <i>To know God so as to walk aright before him is the greatest 
    of all the applied sciences. </i>Holy reverence of God leads us to praise 
    him, and this is the point which the psalm drives at, for it is a wise act 
    on the part of a creature towards his Creator. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">A good understanding have all those who do his 
    commandments.</p></b> Obedience to God proves that our judgment is sound. Why 
    should he not be obeyed? Does not reason itself claim obedience for the Lord 
    of all? Only a man void of understanding will ever justify rebellion against 
    the holy God. <i>Practical godliness is the test of wisdom. </i>Men may know 
    and be very orthodox, they may talk and be very eloquent, they may speculate 
    and be very profound; but the best proof of their intelligence must be found 
    in their actually doing the will of the Lord. 
<p align="justify">The former part of the psalm taught us the doctrine of 
    God's nature and character, by describing his works. The second part 
    supplies the practical lesson by drawing the inference that to worship and 
    obey him is the dictate of true wisdom. We joyfully own that it is so. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">His praise endures forever. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">The praises of God will never cease, because his works 
    will always excite adoration, and it will always be the wisdom of men to 
    extol their glorious Lord.</p></i> 
<p align="justify">Some regard this sentence as referring to those who fear 
    the Lord—their praise shall endure forever. Indeed, it is true that those 
    who lead obedient lives shall obtain honor of the Lord, and commendations 
    which will abide forever. A word of approbation from the mouth of God will 
    be a medal of honor which will outshine all the decorations which kings and 
    emperors can bestow. Lord, help us to study your works, and henceforth to 
    breathe out hallelujahs as long as we live.</p>
