        <p>The Mystery</p>
        <p>THE PROPHET</p>
        <p>
          O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto
          thee of violence, and thou wilt not save. Why dost thou shew me
          iniquity, and cause me to look upon perverseness? for spoiling and
          violence are before me: and there is strife, and contention riseth up.
          Therefore the law is slacked, and judgement doth never go forth: for
          the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore judgement goeth
          forth perverted.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for
          I work a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be
          told you. For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
          nation; which march through the breadth of the earth, to possess
          dwelling places that are not theirs. They are terrible and dreadful:
          their judgement and their dignity proceed from themselves. Their
          horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the
          evening wolves; and their horsemen bear themselves proudly: yea, their
          horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.
          They come all of them for violence; their faces are set eagerly as the
          east wind; and they gather captives as the sand. Yea, he scoffeth at
          kings, and princes are a derision unto him: he derideth every strong
          hold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it. Then shall he sweep by as
          a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty: even he whose might is his
          god.
        </p>
        <p>THE PROPHET</p>
        <p>
          Art not thou from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? thou
          diest not. O LORD, thou hast ordained him for judgement; and thou, O
          Rock, hast established him for correction. Thou that art of purer eyes
          than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness,
          wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest
          thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous
          than he; and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
          things, that have no ruler over them? He taketh up all of them with
          the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his
          drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad. Therefore he sacrificeth
          unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his
          portion is fat, and his meat plenteous. Shall he therefore empty his
          net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?
        </p>
        <p>ii</p>
        <p>The Solution</p>
        <p>THE PROPHET</p>
        <p>
          I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look
          forth to see what he will speak by me, and what I shall answer
          concerning my complaint.
        </p>
        <p>THE LORD</p>
        <p>
          Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that
          readeth it. For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it
          hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for
          it; because it will surely come, it will not delay. Behold, his soul
          is puffed up, it is not upright in him: but the just shall live in his
          faithfulness. Yea, moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer, a haughty
          man, and that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as hell,
          and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
          all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples. Shall not all these
          take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and
          say:
        </p>
        <p>Doom of the Chaldeans</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>
          Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his,<br />
          -- How long? -- <br />And that ladeth himself with pledges!
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall exact usury of thee, and
          awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
          Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the peoples
          shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to
          the land, to the city, and to all that dwell therein.
        </p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>
          Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, That he may set
          his nest on high,<br />That he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many peoples,
          and hast sinned against thy soul. For the stone shall cry out of the
          wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
        </p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>
          Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood,<br />And stablisheth a
          city by iniquity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the peoples labour for the
          fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity? For the earth shall
          be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters
          cover the sea.
        </p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p>
          Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink,<br />That addest thy
          venom thereto,<br />And makest him drunken also,<br />That thou mayest
          look on their nakedness!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and be as one
          uncircumcised. The cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto
          thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory. For the violence done to
          Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts which made
          them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the
          land, to the city, and to all that dwell therein.
        </p>
        <p>5</p>
        <p>
          What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven
          it; the molten image, and the teacher of lies, that the maker of his
          work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? --
        </p>
        <p>
          Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake;<br />To the dumb stone,
          Arise!
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall this teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and
          there is no breath at all in the midst of it. But the LORD is in his
          holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him!
        </p>
        <p>iii</p>
        <p>Jehovah come to Judgment</p>
        <p>Prelude</p>
        <p>
          O LORD, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O LORD, revive
          thy work in the midst of the years,<br />In the midst of the years
          make it known:<br />In wrath remember mercy!
        </p>
        <p>Strophe</p>
        <p>
          God cometh from Teman,<br />And the Holy One from Mount Paran.<br />His
          glory covereth the heavens,<br />And the earth is full of his
          praise.<br />And his brightness is as the light;<br />He hath rays
          coming forth from his hand;<br />And there is the hiding of his
          power.<br />Before him goeth the pestilence,<br />And fiery bolts go
          forth at his feet.<br />He standeth and shaketh the earth;<br />He
          beholdeth, and driveth asunder the nations:<br />And the eternal
          mountains are scattered,<br />The everlasting hills do bow;<br />His
          ways are everlasting.<br />I see the tents of Cushan in affliction;<br />The
          curtains of the land of Midian do tremble.
        </p>
        <p>Antistrophe</p>
        <p>
          Is the LORD displeased against the rivers?<br />Is thine anger against
          the rivers, or thy wrath against the sea, That thou dost ride upon
          thine horses,<br />Upon thy chariots of salvation?<br />Thy bow is
          made quite bare,<br />Sworn are the chastisements of thy word.<br />Thou
          dost cleave the earth with rivers;<br />The mountains see thee and are
          afraid;<br />The tempest of waters passeth by;<br />The deep uttereth
          his voice,<br />And lifteth up his hands on high;<br />The sun and
          moon stand still in their habitation<br />At the light of thine arrows
          as they go,<br />At the shining of thy glittering spear.<br />Thou
          dost march through the land in indignation,<br />Thou dost thresh the
          nations in anger.
        </p>
        <p>Epode</p>
        <p>
          Thou art come for the salvation of thy people,<br />For the salvation
          of thine anointed:<br />Thou dost smite off the head from the house of
          the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck.<br />Thou
          dost pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: (They came
          as a whirlwind to scatter me,<br />Their rejoicing was as to devour
          the poor secretly:) Thou dost tread the sea with thine horses, the
          surge of mighty waters.
        </p>
        <p>Postlude</p>
        <p>
          I heard, and my belly trembled,<br />My lips quivered at the voice;<br />Rottenness
          entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place: That I should rest
          waiting for the day of trouble,<br />When he that shall invade them in
          troops cometh up against the people. For though the fig tree shall not
          blossom,<br />Neither shall fruit be in the vines;<br />The labour of
          the olive shall fail,<br />And the fields shall yield no meat;<br />The
          flock shall be cut off from the fold,<br />And there shall be no herd
          in the stalls:<br />Yet I will rejoice in the LORD,<br />I will joy in
          the God of my salvation.<br />Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength,<br />And
          he maketh my feet like hinds' feet,<br />And will make me to walk upon
          mine high places.
