        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.31)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 24, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>|With my soul have I desired thee in the night.| -- Isaiah 26:9.</p>
        <p>
          NIGHT APPEARS to be a time peculiarly favorable to devotion. Its
          solemn stillness helps to free the mind from that perpetual din which
          the cares of the world will bring around it; and the stars looking
          down from heaven upon us shine as if they would attract us up to God.
          I know not how you may be affected by the solemnities of midnight, but
          when I have sat alone musing on the great God and the mighty universe,
          I have felt that indeed I could worship him; for night seemed to be
          spread abroad as a very temple for adoration, while the moon walked as
          high priest, amid the stars, the worshippers, and I myself joined in
          that silent song which they sang unto God: |Great art thou, O God!
          great in thy works. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy
          fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained; what is man,
          that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest
          him?| I find that this sense of the power of midnight not only acts
          upon religious men, but there is a certain poet, whose character,
          perhaps, I could scarcely too much reprobate: a man very far from
          understanding true religion; one whom I may, I suppose, justly style
          an infidel a libertine of the worst order, and yet he says concerning
          night in one of his poems: --
        </p>
        <p>|Tis midnight on the mountains' brown,</p>
        <p>The cold round moon shines deeply down;</p>
        <p>Blue roll the waters, blue the sky</p>
        <p>Spreads like an ocean hung on high,</p>
        <p>Bespangled with those isles of light,</p>
        <p>So wildly, spiritually bright;</p>
        <p>Who ever gazed upon them shining,</p>
        <p>And turning to earth without repining,</p>
        <p>Nor wish'd for wings to flee away,</p>
        <p>And mix with their eternal ray.|</p>
        <p>
          Even with the most irreligious person, a man farthest from spiritual
          thought, it seems that there is some power in the grandeur and
          stillness of night to draw him up to God. I trust many of us can say,
          like David, |I have thought upon thee continually, I have mused upon
          thy name in the night watches, and with desire have I desired thee in
          the night.| But I leave that thought altogether. I shall not speak of
          night natural at all, although there may be a great deal of room for
          poetic thought and expression. I shall address myself to two orders of
          persons, and shall endeavor to show what I conceive to be the meaning
          of the text. May God make it useful to you both. First, I shall speak
          to confirmed Christians; and from this text I shall bring one or two
          remarks to bear upon their case, if they are in darkness. Second, I
          shall speak to newly awakened souls, and try if I can find some of
          them who can say, |With my soul have I desired thee in the night.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I am about to address this text to the more confirmed believer; and
          the first fact I shall educe from it -- the truth of which I am sure
          he will very readily admit -- is, that THE CHRISTIAN MAN HAS NOT
          ALWAYS A BRIGHT SHINING SUN: that he has seasons of darkness and of
          night. True, it is written in God's word, |Her ways are ways of
          pleasantness, and all her paths are peace;| and it is a great truth
          that religion -- the true religion of the living God -- is calculated
          to give a man happiness below as well as bliss above. But,
          notwithstanding, experience tells us that if the course of the just be
          |as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect
          day,| yet sometimes that light is eclipsed. At certain periods clouds
          and darkness cover the sun, and he beholds no clear shining of the
          daylight, but walks in darkness and sees no light. Now there are many
          who have rejoiced in the presence of God for a season; they have
          basked in the sunshine God has been pleased to give them in the
          earlier stages of their Christian career; they have walked along the
          |green pastures,| by the side of the |still waters,| and suddenly --
          in a month or two -- they find that glorious sky is clouded: instead
          of |green pastures,| they have to tread the sandy desert; in the place
          of |still waters,| they find streams brackish to their taste and
          bitter to their spirits, and they say, |Surely, if I were a child of
          God this would not happen.| Oh! say not so, thou who art walking in
          darkness. The best of God's saints have their nights; the dearest of
          his children have to walk through a weary wilderness. There is not a
          Christian who has enjoyed perpetual happiness, there is no believer
          who can always sing a song of joy. It is not every lark that can
          always carol. It is not every star that can always be seen. And not
          every Christian is always happy. Perhaps the King of Saints gave you a
          season of great joy at first because you were a raw recruit and he
          would not put you into the roughest part of the battle when you had
          first enlisted. You were a tender plant, and he nursed you in the
          hot-house till you could stand severe weather. You were a young child,
          and therefore he wrapped you in furs and clothed you in the softest
          mantle. But now you have become strong and the case is different.
          Capuan holidays do not suit Roman soldiers; and they would not agree
          with Christians. We need clouds and darkness to exercise our faith, to
          cut off self dependence, and make us put more faith in Christ, and
          less in evidence, less in experience, less in frames and feelings. The
          best of God's children -- I repeat it again for the comfort of those
          who are suffering depression of spirits -- have their nights.
          Sometimes it is a night over the whole church at once; and I fear we
          have very much of that night now. There are times when Zion is under a
          cloud, when the whole fine gold becomes dim, and the glory of Zion is
          departed. There are seasons when we do not hear the clear preaching of
          the word; when the doctrines are withheld; when the glory of the Lord
          God of Jacob is dim; when his name is not exalted; when the traditions
          of men are taught, instead of the inspirations of the Holy Ghost. And
          such a season is that when the whole church is dark. Of course each
          Christian participates in it. He goes about and weeps, and cries, |O
          God, how long shall poor Zion be depressed? How long shall her
          shepherds be dumb dogs that cannot bark?' Shall her watchmen be always
          blind? Shall the silver trumpet sound no more? Shall not the voice of
          the gospel be heard in her streets?| O! there are seasons of darkness
          to the entire church! God grant we may not have to pass through
          another! but that, starting from this period, the sun may rise ne'er
          to set, till, like a sea of glory, the light of brilliance shall
          spread from pole to pole!
        </p>
        <p>
          At other times, this darkness over the soul of the Christian rises
          from temporal distresses. He may have had a misfortune as it is called
          -- something has gone wrong in his business, or an enemy has done
          somewhat against him; death has struck down a favourite child --
          bereavement has snatched away the darling of his bosom, the crops are
          blighted; the winds refuse to bear his ships homeward; a vessel
          strikes upon a rock, another founders, all goes ill with him, and,
          like a gentle man who called to see me this week, he may be able to
          say, |Sir, I prospered far more when I was a worldly man than I have
          done since I have become a Christian: for, since then, everything has
          appeared to go wrong with me. I thought,| be said, |that religion had
          the promise of this life as well as of that which is to come.| I told
          him, Yes, it had; and so it should be in the end. But he must remember
          there was one great legacy which Christ left his people; and I was
          glad he had come in for a share of it -- |In the world ye shall have
          tribulation; in me ye shall have peace.| Yes! you may be troubled
          about this, you may be saying, |Look at so-and-so: see how he spreads
          himself like a green bay-tree. He is an extortioner and wicked man,
          yet everything he does prospers. You may even observe his death, and
          say, there are no bands in his death. |They are not in trouble as
          other men, neither are they plagued like other men.| Ah! beloved! ye
          are come into the sanctuary of God this morning, and now shall ye
          understand their end. God hath set them in slippery places, but he
          casteth them down to destruction. Better to have a Christian's days of
          sorrow, than a worldling's days of mirth. Better to have a Christian's
          sorrows than a worldling's joys. Ah! happier to be chained in a
          dungeon with a Paul than reign in the palace with an Ahab. Better to
          be a child of God in poverty than a child of Satan in riches. Cheer
          up, then, thou downcast spirit, if this be thy trial. Remember that
          many saints have passed through the same; and the best and most
          eminent believers have had their nights.
        </p>
        <p>
          |But oh!| says another, |you have not described my night, sir. I have
          not much amiss in business; and I would not care if I had -- but I
          have a night in my spirit.| |O sir,| says one, |I have not a single
          evidence of my Christianity now. I was a child of God, I know; but
          something tells me that I am none of his now. There was a season when
          I flattered myself that I knew something about godliness and God; but
          now I doubt whether I have any part or lot in the matter. Satan
          suggests that I must dwell in endless flames. I see no hope for me. I
          am afraid I am an hypocrite. I think I have imposed on the church and
          upon myself also. I fear I am none of his. When I turn over God's
          Scriptures there is no promise; when I look within, corruption is
          black before me. Then while others are commending me, I am accusing
          myself of all manner of sin and corruption. I could not have thought
          that I was half so bad. I am afraid there cannot have been a work of
          grace in my heart, or else I should not have so many corrupt
          imaginations, filthy desires, hard thoughts of God; so much pride, so
          much selfishness and self-will. I am afraid I am none of his.| Now,
          that is the very reason why you are one of his, that you are able to
          say that: for God's people pass through the night. They have their
          nights of sorrow. I love to hear a man talk like that. I would not
          have him do so always. He ought at times to enter into |the liberty
          where with Christ hath made him free.| But I know that frequently
          bondage will get hold of the spirit, But you say, |Surely no one ever
          suffers like that.| I confess I do myself constantly, and very often
          there are times when I could not prove my election in Jesus Christ,
          nor my adoption, though I rejoice that for the most part I can cry, --
        </p>
        <p>|A debtor to mercy alone</p>
        <p>Of covenant mercy I sing.|</p>
        <p>
          Yet at other seasons I am sure the meanest lamb in Jesu's fold I
          reckon ten thousand times more in advance than myself and if I might
          but sit down on the meanest bench in the kingdom of heaven, and did
          but know I was in, I would barter everything I had, and I do not
          believe there ever existed a Christian yet, who did not now and then
          doubt his interest in Jesus. I think, when a man says, |I never
          doubt,| it is quite time for us to doubt him, it is quite time for us
          to begin to say, |Ah, poor soul, I am afraid you are not on the road
          at all, for if you were, you would see so many things in yourself, and
          so much glory in Christ more than you deserve, that you would be so
          much ashamed of yourself, as even to say, It is too good to be true.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The first part then is fully established by experience, that
          Christian men very frequently have their nights. But the second thing
          here is that a Christian man's religion will keep its colour in the
          night. |With my soul have I desired thee in the night.| What a mighty
          deal of silver-slipper religion we have in this world. Men will follow
          Christ when every one cries |Hosanna! Hosanna!| The multitude will
          crowd around the man then, and they will take him by force and make
          him a king when the sun shines, when the soft wind blows. They are
          like the plants upon the rock, which sprang up and for a little while
          were green, but when the sun had risen with fervent heat straightway
          withered away. Demas and Mr. Hold-the-world, and a great many others,
          are very pious people in easy times. They will always go with Christ
          by daylight, and will keep in company so long as fashion gives
          religion the doubtful benefit of its patronage. But they will not go
          with him in the night. There are some goods whose colour you can only
          see by daylight -- and there are many professors the colour of whom
          you can only see by daylight. If they were in the night of trouble and
          persecution you would find that there was very little in them. They
          are good by daylight but they are bad by night. But, beloved, do you
          not know that the best test of a Christian is the night? The
          nightingale, if she would sing by day when every goose is cackling,
          would be reckoned no better a musician than the wren. A Christian if
          he only remained steadfast by daylight, when every coward is bold,
          what would he be? There would be no beauty in his courage, no glory in
          his bravery. But it is because he can sing at night -- sing in trouble
          -- sing when he is driven well nigh to despair; it is this which
          proves his sincerity. It has its glory in the night. The stars are not
          visible by daylight, but they become apparent when the sun is set.
          There is full many a Christian whose piety did not burn much when he
          was in prosperity; but it will be known in adversity. I have marked it
          in some of my brethren now present, when they were in deep trial not
          long ago. I had not heard them discourse much about Christ before, but
          when God's hand had robbed them of their comfort, I remember that I
          could discern their religion infinitely better than I could before.
          Nothing can bring our religion out better than that. Grind the diamond
          a little and you shall see it glisten. Do but put a trouble on the
          Christian, and his endurance of it will prove him to be of the true
          seed of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A third remark from this to the confirmed Christian is, all that
          the Christian wants in the night is his God. |With desire have I
          desired thee in the night.| By day there are many things that a
          Christian will desire besides his Lord; but in the night he wants
          nothing but his God. I cannot understand how it is unless it is to be
          accounted for by the corruption of our spirit, that when everything
          goes well with us we are setting our affection first on this object
          and -- then on another, and then on another; and that desire which is
          as insatiable as death and as deep as hell never rests satisfied. We
          are always wanting something, always desiring a yet beyond. But if you
          place a Christian in trouble you will find that he does not want gold
          then -- that he does not want carnal honour -- then he wants his God.
          I suppose he is like the sailor, when he sails along smoothly he loves
          to have fair weather, and wants this and that to amuse himself with on
          deck. But when the winds blow all that he wants is the haven. He does
          not desire anything else. The biscuit may be mouldy, but he does not
          care. The water may be brackish, but he does not care. He does not
          think of it in the storm. He only thinks about the haven then. It is
          just so with the Christian, when he is going along smoothly he wants
          this and that comfort; he is aspiring after this position, or is
          wanting to obtain this and that elevation. But let him once doubt his
          interest in Christ -- let him once get into some soul -- distress and
          trouble, so that it is very dark -- and all he will feel then is,
          |With desire have I desired thee in the night.| When the child is put
          upstairs to bed it may lie while the light is there, and look at the
          trees that shake against the window, and admire the stars that are
          coming out; but when it gets dark and the child is still awake it
          cries for its parent. It cannot be amused by aught else. So in
          daylight will the Christian look at anything. He will cast his eyes
          round on this pleasure and on that! but, when the darkness gathers, it
          is |My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?| |O why art thou so far
          from me and from the word of my roaring?| Then it is,
        </p>
        <p>|Give me Christ or else I die;</p>
        <p>These can never satisfy.|</p>
        <p>
          4. But now one more remark before I leave my address to confirmed
          saints. There are times when all the saints can do is to desire. We
          have a vast number of evidences of piety: some are practical, some are
          experimental, some are doctrinal; and the more evidences a man has of
          his piety the better, of course. We like a number of signatures, to
          make a deed more valid, if possible. We like to invest property in a
          great number of trustees, in order that it may be all the safer, and
          so we love to have many evidences. Many witnesses will carry our case
          at the bar better than a few: and so it is well to have many witnesses
          to testify to our piety. But there are seasons when a Christian cannot
          get any. He can get scarcely one witness to come and attest his
          godliness. He asks for good works to come and speak him. But there
          will be such a cloud of darkness about him, and his good works will
          appear so black that he will not dare to think of their evidences. He
          will say, |True, I hope this is the right fruit, I hope I have served
          God but I dare not plead these works as evidences.| He will have lost
          assurance and with it his enjoyment of communion with God. |I have had
          that fellowship with him,| perhaps he will say, and he will summon
          that communion to come and be an evidence. But he has forgotten it,
          and it does not come, and Satan whispers it is a fancy, and the poor
          evidence of communion has its mouth gagged, so that it cannot speak.
          But there is one witness that very seldom is gagged, and one that I
          trust the people of God can always apply, even in the night; and that
          is, |I have desired thee I have desired thee in the night.| |Yes,
          Lord, if I have not believed in thee, I have desired thee; and if I
          have not spent and been spent in thy service, yet one thing I know,
          and the devil cannot beat me out of it, I have desired thee -- that I
          do know -- and I have desired thee in the night, too, when no one saw
          me, when troubles were round about me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my beloved, I hope there are many of you here this morning who
          are strong in faith. You do not, perhaps, want what I have said; but I
          will advise you to take this cordial, and if you do not want to drink
          it now, put it up in a small phial, and carry it about with you till
          you do; you do not know how long it may before you are faint. And as
          Mr. Greatheart gave Christiana a bottle of wine to take with her that
          she might drink when she was fatigued, so you take this, and do not
          laugh at a poor despised believer because he is not so strong as
          yourself. You may want this yourself some day. I tell you there are
          times when a Christian will be ready to creep into a mousehole if he
          might but get into heaven; when he would be glad to throw anything
          away to get into the smallest crevice to escape from his fears; when
          the meanest evidence seems more precious than gold; when the very
          least ray of sunlight is worth all the riches of Peru; and when a doit
          of comfort is more sweet than a whole heaven of it may have been at
          other seasons. You may be brought into the same condition, so take
          this passage with you and have it ready -- have it ready to plead at
          the throne: |With desire have I desired thee in the night.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second part of my sermon is to be occupied by speaking to
          NEWLY AWAKENED SOULS; and as I have made four remarks to confirmed
          Christians, I will now endeavor to answer three questions to those who
          are newly awakened.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first question they would ask me is this. How am I to know that my
          desires are proofs of a work of grace in my soul? Some of you may say,
          I think I can go so far as the text -- I have desired God; I know I
          have desired to be saved. I have desired to have an interest in the
          blood of Jesus, but how am I to know that it is a desire sent of God,
          and how can I tell whether it will end in conversion? Hear me, then,
          while I offer one or two tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, you may tell whether your desires are of God by their
          constancy. Many a man when he hears a stirring sermon, has a very
          strong desire to be saved; but he goes home and forgets it. He is as a
          man who seeth his face in a glass, goeth away, and straightway
          forgetteth what manner of man he is. He returns again: once more the
          arrow sticks hard in the heart of the King's enemy; he goes home, only
          to extract the arrow, and his goodness is as the morning cloud; and as
          the early dew it passeth away. Has it been so with you? Have you had
          such a desire? Will to-morrow's business take it away? Are you wanting
          Christ to-day? and will ye despise him to-morrow? Then I am afraid
          your desires are not of God; they are merely the desires of a
          naturally awakened conscience, just the stirrings of mere nature, and
          they will go as far as nature can go, and no farther. But if your
          desires are constant ones take comfort. How long have they lasted?
          Have you been desiring Christ this last month or these last three or
          four months? Have you been seeking him in prayer for a long season?
          And do you find that you are anxious after Christ on the Monday as
          well as on the Sunday? Do you desire him in the shop when the
          intervals of business allow you to do so? Do you seek him in the night
          -- in the solemn loneliness, when no ministers voice breaks on your
          ear, when no truth is smiting your conscience? Is it but the hectic
          flush of the consumption that has come upon your cheek? which is not
          the mark of health. Or is it the real heat of a true desire, which
          marks a healthy soul? Are you desiring God constantly? I admit there
          will be variations even to our more sincere desires, but a certain
          measure of constancy is essential to their real value as evidences of
          a divine work.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again: you may discern whether they are right or wrong by their
          efficacy. Some persons desire heaven very earnestly, but they do not
          desire to leave off drunkenness: they desire to be saved, but they do
          not desire salvation enough to shut their shops up on Sunday morning;
          or to bridle their tongues, and leave off speaking ill of their
          neighbors. They desire salvation; but they do not desire it enough to
          come sometimes on the week-day to hear the gospel. You may tell the
          truthfulness of your desires by their efficacy. If your desires lead
          you into real |works meet for repentance,| then they come from God.
          Wishes, you know, are nought unless they are carried out. |Many; say
          unto you, shall seek to enter in, but shall not be able| |Strive to
          enter in at the strait gate.| Seeking will not do; there must be
          striving. Our prophet here informs us, that whilst he desired God in
          the night, that desire was very efficacious. For, in the 18th verse,
          he declares, |In the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have waited for
          thee.| This desire made me wait for thy judgments. How many do I hear
          say I am waiting for God, it is all I do: there I lie at the pool of
          Bothesda, and one of these days an angel will come and stir the pool.
          Stop! How do you know you are not deceiving yourself? There is a
          friend waiting for me to tea: I will step into the room. There is no
          kettle on the fire: there is not a bit for me to eat. |Sir, we have
          been waiting for you.| But there is nothing ready in the house! I do
          not believe them; they could not have been waiting for me, or else
          they would have been ready. And waiting for God always implies being
          ready. Says a man, |I am waiting for God.| But he is not ready for God
          at all: he still keeps on his drunkenness, the house is still unswept;
          he is as worldly as ever. He is waiting. Yes, but waiting implies
          being ready; and nobody is waiting that is not ready, You are not
          waiting for the coach until you have your coat and hat on ready to
          start, and are looking out at the door for it; and you are not waiting
          for God, until you are ready to go with God. No man ought to say, I am
          waiting for God. No, beloved, it is God who is waiting for us
          generally, rather than any of us waiting for him. No sinner can be
          beforehand with him. But the prophet waited |in the way of God's
          judgments:| that is, waited in the right place -- waited in the house
          of God -- waited under the sound of the gospel. And then this desire
          led him to seek. |With my spirit within me will I seek thee.| It led
          him to seek after God. Oh! the poor pitiful desires of some of you are
          very little good. An old writer says, |Hell is paved with good
          intentions.| I was not aware that there was any pavement at all --
          because it has no bottom, but at the same time I believe that the
          sides of the pit are hung round with good intentions; and men will
          feel themselves pricked and goaded from side to side with good designs
          that they once formed but never carried out -- children that were
          strangled at the birth -- desires that never were brought into living
          acts -- desires that sprang up like the mushroom in the night, and
          like the fungus were swept away -- like smoke from the chimney, that
          stopped as soon as the fire had gone out. Oh! brethren, if these are
          your desires, they are not practical, they do not come of God. But if
          your desires have made you give up your drunkenness -- have compelled
          you to renounce your theatre-going -- have constrained you to seek God
          with full purpose of heart -- have brought you to give up one lust and
          another -- take comfort, you are in the right road, if your desires
          are practical desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again: you can tell these desires by their urgency. Ah! you want to
          be saved some of you, but it must be this day next week. But when the
          Holy Ghost speaks, he says, |To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden
          not your hearts.| It must be now or never. |To-day give me grace;
          to-day give me mercy; to-day give me pardon.| Some of you hope to be
          saved before you die, before the pit closes on you; you hope Jesus
          Christ will look down upon you in some years to come. You have not set
          down how many years, I suppose; but it is always in the distant hazy
          future. But the true desire is now. Does the poor man who stands upon
          the scaffold with a rope round his neck say, |Pardon me in a year's
          time?| No, he is afraid he shall the next minute be launched into
          eternity. He who feels his danger will cry, |Now!| He who wants Christ
          really, will cry, |Now!| He who is spiritually awakened will cry out,
          |Now or never!| What! sinner, will it do to postpone salvation? Doth
          thine heart tell thee it will do by-and-bye? What! when the fire is
          just coming through the boards of thy little chamber? What! when thy
          ship has struck upon the rock, and is filling? Yes, she is filling,
          while the fire at the other end is rushing up; and fire and water
          together are seeking thy destruction. Wilt thou say, |To-morrow?| Why,
          thou mayest be dead ere to-morrow's sun has risen. To-morrow! where is
          it? In the devil's calendar, it is not written in any book on earth.
          To-morrow! It is some fancied islet in the far-off sea that the
          mariner has never reached. To-morrow! It is the fool's desire: which
          he never shall gain. Like a will-o'-the wisp it dances before him, but
          only lands him in the marshes of distress. To-morrow! There is no such
          thing. It is God's. If there is such a day, ours it cannot be.
          Tillotson well remarks: -- |To be always intending to live a new life,
          but never to find time to set about it; this is as if a man should put
          off eating and drinking, and sleeping, from one day and night to
          another, till he is starved and destroyed|
        </p>
        <p>
          But you say, |If I have desired God, why have I not obtained my desire
          before now? Why has not God granted my request?|
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, you have hardly a right to ash the question; for
          God has a right to grant your petition or not as he pleases; and far
          be it from man to say to God |What doest thou?| He is a sovereign, and
          has power to do what he will. But since thine anxiety has dictated the
          question, let my anxiety attempt to answer it. Perhaps God has not
          granted thy desire, because he wishes thine own profit thereby. He
          designs to show thee more of the desperate wickedness of thine heart,
          that in future thou mayest fear to trust it. He wants thee to see more
          of the blackness of darkness and of the horrible pit of sin, that like
          a burnt child thou mayest shun the fire for ever. He lets thee go down
          into the dungeon, that thou mayest prize liberty the better when it
          comes. And he is keeping thee waiting, moreover, that thy longings may
          be quickened. He knows that delay will fan the desire, and that if he
          keeps you waiting it will not be a loss to you, but will gain you
          much, because you will see your necessity more clearly, seek him more
          earnestly, cry more bitterly and your heart will be more in earnest
          after him. Besides, poor soul, God keeps thee waiting, perhaps in
          order that he may display the riches of his grace more fully to thee
          at the last. I believe that some of us who were kept by God a long
          while before we found him, loved him better perhaps than we should
          have done if we had received him directly, and we can preach better to
          others, we can speak more of his loving kindness and tender mercy.
          John Bunyan could not have written as he did if he had not been
          dragged about by the devil for many years. Ah! I love that picture of
          dear old Christian. I know when I first read that book, and saw the
          old woodcut in it of Christian carrying the burden on his back, I felt
          so interested for the poor fellow, that I thought I should jump with
          joy when, after the poor creature had carried his burden so long, he
          at last got rid of it. Ah! beloved; and God may make you and me carry
          the burden for a long time till he takes it off that we may leap all
          the higher with joy when we do get deliverance; for depend upon it,
          there is no poor penitent who loves mercy so well as he who has been
          ferrying for it for a season. Perhaps that is the reason why God keeps
          you waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thought here. Perhaps it has come already. I think some of
          you are pardoned and you do not know it. I think some of you are
          forgiven; though you are expecting something wonderful as a sign which
          you will never receive. Persons have got the strangest notions in the
          world about conversion. I have heard persons tell the queerest tales
          you could imagine about how they were converted; though of course I
          did not believe them. And I fancy some of you think you will have a
          kind of electric shock -- that a sort of galvanism, or something or
          other, will pass through you, such as you never had before. Do not be
          expecting any miracles now. If you will not think you are pardoned
          till you get a vision, you will have to wait many a year. Some people
          fancy they are not pardoned because they have never heard a voice in
          their ears. I should be very sorry to have my salvation dependent on a
          text of Scripture applied to my heart; I should be afraid that the
          devil had applied it, or that it was the wind whistling behind me. I
          want something more sure than that. But perhaps you are forgiven, and
          you do not yet know it. God has spoken the tidings of mercy to your
          spirit, and you have not yet heard it, because you are saying, |It
          cannot be that.| If you could but sit down and think of this: -- |This
          is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus came
          into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief,| methinks you
          would find that after all you are not excluded. There is no great need
          for any of these miraculous things that you are reckoning upon. God
          may have given them to some of his people, but he has never promised
          them. Perhaps, then, the question may be answered by saying, |The
          pardon is there, but you do not know it.| Oh! may God speak loudly in
          your soul, that you may know really and certainly that he has forgiven
          you!
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one more serious enquiry: and it is, |Will God grant my
          desire at last?| Yes, poor soul, verily he will. It is quite
          impossible that you should have desired God and should be lost, if you
          have desired him with the desire I have described. For I will suppose
          that you should go down into the chambers of the lost with the desire
          still in your spirit: when you entered within the gates you would have
          to say, |I desired mercy of God, and he would not give it me: I sought
          grace at the hands of Jesus, and he would not give it.| You know what
          would be said at once. Satan would be so pleased. |Ah!| he would say,
          |here is a sinner that perished praying: God has not kept his promise,
          he said, Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved:' |and
          here is one that did it, and he is lost!| Ah! how they would howl for
          joy in hell! They would sing a blasphemous song against the Almighty
          God -- that one poor desiring soul should be there! I tell you one
          thing: I have heard many wicked things in my life -- I have heard many
          men swear and blaspheme God, till I have trembled, but there is one
          thing I never did hear a man say yet, and I think God would scarcely
          permit any man to perpetrate such a lie, I never heard even a drunken
          man say, |I sincerely sought God with full purpose of heart, and yet
          he has not heard me, and will not answer me, but has cast me away.| I
          scarcely think it possible, although I know that men can be infinitely
          wicked, that any man could utter such an abominable falsehood as that.
          At any rate, I can say I never heard it; and I believe there are some
          of you who can say, |I have been young and now am old, yet have I
          never seen one penitent sinner who could say, in despair, I am not
          saved. I have sought God and he will not hear me, he has cast me away
          from his face and will not give me mercy;| and, I think, as long as
          you live you will not meet a case. Then why should you be the first?
          Why, poor penitent, shouldst thou be the first? Dost thou think thou
          art a chosen mark for all the arrows of the Almighty? Hath he set thee
          for a butt against which he will direct all the thunderbolts of his
          vengeance? Art thou to be the first instance in which mercy fails? Art
          thou to be the one who shall first out-do the infinity of love? Oh!
          say not so. Despair is mad; but for one instant gather up thy reason
          thou despairing one. Would God wish to see thee damned? Hath he not
          said, |As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of
          him that dieth, but would rather that he should turn to me and live.|
          Do you think it would be a pleasure to the Almighty to have your
          blood? Oh! far be it from you to conceive it. Do you not think that he
          loves to pardon? Hath he not said himself he delighteth in mercy? And
          is it not written, |As the heavens are higher than the earth so are my
          ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.| What
          advantage would it be to God to destroy your souls? Would it not be
          more to his honour to save you? Ah, assuredly; because you would sing
          his praise in heaven, would you not? Yes, but recollect, the best
          argument I can use with you is this: Do you suppose that God would
          give his Son to die for sinners, and yet would not save sinners? It is
          written in the Scriptures, that |Jesus Christ came into the world to
          save sinners,| and you are a sinner; you feel that you are a sinner;
          you know it. Then he came to save you? Only believe that. As a poor
          penitent you have a right to believe it. If you were a Pharisee you
          would not have that right; but as a penitent, humble, contrite soul,
          you have a right to believe in Jesus. The Pharisee has none for it is
          never written that he came to save the righteous; and if he believed
          he did he would believe a lie; but every man who is a sinner, every
          man who lays claim to that title, has a right also to believe that
          Christ died for him; and not only so but it is the truth. He came into
          the world for a certain purpose and what he came for he will do. He
          came into the world to save sinners, and now it is written |Whosoever
          believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved; he that believeth
          not shall be damned.| When, last Friday, I had the honour of preaching
          to many thousand persons in the open air, such an assembly as I never
          dreamed of seeing and such a vast number as I could scarcely have
          fancied would have met for any religious purpose, I noticed a most
          singularly powerful echo, constantly taking up the last words of my
          sentences and sending them back, as if some great giant voice had
          spoken to confirm what I had said. When I had repeated the words, |He
          that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,| echo said, |Saved!|
          and when I proceeded, |He that believeth not shall be damned,| I heard
          the echo gently say |Damned!| Methinks this morning I hear that echo:
          |He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;| and the saints
          above cry, |Saved!| Hark! how they sing before the throne! Hark! how
          your glorified parents and your immortalized relatives, cry, |Saved!|
          Hear ye not the echo, as it echoes from the blue sky of heavens --
          |Saved!| And, oh! doleful thought, when I utter those words, |He that
          believeth not shall be damned,| there comes up that dread word --
          |Damned!| from the place where there are |hollow groans, and sullen
          moans, and shrieks of tortured ghosts.| God grant that you may never
          know what it is to be damned! God give you to believe now; for,
          |to-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.|
