        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1040)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, February 25th, 1872, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          |And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which
          are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said unto him,
          Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of
          great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in
          the blood of the Lamb.| -- Revelation 7:13-14.

          TOWARDS SOME SUBJECTS even the best of men need that their attention
          should be drawn. Certain themes need an introduction to our
          contemplations. We often see and yet do not see: we see that which
          upon the surface attracts the eye, but we fail to penetrate into the
          inner and more precious truth. Even in heaven, it would seem that the
          mind needs directing, and wants a friend to suggest inquiry; he who
          sees the whiterobed host may yet need to be led to the consideration
          of who and what they are. It is very gracious on the part of our
          heavenly Father that he condescends to send us messengers of different
          kinds to awaken our attention, to guide our inquiry, and to lead us to
          search deeper than we might otherwise have done. John looked at the
          long ranks of triumphant spirits and admired their glory, but his
          thoughts had not penetrated deep enough, and therefore an elder was
          sent to speak with him. That personage asked him a question, and this
          he did that John might confess his ignorance, might feel a desire to
          know more, and might be led to inquire upon the point which it was
          most needful for him to consider. While we are dwellers here below our
          minds are very apt to be engrossed with the things which surround us,
          and we want some one to direct our thoughts to the upper world; and in
          the same way the mind of a person dwelling above would naturally be
          most occupied with the things around it in the glory land, and it
          might be needful to bid him remember facts concerning the lower world.
          We generally take that view of a matter which is most consistent with
          our own present circumstances, whereas to see a thing completely we
          need to view it from many angles. Hence the elder suggests to John
          that he should see these glorified spirits from another point than
          that which naturally suggested itself to him. He was led to consider
          them, not as they then were, but as they had been. The question was
          therefore suggested him, |Who are these, whence came they? What was
          their earthly character? What manner of men were they in the days of
          their pilgrimage? Were they cherubim, or children of men? Did they
          come hither on wings of fire, or came they hither as do the sons of
          Adam? Who are these that now have attained to such dignity and bliss,
          as to be now wearing the white robe of innocence, and waving the palm
          of victory?| To that enquiry I hope to lead your attention this
          morning; may it be as profitable to you as doubtless it was to John.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are frequently tempted to think that our Lord Jesus was not in very
          truth a man like ourselves. His actual and proper humanity is believed
          among us, but not fully realized. We are apt to fancy that his was
          another flesh and another manhood from our own, whereas he was in all
          things made like unto his brethren, and was tempted in all points like
          as we are, though without sin. It is, therefore, needful again and
          again and again to set out the true brotherhood and kinship of Christ.
          The same spirit of error leads us into the feeling that those holy men
          who have attained to felicity must have been something different from
          ourselves. We set the apostles up in twelve niches, and look upon them
          as very superior beings. We can hardly imagine that they were
          partakers of our flesh and blood; and, as we see the whole white-robed
          host, we imagine in our hearts that they must have been far different
          from ourselves. They did well and valiantly we admit, and we rejoice
          that they have attained to a blessed reward; but we dream that we
          ourselves cannot do as well, nor win as great a recompense. Without
          exactly defining the feeling, we in some way persuade ourselves that
          something in their persons or in their circumstances entirely
          separated the glorified saints from us, and gave them an advantage
          over us, and therefore we despair of ever achieving their triumphs.
          Now, this error must be overcome, because it furnishes convenient
          excuses for indolence, and represses those holy ardours which are the
          life of elevated piety. Brethren, the point to which the elder drew
          John's attention is the one we are now driving at; he would have him
          note that those were glorified in heaven who were once tried and
          tempted as we are; they were, in fact, men of like passions with us. I
          grant you it would be very delightful for us to contemplate the
          present condition of joy and immortality possessed by yonder bright
          spirits, but for the moment it will be more practically useful for us
          to consider what they were and how they came to be what they now are,
          so that finding that they were of old what we now are, we may follow
          in their track, and may obtain to the same blessed rank as that which
          they now enjoy.

          Our sermon on this occasion will consist of an answer to these two
          questions, -- |Whence come they?| for though that was the second
          question asked, it was the first answered; and, secondly, |Who are
          these?| Our third point shall be, |What of all this?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Concerning the bright spirits in heaven -- WHENCE CAME THEY? These
          bearing the palms -- whence came they? Reason itself suggests that
          they came from battle. It is not according to the wont of God to use
          emblems without a meaning. The palm, the ensign of triumph, indicates
          most certainly a conflict and conquest. As on earth palm would not be
          given if not won, we may conclude that the Lord would not have
          distributed the prize unless there had been a preceding warfare and
          victory. A conflict for a temporal crown is severe; how much more for
          an unfading palm in heaven. The winners of these palms must have
          passed through a battle of battles, an agony of agonies, a great
          tribulation. Palms which may be waved even before the throne of the
          august majesty of heaven are not easily come by. From the very fact
          that the glorified carry palms, we may infer that they did not come
          from beds of sloth, or gardens of pleasure, or palaces of peace, but
          that they endured hardness, and were men trained for war. The
          inference is well warranted, for it is even so; and the answer to the
          question, |Whence came they?| is this: |These are they which came out
          of great tribulation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They were then like ourselves, for, in the first place, they were
          tried like others. They came out of great tribulation. Note, then,
          that the saints now glorified were not screened from sorrow. I saw
          to-day a number of lovely flowers they were as delightful in this
          month of February as thee would have been in the midst of summer; but
          I did not ask, |Whence came they?| I know very well that they were the
          products of the conservatory; they had not been raised amid the frosts
          of this chill season, else they had not bloomed as yet. But when I
          look upon God's flowers blooming in heaven, I understand from the
          voice of inspiration that they enjoyed no immunity from the chill
          breath of grief; they were made to bloom by the master hand of the
          Chief Husbandman, in all their glory, amid the afflictions, and
          adversities, and catastrophes which are common to men. God's elect are
          not pampered like spoiled children, neither are they like |the tender
          and delicate woman who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot
          upon the ground for delicateness.| They are, it is true, secured from
          all fatal injury, but they are not protected from the rough winds and
          rolling billows which toss every barque which bears a son of Adam.
          Turn over the roll of the worthies of the Lord from the first hero of
          faith to the last, and you shall not meet with a sorrowless name.
          Great are their privileges, but immunity from trouble is not among
          them. Was Adam God's elect? We hope he was, but certainly in the sweat
          of his face he ate his bread, and through his tears he saw the mangled
          body of his second son. Did God honor Abraham, and call him his
          friend? He was not without family afflictions, among the chief of
          which was the call to take his son, his only son, and offer him up for
          a sacrifice. Moses was king in Jeshurun, but his yoke, as a servant of
          the Lord, was a very heavy one; for all the day long was he vexed with
          the rebellions of a wayward people. Was David, the man after God's own
          heart? You know how deep called unto deep, while all God's waves and
          billows went over him. Speak ye of the prophets; which of them escaped
          without trial? Come ye to the apostles; which of these enjoyed a life
          of ease? Did they not all of them but one pass through the gates of
          death, wearing the martyr's crown? And he who died of old age, had not
          he been an exile in Patmos? Where, from their day down to this, among
          the elect of heaven do you find a single child of God unchastened, a
          solitary branch of the heavenly vine unpruned, or one ingot of
          precious gold untried with fire? Through flood, and through the fire,
          lies the pathway of the chosen. Through troops we must cut our way,
          and over walls we must leap, for to none is there a luxurious path to
          heaven. We must fight if we would reign.
        </p>
        <p>
          True, God's people have been found in all ranks, but; in every
          position they have had their sorrows. You find Esther, a queen beloved
          of God, but what were the tremblings of her heart when, with her life
          in her hand, she went in unto the king to plead against that wicked
          Haman? Lazarus was in the opposite stage of human circumstance, but he
          lay suffering at the gate of his ungenerous neighbor, and the dogs
          came and licked his sores. In palace or in cottage the rod is the sure
          portion of all the heirs of salvation. Each state to the believer
          produces bitter herbs peculiar to itself, he shall never need to
          search far for the appointed accompaniments to the paschal lamb. I
          have heard that a great statesman once stopped his horse on a plain to
          speak with a shepherd who was resting in the midst of his flock.
          Thinking of his own heavy anxieties, he expressed his envy of the
          shepherd, because his life was so free from vexation. |Sir,| said the
          shepherd, |I may not be troubled exactly as you are, but I have my own
          worries; do you see that black ewe there?| |Yes.| |If she were dead,|
          continued the shepherd, |I might be a perfectly happy man; but she is
          a plague to me, for every now and then she takes to going astray, and
          all the rest are sure to follow her.| Rest assured, that there is a
          black ewe in every flock. Man is born to trouble. All the sons of God
          in heaven passed by |weeping-cross.| Such burdens as we are now
          carrying on earth once pressed the shoulders of those now in glory.
          Our crosses are reproductions of the old yoke of Christ. Under our
          personal and relative griefs the glorified have smarted, and our
          sinkings of heart and fears of soul they have experienced. |Through
          much tribulation| they have inherited the kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, next, that they were not even screened from temptation. To the
          child of God, temptation to sin is a greater grievance than the
          suffering of pain. The saint has often said, |I could endure
          adversity, but it is misery to be day after day solicited to evil, to
          have the bait perpetually dangling before me, and to feel something in
          my soul which half consents to sin, and would altogether surrender
          were it not for watchful grace.| Brethren, temptation to the pure mind
          is very grievous; to be sifted in Satan's sieve is a sore trial.
          Storms on any sea are to be dreaded; but a whirlwind raised by Satan
          on the black sea of corruption is horrible beyond conception. Yet do
          not say you cannot enter heaven because you are tempted, for all those
          snowwhite bands attained their glorious standing through much
          temptation, as well as through much affliction. They, like their
          Master, were tempted in all points as you are. Let me take you again
          to the old records, and ask you whether you find a single saint
          untempted? Oh, ye young men, who lament that you are so often allured
          to evil, have ye forgotten Joseph in Potiphar's house? Ye who dread
          the persecutor's frown, have ye forgotten Shadrach, Meshach, and
          Abed-nego? Ye of riper years, who feel your feet almost gone, do ye
          not remember David, and how he was tempted; ay, and worse, how he
          fell, and with broken bones had to limp his way to heaven? Which of
          the saints has been unassailed by the fiery darts of the wicked one?
          Has not the fowler spread his nets to entangle every one of them? Has
          he not laid snares for every faithful soul? Review all the ranks of
          the white-robed squadrons, and enquire of every glorified spirit. Say
          to each one, |And thou? wert thou also tempted? Did the world seek
          alternately to fascinate and frighten thee? Hadst thou a body of sin
          and death to drag thee down? Hadst thou foes among thine own
          household? Didst thou also cry, Woe is me, for I dwell in Meshech?'|
          To such questions each one of the perfected saints would reply that
          their perils were such as ours, and had it not been for Almighty
          grace, they would have utterly perished from the way. The shields of
          the mighty, which are now so highly exalted, were once battered by the
          blows of temptation, even as ours are at this hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may add to all this, again, that they were men who as keenly felt
          trial and temptation as we do. Too frequently, when we are forced to
          admit that the trials of the saints were similar to our own, we
          persuade ourselves that their natures were less tender, their feelings
          less sensitive, their spirits less vulnerable than our own. We imagine
          that these ancient heroes wore some secret armor, or had their hearts
          steeled within, or wore a charmed life; and yet we know right well
          that all flesh of man has the same power to suffer, that a wound in
          another man's body bleeds even as it would in our own, and that
          reproach is as bitter to one spirit as to another. As face answereth
          to face in water, so the heart of man to man. Good men, because they
          are good, are not the less sorrowful when their beloved ones are taken
          from them: gracious men are not by grace petrified so as to despise
          the chastening, of the Lord. Jacob mourned for Rachel, and David for
          Jonathan. You do not find the saints less troubled than other men when
          friendship turned to treachery, and love to hate. Tears flowed as
          readily from holy eyes as from the eyes of the ungodly. They were sons
          of men, born of women as we are, and subject to the same passions and
          emotions. Oh, no, they were not Stoics, nor men of iron, but, made of
          the same earth as ourselves, their hearts palpitated to the same tune.
          Daughter of grief, dost thou say, |I wish I were as the holy women of
          old, that in my trouble I might not be so cast down?| Read thou the
          history of Hannah, and mark how her adversary |vexed her sore to make
          her fret.| She, too, was a woman of a sorrowful spirit. That story in
          the commencement of the First Book of Samuel I am sure must often have
          cheered the daughters of affliction when they have prayed in the
          bitterness of their souls, for they have said, here was a woman,
          tempted like as we are and smarting as we do under unkind remarks and
          slanderous reports and ungenerous treatment, and yet she rejoiced in
          God's salvation. If your spirit is constitutionally sorrowful, and its
          wounds are often wantonly opened by those about you, read the story of
          Jeremiah, and his plaintive notes in the Lamentations will both help
          you to express your woes and furnish you with sympathy in them. Read,
          too, the sorrowful bemoanings of Job. That grand old patriarch of Uz
          is very stout, and plays the man right gloriously; he is no puling
          child, whining and wincing, at a gentle touch of the rod; but patient
          as he is and a very king, among men, yet how bitterly he curses the
          day of his birth, and how heavily he complains. Nor were New Testament
          saints less tender, for Mary and Martha wept, Magdalene was bowed down
          with sorrow at her Lord's death, and the heart of the Virgin was
          pierced as with a sword. Peter wept bitterly, and Paul had continued
          heaviness. Tribulations abounded and afflictions were multiplied to
          the first disciples, and we wrong both themselves and us if we dream
          that it was easier for them to suffer than for us. I grant you that
          they possessed a secret something which enabled them to endure, but
          that something was not homeborn in their nature any more than it is in
          ours. They were fortified by a secret strength which they found at the
          throne of God in prayer, a patience which the Holy Ghost wrought in
          them, and which he is equally ready to work in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, perhaps, it may be thought by some that those holy men who now
          wave the palm-branch were spared some of the keener and more refined
          tribulations; to which I reply, it certainly was not so. David
          especially appears to have compassed the whole round of affliction. He
          could say, |all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.| From all
          quarters his trials arose; and from his youth to his death they
          assailed him. Let me remind you of that special grief which came upon
          him when his darling son excited rebellion against him, and his own
          chosen friend and counsellor, Ahithophel, betrayed him, and to this
          add the scene when that same darling son was slain in red-handed
          rebellion against his father, and David cried aloud, |O Absolom, my
          son, my son! would God I had died for thee! O Absolom, my son, my
          son!| I should not feel that I had ventured too far if I said that
          there is no trouble known to any person in this audience which would
          not find its parallel in the case of the afflicted writer of the
          Psalms. But, perhaps, you tell me that yours is a spiritual grief, and
          that such a wound is the deepest of all. Turn, then, to the life of
          the apostle Paul, and, as far as he unveils his experience, you shall
          find him to be the subject of internal strifes and spiritual
          contentions of the sharpest kind. Remember, especially, when with the
          thorn in his flesh he prayed thrice to God to have it taken away, but
          it was not removed; sufficient grace was given him, but he had to bear
          the inward smart; for, through much tribulation even of that kind must
          the chief of the apostles follow his Lord. What need of multiplying
          words? It is plain to every man that understandeth, that the children
          of God have been tried like others, and they who have won the victory
          fought a real battle, armed only as we may be, and assailed neither
          more nor less as we are, by the same enemies and the same weapons. As
          the church militant we claim indisputable kinship with the church
          triumphant. We are their companions in tribulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Next, we believe that the saints who are not in heaven needed trial
          like others. The word used in our translation is |tribulation,| and
          you know that the word tribulatio is used by the Romans to signify a
          threshing instrument. When they beat out the corn from the straw, they
          called it tribulatio; and so tribulation is sent to us to separate our
          chaff from our wheat. Since the same tribulation happened to those who
          are now in heaven, we infer that they needed it as much as ourselves.
          To what end do men need tribulation? We reply, they often require it
          to arouse them; and yonder saints who serve God day and night in his
          temple, once slept as do others, and needed to be bestirred. Were they
          not apostles who slept Gethsemane? Yea, were they not three of the
          chief of the apostles who slumbered within a stone's cast of their
          Master in his agony? The best of men are prone to slumber, and need to
          be awakened by the buffetings of sorrow. They needed trial to chasten
          them. What son has God ever had, save his firstborn and well-beloved,
          that did not need chastening? Inasmuch as we are all sinners, we have
          need in our Father's house to suffer from the rod. They wanted
          tribulation as we do to loosen them from the earth, else they would
          have struck their roots into this poor soil, and tried to live as if
          this world were their portion. Affliction was also necessary to
          develope their graces; even as spices need bruising to bring forth
          their smell, and rose leaves require distilling to draw forth their
          sweetest perfume. They required adversity to educate them into
          complete manhood, for they too were once babes in grace. It is in the
          gymnasium of affliction that men are modelled and fashioned in the
          beauty of holiness, and all their spiritual powers are trained for
          harmonious action. It was meet also that they should suffer, in order
          to complete their service. Like their Lord, they had to be made
          perfect through suffering; and if they had not suffered they had not
          finished the work which he had given them to do. They needed
          tribulation, moreover, that they might be made like their Savior; for
          a saint untroubled, how can he be like the man who wore the thorn
          crown? Never smitten, never slandered, never despised, never mocked
          at, never crucified, then how could we be like our Head? Shall the
          servant be above his Master, or the disciple above his Lord? They who
          are in heaven passed through tribulation, and they needed it as much
          as we do. Let us think of all this, for it may encourage us to press
          forward. They were knights of the same order as ourselves, and by the
          self-same methods obtained the honors which they wear.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, the children of God who are in heaven in their trials had no
          other support than that which is still afforded to all the saints. A
          miracle was here and there wrought I grant you; but then there are
          other things to be said on our side, for the Spirit of God was not
          given then as fully as we possess him now, and Christ had not then
          brought life and immortality to light through the gospel so that what
          little advantage they had in miracle is far outweighed by the
          advantage we have in the gospel dispensation. What was it that upheld
          the saints of old who are now before the throne? Their faith was
          sustained by the promise of God, but we have the promise too. They
          rested on God's faithful word; that word is faithful still. We have
          more promises by far than most of them had received. They had but here
          and there a word of inspiration, we have the whole volume of
          consolation; yea, we have a double portion, for we have two books full
          of choice and gracious words. We have, therefore, more to cheer us
          than they had. They had the Spirit of God, you say; but, I reply, so
          have we. They had him with them, we have him in us. He visited them
          occasionally; he dwelleth in us; he never removeth from his people but
          abideth in them for ever. You will tell me that God worked with them:
          God works with us. Providence was on their side; and is not providence
          on our side also? All things worked together for their good; they work
          together for our good in the same manner. The Lord who was at the helm
          of their vessel when storms assaulted it, still stands at the helm for
          us and holds the tiller with a strong hand. He who walked the waves of
          Gennesaret, and came to the rescue of the storm-tossed disciples,
          still saith to us, |It is I; be not afraid.| I see no point in which
          they had superior resorts to those which are open to ourselves, for
          the Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Their
          rest lay where our rest still lies; their peace and comfort were the
          same as our own. The Prince of Wurtenberg on one occasion in the midst
          of certain kings and great men heard them boasting, one of the mines
          which enriched his dominions, another of his forests, another of his
          vineyards. Now the Prince of Wurtenberg was poor, but he said, |I have
          a jewel in my country which I would not exchange for all your wealth,|
          and, when they questioned him, he said, |If I were lost in any forest
          of my territory, or could not find my way along a lonesome road, if I
          said to the first peasant that I met that I was his king, I could lean
          my head upon him and lie down to sleep, and sleep securely there,
          feeling certain that he would watch over his king as he would over his
          child.| So we feel, and so the saints of old felt a delightful
          security any where beneath the blue heavens of God. If we have not
          riches, if we have not honor, if we have nothing that flesh could
          desire, we can lie down anywhere and feel that we are perfectly safe
          in the divine keeping. The angels watch over us and protect us, for we
          are the children of God: all things work for our good; the beasts of
          the field are our friends, and stones of the field are in league for
          our defense. This was the portion of those who are now above; it is
          our portion still.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Very hurriedly I must notice, before I leave this first point, that
          if there was any difference between those saints and our selves, it
          lay in their enduring superior tribulations, for |these are they that
          came out of great tribulation.| If, I say, we must distinguish them
          from ourselves at all, it lies in this, that some of them were
          martyred as we are not, resisted unto blood as we have not, and were
          put to death by cruel torments as probably we shall not be. Theirs was
          the battle's brunt. For them the furnace was heated seven times
          hotter. My brethren, if their faith sustained them and won them the
          palm branch, why should not ours do the like for us? The text says,
          |These are they that come out of the great tribulation,| for so it is
          in the original. It may mean some peculiarly severe tribulation which
          has befallen, or is about to befall the church; and, if so, it is
          consoling to observe that the saints shall come out of it unscathed:
          but I rather take it to mean the one long tribulation of God's Saints
          in all ages. It is all one; it is all a part of the sufferings of the
          body of Christ; the saints in glory have had their share in the great
          tribulation, and, if anything, a greater share than we. We feel
          persuaded then, that as they were men like ourselves, who suffered as
          we suffer, and were supported as we are supported, we shall, through
          the same grace, win the same victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I will not detain you longer on that point, though there is much
          to be said, but I must take you to the second, and that is, WHAT ARE
          THESE? John beheld them all in white robes; and the question to be
          answered was, |Who are these, -- these in heaven?| The reply was |They
          have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;|
          from which we gather, first, that all those in heaven were sinners,
          for they all needed to wash their robes. No superfluity would have
          been written down in this book; but had the robes been perfectly
          white, there had been no necessity to cleanse them, certainly not to
          cleanse them in, Jesus' blood. They were sinners then, those glorious
          ones were sinners like ourselves. Look up at them now! Observe their
          ravishing beauty! See how guiltless they are! And then, remember what
          they were. Oh, ye trembling sinners, whose bruised hearts dare not
          indulge a hope of the divine favor, those fair ones were once like
          you, and you are to-day what they were once. They were all shapen in
          iniquity as you were: they were everyone of them of woman born, and,
          therefore, conceived in sin. They were all placed in circumstances
          which allured them to sin; they had their temptations, as we have
          shown, and they lived in the midst of an ungodly generation, even as
          you do. What is more, they all sinned, for mere temptation would not
          have soiled their robes, but actual sin defiled them. There were
          thoughts of sin, there were words of sin, there were acts of sin in
          all of them. Did you observe that bright one who sang most sweetly of
          them all? Shall I tell you a part of his earthly history? He was one
          of the chief of sinners; he takes rank now amongst the chief of
          choristers, because he has most to sing about, since he had most
          forgiven and loved most. He will not tell you that he was naturally a
          saintly spirit, and that by mortification, and self-denial, and
          diligent perseverance he won his place in heaven. No, he will confess
          that his salvation was all of grace, for he was like others a sinner,
          and had transgressed above many. You will say, perhaps, that none of
          the saints had committed sins like yours, but there I must flatly
          contradict you. Amongst that illustrious company there are those who
          were once sinners of the deepest dye -- the adulterer, the thief, the
          harlot, the murderer; some who were such are now glorified, for we
          have such characters mentioned in infallible Scripture as having been
          forgiven, sanctified, and at length glorified. Whatever your sin may
          be, and I will not mention it, for the mention of sin does not help to
          purify us from it; whatever it is, all manner of sin and blasphemy
          have been forgiven unto men, and the precious blood of Jesus has
          brought into eternal glory men stained with every form of sin. Jesus
          has cleansed crimson sinners, deep ingrained with iniquity, and
          scarlet sinners, whose crimes were of the most glaring hue. They all
          in heaven were sinners, such as we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, they all who are in heaven needed an atonement, and the same
          atonement as we rely upon. They have washed their robes and made them
          white in the blood of the Lamb. Not one of them became white through
          his tears of repentance, not one through the shedding of the blood of
          bulls or of goats. They all wanted a vicarious sacrifice, and for none
          of them was any sacrifice effectual, except the death of Jesus Christ
          the Lord. They washed their robes nowhere but in the blood of the
          Lamb. O sinner, that blood of the Lamb is available now. The fountain
          filled with blood, drunk from Immanuel's veins, is not closed, nor is
          its efficacy diminished. Every child of Adam now in heaven came there
          through the blood of the great substitute. This was the key that
          opened heaven's door, -- the blood, the blood of the Lamb, it was the
          one purification of them all, without one exception. If I were in thy
          case, O sinner, God helping me, I would in the blood as they did, and
          enter heaven as they have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will further notice that the saints in haven realised the
          atonement in the same way as we must do. They washed their robes and
          made them white in the blood of the Lamb. The act which gave them the
          virtue which lies in the atonement was the act of faith. They did not
          bring anything to the blood, any merit, or feeling, or preparation;
          they only brought their filthy garments to the blood, and nothing
          else. They washed and were clean. That was all. They did not give,
          they took; they did not impart, but they received. In this same way I
          have realised the merit of my Savior's passion, and I know that every
          believer here will confess that this is his hope, he has washed and he
          is clean. There is nothing to do, and nothing to feel, and nothing to
          be, in order to forgiveness; we have but to wash and the filth is
          gone. Every child of God in heaven whether he were king or prophet, or
          seer, or priest, came there through simply relying and depending upon
          the blood of Jesus Christ, the Lamb, and that is all, -- all. You must
          not dare to add to it, or you will sin against the all-sufficient
          sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text tells that the sole reason for the saints being in heaven at
          all was because they washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb:
          |Therefore are they before the throne of God.| But, is not one of them
          there because he had not sinned? There is no answer from all the
          shining hosts. Is not one of them glorified because a long life of
          consecration wiped out the small offenses of his youth? No response
          comes to the enquiry. But, if you ask whether they were there because
          they have washed in the blood, the |Yes| which comes from them all is
          like the voice of many waters, and like great thunders.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, beloved, WHAT OF ALL THIS? Why, first of all, we must not
          draw the conclusion that trouble and temptation are any argument that
          a man will get to heaven. Perhaps I may be misunderstood this morning
          and therefore I add a caution. There is a groundless notion abroad,
          that those who are badly off in this world will certainly have it made
          up to them in the world to come; and I have heard the parable of
          Lazarus and Dives quoted as though it taught that those who are poor
          here will be rich hereafter. There is not a shadow of reason for any
          such belief. You may go through much tribulation to hell as well as to
          heaven; and as a man may have two heavens, here and hereafter, by
          living near to God, so may a man have two hells, the hell which he
          bringeth upon himself in this life by his extravagances, his
          wickedness, and his lust, and the hell that shall be his punishment
          for ever in the world to come. Believe me, many a ragged, loathsome
          beggar has been damned; he was as poor as Lazarus, but not as gracious
          as he, and therefore no angels carried him to Abraham's bosom. There
          is no efficacy in the tongues of dogs to lick away sin, neither can a
          hungry belly atone for a guilty soul. Many a soul has begged for
          crumbs on earth, and has afterwards craved in vain for water in hell.
          You must take care not to suck poisonous error out of the flowers of
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would, however, have you learn that no amount of trial which we have
          to suffer here, if we are believers in Jesus, should lead us to
          anything like despair, for however trouble may encompass us to-day,
          those in heaven came through as great a tribulation, and why may not
          we? If messengers should come one after the other with swift feet to
          bring us heavy tidings, if all our property should melt, and our
          children should die, and even the partner of our bosom should tempt us
          to curse God, we must still hold fast our confidence. Our faith's
          motto should be, |Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.| God may
          smite his children, but he never can cast off his children. He must
          love them, and he will love them for ever and for ever. Let us also
          understand that no amount of sin of which we may have been guilty
          ought to lead us to despair of pardon, salvation, and ultimate
          entrance into heaven, if we also wash our robes in the blood of the
          Lamb. Those who are in heaven have washed their robes white by faith
          in Jesus, and so may we. I may be addressing some one who has written
          his own death warrant. I thank God that the Lord has never written it.
          You may have said, |I know that I never shall have mercy.| Who told
          thee that God had set a limit to his grace? Who has been up to heaven
          and found that thy name is not written among his chosen? Oh, do God
          the justice to believe that he delighteth in mercy, and that it is one
          of his greatest joys to pass by iniquity, transgression, and sin. And,
          suppose this day you should have in your own person trouble and sorrow
          united; suppose you should be going through the great tribulation, and
          at the same time you should have committed sin which has defiled your
          garment most conspicuously; though the gall and the wormwood be both
          in your cup and both be bitterest of the bitter, yet do not despair,
          for the saints whom John saw had the double blessing of deliverance
          and cleansing, and why should not you? I make bold to tell you that if
          your troubles were tenfold what they are, and your sins also were
          multiplied ten times, yet there is power in the eternal arm to bear
          you up under the tribulation, and there is efficacy in the precious
          blood to remove your sinful stains. By an act of faith cast yourselves
          upon God in Christ Jesus. If you do so, you shall take your place
          amongst the white-robed bands when this life ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was led to these reflections this morning by the remembrance of the
          few short days ago since our beloved brother, Mr. Dransfield, whose
          mortal remains we committed to the tomb last Monday, was among us. You
          remember his accustomed seat, just here, at the prayer meeting; you
          remember how there was never an empty seat just over yonder at any of
          our public services. He was always among us, and he was just like
          ourselves. I am sure we all felt at home in his presence. He did not
          walk among us at all as a stilted personage or a supernatural being;
          he was a father among us; we loved him, esteemed him, revered him, but
          he was a man of men among us. I have tried to realize the same spirit
          before the throne of God, and I think I have been able to grasp the
          thought. I know he was like ourselves; I am equally certain that he is
          yonder, and that he is rejoicing in Christ; none of us doubt that. Now
          let us make a practical, common sense use of that fact and feel, I,
          too, resting, where he rested -- for, oh, how sweetly did he rest in
          his dying Lord -- I, too, hoping as he hoped, shall bear up under
          troubles as he did during his painful illness, and I, too, shall have
          a joyful death as he did, for his soul triumphed in his God beyond
          measure. Why should not all of us, his brethren, enter where he is
          gone? Dear sister, why should not you? You who are consumptive, you
          who know that death is drawing near to you, because you carry a
          disease about you which will take you home? Just realize the fact now
          before us. Our dear and well-known friend is really gone to the better
          land. You shook hands with that dear brother a few days ago, and now
          he is with God, and is waving the palm and wearing the white robe. It
          is not a dream, a fiction, or a fancy. It is not the delusion of
          high-blown fanaticism. It is not a wondrous attainment for some few
          special and renowned saints. Oh, no, it is for every one of us who
          believe in Jesus. They in heaven are those who came out of great
          tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the
          blood of the Lamb. It is not said, |These are they that were
          emperors,| not |These are they who were reared in marble halls,| not
          |these are they who were great scholars,| not |These are they who were
          mighty preachers,| not |These are they who were great apostles,| not
          |These are they who lived spotless lives;| no, but these are they who
          came through the tribulation of life, and were cleansed from their
          sins, as others must be, in the precious blood of Jesus; therefore are
          they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his
          temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brother Dransfield, thou wast bone of our bone, and flesh of our
          flesh, and yet thou art perfected before the throne. We thy brethren
          are on the way and shall be with thee soon. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>PORTION OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON -- Revelation 14.</p>
        <p>
          As a very large number of friends from a distance desire occasionally
          to attend the Tabernacle, but do not like to encounter the crowds at
          the doors, the deacons have resolved to issue early admission tickets,
          which will admit the holder before the general public, during the
          month of issue. They will be purchasable at the price of one shilling,
          and can be had by letter, enclosing twelve penny stamps, and one
          half-penny stamp for postage, of Mr. C. Blackshaw, Tabernacle,
          Newington Butts.
