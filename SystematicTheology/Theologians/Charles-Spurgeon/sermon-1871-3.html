        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.970)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, January 15th, 1871 by</p>

          "Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece,
          doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till
          she find it? And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and
          her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the
          piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the
          presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth." -- Luke
          15:8-10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS CHAPTER IS FULL OF GRACE and truth. Its three consecutive
          parables have been thought to be merely a repetition of the same
          doctrine under different metaphors, and if that were so, the truth
          which it teaches is so important that it could not be rehearsed too
          often in our hearing. Moreover, it is one which we are apt to forget,
          and it is well to have it again and again impressed upon our minds.
          The truth here taught is just this -- that mercy stretches forth her
          hand to misery, that grace receives men as sinners, that it deals with
          demerit, unworthiness, and worthlessness; that those who think
          themselves righteous are not the objects of divine compassion, but the
          unrighteous, the guilty, and the undeserving, are the proper subjects
          for the infinite mercy of God; in a word, that salvation is not of
          merit but of grace. This truth I say is most important, for it
          encourages penitents to return to their Father; but it is very apt to
          be forgotten, for even those who are saved by grace too often fall
          into the spirit of the elder brother, and speak as if, after all,
          their salvation depended on the works of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my dear friends, the three parables recorded in this chapter are
          not repetitions; they all declare the same main truth, but each one
          reveals a different phase of it. The three parables are three sides of
          a vast pyramid of gospel doctrine, but there is a distinct inscription
          upon each. Not only in the similitude, but also in the teaching
          covered by the similitude, there is variety, progress, enlargement,
          discrimination. We have only need to read attentively to discover that
          in this trinity of parables, we have at once unity of essential truth
          and distinctness of description. Each one of the parables is needful
          to the other, and when combined they present us with a far more
          complete exposition of their doctrine than could have been conveyed by
          any one of them. Note for a moment the first of the three which brings
          before us a shepherd seeking a lost sheep. To whom does this refer?
          Who is the shepherd of Israel? Who brings again that which has gone
          astray? Do we not clearly discern the ever glorious and blessed Chief
          Shepherd of the sheep, who lays down his life that he may save them?
          Beyond a question, we see in the first parable the work of our Lord
          Jesus Christ. The second parable is most fitly placed where it is. It,
          I doubt not, represents the work of the Holy Spirit, working, through
          the church, for the lost but precious souls of men. The church is that
          woman who sweeps her house to find the lost piece of money, and in her
          the Spirit works his purposes of love. How the work of the Holy Spirit
          follows the work of Christ. As here we first see the shepherd seeking
          the lost sheep, and then read of the woman seeking the lost piece of
          money, so the great Shepherd redeems, and then the Holy Spirit
          restores the soul. You will perceive that each parable is thoroughly
          understood in its minute details when so interpreted. The shepherd
          seeks a sheep which has wilfully gone astray, and so far the element
          of sin is present; the lost piece of money does not bring up that
          idea, nor was it needful that it should, since the parable does not
          deal with the pardon of sin as the first does. The sheep, on the other
          hand, though stupid is not altogether senseless and dead, but the
          piece of money is altogether unconscious and powerless, and therefore
          all the fitter emblem of man as the Holy Ghost begins to deal with
          him, dead in trespasses and sins. The third parable evidently
          represents the divine Father in his abundant love receiving the lost
          child who comes back to him. The third parable would be likely to be
          misunderstood without the first and the second. We have sometimes
          heard it said -- here is the prodigal received as soon as he comes
          back, no mention being made of a Savior who seeks and saves him. Is it
          possible to teach all truths in one single parable? Does not the first
          one speak of the shepherd seeking the lost sheep? Why need repeat what
          had been said before? It has also been said that the prodigal returned
          of his own free will, for there is no hint of the operation of a
          superior power upon his heart, it seems as if he himself spontaneously
          says, "I will arise, and go unto my Father." The answer is, that the
          Holy Spirit's work had been clearly described in the second parable,
          and needed not to be introduced again. If you put the three pictures
          in a line, they represent the whole compass of salvation, but each one
          apart sets forth the work in reference to one or other of the divine
          persons of the blessed Trinity. The shepherd, with much pain and
          self-sacrifice, seeks the reckless, wandering sheep; the woman
          diligently searches for the insensible but lost piece of money; the
          father receives the returning prodigal. What God has joined together,
          let no man put asunder. The three life-sketches are one, and one truth
          is taught in the whole three, yet each one is distinct from the other,
          and by itself instructive.
        </p>
        <p>
          May we be taught of God while we try to discover the mind of the
          Spirit in this parable, which, as we believe, represents the work of
          the Holy Spirit in and through the church. The church is evermore
          represented as a woman, either the chaste bride of Christ, or the
          shameless courtesan of Babylon; as for good a woman sweeps the house,
          so for evil a woman takes the leaven and hides it in the meal till all
          is leavened. Towards Christ a wife and towards men a mother, the
          church is most fitly set forth as a woman. A woman with a house under
          her control is the full idea of the text, her husband away and herself
          in charge of the treasure: just such is the condition of the church
          since the departure of the Lord Jesus to the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring each part of the text under inspection we shall notice man in
          three conditions -- lost, sought, found.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, the parable treats of man, the object of divine mercy, as
          lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, first, the treasure was lost in the dust. The woman had lost
          her piece of silver, and in order to find it she had to sweep for it,
          which proves that it had fallen into a dusty place, fallen to the
          earth, where it might be hidden and concealed amid rubbish and dirt.
          Every man of Adam born is as a piece of silver lost, fallen,
          dishonored, and some are buried amid foulness and dust. If we should
          drop many pieces of money they would fall into different positions;
          one of thorn might fall into actual mire, and be lost there; another
          might fall upon a carpet, a cloth, or a clean, well-polished floor,
          and be lest there. If you have lost your money, it is equally lost
          into whatever place it may have fallen. So all men are alike lost, but
          they have not all fallen into the like condition of apparent
          defilement. One man from the surroundings of his childhood and the
          influences of education, has never indulged in the coarser and more
          brutalising vices; he has never keen a blasphemer, perhaps never
          openly even a Sabbath-breaker, yet he may be lost for all that.
          Another, on the other hand, has fallen into great excess of riot; he
          is familiar with wantonness and chambering, and all manner of evil; he
          is lost, he is lost with an emphasis: but the more decorous sinner is
          lost also. There may be some here this morning (and we wish always to
          apply the truth as we go on), who are lost in the very worst of
          corruption: I would to God that they would take hope and learn from
          the parable before us, that the church of God and the Spirit of God
          are seeking after them, and they may be among the found ones yet.
          Since, on the other hand, there are many here who have not dropped
          into such unclean places, I would affectionately remind them that they
          are nevertheless lost, and they need as much to be sought for by the
          Spirit of God as if they were among the vilest of the vile. To save
          the moral needs divine grace as certainly as to save the immoral. If
          you be lost, my dear hearer, it will be small avail to you that you
          perished respectably, and were accursed in decent company: if you lack
          but one thing, yet if the deficiency be fatal, it will be but a poor
          consolation that you had only one lack. If one leak sent the vessel to
          the bottom; it was no comfort to the crew that their ship only leaked
          in one place. One disease may kill a man; he may be sound everywhere
          else, but it will be a sorry comfort to him to know that he might have
          lived long had but that one organ been sound. If, dear hearer, thou
          shouldst have no sin whatever save only an evil heart of unbelief, if
          all thy external life should be lovely and amiable, yet if that one
          fatal sin be in thee, thou canst draw small consolation from all else
          that is good about thee. Thou art lost by nature, and thou must be
          found by grace, whoever thou mayst be.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this parable that which was lost was altogether ignorant of its
          being lost. The silver coin was not a living thing, and therefore had
          no consciousness of its being lost or sought after. The piece of money
          lost was quite as content to be on the floor or in the dust, as it was
          to be in the purse of its owner amongst its like. It knew nothing
          about its being lost, and could not know. And it is just so with the
          sinner who is spiritually dead in sin, he is unconscious of his state,
          nor can we make him understand the danger and terror of his condition.
          When he feels that he is lost, there is already some work of grace in
          him. When the sinner knows that he is lost, he is no longer content
          with his condition, but begins to cry out for mercy, which is evidence
          that the finding work has already began. The unconverted sinner will
          confess that he is lost because he knows the statement to be
          scriptural, and therefore out of compliment to God's word he admits it
          to be true; but he has no idea of what is meant by it, else would he
          either deny it with proud indignation, or he would bestir himself to
          pray that he might be restored to the place from which he has fallen,
          and be numbered with Christ's precious property. O my hearers, this it
          is that makes the Spirit of God so needful in all our preachings, and
          every other soul-saving exercise, because we have to deal with
          insensible souls. The man who puts the fire-escape against the window
          of a burning house, may readily enough rescue those who are aware of
          their danger, and who rush to the front and help him, or at least are
          submissive to him in his work of delivering them; but if a man were
          insane, if he played with the flames, if he were idiotic and thought
          that some grand illumination were going on, and knew nothing of the
          danger but was only "glamoured by the glare," then would it be hard
          work for the rescuer. Even thus it is with sinners. They know not,
          though they profess to know, that sin is hell, that to be an alien
          from God is to be condemned already, to live in sin is to be dead
          while you live. The insensibility of the piece of money fairly
          pictures the utter indifference of souls unquickened by divine grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silver piece was lost but not forgotten. The woman knew that she
          had ten pieces of silver originally; she counted them over carefully,
          for they were all her little store, and she found only nine, but she
          well remembered that one more was hers and ought to be in her hand.
          This is our hope for the Lord's lost ones, they are lost but not
          forgotten, the heart of the Savior remembers them, and prays for them.
          O soul, I trust you are one whom Jesus calls his own, if so he
          remembers the pangs which he endured in redeeming you, and he
          recollects the Father's love which was reflected on you from old
          eternity, when the Father gave you into the hands of his beloved Son.
          You are not forgotten of the Holy Spirit who seeks you for the Savior.
          This is the minister's hope, that there is a people whom the Lord
          remembers and whom he never will forget, though they forget him.
          Strangers to him, far-off, ignorant, callous, careless, dead, yet the
          everlasting heart in heaven throbs towards them with love; and the
          mind of the Spirit, working on earth, is directed to them. These, who
          were numbered and reckoned up of old are still in the inventory of the
          divine memory; and though lost they are earnestly remembered still. In
          some sense this is true of every sinner here. You are lost, but that
          you are remembered is evident, for I am sent to-day to preach the
          gospel of Jesus to you. God has thoughts of love concerning you, and
          bids you turn unto him and live. Have respect, I pray you, to the word
          of his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, the piece of silver was lost but still claimed. Observe that the
          woman called the money, "my piece which was lost." When she lost its
          possession she did not lose her right to it; it did not become
          somebody else's when it slipped out of her hand and fell upon the
          floor. Those for whom Christ hath died, whom he hath peculiarly
          redeemed, are not Satan's even when they are dead in sin. They may
          come under the devil's usurped dominion, but the monster shall be
          chased from his throne. Christ has received them of old of the Father,
          and he has bought them with his precious blood, and he will have them;
          he will chase away the intruder and claim his own. Thus saith the
          Lord, "Your covenant with death is disannulled, and your agreement
          with hell shall not stand." Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye
          shall be redeemed without money. Jesus shall have his own, and none
          shall pluck them from his hold; he will defend his claim against all
          comers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, observe that the lost piece of money was not only remembered
          and claimed, but it was also valued. In these three parables the value
          of the lost article steadily rises. This is not very clear at first
          sight, because it may be said that a sheep is of more value than a
          piece of money; but notice that the shepherd only lost one sheep out
          of a hundred, but the woman lost one piece out of ten, and the father
          one son out of two. Now, it is not the value of the thing in itself
          which is here set forth, for the soul of a man, as absolutely valued
          in comparison with the infinite God, is of small esteem; but because
          of his love it is of great value to him. The one piece of money to the
          woman was a tenth part of all she had, and it was very valuable in her
          esteem. To the Lord of love a lost soul is very precious: it is not
          because of its intrinsic value, but it has a relative value which God
          sets at a high rate. The Holy Spirit values souls, and therefore the
          church prizes them too. The church sometimes says to herself, "We have
          but few conversions, few members; many are called, but few chosen."
          She counts over her few converts, her few members, and one soul is to
          her all the more precious because of the few there are who in these
          times are in the treasury of Christ, stamped with the image of the
          great Being, and made of the precious genuine silver of God's own
          grace. O dear friend, you think yourself of small value, you who are
          conscious that you have sinned, but the church does not think you of
          small value, and the Holy Spirit does not despise you. He sets a high
          price upon you, and so do his people. We value your souls, we only
          wish we knew how to save them; we would spare no expense or pains if
          we might but be the means of finding you, and bringing you once more
          into the great Owner's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The piece of money was lost, but it was not lost hopelessly. The woman
          had hopes of recovering it, and therefore she did not despair, but set
          to work at once. It is a dreadful thing to think of those souls which
          are lost hopelessly. Their state reminds me of a paragraph I have cut
          from this week's newspaper: -- "The fishing smack Veto, of Grimshy, S.
          Cousins, master, arrived in port from the Dogger Bank on Saturday
          night. The master reports that on the previous Wednesday, when about
          two hundred miles from Spurn, he sighted to the leeward what at first
          appeared to be a small schooner in distress, but on bearing down to
          her found her to be a full-sized lifeboat, upwards of twenty feet
          long, and full of water up to her corks. There was no name on the
          boat, which had evidently belonged to some large ship or steamer. It
          was painted white both inside and out, with a brown streak round the
          rim. When alongside, on closer examination, three dead sailors were
          perceived lying aft, huddled together, and a fourth athwart in the
          bow, with his head hanging over the rowlocks. They seemed from their
          dress and general appearance to be foreigners, but the bodies had been
          frightfully; washed about,' and were in a state of decomposition, and
          had evidently been dead some weeks. The water-logged waif drifted on
          with its ghastly cargo, and the horrible sight so shocked the crew of
          the Veto that afterwards they were almost too unnerved to attend to
          their trawling, and the smack, in consequence, returned to port with a
          comparatively small catch, and sooner than expected." Do you wonder at
          the men sickening in the presence of this mystery of the sea? I
          shudder as I think I see that Charon-like boat floating on and on;
          mercy need not follow it, she can confer no boon; love need not seek
          it, no deed of hers can save. My soul sees, as in a vision, souls
          hopelessly lost, drifting on the waves of eternity, beyond all hope or
          help. Alas! Alas! Millions of our race are now in that condition. Upon
          them has passed the second death, and powerless are we all to save
          them. Towards them even the gospel has no aspect of hope. Our joy is
          that we have to deal to-day with lost souls who are not yet hopelessly
          lost. They are dead in sin, but there is a quickening power which can
          make them live. O mariner of the sea of life, fisher of men upon this
          stormy sea, those castaways whom you meet with are accessible to your
          efforts of compassion, they can be rescued from the pitiless deeps;
          your mission is not a hopeless one. I rejoice over the ungodly man
          here to-day that he is not in torment, not in hell, he is not among
          those whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not quenched. I
          congratulate the Christian church too, that her piece of money has not
          fallen where she cannot find it. I rejoice that the fallen around us
          are not past hope; yea, though they dwell in the worst dens of London,
          though they be thieves and harlots, they are not beyond the reach of
          mercy. Up, O church of God, while possibilities of mercy remain! Gird
          up your loins, be soul-winners, and resolve by the grace of God that
          every hour of hope shall be well employed by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other point is worthy of notice. The piece of silver was lost, but
          it was lost in the house, and the woman knew it to be so. If she had
          lost it in the streets, the probabilities are she would not have
          looked for it again, for other hands might have closed over it. If she
          had lost it in a river, or dropped it in the sea, she might very
          fairly have concluded that it was gone for ever, but evidently she was
          sure that she had lost it in the house. Is it not a consolation to
          know that those here, who are lost, are still in the house? They are
          still under the means of grace, within the sphere of the church's
          operations, within the habitation of which she is the mistress, and
          where the Holy Spirit works. What thankfulness there ought to be in
          your minds that you are not lost as heathens, nor lost amid Romish or
          Mohammedan superstition, but lost where the gospel is faithfully and
          plainly preached to you; where you are lovingly told, that whosoever
          believeth in Christ Jesus is not condemned. Lost, but lost where the
          church's business is to look after you, where it is the Spirit's work
          to seek and to find you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the condition of the lost soul, depicted as a lost piece of
          silver.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, we shall notice the soul under another condition, we
          shall view it as sought.
        </p>
        <p>
          By whom was the piece of silver sought? It was sought by its owner
          personally. Notice, she who lost the money lit a candle and swept the
          house, and sought diligently till she found it. So, brethren, I have
          said that the woman represents the Holy Spirit, or rather the church
          in which the Holy Spirit dwells. Now, there will never be a soul found
          till the Holy Spirit seeks after it. He is the great soul finder. The
          heart will continue in the dark until he comes with his illuminating
          power. He is the owner, he possesses it, and he alone can effectually
          seek after it. The God to whom the soul belongs must seek the soul.
          But he does it by his church, for souls belong to the church too; they
          are sons and daughters of the chosen mother, they are her citizens and
          treasures. For this reason the church must personally seek after
          souls. She cannot delegate her work to anybody. The woman did not pay
          a servant to sweep the house, but she swept it herself. Her eyes were
          much better than a servant's eyes, for the servant's eyes would only
          lock after somebody else's money, and perhaps would not see it; but
          the mistress would look after her own money, and she would be certain
          to light upon it if it were anywhere within sight. When the church of
          God solemnly feels, "It is our work to look after sinners, we must not
          delegate it even to the minister, or to the City-missionary, or the
          Biblewoman, but the church as a church must look after the souls of
          sinners," then I believe souls will be found and saved. When the
          church recognizes that these lost souls belong to her, she will be
          likely to find them. It will be a happy day when every church of God
          is actively at work for the salvation of sinners. It has been the
          curse of Christendom that she has ventured to delegate her sacred
          duties to men called priests, or that she has set apart certain
          persons to be called the religious who are to do works of mercy and
          charity and of evangelization. We are, every one of us who are
          Christ's, bound to do our own share; nay, we should deem it a
          privilege of which we will not be deprived, personally to serve God,
          personally to sweep the house and search after the lost spiritual
          treasures. The church herself, in the power of the indwelling Spirit
          of God, must seek lost souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this seeking became a matter of chief concern with the
          woman. I do not know what other business she had to do, but I do know
          that she put it all by to find the piece of money. There was the corn
          to be ground for the morning meal, perhaps that was done, at any rate,
          if not so, she left it unprepared. There was a garment to be mended,
          or water to be drawn, or the fire to be kindled, or the friends and
          neighbors to be conversed with -- never mind, the mistress forgets
          everything else, she has lost her piece of money, and she must find it
          at once. So with the church of God, her chief concern should be to
          seek the perishing sons of men. To bring souls to know Jesus, and to
          be saved in him with a great salvation should be the church's great
          longing and concern. She has other things to do. She has her own
          edification to consider, she has other matters to be attended to in
          their place, but this first, this evermore and always first. The woman
          evidently said, "The money is lost, I must find that first." The loss
          of her piece of silver was so serious a matter that if she sat down to
          her mending, her hands would miss their nimbleness, or if any other
          household work demanded her attention, it would be an irksome task to
          her, for she was thinking of that piece of coin. If her friend came
          and talked with her, she would say to herself, "I wish she were gone,
          for I want to be looking after my lost money." I wish the church of
          God had such an engrossing love for poor sinners that she would feel
          everything to be an impertinence which hindered her from soul-saving.
          We have every now and then, as a church, a little to do with politics,
          and a little to do with finance, for we are still in the world, but I
          love to see in all churches everything kept in the background,
          compared with soul-saving work. This must be first and foremost.
          Educate the people -- yes, certainly; we take an interest in
          everything which will do good to our fellow citizens, for we are men
          as well as Christians; but first and foremost our business is to win
          souls, to bring men to Jesus, to hunt up those who bear heaven's
          image, though lost and fallen. This is what we must be devoted to,
          this is the main and chief concern of believers, the very reason for
          the existence of a church; if she regard it not, she forgets her
          highest end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now note, that the woman having thus set her heart to find her money,
          she used the most fit and proper means to accomplish her end. First,
          she lit a candle. So doth the Holy Spirit in the church. In Eastern
          dwellings it would be necessary, if you lost a piece of money and
          wanted to find it, to light a candle at any time; for in our Savior's
          day glass was not used, and the windows of houses were only little
          slits in the side of the wall, and the rooms were very dark. Almost
          all the Oriental houses are very dark to this day, and if anything be
          dropped as small as a piece of silver, it must be looked for with a
          candle even at high noon. Now, the sphere in which the church moves
          here on earth is a dim twilight of mental ignorance, and moral
          darkness, and in order to find a lost soul, light must be brought to
          bear upon it. The Holy Spirit uses the light of the gospel; he
          convinces men of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment to come. The
          woman lit a candle, and even thus the Holy Spirit lights up some
          chosen man whom he makes to be a light in the world. He calls to
          himself whomsoever he wills, and makes him a lamp to shine upon the
          people. Such a man will have to be consumed in his calling, like a
          candle he will be burnt up in light-giving. Earnest zeal, and
          laborious self-sacrifice, will eat him up. So may this church, and
          every church of God, be continually using up her anointed men and
          women, who shall be as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse
          generation, to find out lost souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she was not content with her candle, she fetched her broom, she
          swept the house. If she could not find the silver as things were in
          the house, she brought the broom to bear upon the accumulated dust.
          Oh, how a Christian church, when it is moved by the Holy Spirit,
          cleanses herself and purges all her work! "Perhaps," saith she, "some
          of our members are inconsistent, and so men are hardened in sin; these
          offenders must be put away. The tone of religion is low -- that may be
          hindering the conversion of souls, it must be raised. Perhaps our
          statements of truth, and our ways of proclaiming it, are not the most
          likely to command attention, we must amend them; we must use the best
          possible methods, we must in fact sweep the whole house." I delight to
          see an earnest house-sweeping by confession of sin at a prayer
          meeting, or by a searching discourse, a house-sweeping when every one
          is earnest to reform himself, and to get nearer to God himself by a
          revival of his own personal piety. This is one of the means by which
          the church is enabled to find the hidden ones. Besides this, all the
          neighborhood round the church (for the house is the sphere in which
          the church moves), must be ransacked, stirred, turned over, in a word
          "swept." A church that is really in earnest after souls will endeavor
          to penetrate the gloom of poverty and stir the heaps of profligacy.
          She will hunt high and hunt low if by any means she may rescue from
          destruction the precious thing upon which her heart is set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefully note that this seeking after the lost piece of silver with
          fitting instruments, the broom and the candle, was attended with no
          small stir. She swept the house -- there was dust for her eyes; if any
          neighbors were in the house there was dust for them. You cannot sweep
          a house without causing some confusion and temporary discomfort. We
          sometimes hear persons complain of certain Christians for making too
          much ado about religion. The complaint shows that something is being
          done, and in all probability some success being achieved. Those people
          who have no interest in the lost silver are annoyed at the dust; it is
          getting down their throats, and they cough at it; never mind, good
          woman, sweep again, and make them grumble more. Another will say, "I
          do not approve of religious excitement, I am for quiet and orderly
          modes of procedure." I dare say that this good woman's neighbor, when
          she came in to make a call, exclaimed in disgust, "Why, mistress,
          there is not a chair to sit down upon in comfort, and you are so taken
          up about this lost money that you scarce give me an answer. Why, you
          are wasting candle at a great rate, and seem quite in a fever."
          "Well," the good woman would answer, "but I must find my piece of
          silver, and in order to seek it out I can bear a little dust myself,
          and so must you if you wish to stop here while I am searching." An
          earnest church will be sure to experience a degree of excitement when
          it is soul-hunting, and very cautious, very fastidious, very critical
          people will find fault. Never mind them, my brethren, sweep on and let
          them talk on. Never mind making a dust if you find the money. If souls
          be saved irregularities and singularities are as the small dust of the
          balance. If men be brought to Jesus, care nothing what cavillers say.
          Sweep on, sweep on, even though men exclaim, "They that turn the world
          upside down are come hither also." Though confusion and stir, and even
          persecution be the present result, yet if the finding of an immortal
          soul be the ultimate effect, you will be well repaid for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be remarked, also, that in the seeking of this piece of
          silver the coin was sought in a most engrossing manner. For a time
          nothing was thought of but the lost silver. Here is a candle: the good
          woman does not read by the light of it, nor mend her garments; no, but
          the candle-light is all spent on that piece of money. All its light is
          consecrated to the search. Here is a broom: there is other work for
          the broom to do, but for the present it sweeps for the silver and for
          nothing else. Here are two bright eyes in the good woman's head: ay,
          but they look for nothing but the lost money; she does not care what
          else may be in the house or out of it -- her money she cares for, and
          that she must find; and here she is with candle, broom, strength,
          eyesight, faculties of mind, and limbs of body, all employed in
          searching for the lost treasure. It is just so when the Holy Ghost
          works in a church, the preacher, like a candle, yields his light, but
          it is all with the view of finding out the sinner and letting him see
          his lost estate. Whether it be the broom of the law or the light of
          the gospel, all is meant for the sinner. All the Holy Spirit's wisdom
          is engaged to find the sinner, and all the living church's talent and
          substance and power are put forth if by any means the sinner may be
          saved. It is a fair picture, may I see it daily. How earnestly souls
          are sought for when the Spirit of God is truly in his church!
        </p>
        <p>
          One other thought only. This woman sought for her piece of silver
          continuously -- "till she found it." May you and I, as parts of the
          church of God, look after wandering souls till we find them. We say
          they discourage us. No doubt that piece of silver did discourage the
          woman who sought it. We complain that men do not appear inclined to
          religion. Did the piece of money lend the housewife any help? Was it
          any assistance to her? She did the seeking, she did it all. And the
          Holy Ghost through you, my brother, seeks the salvation of the sinner,
          not expecting the sinner to help him, for the sinner is averse to
          being found. What, were you repulsed the other day by one whose
          spiritual good you longed for? Go again! Were your invitations laughed
          at? Invite again! Did you become the subject of ridicule through your
          earnest entreaties? Entreat again! Those are not always the least
          likely to be saved who at first repel our efforts. A harsh reception
          is sometimes only an intimation that the heart recognises the power of
          the truth, though it does not desire at present to yield to it.
          Persevere, brother, till you find the soul you seek. You who spend so
          much effort in your Sunday-school class, use still your candle,
          enlighten the child's mind still, sweep the house till you find what
          you seek; never give up the child till it is brought to Christ. You,
          in your senior class, dealing with that young man or young woman,
          cease not from your private prayers and from your personal
          admonitions, till that heart belongs to Jesus. You who can preach in
          the streets, or visit the lodging-houses, or go from door to door with
          tracts, I charge you all, for you can all do something, never give up
          the pursuit of sinners until they are safely lodged in Jesus' hands.
          We must have them saved! With all the intense perseverance of the
          woman who turned everything upside down, and counted all things but
          loss that she might but find her treasure, so may we also, the Spirit
          of God working in us, upset everything of rule and conventionality,
          and form and difficulty, if we may but by any means save some, and
          bring out of the dust those who bear the King's image, and are dear to
          the King's heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Time has fled, alas! too swiftly, and so I must close with the
          third point, which is the piece of silver FOUND.
        </p>
        <p>
          Found! In the first place, this was the woman's ultimatum, and nothing
          short of it. She never stopped until the coin was found. So it is the
          Holy Spirit's design, not that the sinner should be brought into a
          hopeful state, but that he should be actually saved: and this is the
          church's great concern, not that people be made hearers, not that they
          be made orthodox professors, but that they be really changed and
          renewed, regenerated and born again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman herself found the piece of money. It did not turn up by
          accident, nor did some neighbor step in and find it. The Spirit of God
          himself finds sinners, and the church of God herself as a rule is the
          instrument of their recovery. Dear brethren, a few years ago there was
          a kind of slur cast upon the visible church, by many enthusiastic but
          mistaken persons, who dreamed that the time was come for doing away
          with organised effort, for irregular agencies outside of the visible
          church were to do all the work. Certain remarkable men sprang up whose
          ferocious censures almost amounted to attacks upon the recognised
          churches. Their efforts were apart from the regular ministry, and in
          some cases ostentatiously in opposition to it. It was as much their
          aim to pull down the existing church as to bring in converts. I ask
          any man who has fairly watched these efforts, what they have come to?
          I never condemned them, nor will I; but I do venture to say to-day in
          the light of their history, that they have not superseded regular
          church work and never will. The masses were to be aroused, but where
          are the boasted results? What has become of many of these much-vaunted
          works? Those who have worked in connection with a church of God have
          achieved permanent usefulness; those who acted as separatist agencies,
          though they blazed for awhile before the public eye and filled the
          corners of the newspapers with spiritual puffery, are now either
          altogether or almost extinct. Where are the victories which were to be
          won by these freebooters? Echo answers, Where? We have to fall back on
          the old disciplined troops. God means to bless the church still, and
          it is through the church that he will continue to send a benediction
          upon the sons of men. I am glad to hear of anybody preaching the
          gospel if Christ is preached I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
          rejoice. I remember the Master's words, "Forbid them not! He that is
          not against us is for us." Still the mass of conversions will come
          through the church, and by her regular organised efforts. The woman
          who lights the candle and sweeps the house, to whom the silver
          belongs, will herself find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now notice when she had found it what she did, she rejoiced. The
          greater her trouble in searching, the higher her joy in finding. What
          joy there is in the church of God when sinners are converted! We have
          our high holidays, we have our mirthful days downstairs in the lecture
          hall, when we hear of souls turned from the paths of the destroyer --
          and in the vestries behind, your pastors and elders often experience
          such joy as only heaven can equal, when we have heard the stories of
          souls emancipated from the slavery of sin, and led into the perfect
          liberty which Jesus gives. The church rejoices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, she calls her friends and neighbors to share her joy. I am
          afraid we do not treat our friends and neighbors with quite enough
          respect, or remember to invite them to our joys. Who are they? I think
          the angels are here meant; not only the angels in heaven, but those
          who are watching here below. Note well, that when the shepherd took
          home the sheep, it is written, "There shall be joy in heaven over one
          sinner that repenteth;" but it does not mention heaven here, nor speak
          of the future, but it is written, "There is joy in the presence of the
          angels of God." Now, the church is on earth, and the Holy Spirit is on
          earth, at work; when there is a soul saved, the angels down below, who
          keep watch and ward around the faithful, and so are our friends and
          neighbors, rejoice with us. Know ye not that angels are present in our
          assemblies? for this reason the apostle tells us that the woman hath
          her head covered in the assembly. He saith, "Because of the angels,
          for they love order and decorum." The angels are wherever the saints
          are, beholding our orders and rejoicing in our joy. When we see
          conversions we may bid them rejoice too, and they will praise God with
          us. I do not suppose the rejoicing ends there; for as angels are
          always ascending and descending upon the Son of Man, they soon convey
          the tidings to the hosts above, and heaven rejoices over one repenting
          sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The joy is a present joy; it is a joy in the house, in the church in
          her own sphere; it is the joy of her neighbors who are round about her
          here below. All other joy seems swallowed up in this: as every other
          occupation was suspended to find the lost silver, so every other joy
          is hushed when the precious thing is found. The church of God has a
          thousand joys -- the joy of her saints ascending to the skies, the joy
          of her saints ripening for glory, the joy of such as contend with sin
          and overcome it, and grow in grace and receive the promise; but the
          chief Joy in the church, which swallows all others, as Aaron's rod
          swallowed up the other rods, is the joy over the lost soul which,
          after much sweeping and searching, is found at last.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practical lesson to the unconverted is just this. Dear friend, see
          what value is set upon you. You think that nobody cares for you --
          why, heaven and earth care for you! You say, "I am as nothing, a
          castaway, and I am utterly worthless." No, you are not worthless to
          the blessed Spirit, nor worthless to the church of God -- she longs
          for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, again, how false that suspicion of yours is that you will not be
          welcome if you come to Christ. Welcome! welcome! why, the church is
          searching for you; the Spirit of God is searching for you. Do not talk
          of welcome, you will be a great deal more than welcome. Oh, how glad
          will Christ be, and the Spirit be, and the church be, to receive you!
          Ah! but you complain that you have done nothing to make you fit for
          mercy. Talk not so, what had the lost piece of money done? What could
          it do? It was lost and helpless. They who sought it did all; he who
          seeks you will do all for you. O poor soul, since Christ now bids thee
          come, come! If his Spirit draws thee, yield it Since the promise now
          speaks, "Come now, and let us reason together: though your sins be as
          scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
          crimson, they shall be as wool," accept the promise. Believe in Jesus.
          God bless you and save you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
