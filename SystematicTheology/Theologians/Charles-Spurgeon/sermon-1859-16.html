        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.240)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 27th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplication."
          -- Psalm 116:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN the Christian pilgrimage it is well for the most part to be looking
          forward. Whether it be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the
          inspiring of our love, the future after all must be the grand object
          of the eye of faith. Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the
          body of sin and death destroyed, the soul made perfect and fit to be a
          partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. And looking
          further yet, the believer's soul can see Death's river passed, the
          gloomy steam forded; he can behold the hills of light on which
          standeth the celestial city; he seeth himself enter within the pearly
          gates, hailed as more than a conqueror -- crowned by the hand of
          Christ, embraced in the arms of Jesus, glorified with him, made to sit
          together with him on his throne, even as he has overcome and has sat
          down with the Father upon his throne. The sight of the future may well
          relieve the darkness of the past, the hopes of the world to come may
          banish all the doubtings of the present. Hush, my fears! this world is
          but a narrow span, and thou shalt soon have passed it. Hush, hush, my
          doubts! death is but a narrow stream, and thou shalt soon have forded
          it. Time, how short -- eternity, how long! Death, how brief --
          immortality, how endless!
        </p>
        <p>"Oh the transporting, rapturous scene</p>
        <p>That rises to my sight!</p>
        <p>Sweet fields arrayed in living green,</p>
        <p>And rivers of delight.</p>
        <p>Filled with delight my raptured soul</p>
        <p>Would here no longer stay,</p>
        <p>Though Jordan's waves around me roll,</p>
        <p>Fearless I'd launch away."</p>
        <p>
          Yet nevertheless the Christian may do well sometimes to look backward;
          he may look back to the hole of the pit and the miry clay whence he
          was digged -- the retrospect will help him to be humble, it will urge
          him to be faithful. He may look back with satisfaction to the glorious
          hour when first he saw the Lord, when spiritual life for the first
          time quickened his dead soul. Then he may look back through all the
          changes of his life, to his troubles and his joys, to his Pisgahs and
          to his Engedis, to the land of the Hermonites and the hill Mizar. He
          must not keep his eye always backward, for the fairest scene dies
          beyond, it will not benefit him to be always considering the past, for
          the future is more glorious far; but nevertheless at times a
          retrospect may be as useful as a prospect; and memory may be as good a
          teacher as even faith itself. This morning I bid you stand upon the
          hill-top of your present experience and look back upon the past, and
          find therein motives for love to God; and may the Holy Spirit so help
          me in preaching and you in hearing, that your love may be inflamed,
          and that you may retire from this hall, declaring in the language of
          the Psalmist, "I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice, and my
          supplication."
        </p>
        <p>
          The particular objects which you are now to look back upon are the
          manifold and manifest answers to prayer, which God has given you. I
          want you now to take up a book which you ought often to read, the book
          of remembrance which God has written in your heart of his great
          goodness and continued mercies; and I want you to turn to that golden
          page wherein are recorded the instances of God's grace in having
          listened to your voice and having answered your supplications. I shall
          give you seven reflections, each of which shall stir up your hearts to
          love our God whose memorial is that he hears and answers prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And the first thing I would have you recollect is, YOUR OWN
          PRAYERS. If you look at them with an honest eye, you will be struck
          with wonder that ever God should have heard them. There may be some
          men who think their prayers worthy of acceptance: I dare say the
          Pharisee did. But all such men shall find that however worthy they may
          esteem their prayers, God will not answer them at all. The true
          Christian in looking back weeps over his prayers, and if he could
          retrace his steps he would desire to pray better, for he sees that all
          his attempts at prayer in the past have been rather blundering
          attempts than actual successes. Look back now Christian upon thy
          prayers, and remember what cold things they have been. Thou hast been
          on thy knees in the closet, and there thou oughtest to have wrestled
          as Jacob did, but instead of that thy hands have fallen down, and thou
          hast forgotten to strive with God. Thy desires have been but faint,
          and they have been expressed in such sorry language, that the desire
          itself seemed to freeze upon the lips that uttered it. And yet,
          strange to say, God has heard those cold prayers, and has answered
          them too, though they have been such that we have come out of our
          closets and have wept over them. At other times our hearts have been
          broken, because we felt as if we could not feel, and our only prayer
          was, "God forgive us that we cannot pray." Yet, notwithstanding, God
          has heard this inward groaning of spirit. The feeble prayer which we
          ourselves despised, and which we thought would have died at the gate
          of mercy, has been nursed, and nurtured, and fostered, and accepted,
          and it has come back to us a full grown blessing, bearing mercy in
          both its hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, believer, how infrequent and few are your prayers, and yet
          how numerous and how great have God's blessings been. Ye have prayed
          in times of difficulty very earnestly, but when God has delivered you,
          where was your former fervency? In the day of trouble you besieged his
          throne with all your might and in the hour of your prosperity, you
          could not wholly cease from supplication, but oh! how faint was the
          prayer compared with that which was wrung out of your soul by the
          rough hand of your agony. Yet, notwithstanding that, though you have
          ceased to pray as you once did, God has not ceased to bless. When you
          have forgotten your closet, he has not forgotten your house, nor your
          heart. When you have neglected the mercy-seat, God has not left it
          empty, but the bright light of the Shekinah has always been visible
          between the wings of the cherubim. Oh! I marvel that the Lord should
          regard those intermittent spasms of importunity which come and go with
          our necessities. Oh! what a God is he that he should hear the prayers
          of men who come to him when they have wants, but who neglect him when
          they have received a mercy, who approach him when they are forced to
          come, but who almost forget to go to him when mercies are plentiful
          and sorrows are few.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at your prayers, again, in another aspect. How unbelieving have
          they often been! You and I have gone to the mercy-seat, and we have
          asked God to bless us, but we have not believed that he would do so.
          He has said, "whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believe that ye shall have
          it, and ye shall have it." Oh! how I could smite myself this morning,
          when I think how on my knees I have doubted my God! What would you
          think of a man who came before you with a petition, and said, "Sir,
          you have promised to give me such-and-such a thing if I asked for it;
          I ask for it, but I do not believe you will give it me." You would say
          "Get you gone until you believe me better. I will give nothing to a
          man who doubts my word." Often might the Lord have spurned us from his
          mercy-seat, when we have come to him, not believing the very promises
          which we were pretending to plead.
        </p>
        <p>
          How small, too, the faith of our most faithful prayers! When we
          believe the most, how little do we trust; how full of doubting is our
          heart, even when our faith has grown to its greatest extent! What
          Christian is there here who is not ashamed of himself for having so
          often doubted a God who never yet denied himself, who was never once
          untrue, nor once unfaithful to his word? Yet, strange to tell, God has
          heard our prayers; though we believed not, he abode faithful. He has
          said "Poor heart, thy weakness makes thee doubt me, but my love
          compels me to fulfill the promise, even though thou doubtest." He has
          heard us in the day of our trouble; he has brought us sweet
          deliverance, even when we dishonored him by trembling at his
          mercy-seat. I say again, look back upon your prayers, and wonder that
          God should ever have heard them. Often, when we awake in the morning,
          and find our house and family all secure, and remember what a poor
          family prayer we uttered the night before, we must wonder the house
          was not burnt and all in it. And you in the church, after you have
          been to the prayer-meeting and prayed there, and God has actually
          listened to you, and multiplied the church and blessed the minister,
          do you not say afterwards, "I wonder that he should have heard such
          poor prayers as those that were uttered at the prayer-meeting?" I am
          sure, beloved, we shall find much reason to love God, if we only think
          of those pitiful abortions of prayer, those unripe figs, those
          stringless bows, those headless arrows, which we call prayers, and
          which he has borne with in his longsuffering. The fact is, that
          sincere prayer may often be very feeble to us, but it is always
          acceptable to God. It is like some of those one-pound notes, which
          they use in Scotland -- dirty, ragged bite of paper; one would hardly
          look at them, one seems always glad to get rid of them for something
          that looks a little more like money. But still, when they are taken to
          the bank, they are always acknowledged and accepted as being genuine,
          however rotten and old they may be. So with our prayers: they are foul
          with unbelief, decayed with imbecility, and worm-eaten with wandering
          thoughts; but nevertheless, God accepts them at heaven's own bank, and
          gives us rich and ready blessings, in return for our supplications.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Again: I hope we shall be led to love God for having heard our
          prayers, if we consider THE GREAT VARIETY OF MERCIES WHICH WE HAVE
          ASKED IN PRAYER, AND THE LONG LIST OF ANSWERS WHICH WE HAVE RECIEVED.
          Now, Christian, again -- be thine own preacher. It is impossible for
          me to depict thine experience as well as thou canst read it thyself.
          What multitudes of prayers have you and I put up from the first moment
          when we learnt to pray! The first prayer was a prayer for ourselves;
          we asked that God would have mercy upon us, and blot out our sin. He
          heard that. But when he had blotted out our sins like a cloud, then we
          had more prayers for ourselves. We have had to pray for sanctifying
          grace, for constraining and restraining grace; we have been led to ask
          for a fresh assurance of faith, for the comfortable application of the
          promise, for deliverance in the hour of temptation, for help in the
          time of duty, and for succor in the day of trial. We have been
          compelled to go to God for our soup, as constant beggars asking for
          everything. Bear witness, children of God, you have never been able to
          get anything for your souls elsewhere. All the bread your soul has
          eaten has come down from heaven, and all the water of which it has
          drank has come out of that living rock, -- Christ Jesus the Lord. Your
          soul has never grown rich in itself; it has always been a pensioner
          upon the daily bounty of God; and hence your prayers have had to
          ascend to heaven for a range of spiritual mercies all but infinite.
          Your wants were innumerable, and, therefore, the supplies have been
          innumerable, and your prayers have been as varied as the mercies hare
          been countless.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not for your soul alone that you have pleaded, your body has
          had its cries. You have been poor, and you have asked for food and
          raiment. How frequently have they been given to you. Not by miracles
          it is true. The ravens do not bring you bread and meat, but bread and
          meat comes without the ravens which is a greater miracle still. It is
          true your raiment has waxed old, and therefore you have not realized
          the miracle of the children of Israel in the wilderness, whose clothes
          never grew old, nevertheless you have had a greater miracle still, for
          you have had new ones when you wanted them. All your necessities have
          been provided for as they have arisen. How often have these
          necessities come upon you? So great have they been at times, that you
          have said, "Surely the Lord will forsake me and deliver me over; I
          shall not have my bread given me, nor shall my water be sure." But
          hitherto God has fed you; you are not starved yet, and by the grace of
          God you won't be. You have been told many a time by unbelief that you
          would die in the workhouse; but you are out of it even now, though it
          seems as if a thousand miracles had been put together to keep you from
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again; how often sickness has laid hold upon you, and like
          Hezekiah, you have turned your face to the wall, and cried, "Lord,
          spare thy servant, and let him not go down to the grave in the midst
          of his days:" and here you are, the living, the living to praise God.
          Recollect the fever and the cholera, and all those other fierce
          diseases which have laid you low; remember those prayers you uttered,
          and those vows you made. Oh! do not you love the Lord because he hath
          heard your voice and your supplication? How frequently too have you
          prayed for journeying mercies, and he has protected you in the midst
          of accidents. You have asked for blessings in your going out and your
          coming in blessings of the day and of the night, and of the sun and of
          the moon; and all these have been vouchsafed to you. Your prayers were
          innumerable; you asked for countless mercies, and they have all been
          given. Only look at yourrself: are not you adorned and bejewelled with
          mercies as thickly as the sky with stars. Think how you have prayed
          for your family. When you first knew the Lord your husband feared him
          not; but how you wrestled for your husband's soul! and now the tear is
          in your eye while you see your husband sitting by your side in the
          house of God, and recollect, it is not many months ago since he would
          have been in the tavern. Your children too have through your prayers
          been brought to God. Mothers, you wrestled with God that your children
          might be God's children, and you have lived to see them converted. How
          great the mercy to see our offspring called in early youth. Oh! love
          the Lord, because in this respect too he has heard your voice and your
          supplication. How often have you presented before God your business,
          and he has helped you in that matter. How frequently have you laid
          your household sorrows before him, and he has delivered you in that
          case. And some of us can sing of blessings given to us in the service
          of God in his church. We have lived to see the empty sanctuary crowded
          to the full, we have seen our largest attempts successful beyond our
          most sanguine hopes; we have prayed for sinners, and seen them saved;
          we have asked for backsliders, and have seen them restored; we have
          cried for a Pentecost, and we have had it; and by God's grace we are
          crying for it again, and we shall have it once more. O minister,
          deacon, elder, church member, father, mother, man of business, hast
          thou not indeed cause to say, "I love the Lord, because he hath heard
          my voice and my supplications?" I am afraid the very fact that God
          hears our prayers so constantly, leads us to forget the greatness of
          his mercy. Let it not be so, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget
          not all his benefits." Let this to-day be brought to mind, and let me
          raise a song to the God who hath heard the voice of my supplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Let us note again THE FREQUENCY OF HIS ANSWERS TO OUR FREQUENT
          PRAYERS. If a beggar comes to your house, and you give him alms, you
          will be greatly annoyed if within a month he shall come again; and if
          you then discover that he has made it a rule to wait upon you monthly
          for a contribution, you will say to him, "I gave you something once,
          but I did not mean to establish it as a rule." Suppose, however, that
          the beggar should be so impudent and impertinent that he should say,
          "But I intend sir to wait upon you every morning and every evening:"
          then you would say, "I intend to keep my gate locked that you shall
          not trouble me." And suppose he should then look you in the face and
          add still more, "Sir, I intend waiting upon you every hour, nor can I
          promise that I won't come to you sixty times in an hour; but I just
          vow and declare that as often as I want anything so often will I come
          to you: if I only have a wish I will come and tell it to you; the
          least thing and the greatest thing shall drive me to you; I will
          always be at the post of your door." You would soon be tired of such
          importunity as that, and wish the beggar anywhere, rather than that he
          should come and tease you so. Yet recollect, this is just what you
          have done to God, and he has never complained of you for doing it; but
          rather he has complained of you the other way. He has said, "Thou hast
          not called upon me, O Jacob." He has never murmured at the frequency
          of your prayers, but has complained that you have not come to him
          enough. Every morning when you have risen your cry has gone up to him;
          again with the family you have cried to the God of Jacob; at eventide
          you have gathered together and have prayed to him, and whenever ye
          have a trial, or a want, or a doubt, or a fear, ye have, if ye have
          done rightly, sped away swiftly to his throne and told him all. Speak
          now, saint, has he once said to you "Get you gone, thou weariest me?"
          Has he ever said "Mine ear is heavy that it cannot hear, my arm is
          shortened that I cannot save?" Has he said, "Away with thee, I want
          not thus to be perpetually hearing thee? What is thy harsh grating
          voice, that I should always give mine ear to it? Am I not hearkening
          to the songs of angels, to the shouts of cherubim? Away with thee,
          tease me not. At certain seasons thou mayest come, on the Sabbath-day
          thou mayest pray, but I want not to hear thee in the week?" No, no, he
          has sweetly embraced us every time, he has always bowed the heaven and
          come down to listen to our feeble cries; he has never denied a
          promise, never broken his word, even when we have pleaded a thousand
          times a day. Oh I will love the name of such a patient God as this,
          who bears with my prayers though they be as a cloud of hornets in the
          air.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Go a little further and you will have another thought arising.
          Think of THE GREATNESS OF THE MERCY FOR WHICH YOU HAVE OFTEN ASKED
          HIM. We never know the greatness of our mercies till we get into
          trouble and want them. I talk to-day of pardoned sin, but I confess I
          do not feel its preciousness as once I did. There was a time when my
          sins lay heavy on me; conscience accused me, and the law condemned me,
          and I thought if God would but pardon me, it would be the greatest
          thing he ever did. The creating of a world seemed to me to be but
          little compared with the taking away of my desperately evil sins. Oh,
          how I cried, how I groaned before him; and he has pardoned me, and
          blessed be his name for it. But I cannot estimate the value of his
          pardon to-day so well as I could when I was seeking it -- almost
          driven to despair. Oh, remember soul, when thou didst ask for pardon
          thou wast asking for that which worlds could not buy; thou wast asking
          for that which could only be procured through the lifeblood of the Son
          of God. Oh! what a boon was that! And yet he did not look thee in the
          face and say, "Thou hast asked too much." No, but he gave it freely.
          He upbraided not; he blotted out all thy sins, and washed thee at once
          in the river of the Saviour's blood. Since that time what large things
          hast thou asked! Thou wast in trouble once, it seemed as if bankruptcy
          must overtake thee, and thou didst cry to him. If the world heard it
          it would have said, "What a fool art thou to ask this of thy God -- he
          will never deliver thee!" Unbelief, like Rabshekeh, wrote a
          blasphemous letter, and thou didst lay it before the Lord; but even
          when thou wast in prayer, thy heart said, "The Lord will not deliver
          thee this time. The lion will surely devour thee. The furnace will
          most certainly burn thee up." But you did put up a poor, groaning
          prayer, and you dared to ask great things, namely, that God would put
          his hand out of heaven and save you from the waters, that the flood
          might not overflow you. Are you not surprised at this time that you
          dared to ask so much! You would not dare to ask so largely of any of
          your friends; you would not have gone to one and said, "I must have a
          thousand pounds by such and such a day, will you lend it to me?" --
          you knew you would not get it. Yet you asked it of your God. It came,
          and here you are, the living to praise his name; and if this were the
          right place you would stand up and testify that God did hear you, that
          in the day of sorrow and tribulation he delivered you. Now do you not
          love him for giving you such great things as these? God's mercies are
          so great that they cannot be magnified; they are so numerous they
          cannot be multiplied, so precious they cannot be over-estimated. I
          say, look back to-day upon these great mercies with which the Lord has
          favored thee in answer to thy great desires, and wilt thou not say, "I
          love the Lord because he has heard my voice and my supplications?"
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Another aspect of this case, perhaps, will reach our hearts more
          closely still. HOW TRIVIAL HAVE BEEN THE THINGS WHICH WE HAVE OFTEN
          TAKEN BEFORE GOD, AND YET HOW KINDLY HAS HE CONDESCENDED TO HEAR OUR
          PRAYERS. It is a singular thing, that our hearts are often more
          affected by little than by great things. You may feed a child all the
          year round, and never get its thanks, but give it a sweetmeat or an
          orange, and you may have its heart and its gratitude. Strange that the
          bounties of a whole year should seem to be lost, while the gift of a
          moment is greatly prized. A little thing, I say, may often touch the
          heart more than a great thing. Now, how often have we, if we have
          acted rightly, taken little things before the Lord. I believe it is
          the Christian's privilege to take all his sorrows to his God, be they
          little or be they great. I have often prayed to God about a matter at
          which you would laugh if I should mention it. In looking back I can
          only say it was a little thing, but it seemed great at the time. It
          was like a little thorn in the finger, it caused much pain, and might
          have brought forth, at last, a great wound. I learned to lay my little
          troubles at the feet of Jesus. Why should we not? Are not our great
          ones little? and is there, after all, much difference between great
          troubles and little ones in the sight of God? The queen will stand at
          one hour listening to her ministers, who talk with her about public
          business, but does she seem less a queen when, afterwards, her little
          child runs to her as its mother, because a gnat has stung it? Is there
          any great condescension the matter? She who was a right royal queen
          when she stood in the privy chamber is as right royal a queen and as
          well-beloved a mother of the nation, when she takes the little child
          upon her knee, and gives it a maternal kiss. Her ministers must not
          present trifling petitions, but her children may. So the worldling may
          say this morning, "How absurd to think of taking little troubles to
          God." Ah! it might be absurd to you, but to God's children it is not.
          Though you were God's prime minister, if you were not his child, you
          would have no right to take your private troubles to him; but God's
          meanest child has the privilege of casting his care upon his Father,
          and he may rest assured that his Father's heart will not disdain to
          consider even his mean affairs. Now let me think of the innumerable
          little things God has done for me. In looking back, my unbelief
          compels me to wonder at myself, that I should have prayed for such
          little things. My gratitude compels me to say, "I love the Lord,
          because he has heard those little prayers, and answered my little
          supplications, and made me blessed, even in little things which, after
          all, make up the life of man."
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Once more, let me remind you, in the sixth place, of THE TIMELY
          ANSWERS WHICH: GOD HAS GIVEN YOU TO YOUR PRAYERS, and this should
          compel you to love him. God's answers have never come too soon nor yet
          too late. If the Lord had given you his blessing one day before it did
          come, it might have been a curse, and there have been times when if he
          had withheld it an hour longer it would have been quite useless,
          because it would have come too late. In the life of Mr. Charles
          Wesley, there occurs a memorable scene at Devizes. When he went there
          to preach, the curate of the parish assembled a great mob of people,
          who determined to throw him into the horse-pond, and if he would not
          promise that he would never come into the town again they would kill
          him. He escaped into the house and hid himself upstairs. They besieged
          the house for hours, battering at the doors, breaking every pane of
          glass in the windows, and at last to his consternation, they climbed
          the roof, and began to throw the tiles down into the street, so as to
          enter the house from above. He had been in prayer to God to deliver
          him, and he said, "I believe my God will deliver me;" but when he saw
          the heads of the people over the top of the room in which he was
          concealed, and when they were just about to leap down he very nearly
          gave up all hope, and he thought surely God would not deliver him,
          when in rushed one of the leaders of the mob, a gentleman of the town
          who did not wish to incur the guilt of murder, and proposed to him
          that he would get him away if he would only promise that he would
          never come back again. "No," said he, "I will never promise that.
          "But," said the man, "Is it your intention that you will not return
          immediately?" "Well" he said, "I do not say I shall come back just
          yet, I do not see any use in it. As you drive me away, therefore I
          shall shake off the dust of my feet against you, but I mean to come
          back again before I die." "Well," said the man, that will do, if you
          only promise you will not come back directly I will get you away." And
          so, by a great deliverance, he was saved from the jaw of the lion and
          the paw of the bear. His prayer was answered at the right time. Five
          minutes afterwards he would have been dead. Now cannot you say that
          the answer has come to you punctually at the very tick of the clock of
          wisdom, not before nor after.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Now, the seventh recollection with which I would inspire you is
          this -- will you not love the Lord, when you recollect the special and
          great instances of his mercy to you? You have had seasons of special
          prayer and of special answer. Let me picture a man. There was one who
          feared not God, nor regarded man. He was engaged in business, and his
          affairs were not propitious, but rather everything went against him.
          He went against God, and kicked the more because God kicked against
          him. He had servants about him that feared God and worshipped him; but
          as for himself, he had no thought or regard for religion. His affairs
          became more and more perplexed and involved. One day he passed by the
          house of one of his workmen, where prayer was wont to be made, and
          listening, he heard words uttered in supplication that touched his
          heart. Though he was the master, he went inside and listened to his
          servant while he preached. God touched that man's heart, and made him
          feel his need of a Saviour. He went home, and he had now double cause
          for prayer. He went to the Lord, and told him he was a poor, wretched
          undone sinner, and that he wanted mercy; and then he told the Lord
          beside though he did not make it very prominent, that he was a poor,
          almost broken merchant; and that if God did not appear for him, he
          knew not but that he must be driven out of house and home. These two
          cases were laid before God. First of all, God heard his prayer for his
          soul. He gave him joy and peace in believing; and poor as he was at
          that time, he found enough to assist in erecting a house where the
          gospel might be preached. The Lord who had delivered him spiritually,
          now came to his assistance temporally. His affairs took a different
          turn, floods of prosperity rolled in upon him, and he is at this very
          day a living witness of the power of God to answer man's prayer for
          spiritual and for temporal things too. And if it were needed, he could
          bear his willing witness of special answer in that special time of
          necessity. And does he not love his God? I know he does; for he
          delights to honor him, he delights to give of his substance to him.
          And there may be others of you here present whose characters have been
          pictured in this one which I have pourtrayed before you; who are
          saying, "Surely he means me." Oh, will you not then, at the
          recollection of what God did in that double mercy, say, "love him.
          What can I do for him? There is nothing too great for me to give;
          nothing too large for me to do. Only let me know my duty, and the
          recollection of his marvellous bounty shall lead me to give of my
          substance to him; to give my whole heart to him. I will be wholly his,
          and hope that in death he will receive me to himself." Men and women,
          my brethren and sisters in Christ, -- will you look back a few short
          years, and recollect the time when you were on your knees before God,
          seeking him? I could fix my eye to-day upon many a man who has been a
          drunkard, a swearer, a breaker of God's holy day, a hater of
          everything good. I think I see you in that upper chamber of yours. Oh,
          how you cried, how you groaned! Oh, with what agony did you pour out
          your unutterable sighs! You rose up, and you thought God would not
          have mercy on you. You went to your business; but how wretched you
          were! You went back again to the chamber. And how the beam out of the
          wall could speak now, and tell you how you cried and cried, and cried
          again before his mercy-seat. Do you love him but a little to-day? has
          your love grown cold? Go home and look again upon the chair against
          which you kneeled. Look at the very walls, and see if they do not
          accuse you, saying, "I heard you pray to God for mercy, and he has
          heard you. How I see your cold-heartedness; I mark your lukewarmness
          in his cause." Go home to your chamber, fall on your knees, and with
          tears of gratitude say --
        </p>
        <p>"O thou, my soul, bless God the Lord;</p>
        <p>And all that in me is</p>
        <p>Be stirred up, his holy name</p>
        <p>To magnify and bless!"</p>
        <p>
          Some of us can recollect other special seasons of prayer. Members of
          my church, I remind you of that solemn season, when, like a hurricane
          of desolation, the judgment of God swept through our midst. Standing
          in this pulpit this very morning, I recall to myself that evening of
          sorrow, when I saw my people scattered like sheep, without a shepherd,
          trodden upon, injured, and many of them killed. Do you recollect how
          you cried for your minister, that he might be restored to a reason
          that was then tottering? Can you recollect how ye prayed that out of
          evil God would bring forth good, that all the curses of the wicked
          might be rolled back upon themselves, and God would yet fill this
          place with his glory? And do you remember how long ago that is, and
          how God has been with us ever since, and how many of those who were
          injured that night, are now members of our church, and are praising
          God that they ever entered this house? Oh! shall we not love the Lord?
          There is not a church in London, that has had such answers to prayer
          as we have; there has not been a church that has had such cause to
          pray. We have had special work, special trial, special deliverance,
          and we ought pre-eminently to be a church, loving God, and spending
          and being spent in his service. Remember again the varied times of
          your sickness, when you have been sick, sore, and nigh unto death. Let
          me picture, my own experience that I may remind you of yours. I
          remember when I came to this pulpit in agony, and preached you a
          sermon which seemed to cost me my life's blood at every word I
          uttered. I was taken home to my bed full of grief and agony I remember
          those weary nights, those doleful days, that burning brow, those
          roaming thoughts, those spectres that haunted my dreams, that sleep
          without sleep, that rest that knew no rest, that torture, and that
          pain. Then I sought God, and cried that he would spare me to stand in
          this pulpit once again. Oh! I thought then, in my poor foolish way,
          that I would preach as I ne'er had preached before, as "a dying man to
          dying men." I hoped my ministry was not over; I trusted I might have
          another opportunity of freeing myself from the blood of hearers, if
          any of that blood were on my skirts. Here I stand, and I have to chide
          myself that I do not love him as I ought: yet nevertheless, in the
          recollection of his great mercy, saving my soul from death, and mine
          eyes from tears, I must love him, and I must praise him; and I must in
          reminding each of you of similar deliverances, beseech and entreat you
          to bless the Lord with me. O let us magnify his name together. We must
          do something fresh, something greater, something larger than we have
          done before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus delivered these thoughts, I shall want you now for about
          three minutes to listen to me while I teach you three lessons which
          ought to spring from this sevenfold retrospect. What shall I say then?
          God has heard my voice in my prayer. The first lesson, then, is this
          -- He shall hear my voice in my praise. If he heard me pray, he shall
          hear me sing; if he listened to me when the tear was in mine eye, he
          shall listen to me when my eye is sparkling with delight. My piety
          shall not be that of the dungeon and sick bed; it shall be that also
          of deliverance and of health.
        </p>
        <p>"I'll praise my Maker with my breath;</p>
        <p>And when my voice is lost in death,</p>
        <p>Praise shall employ my nobler powers:</p>
        <p>My days of praise shall ne'er be past,</p>
        <p>While life and thought and being last,</p>
        <p>Or immortality endures."</p>
        <p>
          Another lesson. Has God heard my voice? Then I will hear his voice. If
          he heard me I will hear him. Tell me, Lord, what wouldst thou have thy
          servant do, and I will do it; what wouldst thou have me believe, and I
          will believe it. If there be a labor which I have never attempted
          before, tell me to do it, and I will say, "Here am I; Lord, send me."
          Is there an ordinance to which I never attended? Dost thou say, "Do
          this in remembrance of me;" is it thy command? However non-essential
          it seems to be, I will do it, because thou hast told me to do it. If
          thou hast heard my feeble voice, I will hear thine, even though it be
          but a still small voice. Oh that you would learn that lesson!
        </p>
        <p>
          The last lesson is, Lord, hast thou heard my voice? then I will tell
          others that thou wilt hear their voice too. Didst thou save me? O
          Lord, if thou savedst me thou canst save anybody. Didst thou hear my
          prayer?
        </p>
        <p>"Then will I tell to sinners round,</p>
        <p>What a dear Saviour I have found;"</p>
        <p>
          and I will bid them pray too. O you that never pray, I beseech you
          begin from this hour. May God the Spirit lead you to your chambers, to
          cry to him! Remember, if you ask through Jesus, you cannot ask in
          vain. I can prove that in a thousand instances God has heard my
          supplication. There was nothing more in me than there is in you. Go
          and plead the promise; plead the blood, and ask for the help of God's
          Spirit; and there is not one in this assembly who shall not receive
          the blessing, if God shall lead him to pray. Young man, young woman,
          go home; plead with God for yourself first; you that love him, plead
          for others. Let every one of us practice the second verse of this
          Psalm, "Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
          call upon him as long as I live."<br />
