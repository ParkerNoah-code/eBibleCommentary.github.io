        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1188)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, August 16th, 1874, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|What if thy father answer thee roughly?| -- 1 Samuel 20:10.</p>
        <p>
          IT WAS NOT AN UNLIKELY THING that his father would answer Jonathan
          roughly. Saul had taken great umbrage against David, while Jonathan
          his eldest son, on the contrary, loved David as his own soul. Jonathan
          could hardly think that his father really meant harm to so good a man
          as David, and he expressed to David that opinion, and then David, to
          be prepared for the worst, put to him this question, |What if thy
          father answer thee roughly? |It did so turn out. Saul answered his son
          with bitter words, and in the desperation of his anger he even hurled
          a javelin at him to smite him; yet Jonathan did not forsake David, he
          clung to him with all the faithfulness of love, and until his death,
          which was much mourned by David, he remained his fast and faithful
          friend Now, this question of David to Jonathan is one which I wish to
          put this morning to all believers in Christ, especially to the younger
          ones who have lately entered into covenant with the great Son of
          David, and who, in the ardor of their hearts, feel that they could
          live and die for him. I want to put before them the supposition that
          they will meet with opposition from their dearest friends, that
          perhaps their father, brother, husband, or uncle will answer them
          roughly, or perhaps their mother, wife, or sister will become a
          persecutor to them. What then? What will they do under such
          circumstances? Will they follow the Lord through evil report? |What if
          thy father answer thee roughly?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that this supposition is a very likely one. There are a few
          Christians so favourably circumstanced that all their friends
          accompany them in the pilgrimage to heaven. What advances they ought
          to make in the sacred journey! What excellent Christians they ought to
          be! They are like plants in a conservatory -- they ought to grow and
          bring forth the loveliest Bowers of divine grace. But there are not
          very many who are altogether in that case. The large proportion of
          Christians find themselves opposed by those of their own family, or by
          those with whom they labor or trade. Is it not likely to be so? Was it
          not so from the beginning? Is there not enmity between the seed of the
          serpent and the seed of the woman? Did not Cain slay his brother Abel
          because he was accepted of the Lord? In the family of Abraham was
          there not an Ishmael born after the flesh, who persecuted Isaac, who
          was born after the Spirit? Was not Joseph hated of his brethren? Was
          not David persecuted by Saul, Daniel by the Persian princes, and
          Jeremiah by the kings of Israel? Has it not ever been so? Did not the
          Lord Jesus Christ himself meet with slander, cruelty, and death, and
          did he not tell us that we must not look for favor where he found
          rejection? He said plainly, |I came not to send peace upon the earth,
          but a sword;| and he declared that the immediate result of the
          preaching of the gospel would be to set the son against the father and
          the father against the son, so that a man's foes should be they of his
          own household. Did he not carefully inquire of every recruit who
          wished to enlist in his army, |Have you counted the cost?| Have you
          not admired his perfect honesty and admirable caution in dealing with
          men, when he bids them remember that if they follow him they must deny
          themselves and take up their cross daily and be content to be hated of
          all men for his sake? He warns us not to expect that the disciple will
          be above his Master, for if men have called the Master of the house
          Beelzebub, they will assuredly confer no sweet titles upon his
          household. Since our Lord has forewarned us, it is well for us to
          stand ready for the trial which he predicts, and to ask ourselves
          whether we are ready to bear oppression for Christ's sake. I press the
          question Upon you who think of avowing yourselves believers, for most
          likely it will come practically home to you, and it is well when you
          begin to build a house to calculate whether you will be able to finish
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are very many of God's servants here, whose life is made bitter
          by the continual worry they endure from their ungodly relatives and
          associates. Often do they sigh for the wings of a dove to fly away and
          be at rest. I feel the deepest sympathy with them, and it is not Only
          with the intention of forearming the younger ones, but with the hope
          of cheering and consoling those who have been long in the fiery
          furnace, that I shall speak this morning upon this text, |What if thy
          father answer thee roughly?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Our first point is this, WHAT YOU MAY DO, what there is a
          possibility of your doing, should your friends answer you roughly. In
          the first confidence of your love to Christ you go and tell father of
          your conversion; well, what it he should ridicule it all? You run to
          mother, and communicate your change of heart; what if she should scoff
          at it? You tell a little of your heart to some friend; what if that
          friend should turn again and rend you? I will tell you what perhaps
          you will do, though I earnestly pray that you may do no such thing.
          You may |by-and-by be offended.| I mean that you may leave Christ
          altogether, because you cannot bear his cross, and though willing
          enough to go to heaven with him if the way were smooth, it may be
          that, like Mr. Pliable, finding that there is a slough to be got
          through, you will turn your back upon the good country and return to
          the City of Destruction. Many have done so. Our Lord's parable of the
          seed sown in stony places teaches us that many shoots which promise
          fair for harvest, perish when the sun arises with burning heat because
          they have no root. Observation confirms this statement. If yonder
          fair-weather professors of religion could have been daily hailed with
          general acclamation, they would, after a certain fashion, have
          continued steadfast; but inasmuch as they have met with rebuffs and
          chills which they never bargained for, they have cast off all religion
          and joined with the fashionable world. To such the earthly father is
          dearer than the Father who is in heaven; the brother after the flesh
          is dearer than that Brother who is born for adversity, and the ungodly
          husband is more precious than the everlasting bridegroom; and so they
          desert their Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, it may happen to you that, instead of being by-and-by offended,
          you may continue for awhile, but you may gradually give way, and at
          last yield altogether. There are many among us who could bear to lose
          our heads at a stroke for Christ, but to be burned at a slow fire --
          ah, that would try us! And if that slow fire lasted not for a day or
          so, but for weeks, and months, and years! How then? If, after much
          patient endurance, the cruel mockings still continue, if the hard
          words and bitter speeches never cease -- how then? Surely, unless
          grace sustains us, the flesh will clamor to be rid of this uneasy
          yoke, and will look out for some by-path by which it may escape the
          rigor of the rough road and go back again to the world. Grace will
          hold on and out to the end, but nature at her best, with firmest
          resolutions, has only to be tried up to a certain point, and it will
          surely yield. This is what we may do; but may God grant that we may be
          preserved from such a wretched course of action, for, if we do give
          way because of opposition from ungodly friends, it involves tremendous
          guilt. To give up religion because of persecution is to prefer
          ourselves to florist, to be selfish enough to regard our own ease
          rather than this glory, to consult our own peace rather than his
          honor, though we have said that we love him beyond all else for
          redeeming us by his blood. It will show that we love him not at all,
          but are ungrateful, false, and hypocritical. With all our true
          professions, if we flinch from persecution it will prove that we only
          want our price, and, like the traitor Judas, we too will sell our
          Master, not for thirty pieces of silver possibly, but to escape
          ridicule or avoid ill-will.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will become clear, also, that we prefer the praise of man to the
          approval of God. A smile from a face which is soon to die we value at
          a higher price than the love of God, or the Redeemer's approbation.
          Peter for a moment was more affected by the question of a silly maid
          than by his allegiance to his Lord, but how dreadful to fall into that
          condition deliberately, and think more of a man that shall die, and of
          the son of man that is but as a worm, than of the Lord our Maker and
          Judge, who alone is to be feared. Is not this folly, treason, and dire
          iniquity?
        </p>
        <p>
          To forsake the Lord through persecution is to set time before
          eternity, to barter heaven for this world's pleasures, to renounce
          eternal life for a few hours of ease, and to involve ourselves in
          endless misery rather than endure a stupid jest or a senseless jibe.
          It comes to that. Many a man has had life and death set before him,
          the life has been shaded with the cross, and the death has been gilded
          over with transient merriment, and he has chosen the everlasting death
          with its glitter in preference to eternal life with its momentary
          trial. May God grant we may never be of so insane a mind, for if we
          are, we shall be numbered with those mentioned in the Revelation, of
          whom it is said that |the fearful,| which is being interpreted the
          cowardly, |and the unbelieving, the abominable, and murderers, and
          whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars| -- for that
          is the class of persons with whom cowards are membered -- |shall have
          their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is
          the second death| (Revelation 21:8), from which death may the infinite
          mercy of God deliver us. Like true soldiers may we buckle on our
          harness and resolve that let the battle rage as it may, through divine
          grace we will not desert our colors. We prefer death itself to the
          disgrace of forsaking a cause so true, a doctrine so pure, a Savior so
          gracious, a Prince so noble, and so worthy of our most loyal service.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if left to ourselves we may fall into what is as bad as open
          apostasy. When we find the father, or the wife, or the friend
          answering us roughly, we may make a pitiful compromise between Christ
          and the world. I warn you solemnly against this above everything else.
          It has the look of being the prudent and proper thing to do. |Can I
          not please men and please God? May I not go a little way with Christ
          and a little way with the world?| O soul, if you attempt this you must
          fail, and moreover you will have chosen the roughest road of all, for
          if a man serves God, and serves him thoroughly, he will meet with many
          comforts to balance his crosses; and if a man serves Satan thoroughly
          he will enjoy whatever poor comfort is to be got out of sin; but if he
          goes betwixt and between he will feel the discomforts of both, and the
          pleasures of neither. Running the gauntlet on board ship is not worse
          than attempting to be friends with Christ and Satan at the same time.
          I believe many a professing woman has given way at first to her
          ungodly husband, where she should have been decided, and she has
          embittered all the rest of her life; and many a husband, many a son,
          many a man of business, has been undecided in a minor matter for peace
          sake, and from that very moment the other side has never believed in
          his sincerity, and having given an inch, the world has demanded its
          ell, and there has been an end to all liberty henceforth. If you yield
          a single point of honesty or true religion, the unconverted will not
          believe in you as they would have done if you had been firm
          throughout; men respect a thoroughbred Christian, but nobody has a
          good word for a mongrel. Be one thing or the other, either hot or
          cold, or Christ will reject you, and the world too. If a thing be
          right, do it; if you resolve to serve the Lord, do it, offend or
          please; and if, on the other hand, you prefer the service of Satan, do
          at least be honest enough not to pretend to be on the Lord's side.
          Remember the challenge of Elijah, |If God be God, serve him; if Baal
          be God, serve him;| but do not attempt a compromise, which will end in
          a miserable breakdown. Mark Antony drove two lions yoked together
          through the streets of Rome, but no Mark Antony could ever drive the
          lion of the tribe of Judah and the lion of the pit in a leash
          together. They will never agree. Be ye warned, then, against falling
          into the meanness of compromise, for compromise is nothing better than
          varnished rebellion against God, a mockery of his claims, and an
          insult to his judgment. May the grace of God keep us from this, for
          left to ourselves we shall fall into this snare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will tell you what you may do also, and I pray that the Holy Spirit
          may lead you to do it. You may take up humbly, but firmly, this
          decided stand: -- |If my father answer me roughly he must do so, but I
          have another Father who is in heaven, and I shall appeal to him. If
          the world condemn me, I shall accept its condemnation as a
          confirmation of that gracious verdict of acquittal which comes from
          the great Judge of all, for I do remember it is written, If the world
          hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you' and If ye were
          of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of
          the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
          hateth you.'| Be it ours to endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus
          Christ. May we count the reproach of Christ greater riches than all
          earth's treasures. Never may a coward blush defile our cheek because
          we are ashamed of Jesus; far rather may we be willing to be made a
          gazing-stock than for a moment think of turning aside from our Beloved
          Lord. False or fearful may we never be; firmly and calmly, with the
          confidence of a love which cannot falter, let us cleave to our Lord,
          even though all men should forsake him: --
        </p>
        <p>|Oh, learn to scorn the praise of men!</p>
        <p>Oh, learn to lose with God;</p>
        <p>For Jesus won the world through shame,</p>
        <p>And beckons thee His road.|</p>
        <p>
          II. The second head is WHAT THE TRIAL WILL, DO FOR US IF WE ARE HELPED
          TO BEAR UP UNDER IT. |What if thy father answer thee roughly? |First,
          it will grieve us. It is by no means pleasant to be opposed in doing
          right by those who ought to help us in it. It is very painful to flesh
          and blood to go contrary to those we love. Moreover, those who hate
          Christians have a way of putting their revilings so that they are sure
          to make us wince. They watch our weak points, and with very wonderful
          skill they turn their discoveries to account; trained by the old
          master of all malice, they are not slow to ply their lash where we are
          most tender. If one thing is more provoking than another, they will be
          sure to say it, and say it when we are least able to bear it. It may
          be they are very polite people, and if so, your refined persecutors
          have a very dainty way of cutting to the bone, and yet smiling all the
          while. They can say a malicious thing so delicately that you can
          neither resent it nor endure it. The art of persecuting has been so
          long studied by the seed of the serpent that they are perfect masters
          of it, and know how to make the iron enter into the soul. Do not be
          astonished, therefore, if you are sorely vexed, neither be amazed, as
          though some strange thing kind happened unto you. The martyrs did not
          suffer sham pains; the racks on which they were stretched were not
          beds of ease, nor were their prisons parlours of comfort. Their pains
          were agonies, their martyrdoms were torments. If you had sham griefs
          you might expect counterfeit joys; let the reality of your tribulation
          assure you of the reality of the coming glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opposition of your friends will try your sincerity. If you are a
          hypocrite you will soon yield to opposition. |The game is not worth
          the candle,| say you, and you will be off, and for the church's sake
          very likely it will be a blessing, for the wheat is all the better for
          being rid of the chaff, and if the wind of persecution can blow you
          away you are chaff. The rough answers of opponents will try your
          faith. You say you believe in Jesus: now we shall see if you do, for
          if you cannot bear a little trial from men and women, surely you will
          not be able to bear the worse trials from the devil and his angels.
          |If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then
          how easiest thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace,
          wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in
          the swelling of Jordan? |If you cannot bear the trials of life, how
          will you endure the ordeals of death?
        </p>
        <p>
          Persecution will try your love to Jesus. If you really love him you
          will cheerfully stand in the pillory of reproach with him, and when
          enemies have filth to hurl you will say, |Throw it upon me rather than
          upon him: if there is a hard thing to be said, say it about me rather
          than against my Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>|If on my face for his dear name</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach shall be,</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>For he'll remember me.|</p>
        <p>
          It will try your love, I say, and so it will all your graces in their
          turn; and this is good for you. These virtues will not increase in
          strength unless they are brought into action; and if they are not
          tested, who is to know of what sort they are? Your valiant soldier in
          quiet barracks at home could fight, no doubt, but how do you know till
          he has passed through a campaign? He who has charged up to the
          cannon's mouth, he who is adorned with a sabre cut across his brow,
          and bears many a wound beside, which he gained in the service of his
          king, he is brave beyond question. Good gold must expect to be tried
          in the fire, and these oppositions are sent on purpose that our faith,
          and our love, and all our graces should be proved genuine by enduring
          the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rough answers of those who should be our friends will keep us
          awake. I think it was Erskine who used to say, |Lord, deliver me from
          a sleepy devil|; and truly it is a prayer well worth praying. When
          everything goes on smoothly, and nobody ridicules us, we are very apt
          to be off our guard, but when we are stung by undeserved reproaches
          and insults, and when for our love we receive only anger or
          unkindness, we are not very likely to go to sleep. Such afflictions
          drive you to your knees. Perhaps you have read the story of Mr.
          Eraser, one of the ministers in Ross-shire, who had a cold, unfeeling
          woman for a wife; she was very cruel to him, and would never allow
          light or fire in his study, so that he had actually worn two holes in
          the plaster at the ends of his room, where his hand had touched as he
          paced to and fro in the dark. At a meeting of ministers who were not
          of his mind in divine things, one of them thought to make sport of him
          by remarking that he would no doubt very heartily agree with the toast
          of |Health to our wives.| To their astonishment he answered, |Mine has
          been a better wife to me than any of yours has been to you, she has
          sent me to my knees seven times a day, when I would not otherwise have
          gone, which is more than any of you can say of yours.| Personally I
          should greatly prefer not to have such a perpetual blister applied to
          me, but had the good Physician appointed me so severe a trial, I doubt
          not that he would have had good reason for it. Out of what men call
          weeds the wise man extracts a medicine, and out of these bitter trials
          the Lord produces a sacred tonic which braces us for a higher life of
          communion with himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trials from the enemies of Jesus confirm our faith. Those who are
          never tried usually possess a poor, tottering faith, but trial,
          especially persecution, is like the rough March wind which goes
          howling through the forest, and while the young oaks are almost torn
          up by the roots at first, it loosens the soil for them, and they send
          out more rootless, till they get such a firm grip that they defy the
          hurricane. That which shakes them at first strengthens them
          afterwards. The tried saint is the bold saint, and the firm saint;
          therefore take the rough answer joyfully, and look for good results
          from it. A little persecution for the church in England would be a
          grand thing for her. We have fallen on very velvety days, when zeal
          for God is rare and decision for truth scarcely to be met with. The
          church has made terms with the world, and goes to sleep, Satan rocking
          her cradle. Many a man professes to be a Christian, who is nothing
          better than a baptized worldling, and many a man sets up to be a
          minister of Christ who is a mere reader of other people's sermons, and
          a hireling who cares not for the sheep. The fan of persecution, if it
          purged the threshing floor of the church, would bestow great benefits
          upon her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rough speeches, too, will have this good effect upon genuine
          Christians, it will lead them to plead for those who utter them. I
          remember a good man who used to say of a certain swearing fellow who
          took delight to vex him with his horrid taunts and oaths, |Well, after
          all, I might forget to pray for him, but he reminds me of it, for he
          will not let me go by without a curse.| If our friends were all very
          smooth-spoken, and concealed their enmity to Christ, we might
          entertain a false hope about them, and we might not pray for them; but
          when we see that the old nature is there, and very rampant, it drives
          us to intercession for them, and who can tell but what the Lord may
          give us their souls as our reward?
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly opposition has another good effect, that it drives those
          subject to it into the truly separated path; they are known to be
          Christians, and proclaimed as such by their revilers. I do not think
          it is a bad thing, young man, when you go to that warehouse that they
          should advertise you as a Christian by crying out |Halloa, here comes
          one of the Methodist sort.| It is good for you to be known. If you are
          what you should be, you will not mind being labelled, nor being tested
          either. It will help to keep you right when temptations arise; and it
          will frequently deliver you from trials of a more fascinating kind;
          for, suppose they forsake your company because you are a Christian,
          will not that be well? Those who leave you on that account are a very
          gainful loss. An honorable lady, now with God, when she joined this
          church told me how after her baptism many of her aristocratic friends
          had ceased to call upon her, or invite her to their houses. I
          congratulated her upon it, for it rendered it all the easier for her
          to select her own company. Her real worth of character and kindness of
          spirit soon won back all who were worth having, and the rest were
          happily removed. Such as shun you for following the Lord are persons
          whom you yourself might shun. We gain nothing by the love of those who
          love not God.
        </p>
        <p>
          One good effect of being persecuted at home is this, it makes you
          gentler abroad. If, my brother Christian, you have those at home who
          make you unhappy, if you are a wise man you will be the better ably to
          have patience with outsiders. Men wondered why Socrates was so patient
          with his pupils, and so good-tempered, but he ascribed it to having
          been hardened by the opposition of others, by being schooled at home
          by his shrewish wife, Xanthippe. Perhaps you will have the greater
          patience with those who scoff, and the greater sympathy with those who
          are scoffed at, from having had your share in the common lot of the
          saints. Thus to you as to Samson, out of the eater cometh forth meat,
          and out of the strong cometh forth sweetness. This lion roars upon
          you, but the day shall come when you will find honey in it, and bless
          the name of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. My third point is, HOW SHOULD YOU BEHAVE UNDER THE TRIAL? May the
          Holy Spirit enable you to act very discreetly as well as decidedly.
          Never court opposition. God forbid we should do so. Some zealots seem
          bent on making religion objectionable. The cup we hold to a sinful
          world is in itself repugnant enough to fallen nature; there can be no
          wisdom in making it yet more objectionable by presenting it with a
          scowling face. It is as well when you have medicine to give to a child
          to show him a piece of sugar too: so let your kindness, and
          cheerfulness, and gentleness sweeten that which the world is not very
          likely to receive anyhow, but which it will the less resent if you
          present it with love, showing a desire to live peaceably with all men,
          and to consult the comfort of others rather than your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then endure whatever you have to endure with the greatest possible
          meekness. There was a farmer whose wife was very irritated with him
          because of his attending a dissenting place of worship, and joining
          with Christian people. She often declared that she would not bear it
          much longer, but he was very patient, and made no harsh reply to her.
          One day she fetched him out of the harvest field, and said, |Now it is
          come to this; you will give up those people, or give me up|; and she
          brought out a web of cloth and said, |Now you take half of this and
          I'll take the other half; for I am going.| He said, |No, my dear, you
          are welcome to it all. You have always been a very good industrious
          wife, take it all.| Then she proposed taking a part of their household
          goods and settling everything for a final separation, but again he
          said, |Take all there is. If you will go away take everything you
          like, for I should not wish you to be uncomfortable; and come back
          again whenever you please, I shall always be glad to see you.| Seeing
          that he talked in that way, she said, |Do you mean me to go?| |No,|
          said he, |it is your own wish, not mine. I cannot give up my religion,
          but anything else I can do to make you stay and be happy, I will do.|
          This was too much for her, she resolved to cease her opposition, and
          in a short time went with her husband to the place of worship, and
          became herself a believer. This is the surest way to victory. Yield
          everything but what it would be wrong to yield. Never grow angry. Keep
          cool, and let the railing be all on one side. There was a poor godly
          woman who used to attend the ministry of Mr. Robinson, of Leicester,
          and her husband, a very coarse brutal man, said to her one day in his
          wrath, |If you ever go to St. Mary's church again I'll cut both your
          legs off.| He was a dreadful man, and equal to any violence, but on
          the next occasion of worship his wife went as aforetime. As she came
          home, she commended herself to the care of God, expecting to be
          assailed. Her husband said to her, |Where have you been?| |I have been
          to St. Mary's church,| said she. With that he felled her to the ground
          with a terrible blow on the face. Rising up, she gently said, |If you
          strike me on the other side I shall as freely forgive you as I do
          now.| She had been a very passionate woman before conversion, and had
          been accustomed to give her husband as good as he could send, and
          therefore he was struck with her gentleness. |Where did you learn this
          patience?| said he. Her reply was, |By God's grace I learned it at St.
          Mary's.| |Then you may go as often as you like.| Presently he went
          also, and the war was over. There is nothing like meekness. It will
          conquer the strongest.
        </p>
        <p>
          After bearing with meekness return good for evil. For creel words
          return warmer love and increased kindness. The most renowned weapon
          for a Christian to fight his antagonists with is that of overcoming
          evil with good. Evil to evil is beastlike, and no Christian will
          indulge in it; but good for evil is Christlike, and we must practice
          it. I think I have before told you the story of the husband who was a
          very loose, gay, depraved, man of the world, but he had a wife who for
          many years bore with his ridicule and unkindness, praying for him day
          and night, though no change came over him, except that he grew even
          more bold in sin. One night, being at a drunken feast with a number of
          his boon companions, he boasted that his wife would do anything he
          wished, she was as submissive as a lamb. |Now,| he said, |she has gone
          to bed hours ago; but if I take you all to my house at once she will
          get up and entertain you and make no complaint.| |Not she,| they said,
          and the matter ended in a bet, and away they went. It was in the small
          hours of the night, but in a few minutes she was up, and remarked that
          she was glad that she had two chickens ready, and if they would wait a
          little she would soon have a supper spread for them. They waited, and
          ere long, at that late hour, the table was spread, and she took her
          place at it as if it was quite an ordinary matter, acting the part of
          hostess with cheerfulness. One of the company, touched in his better
          feelings, exclaimed, |Madam, we ought to apologize to you for
          intruding upon you in this way, and at such an hour, but I am at a
          loss to understand how it is you receive us so cheerfully, for being a
          religious person you cannot approve of our conduct.| Her reply was, |I
          and my husband were both formerly unconverted, but, by the grace of
          God, I am now a believer in the Lord Jesus. I have daily prayed for my
          husband, and I have done all I can to bring him to a better mind, but
          as I see no charge in him, I fear he will be lost for ever; and I have
          made up my mind to make him as happy as I can while he is here.| They
          went away, and her husband said, |Do you really think I shall be
          unhappy for ever?| |I fear so,| said she, |I would to God you would
          repent and seek forgiveness.| That night patience accomplished her
          desire. He was soon found with her on the way to heaven. Yield on no
          point of principle, but in everything else be willing to bear
          reproach, and to be despised and mocked at for Christ's sake. In hoc
          signo vinces -- by the cross patiently borne thou couquerest. |This is
          a hard saying,| says one. I know it is, but grace can make the
          heaviest burden light, and transform duty into delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here let one also remark that to this gentle endurance there must be
          added by the persecuted Christian much exactness of life. We must be
          very particular when such lynx-eyes are upon us, because if they can
          find us trespassing they will pounce upon us at once. If it is only a
          little wrong, a thing which they would not have noticed in anybody
          else, they will magnify it and raise quite a clamor about it. |Ah,
          that is your religion,| say they, as if we claimed to be absolutely
          perfect. Be watchful, therefore, walk circumspectly, do not put
          yourself into their hands; let them have nothing to say against you
          save only upon the point of your religion. Nothing bathes opponent)
          like integrity, truthfulness, and holiness: they long to speak against
          you, but cannot find a fair opportunity. Take care that you daily pray
          for grace to keep your temper, for if you fail there they will boast
          of having conquered you, and will assail you again in the same way.
          Ask for grace to be patient, and say as little as you can, except to
          God. Pray much for them, for prayer is still heard, and how knowest
          thou, O believing woman, but thou mayst save thy unbelieving husband?
          Only watch on and pray on, and a blessing will come.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. In DOING ALL THIS WHAT COMFORT MAY YOU EXPECT? You may have this
          for your comfort, that the persecutor is in God's hands. He cannot do
          more than God lets him, and if God permits him to annoy, you may
          cheerfully bear it. Next, remember, if you keep your conscience clear
          it is a great joy. Conscience is a little bird that sings more sweetly
          than any lark or nightingale. Rough answers outside need not trouble
          you while within there is the answer of a good conscience towards God.
          Injure your conscience and you lose that consolation; preserve it from
          evil and you must be happy. Remember that by patiently enduring and
          persevering you will have fellowship with the grandest spirits that
          ever lived. You cannot be a martyr and wear the blood-red crown in
          these days, but you can at least suffer as far as you are called to
          do: grace enabling you, you may have a share in the martyr's honors.
          |Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
          for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that if you have extraordinary troubles Jesus will be
          doubly near to you. This is the greatest comfort of all, for in all
          your afflictions he is afflicted. You will find his presence in the
          ordinances to be very delightful. Those stolen waters which he gives
          you in secret fellowship are very choice, those morsels which you get
          by stealth, how sweet they are! The old covenantors said they never
          worshipped God with so much joy as in the glens and among the hills
          when Claverhouse's dragoons were after them. The living is very
          refreshing to the Lord's hunted harts. His bosom is very soft and warm
          for those who are rejected of all men for his sake. He has a
          marvellous way of unveiling his face to those whose faces are covered
          with shame because of their love to him. Oh, be content, dear friends,
          to watch with your Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the sweet thought also that you are doing more good where you
          are than if you were placed altogether among the godly. Yonder light,
          set up in mid ocean on the Eddystone rock, see how the storm sweeps
          around it, and the waters leap over it, threatening to put out its
          flame, but shall the light complain? Standing where it is, beaten by
          the Atlantic rollers, and braving the full fury of the storm, it is
          doing more good than if it were set up in Hyde Park for my lords and
          ladies to look at. The persecuted saint occupies a place where he
          warns and enlightens, and therefore suffers. He is like an advanced
          guard, to whom the place of danger is the place of honor: only let him
          ask for strength to bear and forbear, and he shall have glory at the
          last. Remember the rougher the road the sweeter the rest, and the
          greater the suffering the brighter the crown at the last. Those who
          have to bear most for Jesus will be those to whom he will most sweetly
          say, |Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of
          thy Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, brethren, if you have a little rough language to put up with, what
          is it, compared with what many of the Lord's afflicted ones have to
          endure? I will tell you a little incident bearing upon that point, and
          then have done. Yesterday the postman brought me, amongst many others,
          a letter from Australia, which I prize more than any that have come to
          hand for a long while; it has touched my heart, and when you hear it
          you will not wonder. It is written at the desire of a man who is
          described by the gentleman who writes for him in the following terms:
          |I have known the writer for near eight years, during which time he
          has been quite helpless, being paralyzed, he has had one leg cut off,
          the sight has left his eye, he cannot move hand or feet; as he is
          placed on his bed so must he lie and endure the annoyance of flies, or
          anything that may molest him. So that I am sure you will be pleased to
          be the means of giving comfort to such an one, and yet he is mostly
          rejoicing; and few are more apt to teach and exhort those who come to
          see him, and direct them to suitable portions of God's word far their
          reading.| Now this poor man, who has been helpless ever since the year
          1858, or sixteen long years, writes me thus: |Being moved by the Holy
          Spirit I send you these few lines to thank you for the benefit I have
          received by reading your sermons. In the year 1850 I was brought to
          the knowledge of the truth, and found peace through believing in
          Jesus. In 1858 I met with a serious accident, so that I was not able
          to earn my bread, but trusting in the Lord he has led me in the right
          way. In 1866 it pleased him to confine me entirely to my bed. I bless
          his Holy Name that I can say I am bound by the cords of his love, that
          he has upheld and comforted me through all my long confinement, and
          enabled me to rejoice in hope of his glory; and the reading of your
          excellent sermons, which privilege I have enjoyed for some years,
          having been a source of great comfort and delight to my soul, causing
          me to soar on high and enjoy sweet communion, I am constrained by love
          to send you this acknowledgment, hoping that perhaps you may be
          cheered a little by it in your arduous labors; and if our heavenly
          Father see fit, this my testimony to his faithfulness may be blessed
          by him to the comfort and encouragement of some afflicted ones in your
          flock, as I know that all these things work together for good to them
          that love God.| Think of this unselfish sufferer having a letter
          written to comfort me. One would have thought he needed comforting
          himself, but the Lord so cheers him that, instead of asking for
          consolation, he does not mention in his letter that he has lost his
          leg, or that he is paralyzed, or has lost his sight. He only tells me
          of his joy and peace. Now, if children of God in such extremities can
          yet bear testimony to his faithfulness, are you going to run away
          because some foolish person or other sneers at you? Will you in
          cowardly fashion desert the standard because fools point their fingers
          at you? If so, are you made of the same stuff as the true saints? Have
          you the same backbone of divine grace as they? Assuredly not. May the
          Lord in his infinite mercy give you such a sound conversion that,
          whatever trial comes, you may still sing, |Yet will I rejoice in the
          Lord and glory in the God of my salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          If I am addressing any one who has persecuted God's saints in any way,
          let me say, |Mind what you are at; there are many things a man will
          bear, but if you meddle with his children it will stir his soul, that
          is a tender point with all fathers.| Nothing provokes the Lord like
          interfering with his children. Mind what you are at. And, oh, I pray
          the Lord, if you have done it ignorantly, really thinking them to be
          wrong, and only scoffing at them because you thought them hypocrites,
          may he that spake out of heaven to Saul, and said, |Why persecutest
          thou me?| let you see that you have really been wounding Jesus
          himself. May he make you see that those tears which you have forced
          from that faithful woman, and those sleepless nights which you have
          caused to that earnest man, were so much of evil done unto Christ, for
          which he will reckon with you at the last. Turn you unto the Lord
          Jesus, and may the Holy Spirit grant you to repent of this your
          wickedness, for Jesus is willing to receive and bless even you, as he
          did Paul of old. Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you also shall be
          saved. God bless you all, for Christ's sake. Amen.
