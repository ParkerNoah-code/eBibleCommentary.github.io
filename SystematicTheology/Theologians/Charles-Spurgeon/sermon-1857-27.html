        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.133)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 24, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God." -- Hebrews
          4:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE Apostle proved, in the former part of this and the latter part of
          the preceding chapter, that there was a rest promised in Scripture
          called the rest of God. He proved that Israel did not attain that rest
          for God sware in his wrath, saying, "They shall not enter into my
          rest." He proved that this did not merely refer to the rest of the
          land of Canaan; for he says that after they were in Canaan, David
          himself speaks again in after ages concerning the rest of God, as a
          thing which was yet to come. Again he proves, that "seeing those to
          whom it was promised did not enter in, because of unbelief, and it
          remaineth that some must enter in, therefore," saith he, "there
          remaineth a rest to the people of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My rest," says God: the rest of God! Something more wonderful than
          any other kind of rest. In my text it is (in the original) called the
          Sabbatism -- not the Sabbath, but the rest of the Sabbath -- not the
          outward ritual of the Sabbath, which was binding upon the Jew, but the
          inward spirit of the sabbath, which is the joy and delight of the
          Christian. "There remaineth therefore" -- because others have not had
          it, because some are to have it -- "There remaineth therefore a rest
          to the people of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this rest, I believe, is partly enjoyed on earth. "We that have
          believed do enter into rest," for we have ceased from our own works,
          as God did from his. But the full fruition and rich enjoyment of it
          remains in the future and eternal state of the beatified on the other
          side the stream of death. Of that it shall be our delightful work to
          talk a little this morning. And oh! if God should help me to raise but
          one of his feeble saints on the wings of love to look within the veil,
          and see the joys of the future, I shall be well contented to have made
          the joy-bells ring in one heart at least, to have set one eye flashing
          with joy, and to have made one spirit light with gladness. The rest of
          heaven! I shall try first to exhibit it and then to extol it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, I shall try to EXHIBIT the rest of heaven; and in doing so I
          shall exhibit it, first by way of contrast, and then by way of
          comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To begin then, I shall try to exhibit heaven by way of contrast.
          The rest of the righteous in glory is now to be contrasted with
          certain other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will contrast it, first, with the best estate of the worldling and
          the sinner. The worldling has frequently a good estate. Sometimes his
          vats overflow, his barns are crammed, his heart is full of joy and
          gladness, there are periods with him when he flourishes like a green
          bay tree, when field is added to field, and house to house, when he
          pulls down his barns and builds greater, when the river of his joy is
          full, and the ocean of his life is at its flood with joy and
          blessedness. But sh! beloved, the state of the righteous up there is
          not for a moment to be compared with the joy of the sinner; -- it is
          so infinitely superior, so far surpassing it, that it seems impossible
          that I should even try to set it in contrast. The worldling, when his
          corn and his wine are increased, has a glad eye and A joyous heart;
          but even then he has the direful thought that he may soon leave his
          wealth. He remembers that death may cut him down, that he must then
          leave all his fair riches behind him, and sleep like the meanest of
          the land in a narrow coffin, six feet of earth his only heritage. Not
          so the righteous man: he has obtained an inheritance which is
          "undefiled, and that fadeth not away." He knows that there is no
          possibility of his losing his joys;
        </p>
        <p>"He is securely blessed,</p>
        <p>Has done with sin, and care, and woe,</p>
        <p>And doth with Jesus rest."</p>
        <p>
          He has no dread of dissolution, no fear of the coffin or the shroud,
          and so far the life of heaven is not worthy to be put in comparison
          with the life of the sinner. But the worldling, with all his joys,
          always has a worm at the root of them. Ye votaries of pleasure! the
          blush upon your cheek is frequently but a painted deception. Ah! ye
          sons and daughters of gaiety! the light foot of your dance is not in
          keeping with the heavy woe of your miserable spirits. Do you not
          confess that if by the excitement of company you for awhile forget the
          emptiness of your heart, yet silence, and the hour of midnight, and
          the waking watches of your bed, bid you sometimes think that there
          must be something more blessed than the mere wanderings of gaiety in
          which you now are found? You are trying the world some of you; speak
          then! Do you not find it empty? Might it not be said of the world, as
          an old philosopher said of it when he represented a man with it in his
          hands smiting it and listening to its ringing? Touch it, touch it I
          make it ring again; it is empty. So it is with the world. You know it
          is so; and if you know it not as yet, the day is coming when after you
          have plucked the sweets you shall be pricked with the thorn, and when
          you shall find that all is unsatisfactory that does not begin and end
          with God. Not so the Christian in heaven. For him there are no nights;
          and if there be times of solitude and rest, he is ever filled with
          ecstatic joy. His river floweth ever full of bliss, without one pebble
          of sorrow over which it ripples, he has no aching conscience, no
          "aching void the world can never fill." He is supremely blessed,
          satisfied with favor, and full with the goodness of the Lord. And ye
          know, ye worldlings, that your best estates often bring you great
          anxiety, lest they should depart from you. You are not so foolish yet
          as to conceive that riches endure for ever. You men of business are
          frequently led to see that riches take to themselves wings and fly
          away. You have accumulated a fortune; but you find it is harder to
          retain than it is to get. You are seeking after a competence; but you
          find that you grasp at shadows that flit away -- that the everlasting
          vicissitudes of business and the constant changes of mankind are
          causes of prudent alarm to you, for you fear that you shall lose your
          gods, and that your gourd shall be eaten by the worm, and fall down,
          and your shadow shall be taken away. Not so the Christian. He lives in
          a house that can never hasten to decay; he wears a crown, the glister
          of which shall never be dim; he has a garment which shall never wax
          old; he has bliss that never can depart from him, nor he from it. He
          is now firmly set, like a pillar of marble in the temple of God. The
          world may rock, the tempest may sway it like the cradle of a child;
          but there, above the world, above the perpetual revolution of the
          stars, the Christian stands secure and immovable; trio rest infinitely
          surpasseth yours. Ah I ye shall go to all the fabled luxuries of
          eastern monarchs, and see their dainty couches and their luscious
          wines. Behold the riches of their pleasantry! How charming is the
          music that lulls them to their sleep! How gently moves the fan that
          wafts them to their slumber! But ah!
        </p>
        <p>"I would not change my blest estate</p>
        <p>For all the world calls good or great;</p>
        <p>And whilst my faith can keep her hold</p>
        <p>I envy not the sinner's gold" --</p>
        <p>
          I reckon that the richest, highest, noblest condition of a worldly man
          is not worthy to be compared with the joy-that is to be revealed
          hereafter in the breasts of those who are sanctified. O ye spendthrift
          mortals, that for one merry dance and a giddy life will lose a world
          of joys! O fools that catch at bubbles and lose realities! O ten
          thousand times mad men, that grasp at shadows and lose the substance!
          What! sirs do you think a little round of pleasure, a few years of
          gaiety and merriment, just a little time of the tossing about, to and
          fro, of worldly business, is a compensation for eternal ages of
          unfading bliss! Oh! how foolish will you conceive yourselves to be,
          when you are in the next state, when cast away from heaven you will
          see the saints blessed! I think I hear your mournful soliloquy, "Oh!
          how cheaply did I sell my soul! What a poor price did I get for all I
          have now lost! I have lost the palace and the crown, and the joy and
          bliss for ever, and am shut up in hell! And for what did I lose it? I
          lost it for the lascivious wanton kiss. I lost it for the merry
          drunken song; I lost it for just a few short years of pleasures,
          which, after all, were only painted pleasures!" Oh! I think I see you
          in your lost estates, cursing yourselves, rending your hair, that you
          should have sold heaven for counters and have changed away eternal
          life for pitiful farthings, which were spent quickly and which burned
          your hand in the spending of them! Oh! that ye were wise, that ye
          would weigh those things, and reckon that a life of the greatest
          happiness here is nothing compared with the glorious hereafter: "There
          remaineth a rest to the people of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me put it in more pleasing contrast. I shall contrast the rest
          of the believer above with the miserable estate of the believer
          sometimes here below. Christians have their sorrows. Suns have their
          spots skies have their clouds, and Christians have their sorrows too.
          But oh! how different will the state of the righteous be up there,
          from the state of the believer here! Here the Christian has to suffer
          anxiety. He is anxious to serve his Master, to do his best in his day
          and generation His constant cry is -- "Help me to serve thee, O my
          God," and he looks out, day after day, with a strong desire for
          opportunities of doing good. Ah! if he be an active Christian, he will
          have much labor, much toil, in endeavoring to serve his Master; and
          there will be times when he will say, "My soul is in haste to be gone;
          I am not wearied of the labor, I am wearied in it. To toil thus in the
          sun, though for a good Master, is not the thing that just now I
          desire." Ah! Christian, the day shall soon be over, and thou shalt no
          longer have to toil; the sun is nearing the horizon; it shall rise
          again with a brighter day than thou hast ever seen before. There, up
          in heaven, Luther has no more to face a thundering Vatican; Paul has
          no more to run from city to city, and continent to continent, there
          Baxter has no more to toil in his pulpit, to preach with a broken
          heart to hard hearted sinners, there no longer has Knox to "cry aloud
          and spare not" against the immoralities of the false church; there no
          more shall be the strained lung, and the tired throat, and the aching
          eye; no more shall the sunday school teacher feel that his sabbath is
          a day of joyful weariness; no more shall the tract distributor meet
          with rebuffs. No, there, those who have served their country and their
          God, those who have toiled for man's welfare, with all their might,
          shall enter into everlasting rest. Sheathed is the sword, the banner
          is furled, the fight is over, the victory won; and they rest from
          their labors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, too, the Christian is always sailing onward, he is always in
          motion he feels that he has not yet attained. Like Paul he can say
          "Forgetting the things that are behind, I press forward to that which
          is before." But there his weary head shall be crowned with unfading
          light. There the ship that has been speeding onward shall furl its
          sails in the port of eternal bliss. There he who, like an arrow, has
          sped his way shall be fixed for ever in the target. There we who like
          fleeting clouds were driven by every wind, shall gently distil in one
          perennial shower of everlasting joy. There is no progress, no motion
          there; they are at rest, they have attained the summit of the
          mountain, they have ascended to their God and our God. Higher they
          cannot go; they have reached the Ultima Thule, there are no fortunate
          islands beyond; this is life's utmost end of happiness; and they furl
          their sails, rest from their labors, and enjoy themselves for aye.
          There is a difference between the progress of earth and the perfect
          fixity of the rest of hearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, too, the believer is often the subject of doubt and fear. "Am I
          his or am I not?" is often the cry. He trembleth lest he should be
          deceived, at times he almost despairs, and is inclined not to put his
          name down as one of the children of God. Dark insinuations are
          whispered into his ears, he thinks that God's mercy is clean gone for
          ever, and that he will not be mindful of him any more. Again, his sins
          some times upbraid him, and he thinks God will not have mercy on him.
          He has a poor fainting heart; he is like Ready-to-halt, he has to go
          all his way on crutches; he has a poor feeble mind, always tumbling
          down over a straw, and fearing one day he shall be drowned in a
          cart-rut. Though the lions are chained he is as much afraid of them as
          if they were loose. Hill Difficulty often afrights him; going down
          into the valley of humiliation is often troublesome work to him; but
          there, there are no hills to climb, no dragons to fight, no foes to
          conquer, no dangers to dread. Ready-to-halt, when he dies, will bury
          his crutches, and Feeblemind will leave his feebleness behind him;
          Fearing will never fear again; poor Doubting-heart will learn
          confidently to believe. Oh, joy above all joys! The day is coming when
          I shall "know as I am known," when I shall not want to ask whether I
          am his or not, for in his arms encircled, there shall be no room for
          doubt. Oh! Christian, you think there are slips between your lips and
          that cup of joy, but when you grasp the handle of that cup with your
          hand, and are drinking draughts of ineffable delight, then you will
          have no doubt or fear.
        </p>
        <p>"There you shall see his face,</p>
        <p>And never, never sin</p>
        <p>There from the rivers of his grace,</p>
        <p>Drink endless pleasures in."</p>
        <p>
          Here, too, on earth, the Christian has to suffer; here he has the
          aching head and the pained body; his limbs may be bruised or broken,
          disease may rack him with torture; he may be an afflicted one from his
          birth, he may have lost an eye or an ear or he may have lost many of
          his powers; or if not, being of a weakly constitution he may have to
          spend the most of his days and nights upon the bed of weariness. Or if
          his body be sound, yet what suffering he has in his mind! Conflicts
          between depravity and gross temptations from the evil one, assaults of
          hell, perpetual attacks of divers kinds, from the world, the flesh,
          and the devil. But there, no aching head no weary heart; there no
          palsied arm, no brow ploughed with the furrows of old age; there the
          lost limb shall be recovered, and old age shall find itself endowed
          with perpetual youth, there the infirmities of the flesh shall be left
          behind, given to the worm and devoured by corruption. There they shall
          flit, as on the wings of angels, from pole to pole, and from place to
          place, without weariness or anguish; there they shall never need to
          lie upon the bed of rest, or the bed of suffering, for day without
          night, with joy unflagging, they shall circle God's throne rejoicing,
          and ever praise him who hath said, "The inhabitants there shall never
          be sick."
        </p>
        <p>
          There, too, they shall be free from persecution. Here Sicilian
          Vespers, and St. Bartholomew, and Smithfield, are well-known words;
          but there shall be none to taunt them with a cruel word, or touch them
          with a cruel hand. There emperors and kings are not known, and those
          who had power to torture them cease to be. They are in the society of
          saints; they shall be free from all the idle converse of the wicked,
          and from their cruel jeers set free for ever. Set free from
          persecution! Ye army of martyrs, ye were slain, ye were torn asunder,
          ye were cast to wild beasts, ye wandered about in sheep skins and
          goats' skins, destitute, afflicted, and tormented. I see you now, a
          mighty host. The habiliments you wear are torn with thorns; your faces
          are scarred with sufferings; I see you at your stakes, and on your
          crosses; I hear your words of submission on your racks, I see you in
          your prisons, I behold you in your pillories -- but
        </p>
        <p>"Now ye are arrayed in white,</p>
        <p>Brighter than the noonday-sun</p>
        <p>Fairest of the sons of light,</p>
        <p>Nearest the eternal throne."</p>
        <p>
          These are they, who "for their Master died, who love the cross and
          crown;" they waded through seas of blood, in order to obtain the
          inheritance; and there they are, with the blood-red crown of martyrdom
          about their heads, that ruby brightness, far excelling every other.
          Yes, there is no persecution there. "There remaineth a rest for the
          people of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! in this mortal state the child of God is also subject to sin;
          even he faileth in his duty, and wandereth from his God; even he doth
          not walk in all the law of his God blameless, though he desireth to do
          it. Sin now troubleth him constantly; but there sin is dead, there
          they have no temptation to sin, from without or from within, but they
          are perfectly free to serve their Master. Here the child of God has
          sometimes to weep repentingly of his backslidings; but there they
          never shed tears of penitence, for they have never cause to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          And last of all, here, the child of God has to wet the cold ashes of
          his relatives with tears; here he has to bid adieu to all that is
          lovely and fair of mortal race; here it is he hears, "earth to earth,
          and dust to dust, and ashes to ashes," while the solemn music of the
          dust upon the coffin lid beats doleful time to those words. Here is
          the mother buried, the child snatched away, the husband rent from the
          bosom of a loving wife, the brother parted from the sister. The plate
          upon the coffin, the last coat of arms of earth, earth's last emblems
          are here ever before our eyes. But there never once shall be heard the
          toll of the funeral bell, no hearse with plumes has ever darkened the
          streets of gold, no emblems of sorrow have ever intruded into the
          homes of the immortal, they are strangers to the meaning of death;
          they cannot die -- they live for ever, having no power to decay, and
          no possibility of corruption. Oh! rest of the righteous, how blest art
          thou, where families shall again be bound up in one bundle, where
          parted friends shall again meet to part no more, and where the whole
          church of Christ united in one mighty circle, shall together praise
          God and the Lamb throughout eternal ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, I have tried thus to set the rest of the righteous in the
          way of contrast; I feel I have failed. Poor are the words I can utter
          to tell you of immortal things Even holy Baxter himself, when he wrote
          of the "Saints' Rest," paused and said; "But these are only tinklings
          compared with the full thunders of heaven." I cannot tell you, dear
          friends, nor can mortal tell, what God hath prepared for them that
          love him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And now I shall try very briefly to exhibit this contrast in the
          way of comparison. The Christian hath some rest here, but nothing
          compared with the rest which is to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is the rest of the church. When the believer joins the church of
          God, and becomes united with them, he may expect to rest. The good old
          writer of the "Pilgrim's Progress," says, that when the weary pilgrims
          were once admitted to the house Beautiful, they were shown to sleep in
          a chamber called peace," or "rest." The church-member at the Lord's
          table has a sweet enjoyment of rest in fellowship with the saints; but
          ah! up there the rest of church fellowship far surpasses anything that
          is known here; for there are no divisions there, no angry words at the
          church meetings, no harsh thoughts of one another, no bickerings about
          doctrine, no fightings about practice. There Baptist, and
          Presbyterian, and Independent, and Wesleyan, and Episcopalian, serving
          the same Lord, and having been washed in the same blood, sing the same
          song, and are all joined in one. There pastors and deacons never look
          coolly on each other; no haughty prelates here, no lofty-minded
          ministers there, but all meek and lowly, all knit together in
          brotherhood; they have a rest which surpasseth all the rest of the
          church on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, again, a rest of faith which a Christian enjoys; a sweet
          rest. Many of us have known it. We have known what it is, when the
          billows of trouble have run high, to hide ourselves in the breast of
          Christ, and feel secure. We have cast our anchor deep into the rocks
          of God's promise, we have gone to sleep in our chamber and have not
          feared the tempest, we have looked at tribulation, and have smiled at,
          we have looked at death himself, and have laughed him to scorn, we
          have had much trust by Christian faith that, dauntless and fearless,
          nothing could move us. Yes, in the midst of calumny, reproach, slander
          and contempt, we have said, "I shall not be moved, for God is on my
          side." But the rest up there is better still more unruffled, more
          sweet, more perfectly calm, more enduring, and more lasting than even
          the rest of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, again, the Christian sometimes has the blessed rest of communion.
          There are happy moments when he puts his head on the Saviour's breast
          -- when, like John, he feels that he is close to the Saviour's heart,
          and there he sleeps. "God giveth his beloved sleep;" not the sleep of
          unconsciousness, but the sleep of joy. Happy, happy, happy are the
          dreams we have had on the couch of communion; blessed have been the
          times, when, like the spouse in Solomon's song, we could say of
          Christ, "His left hand was under my head, and with his right hand did
          he embrace me."
        </p>
        <p>"But sweeter still the fountain head,</p>
        <p>Though sweet may be the stream;"</p>
        <p>
          When we shall have plunged into a very bath of joy, we shall have
          found the delights even of communion on earth to have been but the
          dipping of the finger in the cup, but the dipping of the bread in the
          dish, whereas heaven itself shall be the participation of the whole of
          the joy, and not the mere antepast of it. Here we sometimes enter into
          the portico of happiness, there we shall go into the presence chamber
          of the King, here we look over the hedge and see the flowers in
          heaven's garden, there we shall walk between the beds of bliss, and
          pluck fresh flowers at each step; here we just look and see the
          sunlight of heaven in the distance, like the lamps of the
          thousand-gated cities shining afar off, but there we shall see them in
          all their blaze of splendor, here we listen to the whisperings of
          heaven's melody, borne by winds from afar; but there, entranced,
          amidst the grand oratorio of the blessed, we shall join in the
          everlasting hallelujah to the great Messiah, the God, the I AM. Oh!
          again I say, do we not wish to mount aloft, and fly away, to enter
          into the rest which remaineth to the people of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, yet more briefly, and then we shall have done. I am to
          endeavor to EXTOL this rest, as I have tried to EXHIBIT it. I would
          extol this rest for many reasons; and oh! that I were eloquent, that I
          might extol it as it deserves! Oh! for the lip of angel, and the
          burning tongue of cherub, to talk now of the bliss of the sanctified
          and of the rest of God's people!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is, first, a perfect rest. They are wholly at rest in heaven. Here
          rest is but partial. I hope in a little time to cease from every-day
          labors for a season, but then the head will think, and the mind may be
          looking forward to prospective labor, and whilst the body is still,
          the brain will yet be in motion. Here, on Sabbath days a vast
          multitude of you sit in God's house, but many of you are obliged to
          stand, and rest but little except in your mind, and even when the mind
          is at rest the body is wearied with the toil of standing. You have a
          weary mile perhaps, many miles, to go to your homes on the Sabbath
          day. And let the Sabbatarian say what he will, you may work on the
          Sabbath day, if you work for God; and this Sabbath day's work of going
          to the house of God is work for God, and God accepts it. For
          yourselves you may not labor, God commands you to rest, but if you
          have to toil these three, these four, these five, these six miles, as
          many of you have done, I will not and I must not blame you. "The
          priests in the sanctuary profane the Sabbath, and are blameless." It
          is toil and labor, it is true but it is for a good cause -- for your
          Master. But there, my friends, the rest is perfect; the body there
          rests perpetually, the mind too always rests; though the inhabitants
          are always busy, always serving God, yet they are never weary, never
          toil-worn, never fagged; they never fling themselves upon their
          couches at the end of the day, and cry, "Oh! when shall I be away from
          this land of oil?" They I never stand up in the burning sunlight, and
          wipe the hot sweat from their brow; they never rise from their bed in
          the morning, half refreshed, to go to laborious study. No, they are
          perfectly at rest, stretched on the couch of eternal joy. They know
          not the semblance of a tear; they have done with sin, and care, and
          woe, and, with their Saviour rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is a seasonable rest. How seasonable it will be for some of
          you! Ye sons of wealth, ye know not the toils of the poor; the
          horny-handed laborer, perhaps, you have not seen, and you not how he
          has to tug and to toil. Among my congregation I have many of a class,
          upon whom I have always looked with pity, poor women who must rise
          to-morrow morning with the sun, and begin that everlasting "stitch,
          stitch," that works their finger to the bone. And from Monday morning
          till Saturday night, many of you, my members, and multitudes of you,
          my hearers, will not be able to lay aside your needle and your thread,
          except when, tired and weary, you fall back on your chair, and are
          lulled to sleep by your thoughts of labor! Oh! how seasonable will
          heaven's rest be to you! Oh! how glad will you be, when you get there,
          to find that there are no Monday mornings, no more toil for you, but
          rest, eternal rest! Others of you have hard manual labor to perform;
          you have reason to thank God that you are strong enough to do it and
          you are not ashamed of your work; for labor is an honor to a man. But
          still there are times when you say, "I wish I were not so dragged to
          death by the business of London life." We have but little rest in this
          huge city, our day is longer, and our work is harder than our friends
          in the country. You have sometimes sighed to go into the green fields
          for a breath of fresh air, you have longed to hear the song of the
          sweet birds that used to wake you when you were lads; you have
          regretted the bright blue sky, the beauteous flowers, and the thousand
          charms of a country life. And perhaps, you will never get beyond this
          smoky city, but remember, when you get up there, "sweet fields arrayed
          in living green" and "rivers of delight" shall be the place where you
          shall rest, you shall have all the joys you can conceive of in that
          home of happiness; and though worn and weary, you come to your grave,
          tottering on your staff; having journeyed through the wilderness of
          life, like a weary camel, which has only stopped on the Sabbath to sip
          its little water at the well, or to be baited at the oasis, there you
          will arrive at your journey's end, laden with gold and spices, and
          enter into the grand caravanserai of heaven, and enjoy for ever the
          things you have wearily carried with you here.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I must say, that to others of us who have not to toil with our
          hands, heaven will be a seasonable rest. Those of us who have to tire
          our brain day after day will find it no slight boon to have an
          everlasting rest above. I will not boast of what I may do, there may
          be many who do more, there may be many who are perpetually and daily
          striving to serve God, and are using their mind's best energies in so
          doing. But this much I may say, that almost every week I have the
          pleasure of preaching twelve times, and often in my sleep do I think
          of what I shall say next time. Not having the advantage of laying out
          my seven shillings and sixpence in buying manuscripts, it costs me
          hard diligent labor to find even something to say. And I sometimes
          have a difficulty to keep the hopper full in the mill, I feel that if
          I had not now and then a rest I should have no wheat for God's
          children. Still it is on, on, on, and on we must go, we hear the
          chariot wheels of God behind us, and we dare not stop, we think that
          eternity is drawing nigh, and we must go on. Rest to us now is more
          than labor, we want to be at work; but oh! how seasonable it shall be,
          when to the minister it shall be said --
        </p>
        <p>"Servant of God, well done!</p>
        <p>Rest from thy loved employ;</p>
        <p>The battle fought, the victory won,</p>
        <p>Enter thy Master's joy."</p>
        <p>
          It will be seasonable rest. You that are weary with state cares, and
          have to learn the ingratitude of men; you that have sought honors, and
          have got them to your cost, you seek to do your best, but your very
          independence of spirit is called servility, whilst your servility
          would have been praised! You who seek to honor God, and not to honor
          men, who will not bind yourselves to parties, but seek in your own
          independent and honest judgment to serve your country and your God
          you, I say, when God shall see fit to call you to himself, will find
          it no small joy to have done with parliaments, to have done with
          states and kingdoms, and to have laid aside your honors, to receive
          honors more lasting amongst those who dwell for ever before the throne
          of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing, and then once more, and then farewell. This rest, my
          brethren, ought to be extolled, because it is eternal. Here my best
          joys bear "mortar" on their brow; here my fair flowers fade; here my
          sweet cups have dregs and are soon empty; here my sweetest birds must
          die, and their melody must soon be hushed; here my most pleasant days
          must have their nights; here the flowings of my bliss must have their
          ebbs, everything doth pass away, but there everything shall be
          immortal; the harp shall be unrusted, the crown unwithered, the eye
          undimmed the voice unfaltering, the heart unwavering, and the being
          wholly consolidated unto eternity. Happy day, happy day, when
          mortality shall be swallowed up of life, and the mortal shall have put
          on immortality!
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, lastly, this glorious rest is to be best of all commended
          for its certainty. "There remaineth a rest to the people of God."
          Doubting one, thou hast often said, "I fear I shall never enter
          heaven." Fear not, all the people of God shall enter there; there is
          no fear about it. I love the quaint saying of a dying man, who, in his
          country brogue, exclaimed, "I have no fear of going home; I have sent
          all before me. God's finger is on the latch of my door and I am ready
          for him to enter." "But," said one "are you not afraid least you
          should miss your inheritance?" "Nay," said he "nay, there is one crown
          in heaven that the angel Gabriel could not wear; it will fit no head
          but mine. There is one throne in heaven that Paul the apostle could
          not fill; it was made for me, and I shall have it. There is one dish
          at the banquet that I must eat, or else it will be untasted, for God
          has set it apart for me." O Christian, what a joyous thought! thy
          portion is secure! "there remaineth a rest." "But cannot I forfeit
          it?" No, it is entailed. If I be a child of God I shall not lose it.
          It is mine as securely as if I were there.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, Christian, mount to Pisgah's top,</p>
        <p>And view the landscape o'er."</p>
        <p>
          Seest thou that little river of death, glistening in the sunlight, and
          across it dost thou see the pinnacles of the eternal city? Dost thou
          mark the pleasant suburbs and all the joyous inhabitants? Turn thine
          eye to that spot. Dost thou see where that ray of light is glancing
          now? There is a little spot there; dost thou see it? That is thy
          patrimony; that is thine. Oh, if thou couldst fly across thou wouldst
          see written upon it, "this remaineth for such an one, preserved for
          him only. He shall be caught up and dwell for ever with God." Poor
          doubting one; see thine inheritance; it is thine. If thou believest in
          the Lord Jesus thou art one of the Lord's people; if thou hast
          repented of sin thou art one of the Lord's people; if thou hast been
          renewed in heart thou art one of the Lord's people, and there is a
          place for thee, a crown for thee, a harp for thee. No one else shall
          have it but thyself, and thou shalt have it ere long. Just pardon me
          one moment if I beg of you to conceive of yourselves as being in
          heaven. Is it not a strange thing to think of -- a poor clown in
          heaven? Think, how will you feel with your crown on your head? Weary
          matron, many years have rolled over you. How changed will be the scene
          when you are young again. Ah, toil-worn laborer, only think when thou
          shalt rest for aye. Canst thou conceive it? couldst thou but think for
          a moment, of thyself as being in heaven now, what a strange surprise
          would seize thee. Thou wouldst not so as much say, "What! are these
          streets of gold? What! are these walls of jasper?" "What, am I here?
          in white? Am I here, with a crown on my brow? Am I here singing, that
          was always groaning? What! I praise God that once cursed him? What! I
          lifting up my voice in his honor? Oh, precious blood that washed me
          clean! Oh, precious faith that set me free! Oh, precious Spirit that
          made me repent, else I had been cast away and been in hell! But oh!
          what wonders! Angels! I am surprised. I am enraptured! Wonder of
          wonders! Oh! gates of pearls, I long since heard of you! Oh! joys that
          never fade, I long since heard tell of you! But I am like the Queen of
          Sheba, the half has not yet been told me. Profusion, oh profusion of
          bliss! -- wonder of wonders! -- miracle of miracles! What a world I am
          in! And oh! that I am here, this is the topmost miracle of all!" And
          yet tis true, tis true; and that is the glory of it. It is true. Come,
          worm, and prove it, come, pall; come shroud; come, and prove it. Then
          come wings of faith, come, leap like a seraph; come, eternal ages,
          come, and ye shall prove that there are joys that the eye hath not
          seen, which the ear hath not heard, and which only God can reveal to
          us by his spirit. Oh! my earnest prayer is, that none of you may come
          short of this rest, but that ye may enter into it, and enjoy it for
          ever and ever. God give you his great blessing, for Jesus sake!
          Amen.<br />
