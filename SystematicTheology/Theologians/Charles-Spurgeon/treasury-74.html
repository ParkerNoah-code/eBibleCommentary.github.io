          TITLE. <b>A Psalm of Solomon.</b> It is pretty certain that the title
          declares Solomon to be the author of the Psalm, and yet from verse 20
          it would seem that David uttered it in prayer before he died. With
          some diffidence we suggest that the spirit and matter of the Psalm are
          David's, but that he was too near his end to pen the words, or cast
          them into form. Solomon, therefore, caught his dying father's song,
          fashioned it in goodly verse, and, without robbing his father, made
          the Psalm his own. It is, we conjecture, the <i>Prayer </i>of David,
          but the <i>Psalm </i>of Solomon. Jesus is here, beyond all doubt, in
          the glory of his reign, both as he now is, and as he shall be revealed
          in the latter day glory.

        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 1. Give the king your judgments, O God.
          </p></b
        >The right to reign was transmitted by descent from David to Solomon,
        but not by that means alone: Israel was a theocracy, and the kings were
        but the viceroys of the greater King; hence the prayer that the new king
        might be enthroned by divine right, and then endowed with divine wisdom.
        <p align="justify">
          Our glorious King in Zion has all judgment committed unto him. He
          rules in the name of God over all lands. He is king "Dei Gratia" as
          well as by right of inheritance.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">And your righteousness unto the king's son.</p></b
        >Solomon was both king and king's son; so also is our Lord. He has power
        and authority in himself, and also royal dignity given of his Father. He
        is the righteous king; in a word, he is "the Lord our righteousness." We
        are waiting until he shall be manifested among men as the ever righteous
        Judge. May the Lord hasten on his own time the long looked for day. Now
        wars and fightings are even in Israel itself, but soon the dispensation
        will change, and David, the type of Jesus warring with our enemies,
        shall be displaced by Solomon the prince of peace.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 2. He shall judge your people with righteousness.
          </p></b
        >
        Clothed with divine authority, he shall use it on the behalf of the
        favored nation, for whom he shall show himself strong, that they be not
        misjudged, slandered, or in any way treated maliciously. His sentence
        shall put their accusers to silence, and award the saints their true
        position as the accepted of the Lord. What a consolation to feel that
        none can suffer wrong in Christ's kingdom: he sits upon the great white
        throne, unspotted by a single deed of injustice, or even mistake of
        judgment: reputations are safe enough with him.
        <b> <p align="justify">And your poor with judgment.</p></b>True wisdom
        is manifest in all the decisions of Zion's King<i
          >. We do not always understand his doings, but they are always
          right</i
        >. Partiality has been too often shown to rich and great men, but the
        King of the last and best of monarchies deals out even-handed justice,
        to the delight of the poor and despised.
        <p align="justify">
          Here we have the poor mentioned side by side with the king. The
          sovereignty of God is a delightful theme to the poor in spirit; they
          love to see the Lord exalted, and have no quarrel with him for
          exercising the prerogatives of his crown. It is the fictitious wealth
          which labors to conceal real poverty, which makes men cavil at the
          reigning Lord, but a deep sense of spiritual need prepares the heart
          loyally to worship the Redeemer King. On the other hand, the King has
          a special delight in the humbled hearts of his contrite ones, and
          exercises all his power and wisdom on their behalf, even as Joseph in
          Egypt ruled for the welfare of his brethren.

            Verse 3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people.
          </p></b
        >Thence, aforetime, rushed the robber bands which infested the country;
        but now the forts there erected are the guardians of the land, and the
        watchmen publish far and near the tidings that no foe is to be seen.
        <p align="justify">
          Where Jesus is there is peace, lasting, deep, eternal. Even those
          things which were once our dread, lose all terror when Jesus is owned
          as monarch of the heart: death itself, that dark mountain, loses all
          its gloom.
          <i
            >Trials and afflictions, when the Lord is with us, bring us an
            increase rather than a diminution of peace.
          </i>
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And the little hills, by righteousness.</p></b>
        Seeing that the rule of the monarch was just, every little hill seemed
        clothed with peace. Injustice has made Palestine a desert; if the Turk
        and Bedouin were gone, the land would smile again; for even in the most
        literal sense, justice is the fertilizer of lands, and men are diligent
        to plough and raise harvests when they have the prospect of eating the
        fruit of their labors.

        <p align="justify">
          In a spiritual sense, peace is given to the heart by the righteousness
          of Christ; and all the powers and passions of the soul are filled with
          a holy calm, when the way of salvation, by a divine righteousness, is
          revealed. Then do we go forth with joy, and are led forth with peace;
          the mountains and the hills break forth before us into singing.

        He will do them justice, yes, and blessed be his name, more than
        justice, for he will delight to do them good.
        <b> <p align="justify">He shall save the children of the needy.</p></b>
        Poor, helpless things, they were packhorses for others, and paupers
        themselves, but their King would be their protector.
        <p align="justify">
          Happy are God's poor and needy ones; they are safe under the wing of
          the Prince of Peace, for he will save them from all their enemies.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And shall break in pieces the oppressor.</p></b>
        He is strong to smite the foes of his people. Oppressors have been great
        breakers, but their time of retribution shall come, and they shall be
        broken themselves. Sin, Satan, and all our enemies must be crushed by
        the iron rod of King Jesus. We have, therefore, no cause to fear; but
        abundant reason to sing—
        <p align="justify">
          "All hail the power of Jesus' name!<br />
          Let angels prostrate fall,<br />
          Bring forth the royal diadem,<br />
          And crown him lord of all!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is much better to be poor than to be an oppressor; for both the
          needy and their children find an advocate in the heavenly Solomon, who
          aims all his blows at haughty ones, and rests not until they are
          utterly destroyed.
        </p>
        <b>

            Verse 5. They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure.
          </p></b
        >
        And well they may. Such righteousness wins the cheerful homage of the
        poor and the godly, and strikes dismay into the souls of unrighteous
        oppressors; so that all through the lands, both good and bad are filled
        with awe.
        <p align="justify">
          Where Jesus reigns in power men must render obeisance of some sort.
          His kingdom, moreover, is no house of cards, or dynasty of days; it is
          as lasting as the lights of Heaven; days and nights will cease before
          he abdicates his throne. Neither sun nor moon as yet manifest any
          failure in their radiance, nor are there any signs of decrepitude in
          the kingdom of Jesus; on the contrary, it is but in its youth, and is
          evidently the coming power, the rising sun.

          commoners; alas! the rule has been for kings to give their subjects'
          property to the church, and a wretched church has received this
          robbery for a burnt offering; it shall not be thus when Jesus more
          openly assumes the throne.

        nations. We see not as yet all things put under him, but since we see
        Jesus crowned with glory and honor in Heaven, we are altogether without
        doubt as to his universal monarchy on earth. It is not to be imagined
        that an Alexander or a Caesar shall have wider sway than the Son of God.
        "Every knee shall bow to him, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus

        Here is an excellent reason for man's submission to the Lord Christ; it
        is not because they dread his overwhelming power, but because they are
        won over by his just and condescending rule. Who would not fear so good
        a Prince, who makes the needy his peculiar care, and pledges himself to
        be their deliverer in times of need?
        <b> <p align="justify">When he cries.</p></b> He permits them to be so

          always yields to such artillery.

        The proverb says, "God helps those that help themselves;" but it is yet
        more true that Jesus helps those who cannot help themselves, nor find
        help in others. All helpless ones are under the especial care of Zion's
        compassionate King; let them hasten to put themselves in fellowship with
        him. Let them look to him, for he is looking for them.

        needy, that is to say, the consciously unworthy and weak, shall find
        that he will give them his salvation. Jesus calls not the righteous, but
        sinners to repentance. He does not attempt the superfluous work of
        aiding proud Pharisees to air their vanity; but he is careful of poor
        Publicans whose eyes dare not look up to Heaven by reason of their sense
        of sin. We ought to be anxious to be among these needy ones whom the
        Great King so highly favors.

        He will not throw away his subjects in needless wars as tyrants have
        done, but will take every means for preserving the humblest of them.
        Conquerors have reckoned thousands of lives as small items; they have
        reddened fields with gore, as if blood were water, and flesh but manure
        for harvests. But Jesus, though he gave his own blood, is very chary of
        the blood of his servants, and if they must die for him as martyrs, he
        loves their memory, and counts their lives as his precious things.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 15. And he shall live.</p></b> O King! live
        forever! He was slain, but is risen and ever lives.

        not stand still for want of funds; the silver and the gold are his, and
        if they are not to be found at home, far off lands shall hasten to make
        up the deficit. Would to God we had more faith and more generosity.

        >May all blessings be upon his head; all his people desire that his
        cause may prosper, therefore do they hourly cry, "Your kingdom come."
        Prayer for Jesus is a very sweet idea, and one which should be for
        evermore lovingly carried out; for the church is Christ's body, and the
        truth is his scepter; therefore we pray for him when we plead for these.
        <p align="justify">
          The verse may, however, be read as "through him," for it is by Christ
          as our Mediator that prayer enters Heaven and prevails. "Continue in
          prayer" is the standing precept of Messiah's reign, and it implies
          that the Lord will continue to bless.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And daily shall he be praised.</p></b>As he will

        From small beginnings great results shall spring. A mere handful in a
        place naturally uncongenial shall produce a matchless harvest. What a
        blessing that there is a handful; "except the Lord Almighty had left
        unto us a very small remnant we should have been as Sodom, and we should
        have been like unto Gomorrah." But now the faithful are a living seed,

          God's church is no base thing; its beginnings are small, but its

        Another figure. Christ's subjects shall be as plentiful as blades of
        grass, and shall as suddenly appear as eastern verdure after a heavy
        shower. We need not fear for the cause of truth in the land; it is in
        good hands, where the pleasure of the Lord is sure to prosper. "Fear
        not, little flock, it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
        kingdom." When shall these words, which open up such a vista of delight,
        be fulfilled in the midst of the earth?

          As Quesnel well observes, these verses explain themselves. They call
          rather for profound gratitude, and emotion of heart, than for an
          exercise of the understanding; they are rather to be used for
          adoration than for exposition. It is, and ever will be, the acme of
          our desires, and the climax of our prayers, to behold Jesus exalted
          King of kings and Lord of lords.

          He has done great wonders such as none else can match, leaving all
          others so far behind, that he remains the sole and only wonder worker;

          expectation. He is the Blessed God, and his name shall be blessed; his
          name is glorious, and that glory shall fill the whole earth. For so
          bright a consummation our heart yearns daily, and we cry
          <i>Amen, and Amen.</i>

        What more could he ask? He has climbed the summit of the mount of God,
        and he desires nothing more. With this upon his lip, he is content to

        Jesse," thrice happy to subside into nothing before the crowned Messiah.
        Before his believing eye the reign of Jesus, like the sun, filled all
        around with light, and the holy soul of the man after God's own heart
        exulted in it, and sung "Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace,
        for my eyes have seen your salvation!" We, too, will cease from all
        petitioning if it be granted to us to see the day of the Lord. Our

        praise the Lord our God.
