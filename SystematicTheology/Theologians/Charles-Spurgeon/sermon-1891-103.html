          1. For the Lord, revealing Himself to His disciples, that He Himself
          is the Word, who imparts knowledge of the Father, and reproving the
          Jews, who imagined that they, had [the knowledge of] God, while they
          nevertheless rejected His Word, through whom God is made known,
          declared, "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any
          man the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son has willed to
          reveal [Him]." Thus hath Matthew set it down, and Luke in like manner,
          and Mark the very same; for John omits this passage. They, however,
          who would be wiser than the apostles, write [the verse] in the
          following manner: "No man knew the Father, but the Son; nor the Son,
          but the Father, and he to whom the Son has willed to reveal [Him];"
          and they explain it as if the true God were known to none prior to our
          Lord's advent; and that God who was announced by the prophets, they
          allege not to be the Father of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But if Christ did then [only] begin to have existence when He came
          [into the world] as man, and [if] the Father did remember [only] in
          the times of Tiberius Cæsar to provide for [the wants of] men, and His
          Word was shown to have not always coexisted with His creatures; [it
          may be remarked that] neither then was it necessary that another God
          should be proclaimed, but [rather] that the reasons for so great
          carelessness and neglect on His part should be made the subject of
          investigation. For it is fitting that no such question should arise,
          and gather such strength, that it would indeed both change God, and
          destroy our faith in that Creator who supports us by means of His
          creation. For as we do direct our faith towards the Son, so also
          should we possess a firm and immoveable love towards the Father. In
          his book against Marcion, Justin does well say: "I would not have
          believed the Lord Himself, if He had announced any other than He who
          is our framer, maker, and nourisher. But because the only-begotten Son
          came to us from the one God, who both made this world and formed us,
          and contains and administers all things, summing up His own handiwork
          in Himself, my faith towards Him is stedfast, and my love to the
          Father immoveable, God bestowing both upon us."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For no one can know the Father, unless through the Word of God,
          that is, unless by the Son revealing [Him]; neither can he have
          knowledge of the Son, unless through the good pleasure of the Father.
          But the Son performs the good pleasure of the Father; for the Father
          sends, and the Son is sent, and comes. And His Word knows that His
          Father is, as far as regards us, invisible and infinite; and since He
          cannot be declared [by any one else], He does Himself declare Him to
          us; and, on the other hand, it is the Father alone who knows His own
          Word. And both these truths has our Lord declared. Wherefore the Son
          reveals the knowledge of the Father through His own manifestation. For
          the manifestation of the Son is the knowledge of the Father; for all
          things are manifested through the Word. In order, therefore, that we
          might know that the Son who came is He who imparts to those believing
          on Him a knowledge of the Father, He said to His disciples: "No man
          knoweth the Son but the Father, nor the Father but the Son, and those
          to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him;" thus setting Himself forth
          and the Father as He [really] is, that we may not receive any other
          Father, except Him who is revealed by the Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But this [Father] is the Maker of heaven and earth, as is shown
          from His words; and not he, the false father, who has been invented by
          Marcion, or by Valentinus, or by Basilides, or by Carpocrates, or by
          Simon, or by the rest of the "Gnostics," falsely so called. For none
          of these was the Son of God; but Christ Jesus our Lord [was], against
          whom they set their teaching in opposition, and have the daring to
          preach an unknown God. But they ought to hear [this] against
          themselves: How is it that He is unknown, who is known by them? for,
          whatever is known even by a few, is not unknown. But the Lord did not
          say that both the Father and the Son could not be known at all (in
          totum), for in that case His advent would have been superfluous. For
          why did He come hither? Was it that He should say to us, "Never mind
          seeking after God; for He is unknown, and ye shall not find Him;" as
          also the disciples of Valentinus falsely declare that Christ said to
          their Æons? But this is indeed vain. For the Lord taught us that no
          man is capable of knowing God, unless he be taught of God; that is,
          that God cannot be known without God: but that this is the express
          will of the Father, that God should be known. For they shall know Him
          to whomsoever the Son has revealed Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And for this purpose did the Father reveal the Son, that through
          His instrumentality He might be manifested to all, and might receive
          those righteous ones who believe in Him into incorruption and
          everlasting enjoyment (now, to believe in Him is to do His will); but
          He shall righteously shut out into the darkness which they have chosen
          for themselves, those who do not believe, and who do consequently
          avoid His light. The Father therefore has revealed Himself to all, by
          making His Word visible to all; and, conversely, the Word has declared
          to all the Father and the Son, since He has become visible to all. And
          therefore the righteous judgment of God [shall fall] upon all who,
          like others, have seen, but have not, like others, believed.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. For by means of the creation itself, the Word reveals God the
          Creator; and by means of the world [does He declare] the Lord the
          Maker of the world; and by means of the formation [of man] the
          Artificer who formed him; and by the Son that Father who begat the
          Son: and these things do indeed address all men in the same manner,
          but all do not in the same way believe them. But by the law and the
          prophets did the Word preach both Himself and the Father alike [to
          all]; and all the people heard Him alike, but all did not alike
          believe. And through the Word Himself who had been made visible and
          palpable, was the Father shown forth, although all did not equally
          believe in Him; but all saw the Father in the Son: for the Father is
          the invisible of the Son, but the Son the visible of the Father. And
          for this reason all spake with Christ when He was present [upon
          earth], and they named Him God. Yea, even the demons exclaimed, on
          beholding the Son: "We know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God."
          And the devil looking at Him, and tempting Him, said: "If Thou art the
          Son of God;" -- all thus indeed seeing and speaking of the Son and the
          Father, but all not believing [in them].
        </p>
        <p>
          7. For it was fitting that the truth should receive testimony from
          all, and should become [a means of] judgment for the salvation indeed
          of those who believe, but for the condemnation of those who believe
          not; that all should be fairly judged, and that the faith in the
          Father and Son should be approved by all, that is, that it should be
          established by all [as the one means of salvation], receiving
          testimony from all, both from those belonging to it, since they are
          its friends, and by those having no connection with it, though they
          are its enemies. For that evidence is true, and cannot be gainsaid,
          which elicits even from its adversaries striking testimonies in its
          behalf; they being convinced with respect to the matter in hand by
          their own plain contemplation of it, and bearing testimony to it, as
          well as declaring it. But after a while they break forth into enmity,
          and become accusers [of what they had approved], and are desirous that
          their own testimony should not be [regarded as] true. He, therefore,
          who was known, was not a different being from Him who declared "No man
          knoweth the Father," but one and the same, the Father making all
          things subject to Him; while He received testimony from all that He
          was very man, and that He was very God, from the Father, from the
          Spirit, from angels, from the creation itself, from men, from apostate
          spirits and demons, from the enemy, and last of all, from death
          itself. But the Son, administering all things for the Father, works
          from the beginning even to the end, and without Him no man can attain
          the knowledge of God. For the Son is the knowledge of the Father; but
          the knowledge of the Son is in the Father, and has been revealed
          through the Son; and this was the reason why the Lord declared: "No
          man knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, save the Son, and
          those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal [Him]." For "shall reveal"
          was said not with reference to the future alone, as if then [only] the
          Word had begun to manifest the Father when He was born of Mary, but it
          applies indifferently throughout all time. For the Son, being present
          with His own handiwork from the beginning, reveals the Father to all;
          to whom He wills, and when He wills, and as the Father wills.
          Wherefore, then, in all things, and through all things, there is one
          God, the Father, and one Word, and one Son, and one Spirit, and one
          salvation to all who believe in Him.
