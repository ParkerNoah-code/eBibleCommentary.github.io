          And, when he had entered the sepulchre, he was raised to life again,
          and came forth from the sepulchre with many. And those who were
          guarding the sepulchre saw not how He came forth from the sepulchre;
          but the watchers from on high -- they were the proclaimers and
          announcers of His resurrection. For, had He not willed, He had not
          died, because He is Lord of death, the exit from this life; nor, had
          it not pleased Him, would He have put on a body, inasmuch as He is
          Himself the framer of the body. For that will which led Him to stoop
          to be born of the Virgin, likewise caused Him further to descend to
          the suffering of death. -- And a little after (we read): For, although
          His appearance was that of men, yet His power, and His knowledge, and
          his authority, were those of God.<br />
