        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.446)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Evening, March 30th, 1862, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"In due time Christ died for the ungodly." -- Romans 5:6.</p>
        <p>
          There is a doctor of divinity here to-night who listened to me some
          years ago. He has been back to his own dwelling-place in America, and
          he has come here again. I could not help fancying, as I saw his face
          just now, that he would think I was doting on the old subject, and
          harping on the old strain; that I had not advanced a single inch upon
          any new domain of thought, but was preaching the same old gospel in
          the same old terms as ever. If he should think so he will be quite
          right. I suppose I am something like Mr. Cecil when he was a boy. His
          father once told him to wait in a gateway till he came back, and the
          father, being very busy, went about the city; and amidst his numerous
          cares and engagements, he forgot the boy. Night came on, and at last
          when the father reached home, there was great enquiry as to where
          Richard was. The father said, "Dear me, I left him early in the
          morning standing under such-and-such a gateway, and I told him to stay
          there until I came for him; I should not wonder but what he is there
          now." So they went, and there they found him. Such an example of
          childish simple faithfulness it is no disgrace to emulate. I received
          some years ago orders from my Master to stand at the foot of the cross
          until he came. He has not come yet, but I mean to stand there till he
          does. If I should disobey his orders and leave those simple truths
          which have been the means of the conversion of souls, I know not how I
          could expect his blessing. Here, then, I stand at the foot of the
          cross and tell out the old, old story, stale though it sound to
          itching ears, and worn threadbare as critics may deem it. It is of
          Christ I love to speak -- of Christ who loved, and lived, and died,
          the substitute for sinners, the just for the unjust, that he might
          bring us to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is somewhat singular, but just as they say fish go bad at the head
          first, so modern divines generally go bad first upon the head and main
          doctrine of the substitutionary work of Christ. Nearly all our modern
          errors, I might say all of them, begin with mistakes about Christ. Men
          do not like to be always preaching the same thing., There are
          Athenians in the pulpit as well as in the pew who spend their time in
          nothing but hearing some new thing. They are not content to tell over
          and over again the simple message, "He that believeth in the Lord
          Jesus Christ hath everlasting life." So they borrow novelties from
          literature, and garnish the Word of God with the words which man's
          wisdom teacheth. The doctrine of atonement they mystify.
          Reconciliation by the precious blood of Jesus ceases to be the
          corner-stone of their ministry. To shape the gospel to the diseased
          wishes and tastes of men enters far more deeply into their purpose,
          than to re-mould the mind and renew the heart of men that they receive
          the gospel as it is. There is no telling where they will go who once
          go back from following the Lord with a true and undivided heart, from
          deep to deep descending, the blackness of darkness will receive them
          unless grace prevent. Only this you may take for a certainty.
        </p>
        <p>"They cannot be right in the rest,</p>
        <p>Unless they speak rightly of Him."</p>
        <p>
          If they are not sound about the purpose of the cross, they are rotten
          everywhere. "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
          is Jesus Christ." On this rock there is security. We may be mistaken
          on any other points with more impunity than this. They who are builded
          on the rock, though they build wood, and hay, and stubble, thereupon
          to their sore confusion, for what they build shall be burned,
          themselves shall be saved yet so as by fire. Now that grand doctrine
          which we take to be the keystone of the evangelical system, they very
          corner-stone of the gospel, that grand doctrine of the atonement of
          Christ we would tell to you again, and then, without attempting to
          prove it, for that we have done hundreds of times, we shall try to
          draw some lessons of instruction from that truth which is surely
          believed among us. Man having sinned, God's righteousness demanded
          that the penalty should be fulfilled. He had said, "The soul that
          sinneth shall die;" and unless God can be false, the sinner must die.
          Moreover, God's holiness demanded it, for the penalty was based on
          justice. It was just that the sinner should die. God had not appended
          a more heavy penalty than he should have done. Punishment is the just
          result of offending. God, then, must either cease to be holy, or the
          sinner must be punished. Truth and holiness imperiously demanded that
          God should lift his hand and smite the man who had broken his law and
          offended his majesty. Christ Jesus, the second Adam, the federal head
          of the chosen ones, interposed. He offered himself to bear the penalty
          which they ought to bear; to fulfil and honour the law which they had
          broken and dishonoured. He offered to be their day's-man, a surety, a
          substitute, standing in their room, place, and stead. Christ became
          the vicar of his people; vicariously suffering in their stead;
          vicariously doing in their stead that which they were not strong
          enough to do by reason of the weakness of the flesh through the fall.
          This which Christ proposed to do was accepted of God. In due time
          Christ actually died, and fulfilled what he promised to do. He took
          every sin of all his people, and suffered every stroke of the rod on
          account of those sins. He had compounded into one awful draught the
          punishment of the sins of all the elect. He took the cup; he put it to
          his lips; he sweat as it were great drops of blood while he tasted the
          first sip thereof, but he never desisted, but drank on, on, on, till
          he had exhausted the very dregs, and turning the vessel upside down he
          said, "It is finished!" and at one tremendous draught of love the Lord
          God of salvation had drained destruction dry. Not a dreg, not the
          slightest reside was left; he had suffered all that ought to have been
          suffered; had finished transgression, and made an end of sin.
          Moreover, he obeyed his Father's law to the utmost extent of it; he
          fulfilled that will of which he had said of old -- "Lo, I come to do
          thy will, O God: thy law is my delight;" and having offered both an
          atonement for sin and a complete fulfilment of the law, he ascended up
          on high, took his seat on the right hand of the Majesty in heaven,
          from henceforth expecting till he enemies be made his footstool, and
          interceding for those whom be bought with blood that they may be with
          him where he is. The doctrine of the atonement is very simple. It just
          consists in the substitution of Christ in the place of the sinner;
          Christ being treated as of he were the sinner, and then the
          transgressors being treated as if he were the righteous one. It is a
          change of persons; Christ becomes sinner; he stands in the sinner's
          place and stead; he was numbered with the transgressors; the sinner
          becomes righteous; he stands in Christ's place and stead, and is
          numbered with the righteous ones. Christ has no sin of his own, but he
          takes human guilt, and is punished for human folly. We have no
          righteousness of our own, but we take the divine righteousness; we are
          rewarded for it, and stand accepted before God as though that
          righteousness had been wrought out by ourselves. "In due time Christ
          died for the ungodly," that he might take away their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not my present object to prove this doctrine. As I said before,
          there is no need to be always arguing what we know to be true. Rather
          let us say a few earnest words by way of commending this doctrine of
          the atonement; and afterwards I shall propound it by way of
          application to those who as yet have not received Christ.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, BY WAY OF COMMENDATION.</p>
        <p>
          There are some things to be said for the gospel which proclaims the
          atonement as its fundamental principle. And the first thing to be said
          of it is, that in comparison with all modern schemes how simple it is!
          Brethren, this is why our great gentlemen do not like it, it is to
          plain. If you will go and purchase certain books which teach you how
          sermons ought to be made, you will find that the English of it is
          this, -- pick all the hard words you can out of all the books you read
          in the week, and then pour them out on your people on Sunday; and
          there is a certain set of people who always applaud the man they
          cannot understand. They are like the old woman who was asked when she
          came home from Church, "Did you understand the sermon?" "No;" she
          answered, "I would not have the presumption;" she thought it would be
          presumption to attempt to understand the minister. But the Word of God
          is understood with the heart, and makes no strange demands on the
          intellect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, our first commendation on the doctrine of the atonement is, that
          it commends itself to the understanding. The way-faring man, though
          his intellect be but one grade beyond an idiot, may get a hold on the
          truth of substitution without any difficulty. Oh, these modern
          theologians, they will do anything to spirit away the cross! They hang
          over it the gaudy trappings of their elocution, or they introduce it
          with the dark mysterious incantations of their logic, and then the
          poor troubled heart looks up to see the cross and sees nothing there
          but human wisdom. Now I say it again, there is not one of you here but
          can understand this truth, that Christ died in the stead of his
          people. If you perish, it will not be because the gospel was beyond
          your comprehension. If you go down to hell, it will not because you
          were not able to understand how God can be just, and yet the justifier
          of the ungodly. It is astonishing in this age how little is known of
          the simple truisms of the Bible; it seems to be always admonishing us
          how simple we ought to be in setting them forth. I have heard that
          when Mr. Kilpin was once preaching a very good and earnest sermon, he
          used the word "Deity," and a sailor sitting down below leaned forward
          and said, "Beg your pardon, sir, but who's he, pray? Do you mean God
          Almighty?" "Yes," said Mr. Kilpin,"I do mean God, and I ought not to
          have used a word which you could not understand." "I thank you sir,"
          said the sailor, and looked as if he would devour the rest of the
          sermon in the interest which he felt in it even to the close. Now that
          one unvarnished face is but an index of that which prevails in every
          land. There must be simple preaching. A doctrine of atonement that is
          not simple, a doctrine which comes from Germany, which needs a man to
          be a great scholar before he can comprehend it himself, and to be a
          still greater adept before he can tell it to other -- such a doctrine
          is manifestly not of God, because it is not suited to God's creatures.
          It is fascinating to one in a thousand of them, but it is not suited
          to those poor of this world who are rich in faith; not suited to those
          babes to whom God has revealed the things of the kingdom while he has
          hidden them from the wise and prudent. Oh, you may always judge of a
          doctrine in this way. If it is not a simple doctrine, it does not come
          from God; if it puzzles you, if it is one which you cannot see through
          at once because of the mysterious language in which it is couched, you
          may begin to suspect that it is man's doctrine, and not the Word of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this doctrine of the atonement to be commended merely for its
          simplicity, but because while suiting the understand it also suits the
          conscience. How it satisfies the conscience no tongue can tell! When a
          man is awakened and his conscience stings him, when the Spirit of God
          has shown him his sin and his guilt, there is nothing but the blood of
          Christ that can ever give him peace. Peter might have stood up at the
          prow of the boat and have said to the winds and to the waves, "Peace,
          be still," but they would have gone on to roaring with unabated fury.
          The Pope of Rome, who pretends to be Peter's successor, may stand up
          with his ceremonies and say to the troubled conscience, "Peace, be
          still," but it will not cease it's terrible agitations. The unclean
          spirit that sets conscience in so much turmoil cries out, "Jesus I
          know, and his cross I know, but who are ye?" Yea, and it will not be
          case out. There is no chance whatever of our finding a pillow for a
          head which the Holy Ghost, has made to ache save in the atonement and
          the finished work of Christ. When Mr. Robert Hall first went to
          Cambridge to preach, the Cambridge folks were nearly Unitarians. So he
          preached upon the doctrine of the finished work of Christ, and some of
          them came to him in the vestry and said, "Mr Hall, this will never
          do." "Why not?" said he, "Why, your sermon was only fit for old
          women." "And why only fit for old women?" said Mr. Hall. "Because,"
          said they, "they are tottering on the borders of the grave, and they
          want comfort, and, therefore, it will suit them, but it will not do
          for us." "Very well," said Mr. Hall, "you have unconsciously paid me
          all the compliment that I can ask for; if this is good for old women
          on the borders of the grave, it must be good for you if you are in
          your right senses, for the borders of the grave is where we all
          stand." Here, indeed, is a choice feature of the atonement, it is
          comforting to us in the thought of death. When conscience is awakened
          to a sense of guilt, death is sure to cast his pale shadow on all our
          prospects, and encircle all our steps with dark omens of the grave.
          Conscience is accompanied generally in its alarms with the thoughts of
          the near-approaching judgment, but the peace which the blood gives is
          conscience-proof, sickness-proof, death-proof, devil-proof,
          judgment-proof, and it will be eternity-proof. We may well be alarmed
          at all the uprisings of occupation and all the remembrance of past
          defilement, but only let our eyes rest on they dear cross, O Jesus,
          and our conscience has peace with God, and we rest and are still. Now
          we ask whether any of these modern systems of divinity can quiet a
          troubled conscience? We would like to give them some cases that we
          meet with sometimes -- some despairing ones -- and say, "Now, here,
          cast this devil out if you can try your hand at it," and I think they
          would find, that this kind goeth not out save by the tears, and
          groans, and death of Jesus Christ the atoning sacrifice. A gospel
          without an atonement may do very well for young ladies and gentlemen
          who do not know that they ever did anything wrong. It will just suit
          your lackadaisical people who have not got a heart for anybody to see;
          who have always been quite moral, upright, and respectable; who feel
          insulted if you told them they deserved to be sent to hell; who would
          not for a moment allow that they could be depraved or fallen
          creatures. The gospel, I say, of these moderns will suit these
          gentlefolks very well I dare say, but let a man be really guilty and
          know it; let him be really awake to his lost state, and I aver that
          none but Jesus -- none but Jesus, nothing but the precious blood can
          give him peace and rest. For these two things, then, commend us to the
          doctrine of the atonement, because it suits the understanding of the
          mostly lowly, and will quiet the conscience of the most troubled.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has, moreover, this peculiar excellency, that it softens the heart.
          There is a mysterious softening and melting power in the story of the
          sacrifice of Christ. I know a dear Christian woman who loved her
          little ones and sought their salvation. When she prayed for them, she
          thought it right to use the best means she could to arrest their
          attention and awaken their minds. I hope you all do likewise. The
          means, however, which she thought best calculated for her object was
          the terrors of the Lord. She used to read to her children chapter
          after chapter of Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted. Oh, that book!
          how many dreams it gave her boy at night about the devouring flames
          and the everlasting burnings. But the boy's heart grew hardened, as if
          it were annealed rather than melted by the furnace of fear. The hammer
          welded the heart to sin, but did not break it. But even then, when the
          lad's heart was hard, when he heard of Jesus's love to his people,
          though he feared he was not one of them, still it used to make him
          weep to think Jesus should love anybody after such a sort. Even now
          that he has come to manhood, law and terrors make him dead and stolid,
          but thy blood, Jesus, thine agonies, in Gethsemane and on the tree, he
          cannot bear; they melt him; his soul flows through his eyes in tears;
          he weeps himself away from grateful love to thee for what thou hast
          done. Alas for those that deny the atonement! They take the very sting
          out of Christ's sufferings; and then, in taking out the sting, they
          take out the point with which sufferings of Christ pierce, and probe,
          and penetrate the heart. It is because Christ suffered for my sin,
          because he was condemned that I might to acquitted and not be damned
          as the result of my guilt: it is this that makes his sufferings such a
          cordial to my heart.
        </p>
        <p>"See on the bloody tree,</p>
        <p>The Illustrious sufferer hangs,</p>
        <p>The torments due to thee,</p>
        <p>He bore the dreadful pangs;</p>
        <p>And cancelled there, the might sum,</p>
        <p>Sins present, past, and sins to come."</p>
        <p>
          At this present hour there are congregation met in the theatres of
          London, and there are persons addressing them. I do not know what
          their subjects are, but I know what they ought to be. If they want to
          get at the intellects of those who live in the back-slums, if they
          want to get at the consciences of those who have been thieves and
          drunkards, if they want to melt the hearts of those who have grown
          stubborn and callous through years of lust and iniquity, I know there
          is nothing will do it but the death on Calvary, the five wounds, the
          bleeding side, the vinegar, the nails, and the spear. There is a
          melting power here which is not to be found in all the world besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will detain you yet once more on this point. We commend the doctrine
          of the atonement because, besides suiting the understand, quieting the
          conscience, and melting the heart, we know there is a power in it to
          affect the outward life. No man can believe that Christ suffered for
          his sins and yet live in sin. No man can believe that his iniquities
          were the murderers of Christ, and yet go and hug those murderers to
          his bosom. The sure and certain effect of a true faith in the atoning
          sacrifice of Christ is the purging out of the old leaven, the
          dedication of the soul to him who bought it with his blood, and the
          vowing to have revenge against those sins which nailed Jesus to the
          tree. The proof, after all, is the trial. Go into any parish in
          England where there lives a philosophical divine who has cut the
          atonement out of his preaching, and if you do not find more harlots,
          and thieves, and drunkards there than is usual, write me down
          mistaken; but go, on the other hand, into a parish where the atonement
          is preached, and that with rigid integrity and with loving
          earnestness, and if you do not find the ale-houses getting empty, and
          the shops shut on the Sunday, and the people walking in honesty and
          uprightness, then I have looked about the world in vain. I knew a
          village once that was perhaps one of the worst villages in England for
          many things; where many an illicit still was yielding it noxious
          liquor to a manufacturer without payment of the duty to the
          Government, and where, in connection with that, all manner of riot and
          iniquity were rife. There went a lad into that village, and but a lad,
          and one who had no scholarship, but was rough, and sometimes vulgar.
          He began to preach there, and it pleased God to turn that village
          upside down, and in a short time the little thatched chapel was
          crammed, and the biggest vagabonds of the village were weeping floods
          of tears, and those who had been the curse of the parish became its
          blessings; and where there had been robberies and villainies of every
          kind all round the neighbourhood, there were none, because the men who
          did the mischief were themselves in the house of God, rejoicing to
          hear of Jesus crucified. Mark me, I am not telling you an exaggerated
          story now, nor a thing that I do not know. Yet this one thing I
          remember to the praise of God's grace, it pleased the Lord to work
          signs and wonders in our midst. He showed the power of Jesus' name,
          and made us witnesses of the gospel which can win souls, draw
          reluctant hearts, and mould the life and conduct of men afresh. Why,
          there are some brethren here who go to the refuges and homes to talk
          to those poor fallen girls who have been reclaimed. I wonder what they
          would do if they had not the gospel tale to carry with them to the
          abodes of wretchedness and shame. If they should take a leaf out of
          some divinity essays, and should go and talk to them in high-flowing
          words, and philosophies, what good would it be to them? Well, what is
          not good to them is not good to us. We want something we can grasp,
          something we can rely upon, something we can feel; something that will
          mould our character and conversation, and make us to be like Christ.
        </p>
        <p>II. Secondly, one or two points BY WAY OF EXHORTATION.</p>
        <p>
          Christian man, you believe that your sins are forgiven, and that
          Christ has made a full atonement for them. What shall we say to you?
          To you first we say, what a joyful Christian you ought to be! How you
          should live above the common trials and troubles of the world! Since
          sin is forgiven, what matters what happens to you now? Luther said,
          "Smite, Lord, smite, for my sin is forgiven. If thou hast but forgiven
          me, smite as hard as thou wilt;" as if he felt like a child who had
          done wrong, and cared not how his father might whip him if he would
          but forgive him. So I think you can say, "Send sickness, poverty,
          losses, crosses, slander, persecution, what thou wilt, thou hast
          forgiven me, and my soul is glad, and my spirit is rejoiced." And
          then, Christian, if thou art thus saved, and Christ really did take
          thy sin, whilst thou art glad, be grateful and be loving. Cling to
          that cross which took thy sin away; serve thou him who served thee. "I
          beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
          present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
          which is your reasonable service." Let not your zeal bubble over with
          some little ebullition of song. You may say,
        </p>
        <p>"I love my God with zeal so great, that I could give him all,"</p>
        <p>
          but sing it not in words unless thou dost mean it. Oh, do mean it! Is
          there nothing in your life that you do because you belong to Christ?
          Are you never anxious to show your love in some expressive tokens?
          Love the brethren of him who loved thee. If there be a Mephibosheth
          anywhere who is lame or halt, help him for Jonathan's sake. If there
          be a poor tired believer, try and weep with him, and bear his cross
          for the sake of him who wept for thee and carried thy sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, again, Christian, if this be true that there is an atonement
          made for sin, tell it, tell it, tell it. "We cannot all preach," say
          you; no, but tell it, tell it. "I would not prepare a sermon;" tell
          it; tell out the story; tell out the mystery and wonder of Christ's
          love. "But I should never get a congregation;" tell it in your house;
          tell it by the fire-side. "But I have none but little children:" tell
          it to your children, and let them know the sweet mystery on the cross,
          and the blessed history of him who lived and died for sinners. Tell
          it, for you know not into what ears you may speak. Tell it often, for
          thus you will have the better hope that you may turn sinners to
          Christ. Lacking talent, lacking the graces of oratory, be glad that
          you lack these, and glory in your infirmity that the power of Christ
          may rest upon you, but do tell it. Sometimes there are some of our
          young men get preaching who had better hold their tongues, but there
          are many others who have gifts and abilities which they might use for
          Christ, but who seem tongue-tied. I have often said that if you get a
          young man to join a rifle corps, he has got something to do, and he
          puts his heart in it; but if you get the same young man to join a
          church, well, his name is in the book, and he has been baptized, and
          so on, and he thinks he has nothing more to do with it. Why, brethren,
          I do not like to have member of the church who feel they can throw the
          responsibility on a few of us while they themselves sit still. That is
          not the way to win battles. If at Waterloo some nine out of ten of our
          soldiers had said, "Well, we need not fight; we will leave the
          fighting to the few, there they are; let them go and do it all." Why,
          if they had said that, they would very soon have all been cut in
          pieces. They must every one of them take their turns, home, and foot,
          and artillery; men who were light-armed, and men of all kinds; they
          must march to the fray; yes, and even the guards, if they are held
          back as a reserve to the last, yet they must be called for, -- "Up
          guards, and at 'em;" and if there are any of you here that are old men
          and women and think you are like the guards, and ought to be spared
          the heavy conflict, yet up and at them, for now the world needs you
          all, and since Christ has bought you with His blood, I beseech you be
          not content till you have fought for him, and have been victorious
          through His name. Tell it; tell it' tell it; with a voice of thunder
          tell it; year, with many voices mingling together as the sound of many
          waters; tell it till the dwellers in the remotest wilderness shall
          hear the sound thereof. Tell it there shall be ne'er a cot upon the
          mountain where it is not known, ne'er a ship upon the sea where the
          story has not been told. Tell it till there is never a dark alley that
          has not been illuminated by its light, nor a loathsome den which has
          not been cleansed by its power. Tell out the story that Christ died
          for the ungodly.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a few words of application to unbelievers I draw to a close.
          Unbeliever, If god cannot and will not forgive the sons of penitent
          men without Christ taking their punishment, rest assured he will
          surely bring you to judgment. If, when Christ, God's Son, had imputed
          sin laid on him, God smote him, how will he smite you who are his
          enemy, and who have your own sins upon your head? God seemed at
          Calvary, as it were, to take an oath -- sinner, hear it! -- he seemed,
          as it were, to take an oath and say. "By the blood of my Son I swear
          that sin must be punished," and if it is not punished in Christ for
          you, it will be punished in you for yourselves. Is Christ yours,
          sinner? Did he die for you? Do you trust him? If you do, he died for
          you. Do not way, "No, I do not?" Then remember that if you live and
          die without faith in Christ, for every idle word and for every ill act
          that you have done, stroke for stroke, and blow for blow, vengeance
          must chastise you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, to another class of you, this word. If God has in Christ made
          an atonement and opened a way of salvation, what must be your guilt
          who try to open another way; who say, "I will be good and virtuous; I
          will attend to ceremonies; I will save myself?'" Fool that thou art,
          thou hast insulted God in his tenderest point, for thou hast, in fact,
          trampled on the blood of Christ, and said, "I need it not." Oh, if the
          sinner who repents not be damned, with what accumulated terrors shall
          he be damned, who, in addition to his impenitence, heaps affronts upon
          the person of Christ by going about to establish his own
          righteousness. Leave it; leave your rags, you will never make a
          garment of them; leave the pilfered treasure of thine; it is a
          counterfeit; forsake it. I counsel thee to buy of Christ fine raiment,
          that thou mayest be clothed, and fine gold that thou mayest be rich.
        </p>
        <p>
          And consider this, one and all of you, oh my hearers! If Christ hath
          made atonement for the ungodly,then let, the question go round, let it
          go round the aisles and round the gallery, and let it echo in every
          heart, and let it be repeated by every lip, -- "Why not for me?" And
          "Why not for me?" Hope, sinner, hope; he died for the ungodly. If it
          had said he died for the godly, there were no hope for thee. If it had
          been written that he died to save the good, the excellent, and the
          perfect, then thou hast no chance. He died for the ungodly; thou art
          such an one; what reason has thou to conclude that he did not die for
          thee? Hark thee, man; this is what Christ said to thee, "Believe, and
          thou shall be save;" that is, trust, and thou shall be saved. Trust
          thy soul in the hands of him who carried they load upon the cross;
          thrust him now. He died for you; your faith is to us the evidence, and
          to you the proof that Christ bought you with his blood. Delay not; you
          need not even stay to go home to offer a prayer. Trust Christ with you
          soul now. You have nothing else to trust to; hang on him. You are
          going down; you are going down. The waves are gathering about you, and
          soon shall they swallow you up, and we shall hear your gurglings as
          you sink. See, he stretches out his hand. "Sinner," saith he, "I will
          bear thee up; though hell's fiery waves should dash against thee I
          will bear thee through them all, only trust me." What sayest thou,
          sinner? Wilt thou trust him? Oh, my soul, recollect the moment when
          first, I trusted in him! There is joy in heaver over one sinner that
          repenteth, but I hardly think that is greater joy than the joy of the
          repenting sinner when he first finds Christ. So simple and so easy it
          seemed to me when I came to know it. I had only to look and live, only
          to trust and be saved. Year after year had I been running about hither
          and thither to try and do what was done beforehand, to try and get
          ready for that which did not want any readiness. On, happy was that
          day when I ventured to step in by the open door of his mercy, to set
          at the table of grace ready spread, and to eat and drink, asking no
          question! Oh, soul, do the same! Take courage. Trust Christ, and if he
          cast thee away when thou has trusted him -- my soul for thine as we
          meet at the bar of God, I will be pawn and pledge for thee at the
          last, great day if such thou needest; but he cannot and he will not
          cast out any that come to him by faith. May god now accept and bless
          us all, for Jesus' sake! Amen.<br />
