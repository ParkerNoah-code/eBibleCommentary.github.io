          1. Those, therefore, who allege that He took nothing from the Virgin
          do greatly err, [since,] in order that they may cast away the
          inheritance of the flesh, they also reject the analogy [between Him
          and Adam]. For if the one [who sprang] from the earth had indeed
          formation and substance from both the hand and workmanship of God, but
          the other not from the hand and workmanship of God, then He who was
          made after the image and likeness of the former did not, in that case,
          preserve the analogy of man, and He must seem an inconsistent piece of
          work, not having wherewith He may show His wisdom. But this is to say,
          that He also appeared putatively as man when He was not man, and that
          He was made man while taking nothing from man. For if He did not
          receive the substance of flesh from a human being, He neither was made
          man nor the Son of man; and if He was not made what we were, He did no
          great thing in what He suffered and endured. But every one will allow
          that we are [composed of] a body taken from the earth, and a soul
          receiving spirit from God. This, therefore, the Word of God was made,
          recapitulating in Himself His own handiwork; and on this account does
          He confess Himself the Son of man, and blesses "the meek, because they
          shall inherit the earth." The Apostle Paul, moreover, in the Epistle
          to the Galatians, declares plainly, "God sent His Son, made of a
          woman." And again, in that to the Romans, he says, "Concerning His
          Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was
          predestinated as the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of
          holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."

          2. Superfluous, too, in that case is His descent into Mary; for why
          did He come down into her if He were to take nothing of her? Still
          further, if He had taken nothing of Mary, He would never have availed
          Himself of those kinds of food which are derived from the earth, by
          which that body which has been taken from the earth is nourished; nor
          would He have hungered, fasting those forty days, like Moses and
          Elias, unless His body was craving after its own proper nourishment;
          nor, again, would John His disciple have said, when writing of Him,
          "But Jesus, being wearied with the journey, was sitting [to rest];"
          nor would David have proclaimed of Him beforehand, "They have added to
          the grief of my wounds;" nor would He have wept over Lazarus, nor have
          sweated great drops of blood; nor have declared, "My soul is exceeding
          sorrowful;" nor, when His side was pierced, would there have come
          forth blood and water. For all these are tokens of the flesh which had
          been derived from the earth, which He had recapitulated in Himself,
          bearing salvation to His own handiwork.

          3. Wherefore Luke points out that the pedigree which traces the
          generation of our Lord back to Adam contains seventy-two generations,
          connecting the end with the beginning, and implying that it is He who
          has summed up in Himself all nations dispersed from Adam downwards,
          and all languages and generations of men, together with Adam himself.
          Hence also was Adam himself termed by Paul "the figure of Him that was
          to come," because the Word, the Maker of all things, had formed
          beforehand for Himself the future dispensation of the human race,
          connected with the Son of God; God having predestined that the first
          man should be of an animal nature, with this view, that he might be
          saved by the spiritual One. For inasmuch as He had a pre-existence as
          a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also
          be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not
          exist in vain.

          4. In accordance with this design, Mary the Virgin is found obedient,
          saying, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to
          thy word." But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet
          she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but
          being nevertheless as yet a virgin (for in Paradise "they were both
          naked, and were not ashamed," inasmuch as they, having been created a
          short time previously, had no understanding of the procreation of
          children: for it was necessary that they should first come to adult
          age, and then multiply from that time onward), having become
          disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the
          entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed [to her],
          and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become the
          cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race. And on
          this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, the wife of
          him who had betrothed her, although she was as yet a virgin; thus
          indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve, because what is joined
          together could not otherwise be put asunder than by inversion of the
          process by which these bonds of union had arisen; so that the former
          ties be cancelled by the latter, that the latter may set the former
          again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that the first compact
          looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position
          of the first which has been cancelled. For this reason did the Lord
          declare that the first should in truth be last, and the last first.
          And the prophet, too, indicates the same, saying, "instead of fathers,
          children have been born unto thee." For the Lord, having been born
          "the First-begotten of the dead," and receiving into His bosom the
          ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the life of God, He having
          been made Himself the beginning of those that live, as Adam became the
          beginning of those who die. Wherefore also Luke, commencing the
          genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to Adam, indicating that it
          was He who regenerated them into the Gospel of life, and not they Him.
          And thus also it was that the knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by
          the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through
          unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith.
