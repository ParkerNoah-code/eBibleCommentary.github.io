          8. Harden not your heart, as in Meribah, as in the day of Massah in
          the wilderness. 9. When your fathers tempted me, they proved me,
          though yet they had seen my work.10. Forty years, I strove with this
          generation, and said, They are a people that err in heart, and they
          have not known my ways.11. Wherefore I have sworn in my wrath, if they
          shall enter into my rest:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          8. Harden not your heart, as in Meribah The Psalmist, having extolled
          and commended the kindness of God their Shepherd, takes occasion, as
          they were stiffnecked and disobedient, to remind them of their duty,
          as his flock, which was to yield a pliable and meek submission; and
          the more to impress their minds, he upbraids them with the obstinacy
          of their fathers. The term mryvh, Meribah, may be used appellatively
          to mean strife or contention; but as the Psalmist evidently refers to
          the history contained in Exodus 17:2-7, I have preferred understanding
          it of the place -- and so of msh, Massah. In the second clause,
          however, the place where the temptation happened may be thought
          sufficiently described under the term wilderness, and should any read,
          according to the day of temptation (instead of Massah) in the
          wilderness, there can be no objection. Some would have it, that Massah
          and Meribah were two distinct places, but I see no ground to think so;
          and, in a matter of so little importance, we should not be too nice or
          curious. He enlarges in several expressions upon the hardness of heart
          evinced by the people, and, to produce the greater effect, introduces
          God himself as speaking. By hardness of heart, he no doubt means, any
          kind of contempt shown to the word of God, though there are many
          different kinds of it. We find that when proclaimed, it is heard by
          some in a cold and slighting manner; that some fastidiously put it
          away from them after they had received it; that others proudly reject
          it; while again there are men who openly vent their rage against it
          with despite and blasphemy. The Psalmist, in the one term which he has
          employed, comprehends all these defaulters, the careless -- the
          fastidious -- such as deride the word, and such as are actuated in
          their opposition to it by frenzy and passion. Before the heart can be
          judged soft and pliable to the hearing of God's word, it is necessary
          that we receive it with reverence, and with a disposition to obey it.
          If it carry no authority and weight with it, we show that we regard
          him as no more than a mere man like ourselves; and here lies the
          hardness of our hearts, whatever may be the cause of it, whether
          simply carelessness, or pride, or rebellion. He has intentionally
          singled out the odious term here employed, to let us know what an
          execrable thing contempt of God's word is; as, in the Law, adultery is
          used to denote all kinds of fornication and uncleanness, and murder
          all kinds of violence, and injury, hatreds, and enmities. Accordingly,
          the man who simply treats the word of God with neglect, and fails to
          obey it, is said here to have a hard and stony heart, although he may
          not be an open despiser. The attempt is ridiculous which the Papists
          have made to found upon this passage their favorite doctrine of the
          liberty of the will. We are to notice, in the first place, that all
          men's hearts are naturally hard and stony; for Scripture does not
          speak of this as a disease peculiar to a few, but characteristic in
          general of all mankind, (Ezekiel 36:26.) It is an inbred pravity;
          still it is voluntary; we are not insensible in the same manner that
          stones are, and the man who will not suffer himself to be ruled by
          God's word, makes that heart, which was hard before, harder still, and
          is convinced as to his own sense and feeling of obstinacy. The
          consequence by no means follows from this, that softness of heart -- a
          heart flexible indifferently in either direction, is at our command.
          The will of man, through natural corruption, is wholly bent to evil;
          or, to speak more properly, is carried headlong into the commission of
          it. And yet every man, who disobeys God therein, hardens himself; for
          the blame of his wrong doing rests with none but himself.

          9 When your fathers tempted me, they proved me The Psalmist
          insinuates, as I have already remarked, that the Jews had been from
          the first of a perverse and almost intractable spirit. And there were
          two reasons which made it highly useful to remind the children of the
          guilt chargeable upon their fathers. We know how apt men are to follow
          the example of their predecessors; custom begets a sanction; what is
          ancient becomes venerable, and such is the blinding influence of home
          example, that whatever may have been done by our forefathers passes
          for a virtue without examination. We have an instance in Popedom, of
          the audacity with which the authority of the fathers is opposed to
          God's word. The Jews were of all others most liable to be deceived
          upon this side, ever accustomed as they were to boast of their
          fathers. The Psalmist accordingly would detach them from the fathers,
          by taking notice of the monstrous ingratitude with which they had been
          chargeable. A second reason, and one to which I have already adverted,
          is, that he would show them the necessity in which they stood of being
          warned upon the present subject. Had their fathers not manifested a
          rebellions spirit, they might have retorted by asking the question,
          Upon what ground he warned them against hardness of heart, their
          nation having hitherto maintained a character for docility and
          tractableness? The fact being otherwise -- their fathers having from
          the first been perverse and stubborn, the Psalmist had a plain reason
          for insisting upon the correction of this particular vice.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways of interpreting the words which follow. As tempting
          God is nothing else than yielding to a diseased and unwarrantable
          craving after proof of his power, we may consider the verse as
          connected throughout, and read, They tempted me and proved me,
          although they had already seen my work God very justly complains, that
          they should insist upon new proof, after his power had been already
          amply testified by undeniable evidences. There is another meaning,
          however, that may be given to the term proved, -- according to which,
          the meaning of the passage would run as follows: -- Your fathers
          tempted me in asking where God was, notwithstanding all the benefits I
          had done them; and they proved me, that is, they had actual experience
          of what I am, inasmuch as I did not cease to give them open proofs of
          my presence, and consequently they saw my work. Whatever sense we
          adopt, the Psalmist's design is plainly to show how inexcusable the
          Jews were in desiring a discovery of God's power, just as if it had
          been hidden, and had not been taught them by the most incontestable
          proofs. Granting that they had received no foregoing demonstration of
          it, they would have evinced an unbecoming spirit in demanding of God
          why he had failed to provide them with meat and drink; but to doubt
          his presence after he had brought them from Egypt with an outstretched
          hand, and evidenced his nearness to them by most convincing
          testimonies, -- to doubt his presence in the same manner as if it had
          never been revealed, was a degree of perverse forgetfulness which
          aggravated their guilt. Upon the whole, I consider the following to be
          the sense of the passage -- Your fathers tempted me, although they had
          abundantly proved -- perceived by clear and undeniable evidences, that
          I was their God -- nay, although my works had been clearly set before
          them. The lesson is one which is equally applicable to ourselves; for
          the more abundant testimonies we may have had of the power and
          loving-kindness of the Lord, the greater will our sin be, if we insist
          upon receiving additional proofs of them. How many do we find in our
          own day demanding miracles, while others murmur against God because he
          does not indulge their wishes? Some may ask why the Psalmist singles
          out the particular case of Meribah, when there were many other
          instances which he might have adduced. They never ceased to provoke
          God from the moment of their passing the Red Sea; and in bringing this
          one charge only against them, he might seem by his silence on other
          points to justify their conduct. But the figure synecdoche is common
          in Scripture, and it would be natural enough to suppose that one case
          is selected for many. At the same time, another reason for the
          specification may have been, that, as plainly appears from Moses, the
          ingratitude and rebellion of the people reached its greatest height on
          this occasion, when they murmured for water. I am aware that
          interpreters differ upon this. Such, however, was the fact. They then
          crowned their former impiety; nor was it until this outcry was made,
          as the consummating act of all their preceding wickedness, that they
          gave open proof of their obstinacy being incurable.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Forty years I strove with this generation The Psalmist brings it
          forward as an aggravation of their perverse obstinacy, that God strove
          with them for so long a time without effect. Occasionally it will
          happen that there is a violent manifestation of perversity which soon
          subsides; but God complains that he had constant grounds of contention
          with his people, throughout the whole forty years. And this proves to
          us the incurable waywardness of that people. The word generation is
          used with the same view. The word dvr, dor, signifies an age, or the
          allotted term of human life; and it is here applied to the men of an
          age, as if the Psalmist had said, that the Israelites whom God had
          delivered were incorrigible, during the whole period of their lives.
          The verb 'qvt, akut, which I have rendered I strove, is, by some,
          translated contemned, and in the Septuagint it reads, prosochthisa, I
          was incensed, or enraged; but Hebrew interpreters retain the genuine
          meaning, That God strove with them in a continual course of
          contention. This was a remarkable proof of their extreme obstinacy;
          and God is introduced in the verse as formally pronouncing judgment
          upon them, to intimate, that after having shown their ungodliness in
          so many different ways, there could be no doubt regarding their
          infatuation. Erring in heart, is an expression intended not to
          extenuate their conduct, but to stamp it with folly and madness, as if
          he had said, that he had to do with beasts, rather than men endued
          with sense and intelligence. The reason is subjoined, that they would
          not attend to the many works of God brought under their eyes, and more
          than all, to his word; for the Hebrew term drk, derech, which I have
          rendered ways, comprehends his law and repeated admonitions, as well
          as his miracles done before them. It argued amazing infatuation that
          when God had condescended to dwell in such a familiar manner amongst
          them, and had made such illustrious displays of himself, both in word
          and works, they should have shut their eyes and overlooked all that
          had been done. This is the reason why the Psalmist, considering that
          they wandered in error under so much light as they enjoyed, speaks of
          their stupidity as amounting to madness.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Wherefore I have sworn in my wrath I see no objection to the
          relative 'sr, asher, being understood in its proper sense and reading
          -- To whom I have sworn. The Greek version, taking it for a mark of
          similitude, reads, As I have sworn But I think that it may be properly
          considered as expressing an inference or conclusion; not as if they
          were then at last deprived of the promised inheritance when they
          tempted God, but the Psalmist, having spoken, in the name of God, of
          that obstinacy which they displayed, takes occasion to draw the
          inference that there was good reason for their being prohibited, with
          an oath, from entering the land. Proportionally as they multiplied
          their provocations, it became the more evident that, being
          incorrigible, they had been justly cut off from God's rest. The
          meaning would be more clear by reading in the pluperfect tense -- I
          had sworn; for God had already shut them out from the promised
          inheritance, having foreseen their misconduct; before he thus strove
          with them. I have elsewhere adverted to the explanation which is to be
          given of the elliptical form in which the oath runs. The land of
          Canaan is called God's rest in reference to the promise. Abraham and
          his posterity had been wanderers in it until the full time came for
          entering upon the possession of it. Egypt had been a temporary asylum,
          and, as it were, a place of exile. In preparing to plant the Jews,
          agreeably to his promise, in their rightful patrimony of Canaan, God
          might very properly call it his rest. The word must be taken, however,
          in the active sense; this being the great benefit which God bestowed,
          that the Jews were to dwell there, as in their native soil, and in a
          quiet habitation. We might stop a moment here to compare what the
          Apostle states in the third and fourth chapters of his Epistle to the
          Hebrews, with the passage now before us. That the Apostle follows the
          Greek version, need occasion no surprise. Neither is he to be
          considered as undertaking professedly to treat this passage. He only
          insists upon the adverb To-day, and upon the word Rest And first, he
          states that the expression to-day, is not to be confined to the time
          when the Law was given, but properly applies to the Gospel, when God
          began to speak more openly. The fuller and more perfect declaration of
          doctrine demanded the greater share of attention. God has not ceased
          to speak: he has revealed his Son, and is daily inviting us to come
          unto him; and, undoubtedly, it is our incumbent duty, under such an
          opportunity, to obey his voice. The Apostle next reasons from the
          rest, to an extent which we are not to suppose that the words of the
          Psalmist themselves warrant. He takes it up as a first position, that
          since there was an implied promise in the punishment here denounced,
          there must have been some better rest promised to the people of God
          than the land of Canaan. For, when the Jews had entered the land, God
          held out to his people the prospect of another rest, which is defined
          by the Apostle to consist in that renouncing of ourselves, whereby we
          rest from our own works while God worketh in us. From this, he takes
          occasion to compare the old Sabbath, or rest, under the Law, which was
          figurative, with the newness of spiritual life. When his said that he
          swore in his wrath, this intimates that he was in a manner freed to
          inflict this punishment, that the provocation was of no common or
          slight kind, but that their awful obstinacy inflamed his anger, and
          drew from him this oath.<br />
