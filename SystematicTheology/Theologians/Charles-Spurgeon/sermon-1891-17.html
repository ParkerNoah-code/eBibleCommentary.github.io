          1. The all-wise Sige then announced the production of the
          four-and-twenty elements to him as follows: -- Along with Monotes
          there coexisted Henotes, from which sprang two productions, as we have
          remarked above, Monas and Hen, which, added to the other two, make
          four, for twice two are four. And again, two and four, when added
          together, exhibit the number six. And further, these six being
          quadrupled, give rise to the twenty-four forms. And the names of the
          first Tetrad, which are understood to be most holy, and not capable of
          being expressed in words, are known by the Son alone, while the father
          also knows what they are. The other names which are to be uttered with
          respect, and faith, and reverence, are, according to him, Arrhetos and
          Sige, Pater and Aletheia. Now the entire number of this Tetrad amounts
          to four-and-twenty letters; for the name Arrhetos contains in itself
          seven letters, Seige five, Pater five, and Aletheia seven. If all
          these be added together -- twice five, and twice seven -- they
          complete the number twenty-four. In like manner, also, the second
          Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, reveal the same number
          of elements. Moreover, that name of the Saviour which may be
          pronounced, viz., Jesus ['Iesous], consists of six letters, but His
          unutterable name comprises four-and-twenty letters. The name Christ
          the Son (huios Chreistos) comprises twelve letters, but that which is
          unpronounceable in Christ contains thirty letters. And for this reason
          he declares that He is Alpha and Omega, that he may indicate the dove,
          inasmuch as that bird has this number [in its name].
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But Jesus, he affirms, has the following unspeakable origin. From
          the mother of all things, that is, the first Tetrad, there came forth
          the second Tetrad, after the manner of a daughter; and thus an Ogdoad
          was formed, from which, again, a Decad proceeded: thus was produced a
          Decad and an Ogdoad. The Decad, then, being joined with the Ogdoad,
          and multiplying it ten times, gave rise to the number eighty; and,
          again, multiplying eighty ten times, produced the number eight
          hundred. Thus, then, the whole number of the letters proceeding from
          the Ogdoad [multiplied] into the Decad, is eight hundred and
          eighty-eight. This is the name of Jesus; for this name, if you reckon
          up the numerical value of the letters, amounts to eight hundred and
          eighty-eight. Thus, then, you have a clear statement of their opinion
          as to the origin of the supercelestial Jesus. Wherefore, also, the
          alphabet of the Greeks contains eight Monads, eight Decads, and eight
          Hecatads , which present the number eight hundred and eighty-eight,
          that is, Jesus, who is formed of all numbers; and on this account He
          is called Alpha and Omega, indicating His origin from all. And, again,
          they put the matter thus: If the first Tetrad be added up according to
          the progression of number, the number ten appears. For one, and two,
          and three, and four, when added together, form ten; and this, as they
          will have it, is Jesus. Moreover, Chreistus, he says, being a word of
          eight letters, indicates the first Ogdoad, and this, when multiplied
          by ten, gives birth to Jesus (888). And Christ the Son, he says, is
          also spoken of, that is, the Duodecad. For the name Son, (uios)
          contains four letters, and Christ (Chreistus) eight, which, being
          combined, point out the greatness of the Duodecad. But, he alleges,
          before the Episemon of this name appeared, that is Jesus the Son,
          mankind were involved in great ignorance and error. But when this name
          of six letters was manifested (the person bearing it clothing Himself
          in flesh, that He might come under the apprehension of man's senses,
          and having in Himself these six and twenty-four letters), then,
          becoming acquainted with Him, they ceased from their ignorance, and
          passed from death unto life, this name serving as their guide to the
          Father of truth. For the Father of all had resolved to put an end to
          ignorance, and to destroy death. But this abolishing of ignorance was
          just the knowledge of Him. And therefore that man (Anthropos) was
          chosen according to His will, having been formed after the image of
          the [corresponding] power above.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As to the Æons, they proceeded from the Tetrad, and in that Tetrad
          were Anthropos and Ecclesia, Logos and Zoe. The powers, then, he
          declares, who emanated from these, generated that Jesus who appeared
          upon the earth. The angel Gabriel took the place of Logos, the Holy
          Spirit that of Zoe, the Power of the Highest that of Anthropos, while
          the Virgin pointed out the place of Ecclesia. And thus, by a special
          dispensation, there was generated by Him, through Mary, that man,
          whom, as He passed through the womb, the Father of all chose to
          [obtain] the knowledge of Himself by means of the Word. And on His
          coming to the water [of baptism], there descended on Him, in the form
          of a dove, that Being who had formerly ascended on high, and completed
          the twelfth number, in whom there existed the seed of those who were
          produced contemporaneously with Himself, and who descended and
          ascended along with Him. Moreover, he maintains that power which
          descended was the seed of the Father, which had in itself both the
          Father and the Son, as well as that power of Sige which is known by
          means of them, but cannot be expressed in language, and also all the
          Æons. And this was that Spirit who spoke by the mouth of Jesus, and
          who confessed that He was the son of Man as well as revealed the
          Father, and who, having descended into Jesus, was made one with Him.
          And he says that the Saviour formed by special dispensation did indeed
          destroy death, but that Christ made known the Father. He maintains,
          therefore, that Jesus is the name of that man formed by a special
          dispensation, and that He was formed after the likeness and form of
          that [heavenly] Anthropos, who was about to descend upon Him. After He
          had received that Æon, He possessed Anthropos himself, and Logos
          himself, and Pater, and Arrhetus, and Sige, and Aletheia, and
          Ecclesia, and Zoe.

          4. Such ravings, we may now well say, go beyond Iu, Iu, Pheu, Pheu,
          and every kind of tragic exclamation or utterance of misery. For who
          would not detest one who is the wretched contriver of such audacious
          falsehoods, when he perceives the truth turned by Marcus into a mere
          image, and that punctured all over with the letters of the alphabet?
          The Greeks confess that they first received sixteen letters from
          Cadmus, and that but recently, as compared with the beginning, [the
          vast antiquity of which is implied] in the common proverb: "Yesterday
          and before;" and afterwards, in the course of time, they themselves
          invented at one period the aspirates, and at another the double
          letters, while, last of all, they say Palamedes added the long letters
          to the former. Was it so, then, that until these things took place
          among the Greeks, truth had no existence? For, according to thee,
          Marcus, the body of truth is posterior to Cadmus and those who
          preceded him -- posterior also to those who added the rest of the
          letters -- posterior even to thyself! For thou alone hast formed that
          which is called by thee the truth into an [outward, visible] image.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But who will tolerate thy nonsensical Sige, who names Him that
          cannot be named, and expounds the nature of Him that is unspeakable,
          and searches out Him that is unsearchable, and declares that He whom
          thou maintainest to be destitute of body and form, opened His mouth
          and sent forth the Word, as if He were included among organized
          beings; and that His Word, while like to His Author, and bearing the
          image of the invisible, nevertheless consisted of thirty elements and
          four syllables? It will follow, then, according to thy theory, that
          the Father of all, in accordance with the likeness of the Word,
          consists of thirty elements and four syllables! Or, again, who will
          tolerate thee in thy juggling with forms and numbers, -- at one time
          thirty, at another twenty-four, and at another, again, only six, --
          whilst thou shuttest up [in these] the Word of God, the Founder, and
          Framer, and Maker of all things; and then, again, cutting Him up
          piecemeal into four syllables and thirty elements; and bringing down
          the Lord of all who founded the heavens to the number eight hundred
          and eighty-eight, so that He should be similar to the alphabet; and
          subdividing the Father, who cannot be contained, but contains all
          things, into a Tetrad, and an Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a Duodecad; and
          by such multiplications, setting forth the unspeakable and
          inconceivable nature of the Father, as thou thyself declarest it to
          be? And showing thyself a very Dædalus for evil invention, and the
          wicked architect of the supreme power, thou dost construct a nature
          and substance for Him whom thou callest incorporeal and immaterial,
          out of a multitude of letters, generated the one by the other. And
          that power whom thou affirmest to be indivisible, thou dost
          nevertheless divide into consonants, and vowels, and semi-vowels; and,
          falsely ascribing those letters which are mute to the Father of all
          things, and to His Ennoea (thought), thou hast driven on all that
          place confidence in thee to the highest point of blasphemy, and to the
          grossest impiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. With good reason, therefore, and very fittingly, in reference to
          thy rash attempt, has that divine elder and preacher of the truth
          burst forth in verse against thee as follows: --
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>"Marcus, thou former of idols, inspector of portents,</p>
        <p>
          Skill'd in consulting the stars, and deep in the black arts of magic,
        </p>
        <p>Ever by tricks such as these confirming the doctrines of error,</p>
        <p>Furnishing signs unto those involved by thee in deception,</p>
        <p>Wonders of power that is utterly severed from God and apostate,</p>
        <p>Which Satan, thy true father, enables thee still to accomplish,</p>
        <p>By means of Azazel, that fallen and yet mighty angel, --</p>
        <p>Thus making thee the precursor of his own impious actions."</p>
        <p>
          Such are the words of the saintly elder. And I shall endeavour to
          state the remainder of their mystical system, which runs out to great
          length, in brief compass, and to bring to the light what has for a
          long time been concealed. For in this way such things will become
          easily susceptible of exposure by all.<br />
