          12. When they were but very few in number; and strangers in it.13. And
          walked about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another
          people.14. He did not suffer men to hurt them; and rebuked kings for
          their sake; 15. Saying, Touch not my anointed ones, and do my prophets
          no wrong.

          12. When they were but very few in number The prophet here recounts
          the benefits which God had conferred upon the holy fathers from the
          commencement, to manifest that even long before the deliverance from
          Egypt, the covenant was not ineffectual. The great object aimed at in
          this recital, is to show that ever since God took Abraham under his
          protection, he cherished him in a wonderful manner, and also that his
          fatherly love and care were displayed in maintaining and defending the
          other two patriarchs. When it is said, that they were but very few in
          number, the power of God by this circumstance is not only magnified,
          but the cause why he was so beneficent towards them is also pointed
          out. We must then, in the first place, attend to this, that the
          prophet, lest the Jews should arrogate anything to themselves,
          expressly declares, that their fathers had experienced the divine
          favor, even when they were feeble and despised, wandering from place
          to place, in every respect poor and miserable according to the flesh.
          Thus also Moses reproaches them,
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
          were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all
          people; but because the Lord loved you." Deuteronomy 7:7, 8,
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, in the choosing of this people, no regard was had either to
          number, or to any excellence whatever. There was only the house of
          Abraham, and yet it was barren. Isaac was compelled to banish to a
          distance from him one of his two sons, and he saw the other cut off
          from his family. The house of Jacob was indeed more fruitful, but it
          was nevertheless of a low condition. Besides, they were not only
          ignoble and despised when sojourning in a strange land, but famine,
          and the want of other things also, compelled them frequently to go
          from one place to another. All these things being taken into view, the
          consideration of human worth falls to the ground, and it is clearly
          seen, that all the blessings which God had bestowed upon them flowed
          from no other fountain than his own free love. And the cause of this
          love is not to be sought for out of himself. If the Holy Spirit is so
          careful in magnifying the grace of God in these earthly blessings, how
          much more must he observe this rule, when the subject of which he
          speaks is the heavenly inheritance! When it is said, that they walked
          about from nation to nation, this intimates the more plainly how
          wonderfully the divine protection was displayed in preserving them.
          Had they found any quiet nest in which to repose, such comfort would
          have been a notable sign of the divine goodness; but when they were as
          exiles in divers countries, and were driven from one place to another
          with bitter scorn, as chaff is driven about by the wind, the
          guardianship which God exercised over them shone forth much more
          conspicuously. Since their life everywhere hung only by a thread, and
          the changing of their place of sojourn exposed them from time to time
          to fresh injuries, it is evident that it was the divine power alone
          which preserved them in safety.

          14. He did not suffer men to hurt them Abraham and his children had
          not merely two or three enemies: they were harassed by whole nations.
          As then many rose up one after another in troops against them, the
          Psalmist says indefinitely, that men were withheld from hurting them;
          for 'dm, adam, is the word here used, which is the one most generally
          employed to signify man He next amplifies the love of God towards his
          servants, in setting himself in opposition to kings for their sake.
          When God did not spare even the kings of Egypt and Gerar, it is
          evident how precious the welfare of Abraham and his offspring was in
          his sight. We have said a little before that the holy fathers were of
          no estimation in the eyes of the world. God therefore displayed his
          goodness so much the more signally in preferring them to kings. Now we
          here see, that the Jews were humbled in the person of their fathers,
          that they might not imagine that they found favor in the sight of God
          by any merit of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. Saying, Touch not my anointed ones The Psalmist proceeds farther,
          affirming, that when God made war against kings for the sake of his
          servants, they were defended by him, not only as he is accustomed to
          succor the miserable and the unjustly oppressed, but because he had
          taken them under his special guardianship. God protects his people,
          not only upon a general ground, but because he has declared on account
          of his free adoption, that he will maintain them. This is the reason
          why these holy patriarchs are here honored with two designations, his
          prophets and his anointed ones In speaking of other men, God would
          have said, Touch not these men who have done wrong to nobody, hurt not
          these poor wretched creatures who have deserved no such treatment at
          your hands. But in the person of Abraham and his children, he shows
          that there was another reason for his defending them. He calls them
          anointed ones, because he had set them apart to be his peculiar
          people. In the same sense, he designates them prophets, (a title with
          which Abraham is also honored, Genesis 20:7) not only because God had
          manifested himself more intimately to them, but also because they
          faithfully spread around them divine truth, that the memory of it
          might survive them, and flourish after their death. Anointing, it is
          true, was not as yet in use, as it was afterwards under the law; but
          the prophet teaches, that what God at a subsequent period exhibited in
          the ceremonies of the law was really and in very deed in Abraham, even
          as God engraves the mark of sanctification on all his chosen ones. If
          God's inward anointing was of such powerful efficacy, even at the time
          when he had not yet appointed, or delivered the figures of the law,
          with how much greater care will he defend his servants now, after
          having exhibited to us the plenitude of anointing in his only begotten
          Son!<br />
