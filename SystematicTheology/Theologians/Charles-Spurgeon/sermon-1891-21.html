          1. I judge it necessary to add to these details also what, by garbling
          passages of Scripture, they try to persuade us concerning their
          Propator, who was unknown to all before the coming of Christ. Their
          object in this is to show that our Lord announced another Father than
          the Maker of this universe, whom, as we said before, they impiously
          declare to have been the fruit of a defect. For instance, when the
          prophet Isaiah says, "But Israel hath not known Me, and My people have
          not understood Me," they pervert his words to mean ignorance of the
          invisible Bythus. And that which is spoken by Hosea, "There is no
          truth in them, nor the knowledge of God," they strive to give the same
          reference. And, "There is none that understandeth, or that seeketh
          after God: they have all gone out of the way, they are together become
          unprofitable," they maintain to be said concerning ignorance of
          Bythus. Also that which is spoken by Moses, "No man shall see God and
          live," has, as they would persuade us, the same reference.

          2. For they falsely hold, that the Creator was seen by the prophets.
          But this passage, "No man shall see God and live," they would
          interpret as spoken of His greatness unseen and unknown by all; and
          indeed that these words, "No man shall see God," are spoken concerning
          the invisible Father, the Maker of the universe, is evident to us all;
          but that they are not used concerning that Bythus whom they conjure
          into existence, but concerning the Creator (and He is the invisible
          God), shall be shown as we proceed. They maintain that Daniel also set
          forth the same thing when he begged of the angels explanations of the
          parables, as being himself ignorant of them. But the angel, hiding
          from him the great mystery of Bythus, said unto him, "Go thy way
          quickly, Daniel, for these sayings are closed up until those who have
          understanding do understand them, and those who are white be made
          white." Moreover, they vaunt themselves as being the white and the men
          of good understanding.<br />
