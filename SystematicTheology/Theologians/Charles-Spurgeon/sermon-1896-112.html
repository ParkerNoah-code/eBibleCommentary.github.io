          1 When Israel went out from Egypt That exodus being a remarkable
          pledge and symbol of God's love for the children of Abraham, it is not
          surprising that it should be so frequently called to remembrance. In
          the beginning of the psalm, the prophet informs us that the people
          whom God purchased at so great a price are no more their own. The
          opinion of certain expositors, that at that time the tribe of Judah
          was consecrated to the service of God, according to what is said in
          Exodus 19:6, and 1 Peter 2:9, appears to me foreign to the prophet's
          design. All doubt about the matter is removed by what is immediately
          subjoined, God's taking Israel under his rule, which is simply a
          repetition of the same sentiment in other words. Judah being the most
          powerful and numerous of all the tribes, and occupying the chief place
          among them, here takes the precedency of the rest of the people. At
          the same time, it is very evident that the honor which is in a
          peculiar manner ascribed to them, belongs equally to the whole body of
          the people. When God is said to be sanctified, it must be understood
          that the prophet is speaking after the manner of men, because, in
          himself, God is incapable of increase or diminution. Judah is called
          his holiness, and Israel his dominion, because his holy majesty, which
          hitherto had been little known, secured the veneration of all who had
          witnessed the displays of his incredible power. In delivering his
          people, God erected a kingdom for himself and procured respect for his
          sacred name; if then they do not constantly reflect upon such a
          remarkable instance of his kindness, their insensibility is totally
          inexcusable.

          3 The sea saw, and fled He does not enumerate in succession all the
          miracles which were wrought at that time, but briefly alludes to the
          sea, which, though a lifeless and senseless element, is yet struck
          with terror at the power of God. Jordan did the same, and the very
          mountains shook. It is in a poetical strain that the Psalmist
          describes the receding of the sea and of the Jordan. The description,
          however, does not exceed the facts of the case. The sea, in rendering
          such obedience to its Creator, sanctified his name; and Jordan, by its
          submission, put honor upon his power; and the mountains, by their
          quaking, proclaimed how they were overawed at the presence of his
          dreadful majesty. By these examples it is not meant to celebrate God's
          power more than the fatherly care and desire which he manifests for
          the preservation of the Church; and, accordingly, Israel is very
          properly distinguished from the sea, the Jordan, and the mountains --
          there being a very marked difference between the chosen people and the
          insensate elements.
