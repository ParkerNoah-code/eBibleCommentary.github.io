        <p>To All Christians.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Of the church's receiving only the property of the faithful, and not
          the price of the same, as in the times of the apostles; and as to why
          elevated seats should be prepared in the churches for the bishops; and
          as to the fact that no one should have intercourse with those whom the
          bishops excommunicate, and that no one should receive those whom they
          have cast out in any manner whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Urban, bishop, to all Christians, in sanctification of the spirit, in
          obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord,
          greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It becomes all Christians, most dearly beloved, to imitate Him whose
          name they have received. "What doth it profit, my brethren," says the
          Apostle James, "though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?"
          "My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that ye receive (sumitis)
          the greater condemnation; for in many things we offend all." "Let him
          who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you, show out of a
          good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom."
