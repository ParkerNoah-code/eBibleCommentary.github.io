        <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
        <p>
          Our first proposition was, That there is satisfactory evidence that
          many pretending to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles,
          passed their lives in labours, dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily
          undertaken and undergone in attestation of the accounts which they
          delivered, and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of
          those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same motives,
          to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our second proposition, and which now remains to be treated of, is,
          That there is NOT satisfactory evidence, that persons pretending to be
          original witnesses of any other similar miracles have acted in the
          same manner, in attestation of the accounts which they delivered, and
          solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enter upon this part of my argument, by declaring how far my belief
          in miraculous accounts goes. If the reformers in the time of
          Wickliffe, or of Luther; or those of England in the time of Henry the
          Eighth, or of Queen Mary; or the founders of our religious sects
          since, such as were Mr. Whitfield and Mr. Wesley in our times—had
          undergone the life of toil and exertion, of danger and sufferings,
          which we know that many of them did undergo, for a miraculous story;
          that is to say, if they had founded their public ministry upon the
          allegation of miracles wrought within their own knowledge, and upon
          narratives which could not be resolved into delusion or mistake; and
          if it had appeared that their conduct really had its origin in these
          accounts, I should have believed them. Or, to borrow an instance which
          will be familiar to every one of my readers, if the late Mr. Howard
          had undertaken his labours and journeys in attestation, and in
          consequence of a clear and sensible miracle, I should have believed
          him also. Or, to represent the same thing under a third supposition;
          if Socrates had professed to perform public miracles at Athens; if the
          friends of Socrates, Phaedo, Cebes, Crito, and Simmias, together with
          Plato, and many of his followers, relying upon the attestations which
          these miracles afforded to his pretensions, had, at the hazard of
          their lives, and the certain expense of their ease and tranquillity,
          gone about Greece, after his death, to publish and propagate his
          doctrines: and if these things had come to our knowledge, in the same
          way as that in which the life of Socrates is now transmitted to us
          through the hands of his companions and disciples, that is, by
          writings received without doubt as theirs, from the age in which they
          were published to the present, I should have believed this likewise.
          And my belief would, in each case, be much strengthened, if the
          subject of the mission were of importance to the conduct and happiness
          of human life; if it testified anything which it behoved mankind to
          know from such authority; if the nature of what it delivered required
          the sort of proof which it alleged; if the occasion was adequate to
          the interposition, the end worthy of the means. In the last ease, my
          faith would be much confirmed if the effects of the transaction
          remained; more especially if a change had been wrought, at the time,
          in the opinion and conduct of such numbers as to lay the foundation of
          an institution, and of a system of doctrines, which had since
          overspread the greatest part of the civilized world. I should have
          believed, I say, the testimony in these cases; yet none of them do
          more than come up to the apostolic history.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any one choose to call assent to its evidence credulity, it is at
          least incumbent upon him to produce examples in which the same
          evidence hath turned out to be fallacious. And this contains the
          precise question which we are now to agitate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In stating the comparison between our evidence, and what our
          adversaries may bring into competition with ours, we will divide the
          distinctions which we wish to propose into two kinds,—those which
          relate to the proof, and those which relate to the miracles. Under the
          former head we may lay out of the case:—
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Such accounts of supernatural events as are found only in histories
          by some ages posterior to the transaction; and of which it is evident
          that the historian could know little more than his reader. Ours is
          contemporary history. This difference alone removes out of our way the
          miraculous history of Pythagoras, who lived five hundred years before
          the Christian era, written by Porphyry and Jamblicus, who lived three
          hundred years after that era; the prodigies of Livy&#x27;s history;
          the fables of the heroic ages; the whole of the Greek and Roman, as
          well as of the Gothic mythology; a great part of the legendary history
          of Popish saints, the very best attested of which is extracted from
          the certificates that are exhibited during the process of their
          canonization, a ceremony which seldom takes place till a century after
          their deaths. It applies also with considerable force to the miracles
          of Apollonius Tyaneus, which are contained in a solitary history of
          his life, published by Philostratus above a hundred years after his
          death; and in which, whether Philostratus had any prior account to
          guide him, depends upon his single unsupported assertion. Also to some
          of the miracles of the third century, especially to one extraordinary
          instance, the account of Gregory, bishop of Neocesarea, called
          Thaumaturgus, delivered in the writings of Gregory of Nyssen, who
          lived one hundred and thirty years after the subject of his panegyric.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of this circumstance is shown to have been accurately
          exemplified in the history of Ignatius Loyola, founder of the order of
          Jesuits. (Douglas&#x27;s Criterion of Miracles, p. 74.) His life,
          written by a companion of his, and by one of the order, was published
          about fifteen years after his death. In which life, the author, so far
          from ascribing any miracles to Ignatius, industriously states the
          reasons why he was not invested with any such power. The life was
          republished fifteen years afterwards, with the addition of many
          circumstances which were the fruit, the author says, of further
          inquiry, and of diligent examination; but still with a total silence
          about miracles. When Ignatius had been dead nearly sixty years, the
          Jesuits, conceiving a wish to have the founder of their order placed
          in the Roman calendar, began, as it should seem, for the first time,
          to attribute to him a catalogue of miracles which could not then be
          distinctly disproved; and which there was, in those who governed the
          church, a strong disposition to admit upon the slenderest proofs.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We may lay out of the case accounts published in one country, of
          what passed in a distant country, without any proof that such accounts
          were known or received at home. In the case of Christianity, Judea,
          which was the scene of the transaction, was the centre of the mission.
          The story was published in the place in which it was acted. The church
          of Christ was first planted at Jerusalem itself. With that church
          others corresponded. From thence the primitive teachers of the
          institution went forth; thither they assembled. The church of
          Jerusalem, and the several churches of Judea, subsisted from the
          beginning, and for many ages; received also the same books and the
          same accounts as other churches did. (The succession of many eminent
          bishops of Jerusalem in the first three centuries is distinctly
          preserved; as Alexander, A.D. 212, who succeeded Narcissus, then 116
          years old.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This distinction disposes, amongst others, of the above-mentioned
          miracles of Apollonius Tyaneus, most of which are related to have been
          performed in India; no evidence remaining that either the miracles
          ascribed to him, or the history of those miracles, were ever heard of
          in India. Those of Francis Xavier, the Indian missionary, with many
          others of the Romish breviary, are liable to the same objection, viz.
          that the accounts of them were published at a vast distance from the
          supposed scene of the wonders. (Douglas&#x27;s Crit. p. 84.)
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We lay out of the case transient rumours. Upon the first
          publication of an extraordinary account, or even of an article of
          ordinary intelligence, no one who is not personally acquainted with
          the transaction can know whether it be true or false, because any man
          may publish any story. It is in the future confirmation, or
          contradiction, of the account; in its permanency, or its
          disappearance; its dying away into silence, or its increasing in
          notoriety; its being followed up by subsequent accounts, and being
          repeated in different and independent accounts—that solid truth is
          distinguished from fugitive lies. This distinction is altogether on
          the side of Christianity. The story did not drop. On the contrary, it
          was succeeded by a train of action and events dependent upon it. The
          accounts which we have in our hands were composed after the first
          reports must have subsided. They were followed by a train of writings
          upon the subject. The historical testimonies of the transaction were
          many and various, and connected with letters, discourses,
          controversies, apologies, successively produced by the same
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We may lay out of the case what I call naked history. It has been
          said, that if the prodigies of the Jewish history had been found only
          in fragments of Manetho, or Berosus, we should have paid no regard to
          them: and I am willing to admit this. If we knew nothing of the fact,
          but from the fragment; if we possessed no proof that these accounts
          had been credited and acted upon, from times, probably, as ancient as
          the accounts themselves; if we had no visible effects connected with
          the history, no subsequent or collateral testimony to confirm it;
          under these circumstances I think that it would be undeserving of
          credit. But this certainly is not our case. In appreciating the
          evidence of Christianity, the books are to be combined with the
          institution; with the prevalency of the religion at this day; with the
          time and place of its origin, which are acknowledged points; with the
          circumstances of its rise and progress, as collected from external
          history; with the fact of our present books being received by the
          votaries of the institution from the beginning; with that of other
          books coming after these, filled with accounts of effects and
          consequences resulting from the transaction, or referring to the
          transaction, or built upon it; lastly, with the consideration of the
          number and variety of the books themselves, the different writers from
          which they proceed, the different views with which they were written,
          so disagreeing as to repel the suspicion of confederacy, so agreeing
          as to show that they were founded in a common original, i. e. in a
          story substantially the same. Whether this proof be satisfactory or
          not, it is properly a cumulation of evidence, by no means a naked or
          solitary record.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. A mark of historical truth, although only a certain way, and to a
          certain degree, is particularity in names, dates, places,
          circumstances, and in the order of events preceding or following the
          transaction: of which kind, for instance, is the particularity in the
          description of St. Paul&#x27;s voyage and shipwreck, in the 27th
          chapter of the Acts, which no man, I think, can read without being
          convinced that the writer was there; and also in the account of the
          cure and examination of the blind man in the 9th chapter of St.
          John&#x27;s Gospel, which bears every mark of personal knowledge on
          the part of the historian. (Both these chapters ought to be read for
          the sake of this very observation.) I do not deny that fiction has
          often the particularity of truth; but then it is of studied and
          elaborate fiction, or of a formal attempt to deceive, that we observe
          this. Since, however, experience proves that particularity is not
          confined to truth, I have stated that it is a proof of truth only to a
          certain extent, i. e. it reduces the question to this, whether we can
          depend or not upon the probity of the relater? which is a considerable
          advance in our present argument; for an express attempt to deceive, in
          which case alone particularity can appear without truth, is charged
          upon the evangelists by few. If the historian acknowledge himself to
          have received his intelligence from others, the particularity of the
          narrative shows, prima facie, the accuracy of his inquiries, and the
          fulness of his information. This remark belongs to St. Luke&#x27;s
          history. Of the particularity which we allege, many examples may be
          found in all the Gospels. And it is very difficult to conceive that
          such numerous particularities as are almost everywhere to be met with
          in the Scriptures should be raised out of nothing, or be spun out of
          the imagination without any fact to go upon.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;There is always some truth where there are considerable
          particularities related, and they always seem to bear some proportion
          to one another. Thus, there is a great want of the particulars of
          time, place, and persons in Manetho&#x27;s account of the Egyptian
          Dynasties, Etesias&#x27;s of the Assyrian Kings, and those which the
          technical chronologers have given of the ancient kingdoms of Greece;
          and, agreeably thereto, the accounts have much fiction and falsehood,
          with some truth: whereas Thucydides&#x27;s History of the
          Peloponnesian War, and Caesar&#x27;s of the War in Gaul, in both which
          the particulars of time, place, and persons are mentioned, are
          universally esteemed true to a great degree of exactness.&quot;
          Hartley, vol. ii. p. 109. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be remarked, however, that this particularity is only to be
          looked for in direct history. It is not natural in references or
          allusions, which yet, in other respects, often afford, as far as they
          go, the most unsuspicious evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. We lay out of the case such stories of supernatural events as
          require, on the part of the hearer, nothing more than an otiose
          assent; stories upon which nothing depends, in which no interest is
          involved, nothing is to be done or changed in consequence of believing
          them. Such stories are credited, if the careless assent that is given
          to them deserve that name, more by the indolence of the hearer, than
          by his judgment: or, though not much credited, are passed from one to
          another without inquiry or resistance. To this case, and to this case
          alone, belongs what is called the love of the marvellous. I have never
          known it carry men further. Men do not suffer persecution from the
          love of the marvellous. Of the indifferent nature we are speaking of
          are most vulgar errors and popular superstition: most, for instance,
          of the current reports of apparitions. Nothing depends upon their
          being true or false. But not, surely, of this kind were the alleged
          miracles of Christ and his apostles. They decided, if true, the most
          important question upon which the human mind can fix its anxiety. They
          claimed to regulate the opinions of mankind upon subjects in which
          they are not only deeply concerned, but usually refractory and
          obstinate. Men could not be utterly careless in such a case as this.
          If a Jew took up the story, he found his darling partiality to his own
          nation and law wounded; if a Gentile, he found his idolatry and
          polytheism reprobated and condemned. Whoever entertained the account,
          whether Jew or Gentile, could not avoid the following
          reflection:—&quot;If these things be true, I must give up the opinions
          and principles in which I have been brought up, the religion in which
          my fathers lived and died.&quot; It is not conceivable that a man
          should do this upon any idle report or frivolous account, or, indeed,
          without being fully satisfied and convinced of the truth and
          credibility of the narrative to which he trusted. But it did not stop
          at opinions. They who believed Christianity acted upon it. Many made
          it the express business of their lives to publish the intelligence. It
          was required of those who admitted that intelligence to change
          forthwith their conduct and their principles, to take up a different
          course of life, to part with their habits and gratifications, and
          begin a new set of rules and system of behaviour. The apostles, at
          least, were interested not to sacrifice their ease, their fortunes,
          and their lives for an idle tale; multitudes beside them were induced,
          by the same tale, to encounter opposition, danger, and sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be said, that the mere promise of a future state would do all
          this; I answer, that the mere promise of a future state, without any
          evidence to give credit or assurance to it, would do nothing. A few
          wandering fishermen talking of a resurrection of the dead could
          produce no effect. If it be further said that men easily believe what
          they anxiously desire; I again answer that in my opinion, the very
          contrary of this is nearer to the truth. Anxiety of desire,
          earnestness of expectation, the vastness of an event, rather causes
          men to disbelieve, to doubt, to dread a fallacy, to distrust, and to
          examine. When our Lord&#x27;s resurrection was first reported to the
          apostles, they did not believe, we are told, for joy. This was
          natural, and is agreeable to experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. We have laid out of the case those accounts which require no more
          than a simple assent; and we now also lay out of the case those which
          come merely in affirmance of opinions already formed. This last
          circumstance is of the utmost importance to notice well. It has long
          been observed, that Popish miracles happen in Popish countries; that
          they make no converts; which proves that stories are accepted when
          they fall in with principles already fixed, with the public
          sentiments, or with the sentiments of a party already engaged on the
          side the miracle supports, which would not be attempted to be produced
          in the face of enemies, in opposition to reigning tenets or favourite
          prejudices, or when, if they be believed, the belief must draw men
          away from their preconceived and habitual opinions, from their modes
          of life and rules of action. In the former case, men may not only
          receive a miraculous account, but may both act and suffer on the side,
          and, in the cause, which the miracle supports, yet not act or suffer
          for the miracle, but in pursuance of a prior persuasion. The miracle,
          like any other argument which only confirms what was before believed,
          is admitted with little examination. In the moral, as in the natural
          world, it is change which requires a cause. Men are easily fortified
          in their old opinions, driven from them with great difficulty. Now how
          does this apply to the Christian history? The miracles there recorded
          were wrought in the midst of enemies, under a government, a
          priesthood, and a magistracy decidedly and vehemently adverse to them,
          and to the pretensions which they supported. They were Protestant
          miracles in a Popish country; they were Popish miracles in the midst
          of Protestants. They produced a change; they established a society
          upon the spot, adhering to the belief of them; they made converts; and
          those who were converted gave up to the testimony their most fixed
          opinions and most favourite prejudices. They who acted and suffered in
          the cause acted and suffered for the miracles: for there was no
          anterior persuasion to induce them, no prior reverence, prejudice, or
          partiality to take hold of Jesus had not one follower when he set up
          his claim. His miracles gave birth to his sect. No part of this
          description belongs to the ordinary evidence of Heathen or Popish
          miracles. Even most of the miracles alleged to have been performed by
          Christians, in the second and third century of its era, want this
          confirmation. It constitutes indeed a line of partition between the
          origin and the progress of Christianity. Frauds and fallacies might
          mix themselves with the progress, which could not possibly take place
          in the commencement of the religion; at least, according to any laws
          of human conduct that we are acquainted with. What should suggest to
          the first propagators of Christianity, especially to fishermen,
          tax-gatherers, and husbandmen, such a thought as that of changing the
          religion of the world; what could bear them through the difficulties
          in which the attempt engaged them; what could procure any degree of
          success to the attempt? are questions which apply, with great force,
          to the setting out of the institution—with less, to every future stage
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To hear some men talk, one would suppose the setting up a religion by
          miracles to be a thing of every day&#x27;s experience: whereas the
          whole current of history is against it. Hath any founder of a new sect
          amongst Christians pretended to miraculous powers, and succeeded by
          his pretensions? &quot;Were these powers claimed or exercised by the
          founders of the sects of the Waldenses and Albigenses? Did Wickliffe
          in England pretend to it? Did Huss or Jerome in Bohemia? Did Luther in
          Germany, Zuinglius in Switzerland, Calvin in France, or any of the
          reformers advance this plea?&quot; (Campbell on Miracles, p. 120, ed.
          1766.) The French prophets, in the beginning of the present century,
          (the eighteenth) ventured to allege miraculous evidence, and
          immediately ruined their cause by their temerity. &quot;Concerning the
          religion of ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, of China, a single
          miracle cannot be named that was ever offered as a test of any of
          those religions before their establishment.&quot; (Adams on Mir. p.
          75.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We may add to what has been observed of the distinction which we are
          considering, that, where miracles are alleged merely in affirmance of
          a prior opinion, they who believe the doctrine may sometimes propagate
          a belief of the miracles which they do not themselves entertain. This
          is the case of what are called pious frauds; but it is a case, I
          apprehend, which takes place solely in support of a persuasion already
          established. At least it does not hold of the apostolical history. If
          the apostles did not believe the miracles, they did not believe the
          religion; and without this belief, where was the piety, what place was
          there for anything which could bear the name or colour of piety, in
          publishing and attesting miracles in its behalf? If it be said that
          many promote the belief of revelation, and of any accounts which
          favour that belief, because they think them, whether well or ill
          founded, of public and political utility; I answer, that if a
          character exist which can with less justice than another be ascribed
          to the founders of the Christian religion, it is that of politicians,
          or of men capable of entertaining political views. The truth is, that
          there is no assignable character which will account for the conduct of
          the apostles, supposing their story to be false. If bad men, what
          could have induced them to take such pains to promote virtue? If good
          men, they would not have gone about the country with a string of lies
          in their mouths.
        </p>
        <p>
          In appreciating the credit of any miraculous story, these are
          distinctions which relate to the evidence. There are other
          distinctions, of great moment in the question, which relate to the
          miracles themselves. Of which latter kind the following ought
          carefully to be retained.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is not necessary to admit as a miracle what can be resolved into
          a false perception. Of this nature was the demon of Socrates; the
          visions of Saint Anthony, and of many others; the vision which Lord
          Herbert of Cherbury describes himself to have seen; Colonel
          Gardiner&#x27;s vision, as related in his life, written by Dr.
          Doddridge. All these may be accounted for by a momentary insanity; for
          the characteristic symptom of human madness is the rising up in the
          mind of images not distinguishable by the patient from impressions
          upon the senses. (Batty on Lunacy.) The cases, however, in which the
          possibility of this delusion exists are divided from the cases in
          which it does not exist by many, and those not obscure marks. They
          are, for the most part, cases of visions or voices. The object is
          hardly ever touched. The vision submits not to be handled. One sense
          does not confirm another. They are likewise almost always cases of a
          solitary witness. It is in the highest degree improbable, and I know
          not, indeed, whether it hath ever been the fact, that the same
          derangement of the mental organs should seize different persons at the
          same time; a derangement, I mean, so much the same, as to represent to
          their imagination the same objects. Lastly, these are always cases of
          momentary miracles; by which term I mean to denote miracles of which
          the whole existence is of short duration, in contradistinction to
          miracles which are attended with permanent effects. The appearance of
          a spectre, the hearing of a supernatural sound, is a momentary
          miracle. The sensible proof is gone when the apparition or sound is
          over. But if a person born blind be restored to sight, a notorious
          cripple to the use of his limbs, or a dead man to life, here is a
          permanent effect produced by supernatural means. The change indeed was
          instantaneous, but the proof continues. The subject of the miracle
          remains. The man cured or restored is there: his former condition was
          known, and his present condition may be examined. This can by no
          possibility be resolved into false perception: and of this kind are by
          far the greater part of the miracles recorded in the New Testament.
          When Lazarus was raised from the dead, he did not merely move, and
          speak, and die again; or come out of the grave, and vanish away. He
          returned to his home and family, and there continued; for we find him
          some time afterwards in the same town, sitting at table with Jesus and
          his sisters; visited by great multitudes of the Jews as a subject of
          curiosity; giving, by his presence, so much uneasiness to the Jewish
          rulers as to beget in them a design of destroying him. (John xii. 1,
          2, 9, 10.) No delusion can account for this. The French prophets in
          England, some time since, gave out that one of their teachers would
          come to life again; but their enthusiasm never made them believe that
          they actually saw him alive. The blind man whose restoration to sight
          at Jerusalem is recorded in the ninth chapter of Saint John&#x27;s
          Gospel did not quit the place or conceal himself from inquiry. On the
          contrary, he was forthcoming, to answer the call, to satisfy the
          scrutiny, and to sustain the browbeating of Christ&#x27;s angry and
          powerful enemies. When the cripple at the gate of the temple was
          suddenly cured by Peter, (Acts iii. 2.) he did not immediately relapse
          into his former lameness, or disappear out of the city; but boldly and
          honestly produced himself along with the apostles, when they were
          brought the next day before the Jewish council. (Acts iv. 14.) Here,
          though the miracle was sudden, the proof was permanent. The lameness
          had been notorious, the cure continued. This, therefore, could not be
          the effect of any momentary delirium, either in the subject or in the
          witnesses of the transaction. It is the same with the greatest number
          of the Scripture miracles. There are other cases of a mixed nature, in
          which, although the principal miracle be momentary, some circumstance
          combined with it is permanent. Of this kind is the history of Saint
          Paul&#x27;s conversion. (Acts ix.) The sudden light and sound, the
          vision and the voice upon the road to Damascus, were momentary: but
          Paul&#x27;s blindness for three days in consequence of what had
          happened; the communication made to Ananias in another place, and by a
          vision independent of the former; Ananias finding out Paul in
          consequence of intelligence so received, and finding him in the
          condition described, and Paul&#x27;s recovery of his sight upon
          Ananias laying his hands upon him; are circumstances which take the
          transaction, and the principal miracle as included in it, entirely out
          of the case of momentary miracles, or of such as may be accounted for
          by false perceptions. Exactly the same thing may be observed of
          Peter&#x27;s vision preparatory to the call of Cornelius, and of its
          connexion with what was imparted in a distant place to Cornelius
          himself, and with the message despatched by Cornelius to Peter. The
          vision might be a dream; the message could not. Either communication
          taken separately, might be a delusion; the concurrence of the two was
          impossible to happen without a supernatural cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside the risk of delusion which attaches upon momentary miracles,
          there is also much more room for imposture. The account cannot be
          examined at the moment: and when that is also a moment of hurry and
          confusion, it may not be difficult for men of influence to gain credit
          to any story which they may wish to have believed. This is precisely
          the case of one of the best attested of the miracles of Old Rome, the
          appearance of Castor and Pollux in the battle fought by Posthumius
          with the Latins at the lake Regillus. There is no doubt but that
          Posthumius, after the battle, spread the report of such an appearance.
          No person could deny it whilst it was said to last. No person,
          perhaps, had any inclination to dispute it afterwards; or, if they
          had, could say with positiveness what was or what was not seen by some
          or other of the army, in the dismay and amidst the tumult of a battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In assigning false perceptions as the origin to which some miraculous
          accounts may be referred, I have not mentioned claims to inspiration,
          illuminations, secret notices or directions, internal sensations, or
          consciousnesses of being acted upon by spiritual influences, good or
          bad, because these, appealing to no external proof, however convincing
          they may be to the persons themselves, form no part of what can be
          accounted miraculous evidence. Their own credibility stands upon their
          alliance with other miracles. The discussion, therefore, of all such
          pretensions may be omitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is not necessary to bring into the comparison what may be
          called tentative miracles; that is, where, out of a great number of
          trials, some succeed; and in the accounts of which, although the
          narrative of the successful cases be alone preserved, and that of the
          unsuccessful cases sunk, yet enough is stated to show that the cases
          produced are only a few out of many in which the same means have been
          employed. This observation bears with considerable force upon the
          ancient oracles and auguries, in which a single coincidence of the
          event with the prediction is talked of and magnified, whilst failures
          are forgotten, or suppressed, or accounted for. It is also applicable
          to the cures wrought by relics, and at the tombs of saints. The
          boasted efficacy of the king&#x27;s touch, upon which Mr. Hume lays
          some stress, falls under the same description. Nothing is alleged
          concerning it which is not alleged of various nostrums, namely, out of
          many thousands who have used them, certified proofs of a few who have
          recovered after them. No solution of this sort is applicable to the
          miracles of the Gospel. There is nothing in the narrative which can
          induce, or even allow, us to believe, that Christ attempted cures in
          many instances, and succeeded in a few; or that he ever made the
          attempt in vain. He did not profess to heal everywhere all that were
          sick; on the contrary, he told the Jews, evidently meaning to
          represent his own case, that, &quot;although many widows were in
          Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years
          and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land, yet
          unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon,
          unto a woman that was a widow:&quot; and that &quot;many lepers were
          in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was
          cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian.&quot; (Luke iv. 25.) By which
          examples he gave them to understand, that it was not the nature of a
          Divine interposition, or necessary to its purpose, to be general;
          still less to answer every challenge that might be made, which would
          teach men to put their faith upon these experiments. Christ never
          pronounced the word, but the effect followed.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          *One, and only one, instance may be produced in which the disciples of
          Christ do seem to have attempted a cure, and not to have been able to
          perform it. The story is very ingenuously related by three of the
          evangelists. (Matt. xvii. 14. Mark ix. 14. Luke ix. 33.) The patient
          was afterwards healed by Christ himself; and the whole transaction
          seems to have been intended, as it was well suited, to display the
          superiority of Christ above all who performed miracles in his name, a
          distinction which, during his presence in the world, it might be
          necessary to inculcate by some such proof as this. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not a thousand sick that received his benediction, and a few
          that were benefited; a single paralytic is let down in his bed at
          Jesus&#x27;s feet, in the midst of a surrounding multitude; Jesus bid
          him walk, and he did so. (Mark ii. 3.) A man with a withered hand is
          in the synagogue; Jesus bid him stretch forth his hand in the presence
          of the assembly, and it was &quot;restored whole like the other.&quot;
          (Matt. xii. 10.) There was nothing tentative in these cures; nothing
          that can be explained by the power of accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe, also, that many of the cures which Christ wrought,
          such as that of a person blind from his birth; also many miracles
          besides cures, as raising the dead, walking upon the sea, feeding a
          great multitude with a few loaves and fishes, are of a nature which
          does not in anywise admit of the supposition of a fortunate
          experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We may dismiss from the question all accounts in which, allowing
          the phenomenon to be real, the fact to be true, it still remains
          doubtful whether a miracle were wrought. This is the case with the
          ancient history of what is called the thundering legion, of the
          extraordinary circumstances which obstructed the rebuilding of the
          temple at Jerusalem by Julian; the circling of the flames and fragrant
          smell at the martyrdom of Polycarp; the sudden shower that
          extinguished the fire into which the Scriptures were thrown in the
          Diocletian persecution; Constantine&#x27;s dream; his inscribing in
          consequence of it the cross upon his standard and the shields of his
          soldiers; his victory, and the escape of the standard-bearer; perhaps,
          also, the imagined appearance of the cross in the heavens, though this
          last circumstance is very deficient in historical evidence. It is also
          the case with the modern annual exhibition of the liquefaction of the
          blood of Saint Januarius at Naples. It is a doubt, likewise, which
          ought to be excluded by very special circumstances from those
          narratives which relate to the supernatural cure of hypochondriacal
          and nervous complaints, and of all diseases which are much affected by
          the imagination. The miracles of the second and third century are,
          usually, healing the sick and casting out evil spirits, miracles in
          which there is room for some error and deception. We hear nothing of
          causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the
          lepers to be cleansed. (Jortin&#x27;s Remarks, vol. ii. p. 51.) There
          are also instances in Christian writers of reputed miracles, which
          were natural operations, though not known to be such at the time; as
          that of articulate speech after the loss of a great part of the
          tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. To the same head of objection, nearly, may also be referred
          accounts in which the variation of a small circumstance may have
          transformed some extraordinary appearance, or some critical
          coincidence of events, into a miracle; stories, in a word, which may
          be resolved into exaggeration. The miracles of the Gospel can by no
          possibility be explained away in this manner. Total fiction will
          account for anything; but no stretch of exaggeration that has any
          parallel in other histories, no force of fancy upon real
          circumstances, could produce the narratives which we now have. The
          feeding of the five thousand with a few loaves and fishes surpasses
          all bounds of exaggeration. The raising of Lazarus, of the
          widow&#x27;s son at Nain, as well as many of the cures which Christ
          wrought, come not within the compass of misrepresentation. I mean that
          it is impossible to assign any position of circumstances however
          peculiar, any accidental effects however extraordinary, any natural
          singularity, which could supply an origin or foundation to these
          accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus enumerated several exceptions which may justly be taken to
          relations of miracles, it is necessary, when we read the Scriptures,
          to bear in our minds this general remark; that although there be
          miracles recorded in the New Testament, which fall within some or
          other of the exceptions here assigned, yet that they are united with
          others, to which none of the same exceptions extend, and that their
          credibility stands upon this union. Thus the visions and revelations
          which Saint Paul asserts to have been imparted to him may not, in
          their separate evidence, be distinguishable from the visions and
          revelations which many others have alleged. But here is the
          difference. Saint Paul&#x27;s pretensions were attested by external
          miracles wrought by himself, and by miracles wrought in the cause to
          which these visions relate; or, to speak more properly, the same
          historical authority which informs us of one informs us of the other.
          This is not ordinarily true of the visions of enthusiasts, or even of
          the accounts in which they are contained. Again, some of Christ&#x27;s
          own miracles were momentary; as the transfiguration, the appearance
          and voice from Heaven at his baptism, a voice from the clouds on one
          occasion afterwards (John xii. 28), and some others. It is not denied,
          that the distinction which we have proposed concerning miracles of
          this species applies, in diminution of the force of the evidence, as
          much to these instances as to others. But this is the case not with
          all the miracles ascribed to Christ, nor with the greatest part, nor
          with many. Whatever force therefore there may be in the objection, we
          have numerous miracles which are free from it; and even those to which
          it is applicable are little affected by it in their credit, because
          there are few who, admitting the rest, will reject them. If there be
          miracles of the New Testament which come within any of the other heads
          into which we have distributed the objections, the same remark must be
          repeated. And this is one way in which the unexampled number and
          variety of the miracles ascribed to Christ strengthen the credibility
          of Christianity. For it precludes any solution, or conjecture about a
          solution, which imagination, or even which experience might suggest,
          concerning some particular miracles, if considered independently of
          others. The miracles of Christ were of various kinds,* and performed
          in great varieties of situation, form, and manner; at Jerusalem, the
          metropolis of the Jewish nation and religion; in different parts of
          Judea and Galilee; in cities and villages; in synagogues, in private
          houses; in the street, in highways; with preparation, as in the case
          of Lazarus; by accident, as in the case of the widow&#x27;s son of
          Nain; when attended by multitudes, and when alone with the patient; in
          the midst of his disciples, and in the presence of his enemies; with
          the common people around him, and before Scribes and Pharisees, and
          rulers of the synagogues.

          I apprehend that, when we remove from the comparison the cases which
          are fairly disposed of by the observations that have been stated, many
          cases will not remain. To those which do remain, we apply this final
          distinction; &quot;that there is not satisfactory evidence that
          persons pretending to be original witnesses of the miracles passed
