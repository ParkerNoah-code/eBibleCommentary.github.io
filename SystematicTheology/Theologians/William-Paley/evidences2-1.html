        <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
        <p>PROPHECY.</p>
        <p>
          Isaiah iii. 13; liii. &quot;Behold, my servant shall deal prudently;
          he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were
          astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and
          his form more than the sons of men: so shall he sprinkle many nations;
          the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been
          told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they
          consider. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
          Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and
          as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
          when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
          He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted
          with grief: and we hid, as it were, our faces from him: he was
          despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs,
          and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
          God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was
          bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon
          him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone
          astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath
          laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was
          afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the
          slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened
          not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who
          shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of
          the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he
          made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;
          because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
          Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief. When
          thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed,
          he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
          in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
          satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;
          for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a
          portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
          because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered
          with the transgressors, and he bare the sin of many, and made
          intercession for the transgressors.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These words are extant in a book purporting to contain the predictions
          of a writer who lived seven centuries before the Christian era.
        </p>
        <p>
          That material part of every argument from prophecy, namely, that the
          words alleged were actually spoken or written before the fact to which
          they are applied took place, or could by any natural means be
          foreseen, is, in the present instance, incontestable. The record comes
          out of the custody of adversaries. The Jews, as an ancient father well
          observed, are our librarians. The passage is in their copies as well
          as in ours. With many attempts to explain it away, none has ever been
          made by them to discredit its authenticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what adds to the force of the quotation is, that it is taken from
          a writing declaredly prophetic; a writing professing to describe such
          future transactions and changes in the world as were connected with
          the fate and interests of the Jewish nation. It is not a passage in an
          historical or devotional composition, which, because it turns out to
          be applicable to some future events, or to some future situation of
          affairs, is presumed to have been oracular. The words of Isaiah were
          delivered by him in a prophetic character, with the solemnity
          belonging to that character: and what he so delivered was all along
          understood by the Jewish reader to refer to something that was to take
          place after the time of the author. The public sentiments of the Jews
          concerning the design of Isaiah&#x27;s writings are set forth in the
          book of Ecclesiasticus:* &quot;He saw by an excellent spirit what
          should come to pass at the last, and he comforted them that mourned in
          Sion. He showed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things
          or ever they came.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>* Chap. xlviii. ver. 24. _________</p>
        <p>
          It is also an advantage which this prophecy possesses, that it is
          intermixed with no other subject. It is entire, separate, and
          uninterruptedly directed to one scene of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application of the prophecy to the evangelic history is plain and
          appropriate. Here is no double sense; no figurative language but what
          is sufficiently intelligible to every reader of every country. The
          obscurities (by which I mean the expressions that require a knowledge
          of local diction, and of local allusion) are few, and not of great
          importance. Nor have I found that varieties of reading, or a different
          construing of the original, produce any material alteration in the
          sense of the prophecy. Compare the common translation with that of
          Bishop Lowth, and the difference is not considerable. So far as they
          do differ, Bishop Lowth&#x27;s corrections, which are the faithful
          result of an accurate examination, bring the description nearer to the
          New Testament history than it was before. In the fourth verse of the
          fifty-third chapter, what our bible renders &quot;stricken&quot; he
          translates &quot;judicially stricken:&quot; and in the eighth verse,
          the clause &quot;he was taken from prison and from judgment,&quot; the
          bishop gives &quot;by an oppressive judgment he was taken off.&quot;
          The next words to these, &quot;who shall declare his generation?&quot;
          are much cleared up in their meaning by the bishop&#x27;s version;
          &quot;his manner of life who would declare?&quot; i. e. who would
          stand forth in his defence? The former part of the ninth verse,
          &quot;and he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
          death,&quot; which inverts the circumstances of Christ&#x27;s passion,
          the bishop brings out in an order perfectly agreeable to the event;
          &quot;and his grave was appointed with the wicked, but with the rich
          man was his tomb.&quot; The words in the eleventh verse, &quot;by his
          knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many,&quot; are, in the
          bishop&#x27;s version, &quot;by the knowledge of him shall my
          righteous servant justify many.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is natural to inquire what turn the Jews themselves give to this
          prophecy.* There is good proof that the ancient Rabbins explained it
          of their expected Messiah:+ but their modern expositors concur, I
          think, in representing it as a description of the calamitous state,
          and intended restoration, of the Jewish people, who are here, as they
          say, exhibited under the character of a single person. I have not
          discovered that their exposition rests upon any critical arguments, or
          upon these in any other than in a very minute degree.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;Vaticinium hoc Esaiae est carnificina Rabbinorum, de quo
          aliqui
        </p>
        <p>
          Judaei mihi confessi sunt, Rabbinos suos ex propheticis scripturis
        </p>
        <p>
          facile se extricare potuisse, modo; Esaias tacuisset.&quot; Hulse,
          Theol.
        </p>
        <p>Jud. P. 318, quoted by Poole, in loc.</p>
        <p>+ Hulse, Theol. Jud. p. 430. _________</p>
        <p>
          The clause in the ninth verse, which we render &quot;for the
          transgression of my people was he stricken,&quot; and in the margin,
          &quot;was the stroke upon him,&quot; the Jews read &quot;for the
          transgression of my people was the stroke upon them.&quot; And what
          they allege in support of the alteration amounts only to this, that
          the Hebrew pronoun is capable of a plural as well as of a singular
          signification; that is to say, is capable of their construction as
          well as ours.* And this is all the variation contended for; the rest
          of the prophecy they read as we do. The probability, therefore, of
          their exposition is a subject of which we are as capable of judging as
          themselves. This judgment is open indeed to the good sense of every
          attentive reader. The application which the Jews contend for appears
          to me to labour under insuperable difficulties; in particular, it may
          be demanded of them to explain in whose name or person, if the Jewish
          people he the sufferer, does the prophet speak, when he says, &quot;He
          hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows, yet we did esteem him
          stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted; but he was wounded for our
          transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of
          our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.&quot;
          Again, the description in the seventh verse, &quot;he was oppressed
          and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a
          lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so
          he opened not his mouth,&quot; quadrates with no part of the Jewish
          history with which we are acquainted. The mention of the
          &quot;grave&quot; and the &quot;tomb,&quot; in the ninth verse, is not
          very applicable to the fortunes of a nation; and still less so is the
          conclusion of the prophecy in the twelfth verse, which expressly
          represents the sufferings as voluntary, and the sufferer as
          interceding for the offenders; &quot;because he hath poured out his
          soul unto death, and he was numbered with the transgressors, and he
          bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the
          transgressors.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Bishop Lowth adopts in this place the reading of the seventy, which
          gives smitten to death, &quot;for the transgression of my people was
          he smitten to death.&quot; The addition of the words &quot;to
          death&quot; makes an end of the Jewish interpretation of the clause.
          And the authority upon which this reading (though not given by the
          present Hebrew text) is adopted, Dr. Kennicot has set forth by an
          argument not only so cogent, but so clear and popular, that I beg
          leave to transcribe the substance of it into this note:—&quot;Origen,
          after having quoted at large this prophecy concerning the Messiah,
          tells us that, having once made use of this passage, in a dispute
          against some that were accounted wise amongst the Jews, one of them
          replied that the words did not mean one man, but one people, the Jews,
          who were smitten of God, and dispersed among the Gentiles for their
          conversion; that he then urged many parts of this prophecy to show the
          absurdity of this interpretation, and that he seemed to press them the
          hardest by this sentence,—&#x27;for the transgression of my people was
          he smitten to death.&#x27;&quot; Now as Origen, the author of the
          Hexapla, must have understood Hebrew, we cannot suppose that he would
          have urged this last text as so decisive, if the Greek version had not
          agreed here with the Hebrew text; nor that these wise Jews would have
          been at all distressed by this quotation, unless the Hebrew text had
          read agreeably to the words &quot;to death,&quot; on which the
          argument principally depended; for by quoting it immediately, they
          would have triumphed over him, and reprobated his Greek version. This,
          whenever they could do it was their constant practice in their
          disputes with the Christians. Origen himself, who laboriously compared
          the Hebrew text with the Septuagint, has recorded the necessity of
          arguing with the Jews from such passages only as were in the
          Septuagint agreeable to the Hebrew. Wherefore, as Origen had carefully
          compared the Greek version of the Septuagint with the Hebrew text; and
          as he puzzled and confounded the learned Jews, by urging upon them the
          reading &quot;to death&quot; in this place; it seems almost impossible
          not to conclude, both from Origen&#x27;s argument and the silence of
          his Jewish adversaries, that the Hebrew text at that time actually had
          the word agreeably to the version of the seventy. Lowth&#x27;s Isaiah,
          p. 242. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other prophecies of the Old Testament, interpreted by
          Christians to relate to the Gospel history, which are deserving both
          of great regard and of a very attentive consideration: but I content
          myself with stating the above, as well because I think it the clearest
          and the strongest of all, as because most of the rest, in order that
          their value might be represented with any tolerable degree of
          fidelity, require a discussion unsuitable to the limits and nature of
          this work. The reader will find them disposed in order, and distinctly
          explained, in Bishop Chandler&#x27;s treatise on the subject; and he
          will bear in mind, what has been often, and, I think, truly, urged by
          the advocates of Christianity, that there is no other eminent person
          to the history of whose life so many circumstances can be made to
          apply. They who object that much has been done by the power of chance,
          the ingenuity of accommodation, and the industry of research, ought to
          try whether the same, or anything like it, could be done, if Mahomet,
          or any other person, were proposed as the subject of Jewish prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. A second head of argument from prophecy is founded upon our
          Lord&#x27;s predictions concerning the destruction of Jerusalem,
          recorded by three out of the four evangelists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke xxi. 5-25. &quot;And as some spake of the temple, how it was
          adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said, As for these things
          which ye behold, the days will come in which there shall not be left
          one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. And they asked
          him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign
          will there be when these things shall come to pass? And he said, Take
          heed that ye be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying,
          I am Christ; and the time draweth near; go ye not therefore after
          them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
          for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not
          by-and-by. Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation,
          and kingdom against kingdom; and great earth-quakes shall be in divers
          places, and famines and pestilences; and fearful sights, and great
          signs shall there be from heaven. But before all these, they shall lay
          their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the
          synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers
          for my name&#x27;s sake. And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
          Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye
          shall answer: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
          adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. And ye shall be
          betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and
          some of you shall they cause to be put to death. And ye shall be hated
          of all men for my name&#x27;s sake. But there shall not an hair of
          your head perish. In your patience possess ye your souls. And when ye
          shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the
          desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judea flee to
          the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out;
          and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For these
          be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be
          fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give
          suck in those days: for there shall be great distress in the land, and
          wrath upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword,
          and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be
          trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
          fulfilled.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms nearly similar, this discourse is related in the
          twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew and the thirteenth of Mark. The
          prospect of the same evils drew from our Saviour, on another occasion,
          the following affecting expressions of concern, which are preserved by
          St. Luke (xix. 41—44): &quot;And when he was come near, he beheld the
          city and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at
          least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now
          they are hid from thine eyes. For the day shall come upon thee, that
          thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round
          and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the
          ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee
          one stone upon another; because thou knowest not the time of thy
          visitation&quot;—These passages are direct and explicit predictions.
          References to the same event, some plain, some parabolical, or
          otherwise figurative, are found in divers other discourses of our
          Lord. (Matt. xxi. 33-46; xxii. 1-7. Mark xii. 1-12. Luke xiii. 1-9;
          xx. 9-20; xxi. 5-13.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The general agreement of the description with the event, viz. with the
          ruin of the Jewish nation, and the capture of Jerusalem under
          Vespasian, thirty-six years after Christ&#x27;s death, is most
          evident; and the accordancy in various articles of detail and
          circumstances has been shown by many learned writers. It is also an
          advantage to the inquiry, and to the argument built upon it, that we
          have received a copious account of the transaction from Josephus, a
          Jewish and contemporary historian. This part of the case is perfectly
          free from doubt. The only question which, in my opinion, can be raised
          upon the subject is, whether the prophecy was really delivered before
          the event? I shall apply, therefore, my observations to this point
          solely.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The judgment of antiquity, though varying in the precise year of
          the publication of the three Gospels, concurs in assigning them a date
          prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. (Lardner, vol. xiii.)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This judgment is confirmed by a strong probability arising from the
          course of human life. The destruction of Jerusalem took place in the
          seventieth year after the birth of Christ. The three evangelists, one
          of whom was his immediate companion, and the other two associated with
          his companions, were, it is probable, not much younger than he was.
          They must, consequently, have been far advanced in life when Jerusalem
          was taken; and no reason has been given why they should defer writing
          their histories so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. (Le Clerc, Diss. III. de Quat. Evang. num. vii. p. 541.) If the
          evangelists, at the time of writing the Gospels, had known of the
          destruction of Jerusalem, by which catastrophe the prophecies were
          plainly fulfilled, it is most probable that, in recording the
          predictions, they would have dropped some word or other about the
          completion; in like manner as Luke, after relating the denunciation of
          a dearth by Agabus, adds, &quot;which came to pass in the days of
          Claudius Caesar;&quot; (Acts xi. 28.) whereas the prophecies are given
          distinctly in one chapter of each of the first three Gospels, and
          referred to in several different passages of each, and in none of all
          these places does there appear the smallest intimation that the things
          spoken of had come to pass. I do admit that it would have been the
          part of an impostor, who wished his readers to believe that this book
          was written before the event, when in truth it was written after it,
          to have suppressed any such intimation carefully. But this was not the
          character of the authors of the Gospel. Cunning was no quality of
          theirs. Of all writers in the world, they thought the least of
          providing against objections. Moreover, there is no clause in any one
          of them that makes a profession of their having written prior to the
          Jewish wars, which a fraudulent purpose would have led them to
          pretend. They have done neither one thing nor the other; they have
          neither inserted any words which might signify to the reader that
          their accounts were written before the destruction of Jerusalem, which
          a sophist would have done; nor have they dropped a hint of the
          completion of the prophecies recorded by them, which an undesigning
          writer, writing after the event, could hardly, on some or other of the
          many occasions that presented themselves, have missed of doing.

          4. The admonitions* which Christ is represented to have given to his
          followers to save themselves by flight are not easily accounted for on
          the supposition of the prophecy being fabricated after the event.
          Either the Christians, when the siege approached, did make their
          escape from Jerusalem, or they did not: if they did, they must have
          had the prophecy amongst them: if they did not know of any such
          prediction at the time of the siege, if they did not take notice of
          any such warning, it was an improbable fiction, in a writer publishing
          his work near to that time (which, on any, even the lowest and most
          disadvantageous supposition, was the case with the gospels now in our
          hands), and addressing his work to Jews and to Jewish converts (which
          Matthew certainly did), to state that the followers of Christ had
          received admonition of which they made no use when the occasion
          arrived, and of which experience then recent proved that those who
          were most concerned to know and regard them were ignorant or
          negligent. Even if the prophecies came to the hands of the evangelists
          through no better vehicle than tradition, it must have been by a
          tradition which subsisted prior to the event. And to suppose that
          without any authority whatever, without so much as even any tradition
          to guide them, they had forged these passages, is to impute to them a
          degree of fraud and imposture from every appearance of which their
          compositions are as far removed as possible.

          * &quot;When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
          that the desolation thereof is nigh; then let them which are in Judea
          flee to the mountains; then let them which are in the midst of it
          depart out, and let not them that are in the countries enter
          thereinto.&quot;—Luke xxi. 20, 21. &quot;When ye shall see Jerusalem
          compassed with armies, then let them which be in Judea flee unto the
          mountains; let him which is on the house-top not come down to take
          anything out of his house; neither let him which is in the field
          return back to take his clothes.&quot;—Matt. xiv. 18. _________

          5. I think that, if the prophecies had been composed after the event,
          there would have been more specification. The names or descriptions of
          the enemy, the general, the emperor, would have been found in them.
          The designation of the time would have been more determinate. And I am
          fortified in this opinion by observing that the counterfeited
          prophecies of the Sibylline oracles, of the twelve patriarchs, and, I
          am inclined to believe, most others of the kind, are mere transcripts
          of the history, moulded into a prophetic form.

          It is objected that the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is
          mixed or connected with expressions which relate to the final judgment
          of the world; and so connected as to lead an ordinary reader to expect
          that these two events would not be far distant from each other. To
          which I answer, that the objection does not concern our present
          argument. If our Saviour actually foretold the destruction of
          Jerusalem, it is sufficient; even although we should allow that the
          narration of the prophecy had combined what had been said by him on
          kindred subjects, without accurately preserving the order, or always
          noticing the transition of the discourse.
