        <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed there lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the primitive condition of Christianity, a distant only and general
          view can be acquired from heathen writers. It is in our own books that
          the detail and interior of the transaction must be sought for. And
          this is nothing different from what might be expected. Who would write
          a history of Christianity, but a Christian? Who was likely to record
          the travels, sufferings, labours, or successes of the apostles, but
          one of their own number, or of their followers? Now these books come
          up in their accounts to the full extent of the proposition which we
          maintain. We have four histories of Jesus Christ. We have a history
          taking up the narrative from his death, and carrying on an account of
          the propagation of the religion, and of some of the most eminent
          persons engaged in it, for a space of nearly thirty years. We have,
          what some may think still more original, a collection of letters,
          written by certain principal agents in the business upon the business,
          and in the midst of their concern and connection with it. And we have
          these writings severally attesting the point which we contend for,
          viz. the sufferings of the witnesses of the history, and attesting it
          in every variety of form in which it can be conceived to appear:
          directly and indirectly, expressly and incidentally, by assertion,
          recital, and allusion, by narratives of facts, and by arguments and
          discourses built upon these facts, either referring to them, or
          necessarily presupposing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remark this variety, because, in examining ancient records, or
          indeed any species of testimony, it is, in my opinion, of the greatest
          importance to attend to the information or grounds of argument which
          are casually and undesignedly disclosed; forasmuch as this species of
          proof is, of all others, the least liable to be corrupted by fraud or
          misrepresentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may be allowed therefore, in the inquiry which is now before us, to
          suggest some conclusions of this sort, as preparatory to more direct
          testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Our books relate, that Jesus Christ, the founder of the religion,
          was, in consequence of his undertaking, put to death, as a malefactor,
          at Jerusalem. This point at least will be granted, because it is no
          more than what Tacitus has recorded. They then proceed to tell us that
          the religion was, notwithstanding, set forth at this same city of
          Jerusalem, propagated thence throughout Judea, and afterwards preached
          in other parts of the Roman Empire. These points also are fully
          confirmed by Tacitus, who informs us that the religion, after a short
          check, broke out again in the country where it took its rise; that it
          not only spread throughout Judea, but had reached Rome, and that it
          had there great multitudes of converts: and all this within thirty
          years after its commencement. Now these facts afford a strong
          inference in behalf of the proposition which we maintain. What could
          the disciples of Christ expect for themselves when they saw their
          master put to death? Could they hope to escape the dangers in which he
          had perished? If they had persecuted me, they will also persecute you,
          was the warning of common sense. With this example before their eyes,
          they could not be without a full sense of the peril of their future
          enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Secondly, all the histories agree in representing Christ as
          foretelling the persecution of his followers:— &quot;Then shall they
          deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be
          hated of all nations for my name&#x27;s sake.&quot; (Matt. xxiv. 9.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;When affliction or persecution ariseth for the word&#x27;s sake,
          immediately they are offended.&quot; (Mark iv. 17. See also chap. x.
          30.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;They shall lay hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you
          up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and
          rulers for my name&#x27;s sake:—and ye shall be betrayed both by
          parents and brethren, and kinsfolks and friends, and some of you shall
          they cause to be put to death.&quot; (Luke xxi. 12—16. See also chap.
          xi. 49.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The time cometh, that he that killed you will think that he
          doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because
          they have not known the Father, nor me. But these things have I told
          you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of
          them.&quot; (John xvi. 4. See also chap. xv. 20; xvi. 33.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not entitled to argue from these passages, that Christ actually
          did foretell these events, and that they did accordingly come to pass;
          because that would be at once to assume the truth of the religion: but
          I am entitled to contend that one side or other of the following
          disjunction is true; either that the Evangelists have delivered what
          Christ really spoke, and that the event corresponded with the
          prediction; or that they put the prediction into Christ&#x27;s mouth,
          because at the time of writing the history, the event had turned out
          so to be: for, the only two remaining suppositions appear in the
          highest degree incredible; which are, either that Christ filled the
          minds of his followers with fears and apprehensions, without any
          reason or authority for what he said, and contrary to the truth of the
          case; or that, although Christ had never foretold any such thing, and
          the event would have contradicted him if he had, yet historians who
          lived in the age when the event was known, falsely, as well as
          officiously, ascribed these words to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thirdly, these books abound with exhortations to patience, and with
          topics of comfort under distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall
          tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
          peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors
          through Him that loved us.&quot; (Rom. viii. 35-37.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
          perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast
          down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of
          the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in
          our body;—knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise
          us up also by Jesus, and shall present us with you—-For which cause we
          faint not; but, though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is
          renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a
          moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
          glory.&quot; (2 Cor. iv. 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of
          the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
          Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
          patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
          very pitiful, and of tender mercy.&quot; (James v. 10, 11.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
          illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst ye
          were made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions, and
          partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used; for ye
          had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of
          your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and
          an enduring substance. Cast not away, therefore, your confidence,
          which hath great recompense of reward; for ye have need of patience,
          that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the
          promise.&quot; (Heb. x. 32-36.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for
          your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that
          ye endure. Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
          that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom for which ye also
          suffer.&quot; (2 Thess. i. 4, 5.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We rejoice in hope of the glory of God; and not only so, but we
          glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience,
          and patience experience, and experience hope.&quot; (Rom. v. 3, 4.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
          is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you; but
          rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ&#x27;s
          sufferings.—Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of
          God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a
          faithful Creator.&quot; (1 Pet. iv. 12, 13, 19.)
        </p>
        <p>
          What could all these texts mean, if there was nothing in the
          circumstances of the times which required patience,—which called for
          the exercise of constancy and resolution? Or will it be pretended,
          that these exhortations (which, let it be observed, come not from one
          author, but from many) were put in merely to induce a belief in
          after-ages, that the Christians were exposed to dangers which they
          were not exposed to, or underwent sufferings which they did not
          undergo? If these books belong to the age to which they lay claim, and
          in which age, whether genuine or spurious, they certainly did appear,
          this supposition cannot be maintained for a moment; because I think it
          impossible to believe that passages, which must be deemed not only
          unintelligible, but false, by the persons into whose hands the books
          upon their publication were to come, should nevertheless be inserted,
          for the purpose of producing an effect upon remote generations. In
          forgeries which do not appear till many ages after that to which they
          pretend to belong, it is possible that some contrivance of that sort
          may take place; but in no others can it be attempted.
