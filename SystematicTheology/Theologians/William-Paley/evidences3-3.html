        <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
        <p>THE CONNEXION OF CHRISTIANITY WITH THE JEWISH HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          Undoubtedly our Saviour assumes the divine origin of the Mosaic
          institution: and, independently of his authority, I conceive it to be
          very difficult to assign any other cause for the commencement or
          existence of that institution; especially for the singular
          circumstance of the Jews adhering to the unity when every other people
          slid into polytheism; for their being men in religion, children in
          everything else; behind other nations in the arts of peace and war,
          superior to the most improved in their sentiments and doctrines
          relating to the Deity.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;In the doctrine, for example, of the unity, the eternity, the
          omnipotence, the omniscience, the omnipresence, the wisdom, and the
          goodness of God; in their opinions concerning providence, and the
          creation, preservation, and government of the world.&quot; Campbell on
          Mir. p. 207. To which we may add, in the acts of their religion not
          being accompanied either with cruelties or impurities: in the religion
          itself being free from a species of superstition which prevailed
          universally in the popular religions of the ancient world, and which
          is to be found perhaps in all religions that have their origin in
          human artifice and credulity, viz. fanciful connexions between certain
          appearances and actions, and the destiny of nations or individuals.
          Upon these conceits rested the whole train of auguries and auspices,
          which formed so much even of the serious part of the religions of
          Greece and Rome, and of the charms and incantations which were
          practised in those countries by the common people. From everything of
          this sort the religion of the Jews, and of the Jews alone, was free.
          Vide. Priestley&#x27;s Lectures on the Truth of the Jewish and
          Christian Revelation; 1794. _________

        <p>
          Undoubtedly, also, our Saviour recognises the prophetic character of
          many of their ancient writers. So far, therefore, we are bound as
          Christians to go. But to make Christianity answerable, with its life,
          for the circumstantial truth of each separate passage of the Old
          Testament, the genuineness of every book, the information, fidelity,
          and judgment of every writer in it, is to bring, I will not say great,
          but unnecessary difficulties into the whole system. These books were
          universally read and received by the Jews of our Saviour&#x27;s time.
          He and his apostles, in common with all other Jews, referred to them,
          alluded to them, used them. Yet, except where he expressly ascribes a
          divine authority to particular predictions, I do not know that we can
          strictly draw any conclusion from the books being so used and applied,
          beside the proof, which it unquestionably is, of their notoriety and
          reception at that time. In this view, our Scriptures afford a valuable
          testimony to those of the Jews. But the nature of this testimony ought
          to be understood. It is surely very different from what it is
          sometimes represented to be, a specific ratification of each
          particular fact and opinion; and not only of each particular fact, but
          of the motives assigned for every action, together with the judgment
          of praise or dispraise bestowed upon them. Saint James, in his
          Epistle, says, &quot;Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have
          seen the end of the Lord.&quot; Notwithstanding this text, the reality
          of Job&#x27;s history, and even the existence of such a person, have
          been always deemed a fair subject of inquiry and discussion amongst
          Christian divines. Saint James&#x27;s authority is considered as good
          evidence of the existence of the book of Job at that time, and of its
          reception by the Jews; and of nothing more. Saint Paul, in his Second
          Epistle to Timothy, has this similitude: &quot;Now, as Jannes and
          Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth.&quot;
          These names are not found in the Old Testament. And it is uncertain
          whether Saint Paul took them from some apocryphal writing then extant,
          or from tradition. But no one ever imagined that Saint Paul is here
          asserting the authority of the writing, if it was a written account
          which he quoted, or making himself answerable for the authenticity of
          the tradition; much less that he so involves himself with either of
          these questions as that the credit of his own history and mission
          should depend upon the fact whether Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses
          or not. For what reason a more rigorous interpretation should be put
          upon other references it is difficult to know. I do not mean, that
          other passages of the Jewish history stand upon no better evidence
          than the history of Job, or of Jannes and Jambres (I think much
          otherwise); but I mean, that a reference in the New Testament to a
          passage in the Old does not so fix its authority as to exclude all
          inquiry into its credibility, or into the separate reasons upon which
          that credibility is founded; and that it is an unwarrantable as well
          as unsafe rule to lay down concerning the Jewish history, what was
          never laid down concerning any other, that either every particular of
          it must be true, or the whole false.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thought it necessary to state this point explicitly, because a
          fashion, revived by Voltaire, and pursued by the disciples of his
          school, seems to have much prevailed of late, of attacking
          Christianity through the sides of Judaism. Some objections of this
          class are founded in misconstruction, some in exaggeration; but all
          proceed upon a supposition, which has not been made out by argument,
          viz. that the attestation which the Author and first teachers of
          Christianity gave to the divine mission of Moses and the prophets
          extends to every point and portion of the Jewish history; and so
          extends as to make Christianity responsible, in its own credibility,
          for the circumstantial truth (I had almost said for the critical
          exactness) of every narrative contained in the Old Testament.
