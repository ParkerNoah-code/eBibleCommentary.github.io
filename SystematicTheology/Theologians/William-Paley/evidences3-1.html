        <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
        <p>THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL GOSPELS.</p>
        <p>
          I know not a more rash or unphilosophical conduct of the
          understanding, than to reject the substance of a story by reason of
          some diversity in the circumstances with which it is related. The
          usual character of human testimony is substantial truth under
          circumstantial variety. This is what the daily experience of courts of
          justice teaches. When accounts of a transaction come from the mouths
          of different witnesses, it is seldom that it is not possible to pick
          out apparent or real inconsistencies between them. These
          inconsistencies are studiously displayed by an adverse pleader, but
          oftentimes with little impression upon the minds of the judges. On the
          contrary, a close and minute agreement induces the suspicion of
          confederacy and fraud. When written histories touch upon the same
          scenes of action; the comparison almost always affords ground for a
          like reflection. Numerous, and sometimes important, variations present
          themselves; not seldom, also, absolute and final contradictions; yet
          neither one nor the other are deemed sufficient to shake the
          credibility of the main fact. The embassy of the Jews to deprecate the
          execution of Claudian&#x27;s order to place his statute, in their
          temple, Philo places in harvest, Josephus in seed time; both
          contemporary writers. No reader is led by this inconsistency to doubt
          whether such an embassy was sent, or whether such an order was given.
          Our own history supplies examples of the same kind. In the account of
          the Marquis of Argyle&#x27;s death, in the reign of Charles the
          Second, we have a very remarkable contradiction. Lord Clarendon
          relates that he was condemned to be hanged, which was performed the
          same day; on the contrary, Burnet, Woodrew, Heath, Echard, concur in
          stating that he was beheaded; and that he was condemned upon the
          Saturday, and executed upon the Monday. (See Biog. Britann.) Was any
          reader of English history ever sceptic enough to raise from hence a
          question whether the Marquis of Argyle was executed or not? Yet this
          ought to be left in uncertainty, according to the principles upon
          which the Christian history has sometimes been attacked. Dr. Middleton
          contended, that the different hours of the day assigned to the
          crucifixion of Christ, by John and by the other Evangelists, did not
          admit of the reconcilement which learned men had proposed: and then
          concludes the discussion with this hard remark; &quot;We must be
          forced, with several of the critics, to leave the difficulty just as
          we found it, chargeable with all the consequences of manifest
          inconsistency.&quot; (Middleton&#x27;s Reflections answered by Benson,
          Hist. Christ. vol. iii. p. 50.) But what are these consequences? By no
          means the discrediting of the history as to the principal fact, by a
          repugnancy (even supposing that repugnancy not to be resolvable into
          different modes of computation) in the time of the day in which it is
          said to have taken place.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great deal of the discrepancy observable in the Gospels arises from
          omission; from a fact or a passage of Christ&#x27;s life being noticed
          by one writer which is unnoticed by another. Now, omission is at all
          times a very uncertain ground of objection. We perceive it, not only
          in the comparison of different writers, but even in the same writer
          when compared with himself. There are a great many particulars, and
          some of them of importance, mentioned by Josephus in his Antiquities,
          which, as we should have supposed, ought to have been put down by him
          in their place in the Jewish Wars. (Lardner, part i. vol. ii. p. 735,
          et seq.) Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, have, all three, written of
          the reign of Tiberius. Each has mentioned many things omitted by the
          rest, (Lardner, part i. vol. ii. p. 743.) yet no objection is from
          thence taken to the respective credit of their histories. We have in
          our own times, if there were not something indecorous in the
          comparison, the life of an eminent person written by three of his
          friends, in which there is very great variety in the incidents
          selected by them; some apparent, and perhaps some real contradictions;
          yet without any impeachment of the substantial truth of their
          accounts, of the authenticity of the books, of the competent
          information or general fidelity of the writers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these discrepancies will be still more numerous, when men do not
          write histories, but memoirs: which is, perhaps, the true name and
          proper description of our Gospels: that is, when they do not
          undertake, nor ever meant to deliver, in order of time, a regular and
          complete account of all the things of importance which the person who
          is the subject of their history did or said; but only, out of many
          similar ones, to give such passages, or such actions and discourses,
          as offered themselves more immediately to their attention, came in the
          way of their inquiries, occurred to their recollection, or were
          suggested by their particular design at the time of writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This particular design may appear sometimes, but not always, nor
          often. Thus I think that the particular design which Saint Matthew had
          in view whilst he was writing the history of the resurrection was to
          attest the faithful performance of Christ&#x27;s promise to his
          disciples to go before them into Galilee; because he alone, except
          Mark, who seems to have taken it from him, has recorded this promise,
          and he alone has confined his narrative to that single appearance to
          the disciples which fulfilled it. It was the preconcerted, the great
          and most public manifestation of our Lord&#x27;s person. It was the
          thing which dwelt upon Saint Matthew&#x27;s mind, and he adapted his
          narrative to it. But, that there is nothing in Saint Matthew&#x27;s
          language which negatives other appearances, or which imports that this
          his appearance to his disciples in Galilee, in pursuance of his
          promise, was his first or only appearance, is made pretty evident by
          Saint Mark&#x27;s Gospel, which uses the same terms concerning the
          appearance in Galilee as Saint Matthew uses, yet itself records two
          other appearances prior to this: &quot;Go your way, tell his disciples
          and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see
          him as he said unto you&quot; (xvi. 7). We might be apt to infer from
          these words, that this was the first time they were to see him; at
          least, we might infer it, with as much reason as we draw the inference
          from the same words in Matthew: the historian himself did not perceive
          that he was leading his readers to any such conclusion; for, in the
          twelfth and following verses of this chapter, he informs us of two
          appearances, which, by comparing the order of events, are shown to
          have been prior to the appearance in Galilee. &quot;He appeared in
          another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the
          country; and they went and told it unto the residue, neither believed
          they them: afterwards he appeared unto the eleven, as they sat at
          meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief, because they believed
          not them that had seen him after he was risen.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably the same observation, concerning the particular design which
          guided the historian, may be of use in comparing many other passages
          of the Gospels.
