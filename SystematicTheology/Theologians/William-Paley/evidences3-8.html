        <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
        <p>THE CONCLUSION,</p>
        <p>
          In religion, as in every other subject of human reasoning, much
          depends upon the order in which we dispose our inquiries. A man who
          takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion that either
          every part must be true or the whole false, approaches the discussion
          with great disadvantage. No other system, which is founded upon moral
          evidence, would bear to be treated in the same manner. Nevertheless,
          in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious studies
          under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakness of
          the human judgment in the early part of youth, yet its extreme
          susceptibility of impression, renders it necessary to furnish it with
          some opinions, and with some principles or other. Or indeed, without
          much express care, or much endeavour for this purpose, the tendency of
          the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and
          speaking which prevail around him, produces the same effect. That
          indifferency and suspense, that waiting and equilibrium of the
          judgment, which some require in religious matters, and which some
          would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impossible
          to be preserved. They are not given to the condition of human life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a consequence of this institution that the doctrines of religion
          come to us before the proofs; and come to us with that mixture of
          explications and inferences from which no public creed is, or can be,
          free. And the effect which too frequently follows, from Christianity
          being presented to the understanding in this form, is, that when any
          articles, which appear as parts of it, contradict the apprehension of
          the persons to whom it is proposed, men of rash and confident tempers
          hastily and indiscriminately reject the whole. But is this to do
          justice, either to themselves or to the religion? The rational way of
          treating a subject of such acknowledged importance is, to attend, in
          the first place, to the general and substantial truth of its
          principles, and to that alone. When we once feel a foundation; when we
          once perceive a ground of credibility in its history; we shall proceed
          with safety to inquire into the interpretation of its records, and
          into the doctrines which have been deduced from them. Nor will it
          either endanger our faith, or diminish or alter our motives for
          obedience, if we should discover that these conclusions are formed
          with very different degrees of probability, and possess very different
          degrees of importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conduct of the understanding, dictated by every rule of right
          reasoning, will uphold personal Christianity, even in those countries
          in which it is established under forms the most liable to difficulty
          and objection. It will also have the further effect of guarding us
          against the prejudices which are wont to arise in our minds to the
          disadvantage of religion, from observing the numerous controversies
          which are carried on amongst its professors; and likewise of inducing
          a spirit of lenity and moderation in our judgment, as well as in our
          treatment of those who stand, in such controversies, upon sides
          opposite to ours. What is clear in Christianity we shall find to be
          sufficient, and to be infinitely valuable; what is dubious,
          unnecessary to be decided, or of very subordinate importance, and what
          is most obscure, will teach us to bear with the opinions which others
          may have formed upon the same subject. We shall say to those who the
          most widely dissent from us, what Augustine said to the worst heretics
          of his age; &quot;Illi in vos saeviant, qui nasciunt, cum quo labore
          verum inveniatur, et quam difficile caveantur errores;—-qui nesciunt,
          cure quanta difficultate sanetur oculus interioris hominis;—qui
          nesciunt, quibus suspiriis et gemitibus fiat ut ex quantulacumque
          parte possit intelligi Deus.&quot;. (Aug. contra. Ep. Fund. Cap. ii.
          n. 2,3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A judgment, moreover, which is once pretty well satisfied of the
          general truth of the religion will not only thus discriminate in its
          doctrines, but will possess sufficient strength to overcome the
          reluctance of the imagination to admit articles of faith which are
          attended with difficulty of apprehension, if such articles of faith
          appear to be truly parts of the revelation. It was to be expected
          beforehand, that what related to the economy and to the persons of the
          invisible world, which revelation profess to do, and which, if true,
          it actually does, should contain some points remote from our
          analogies, and from the comprehension of a mind which hath acquired
          all its ideas from sense and from experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          It hath been my care in the preceding work to preserve the separation
          between evidences and doctrines as inviolable as I could; to remove
          from the primary question all considerations which have been
          unnecessarily joined with it; and to offer a defence to Christianity
          which every Christian might read without seeing the tenets in which he
          had been brought up attacked or decried: and it always afforded a
          satisfaction to my mind to observe that this was practicable; that few
          or none of our many controversies with one another affect or relate to
          the proofs of our religion; that the rent never descends to the
          foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth of Christianity depends upon its leading facts, and upon
          them alone. Now of these we have evidence which ought to satisfy us,
          at least until it appear that mankind have ever been deceived by the
          same. We have some uncontested and incontestable points, to which the
          history of the human species hath nothing similar to offer. A Jewish
          peasant changed the religion of the world, and that without force,
          without power, without support; without one natural source or
          circumstance of attraction, influence, or success. Such a thing hath
          not happened in any other instance. The companions of this Person,
          after he himself had been put to death for his attempt, asserted his
          supernatural character, founded upon his supernatural operations: and,
          in testimony of the truth of their assertions, i.e. in consequence of
          their own belief of that truth, and in order to communicate the
          knowledge of it to others, voluntarily entered upon lives of toil and
          hardship, and, with a full experience of their danger, committed
          themselves to the last extremities of persecution. This hath not a
          parallel. More particularly, a very few days after this Person had
          been publicly executed, and in the very city in which he was buried,
          these his companions declared with one voice that his body was
          restored to life: that they had seen him, handled him, ate with him,
          conversed with him; and, in pursuance of their persuasion of the truth
          of what they told, preached his religion, with this strange fact as
          the foundation of it, in the face of those who had killed him, who
          were armed with the power of the country, and necessarily and
          naturally disposed to treat his followers as they had treated himself;
          and having done this upon the spot where the event took place, carried
          the intelligence of it abroad, in despite of difficulties and
          opposition, and where the nature of their errand gave them nothing to
          expect but derision, insult, and outrage.—This is without example.
          These three facts, I think, are certain, and would have been nearly
          so, if the Gospels had never been written. The Christian story, as to
          these points, hath never varied. No other hath been set up against it.
          Every letter, every discourse, every controversy, amongst the
          followers of the religion; every book written by them from the age of
          its commencement to the present time, in every part of the world in
          which it hath been professed, and with every sect into which it hath
          been divided (and we have letters and discourses written by
          contemporaries, by witnesses of the transaction, by persons themselves
          bearing a share in it, and other writings following that again regular
          succession), concur in representing these facts in this manner. A
          religion which now possesses the greatest part of the civilised world
          unquestionably sprang up at Jerusalem at this time. Some account must
          be given of its origin; some cause assigned for its rise. All the
          accounts of this origin, all the explications of this cause, whether
          taken from the writings of the early followers of the religion (in
          which, and in which perhaps alone, it could he expected that they
          should he distinctly unfolded), or from occasional notices in other
          writings of that or the adjoining age, either expressly allege the
          facts above stated as the means by which the religion was set up, or
          advert to its commencement in a manner which agrees with the
          supposition of these facts being true, and which testifies their
          operation and effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          These prepositions alone lay a foundation for our faith; for they
          prove the existence of a transaction which cannot even, in its most
          general parts, be accounted for upon any reasonable supposition,
          except that of the truth of the mission. But the particulars, the
          detail of the miracles or miraculous pretences (for such there
          necessarily must have been) upon which this unexampled transaction
          rested, and for which these men acted and suffered as they did act and
          suffer, it is undoubtedly of great importance to us to know. We have
          this detail from the fountain-head, from the persons themselves; in
          accounts written by eye-witnesses of the scene, by contemporaries and
          companions of those who were so; not in one book but four, each
          containing enough for the verification of the religion, all agreeing
          in the fundamental parts of the history. We have the authenticity of
          these books established by more and stronger proofs than belong to
          almost any other ancient book whatever, and by proofs which widely
          distinguish them from any others claiming a similar authority to
          theirs. If there were any good reason for doubt concerning the names
          to which these books are ascribed (which there is not, for they were
          never ascribed to any other, and we have evidence not long after their
          publication of their bearing the names which they now bear); their
          antiquity, of which there is no question, their reputation and
          authority amongst the early disciples of the religion, of which there
          is as little, form a valid proof that they must, in the main at least,
          have agreed with what the first teachers of the religion delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we open these ancient volumes, we discover in them marks of
          truth, whether we consider each in itself, or collate them with one
          another. The writers certainly knew something of what they were
          writing about, for they manifest an acquaintance with local
          circumstances, with the history and usages of the times, which could
          belong only to an inhabitant of that country, living in that age. In
          every narrative we perceive simplicity and undesignedness; the air and
          the language of reality. When we compare the different narratives
          together, we find them so varying as to repel all suspicion of
          confederacy; so agreeing under this variety as to show that the
          accounts had one real transaction for their common foundation; often
          attributing different actions and discourses to the Person whose
          history, or rather memoirs of whose history, they profess to relate,
          yet actions and discourses so similar as very much to bespeak the same
          character: which is a coincidence that, in such writers as they were,
          could only be the consequence of their writing from fact, and not from
          imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          These four narratives are confined to the history of the Founder of
          the religion, and end with his ministry. Since, however, it is certain
          that the affair went on, we cannot help being anxious to know how it
          proceeded. This intelligence hath come down to us in a work purporting
          to be written by a person, himself connected with the business during
          the first stages of its progress, taking up the story where the former
          histories had left it, carrying on the narrative, oftentimes with
          great particularity, and throughout with the appearance of good
          sense,* information and candour; stating all along the origin, and the
          only probable origin, of effects which unquestionably were produced,
          together with the natural consequences of situations which
          unquestionably did exist; and confirmed, in the substance at least of
          the account, by the strongest possible accession of testimony which a
          history can receive, original letters, written by the person who is
          the principal subject of the history, written upon the business to
          which the history relates, and during the period, or soon after the
          period, which the history comprises. No man can say that this all
          together is not a body of strong historical evidence.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * See Peter&#x27;s speech upon curing the cripple (Acts iii. 18), the
          council of the apostles (xv.), Paul&#x27;s discourse at Athens (xvii.
          22), before Agrippa (xxvi.). I notice these passages, both as fraught
          with good sense and as free from the smallest tincture of enthusiasm.
          _________
        </p>
        <p>
          When we reflect that some of those from whom the books proceeded are
          related to have themselves wrought miracles, to have been the subject
          of miracles, or of supernatural assistance in propagating the
          religion, we may perhaps be led to think that more credit, or a
          different kind of credit, is due to these accounts, than what can be
          claimed by merely human testimony. But this is an argument which
          cannot be addressed to sceptics or unbelievers. A man must be a
          Christian before he can receive it. The inspiration of the historical
          Scriptures, the nature, degree, and extent of that inspiration, are
          questions undoubtedly of serious discussion; but they are questions
          amongst Christians themselves, and not between them and others. The
          doctrine itself is by no means necessary to the belief of
          Christianity, which must, in the first instance at least, depend upon
          the ordinary maxim of historical credibility. (See Powell&#x27;s
          Discourse, disc. xv. P. 245.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In viewing the detail of miracles recorded in these books, we find
          every supposition negatived by which they can be resolved into fraud
          or delusion. They were not secret, nor momentary, nor tentative, nor
          ambiguous; nor performed under the sanction of authority, with the
          spectators on their side, or in affirmance of tenets and practices
          already established. We find also the evidence alleged for them, and
          which evidence was by great numbers received, different from that upon
          which other miraculous accounts rest. It was contemporary, it was
          published upon the spot, it continued; it involved interests and
          questions of the greatest magnitude; it contradicted the most fixed
          persuasions and prejudices of the persons to whom it was addressed; it
          required from those who accepted it, not a simple, indolent assent,
          but a change, from thenceforward, of principles and conduct, a
          submission to consequences the most serious and the most deterring, to
          loss and danger, to insult, outrage, and persecution. How such a story
          should be false, or, if false, how under such circumstances it should
          make its way, I think impossible to be explained; yet such the
          Christian story was, such were the circumstances under which it came
          forth, and in opposition to such difficulties did it prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          An event so connected with the religion, and with the fortunes, of the
          Jewish people, as one of their race, one born amongst them,
          establishing his authority and his law throughout a great portion of
          the civilised world, it was perhaps to be expected should be noticed
          in the prophetic writings of that nation; especially when this Person,
          together with his own mission, caused also to be acknowledged the
          Divine original of their institution, and by those who before had
          altogether rejected it. Accordingly, we perceive in these writings
          various intimations concurring in the person and history of Jesus, in
          a manner and in a degree in which passages taken from these books
          could not be made to concur in any person arbitrarily assumed, or in
          any person except him who has been the author of great changes in the
          affairs and opinions of mankind. Of some of these predictions the
          weight depends a good deal upon the concurrence. Others possess great
          separate strength: one in particular does this in an eminent degree.
          It is an entire description, manifestly directed to one character and
          to one scene of things; it is extant in a writing, or collection of
          writings, declaredly prophetic; and it applies to Christ&#x27;s
          character, and to the circumstances of his life and death, with
          considerable precision, and in a way which no diversity of
          interpretation hath, in my opinion, been able to confound. That the
          advent of Christ, and the consequences of it, should not have been
          more distinctly revealed in the Jewish sacred books, is I think in
          some measure accounted for by the consideration, that for the Jews to
          have foreseen the fall of their institution, and that it was to merge
          at length into a more perfect and comprehensive dispensation, would
          have cooled too much, and relaxed, their zeal for it, and their
          adherence to it, upon which zeal and adherence the preservation in the
          world of any remains, for many ages, of religious truth might in a
          great measure depend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of what a revelation discloses to mankind, one, and only one, question
          can properly be asked—Was it of importance to mankind to know, or to
          be better assured of? In this question, when we turn our thoughts to
          the great Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and of a
          future judgment, no doubt can possibly be entertained. He who gives me
          riches or honours, does nothing; he who even gives me health, does
          little, in comparison with that which lays before me just grounds for
          expecting a restoration to life, and a day of account and retribution;
          which thing Christianity hath done for millions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other articles of the Christian faith, although of infinite importance
          when placed beside any other topic of human inquiry, are only the
          adjuncts and circumstances of this. They are, however, such as appear
          worthy of the original to which we ascribe them. The morality of the
          religion, whether taken from the precepts or the example of its
          Founder, or from the lessons of its primitive teachers, derived, as it
          should seem, from what had been inculcated by their Master, is, in all
          its parts, wise and pure; neither adapted to vulgar prejudices, nor
          flattering popular notions, nor excusing established practices, but
          calculated, in the matter of its instruction, truly to promote human
          happiness; and in the form in which it was conveyed, to produce
          impression and effect: a morality which, let it have proceeded from
          any person whatever, would have been satisfactory evidence of his good
          sense and integrity, of the soundness of his understanding and the
          probity of his designs: a morality, in every view of it, much more
          perfect than could have been expected from the natural circumstances
          and character of the person who delivered it; a morality, in a word,
          which is, and hath been, most beneficial to mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the greatest, therefore, of all possible occasions, and for a
          purpose of inestimable value, it pleased the Deity to vouchsafe a
          miraculous attestation. Having done this for the institution, when
          this alone could fix its authority, or give to it a beginning, he
          committed its future progress to the natural means of human
          communication, and to the influence of those causes by which human
          conduct and human affairs are governed. The seed, being sown, was left
          to vegetate; the leaven, being inserted, was left to ferment; and both
          according to the laws of nature: laws, nevertheless, disposed and
          controlled by that Providence which conducts the affairs of the
          universe, though by an influence inscrutable, and generally
          undistinguishable by us. And in this, Christianity is analogous to
          most other provisions for happiness. The provision is made; and; being
          made, is left to act according to laws which, forming a part of a more
          general system, regulate this particular subject in common with many
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the constant recurrence to our observation of contrivance, design,
          and wisdom, in the works of nature, once fix upon our minds the belief
          of a God, and after that all is easy. In the counsels of a being
          possessed of the power and disposition which the Creator of the
          universe must possess, it is not improbable that there should be a
          future state; it is not improbable that we should be acquainted with
          it. A future state rectifies everything; because, if moral agents be
          made, in the last event, happy or miserable, according to their
          conduct in the station and under the circumstances in which they are
          placed, it seems not very material by the operation of what causes,
          according to what rules, or even, if you please to call it so, by what
          chance or caprice these stations are assigned, or these circumstances
          determined. This hypothesis, therefore, solves all that objection to
          the divine care and goodness which the promiscuous distribution of
          good and evil (I do not mean in the doubtful advantages of riches and
          grandeur, but in the unquestionably important distinctions of health
          and sickness, strength and infirmity, bodily ease and pain, mental
          alacrity and depression) is apt on so many occasions to create. This
          one truth changes the nature of things; gives order to confusion;
          makes the moral world of a piece with the natural.

          Nevertheless, a higher degree of assurance than that to which it is
          possible to advance this, or any argument drawn from the light of
          nature, was necessary, especially to overcome the shock which the
          imagination and the senses received from the effects and the
          appearances of death, and the obstruction which thence arises to the
          expectation of either a continued or a future existence. This
          difficulty, although of a nature no doubt to act very forcibly, will
          be found, I think, upon reflection to reside more in our habits of
          apprehension than in the subject: and that the giving way to it, when
          we have any reasonable grounds or the contrary, is rather an indulging
          of the imagination than anything else. Abstractedly considered, that
          is, considered without relation to the difference which habit, and
          merely habit, produces in our faculties and modes of apprehension, I
          do not see anything more in the resurrection of a dead man than in the
          conception of a child; except it be this, that the one comes into his
          world with a system of prior consciousness about him, which the other
          does not: and no person will say that he knows enough of either
          subject to perceive that this circumstance makes such a difference in
          the two cases that the one should be easy, and the other impossible;
          the one natural, the other not so. To the first man the succession of
          the species would be as incomprehensible as the resurrection of the
          dead is to us.

          Thought is different from motion, perception from impact: the
          individuality of a mind is hardly consistent with the divisibility of
          an extended substance; or its volition, that is, its power of
          originating motion, with the inertness which cleaves to every portion
          of matter which our observation or our experiments can reach. These
          distinctions lead us to an immaterial principle: at least, they do
          this: they so negative the mechanical properties of matter, in the
          constitution of a sentient, still more of a rational, being, that no
          argument drawn from the properties can be of any great weight in
          opposition to other reasons, when the question respects the changes of
          which such: a nature is capable, or the manner in which these changes
          am effected. Whatever thought be, or whatever it depend upon the
          regular experience of sleep makes one thing concerning it certain,
          that it can be completely suspended, and completely restored.

          If any one find it too great a strain upon his thoughts to admit the
          notion of a substance strictly immaterial, that is, from which
          extension and solidity are excluded, he can find no difficulty in
          allowing, that a particle as small as a particle of light, minuter
          than all conceivable dimensions, may just as easily be the depositary,
          the organ, and the vehicle of consciousness as the congeries of animal
          substance which forms a human body, or the human brain; that, being
          so, it may transfer a proper identity to whatever shall hereafter be
          united to it; may be safe amidst the destruction of its integuments;
          may connect the natural with the spiritual, the corruptible with the
          glorified body. If it be said that the mode and means of all this is
          imperceptible by our senses, it is only what is true of the most
          important agencies and operations. The great powers of nature are all
          invisible. Gravitation, electricity, magnetism, though constantly
          present, and constantly exerting their influence; though within us,
          near us, and about us; though diffused throughout all space,
          overspreading the surface, or penetrating the contexture, of all
          bodies with which we are acquainted, depend upon substances and
          actions which are totally concealed from our senses. The Supreme
          Intelligence is so himself.

          But whether these or any other attempts to satisfy the imagination
          bear any resemblance to the truth; or whether the imagination, which,
          as I have said before, is the mere slave of habit, can be satisfied or
          not; when a future state, and the revelation of a future state is not
          only perfectly consistent with the attributes of the Being who governs
          the universe; but when it is more; when it alone removes the
          appearance of contrariety which attends the operations of his will
          towards creatures capable of comparative merit and demerit, of reward
          and punishment; when a strong body of historical evidence, confirmed
          by many internal tokens of truth and authenticity, gives us just
          reason to believe that such a revelation hath actually been made; we
          ought to set our minds at rest with the assurance, that in the
          resources of Creative Wisdom expedients cannot be wanted to carry into
          effect what the Deity hath purposed: that either a new and mighty
          influence will descend upon the human world to resuscitate
          extinguished consciousness; or that, amidst the other wonderful
          contrivances with which the universe abounds, and by some of which we
          see animal life, in many instances, assuming improved forms of
          existence, acquiring new organs, new perceptions, and new sources of
          enjoyment, provision is also made, though by methods secret to us (as
          all the great processes of nature are), for conducting the objects of
          God&#x27;s moral government, through the necessary changes of their
          frame, to those final distinctions of happiness and misery which he
          hath declared to be reserved for obedience and transgression, for
          virtue and vice, for the use and the neglect, the right and the wrong
          employment of the faculties and opportunities with which he hath been
          pleased, severally, to intrust and to try us.
