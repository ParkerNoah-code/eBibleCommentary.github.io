        <h2>SECTION III.</h2>
        <p>OF THE RELIGION OF MAHOMET.</p>
        <p>
          The only event in the history of the human species which admits of
          comparison with the propagation of Christianity is the success of
          Mahometanism. The Mahometan institution was rapid in its progress, was
          recent in its history, and was founded upon a supernatural or
          prophetic character assumed by its author. In these articles, the
          resemblance with Christianity is confessed. But there are points of
          difference which separate, we apprehend, the two cases entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Mahomet did not found his pretensions upon miracles, properly so
          called; that is, upon proofs of supernatural agency capable of being
          known and attested by others. Christians are warranted in this.
          assertion by the evidence of the Koran, in which Mahomet not only does
          not affect the power of working miracles, but expressly disclaims it.
          The following passages of that book furnish direct proofs of the truth
          of what we allege:—&quot;The infidels say, Unless a sign be sent down
          unto him from his lord, we will not believe; thou art a preacher
          only.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. xiii. p. 201, ed. quarto.) Again;
          &quot;Nothing hindered us from sending thee with miracles, except that
          the former nations have charged them with imposture.&quot; (C. xvii.
          p. 232.) And lastly; &quot;They say, Unless a sign be sent down unto
          him from his lord, we will not believe: Answer; Signs are in the power
          of God alone, and I am no more than a public preacher. Is it not
          sufficient for them, that we have sent down unto them the book of the
          Koran to be read unto them?&quot; (C. xxix. p. 328.) Beside these
          acknowledgments, I have observed thirteen distinct places in which
          Mahomet puts the objection (unless a sign, &amp;c.) into the mouth of
          the unbeliever, in not one of which does he allege a miracle in reply.
          His answer is, &quot;that God giveth the power of working miracles
          when and to whom he pleaseth;&quot; (C. v. x. xiii. twice.) &quot;that
          if he should work miracles, they would not believe;&quot; (C. vi.)
          &quot;that they had before rejected Moses, and Jesus and the Prophets,
          who wrought miracles;&quot; (C. iii. xxi. xxviii.) &quot;that the
          Koran itself was a miracle.&quot; (C. xvi.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The only place in the Koran in which it can be pretended that a
          sensible miracle is referred to (for I do not allow the secret
          visitations of Gabriel, the night-journey of Mahomet to heaven, or the
          presence in battle of invisible hosts of angels, to deserve the name
          of sensible miracles) is the beginning of the fifty-fourth chapter.
          The words are these:—&quot;The hour of judgment approacheth, and the
          moon hath been split in sunder: but if the unbelievers see a sign,
          they turn aside, saying, This is a powerful charm.&quot; The Mahometan
          expositors disagree in their interpretation of this passage; some
          explaining it to be mention of the splitting of the moon as one of the
          future signs of the approach of the day of judgment: others referring
          it to a miraculous appearance which had then taken place. (Vide Sale,
          in loc.) It seems to me not improbable, that Mahomet might have taken
          advantage of some extraordinary halo, or other unusual appearance of
          the moon, which had happened about this time; and which supplied a
          foundation both for this passage, and for the story which in after
          times had been raised out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this more than silence, after these authentic confessions of the
          Koran, we are not to be moved with miraculous stories related of
          Mahomet by Abulfeda, who wrote his life about six hundred years after
          his death; or which are found in the legend of Al-Jannabi, who came
          two hundred years later.* On the contrary, from comparing what Mahomet
          himself wrote and said with what was afterwards reported of him by his
          followers, the plain and fair conclusion is, that when the religion
          was established by conquest, then, and not till then, came out the
          stories of his miracles.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * It does not, I think, appear, that these historians had any written
          accounts to appeal to more ancient than the Sonnah; which was a
          collection of traditions made by order of the Caliphs two hundred
          years after Mahomet&#x27;s death. Mahomet died A.D. 632; Al-Bochari,
          one of the six doctors who compiled the Sonnah, was born A.D. 809;
          died 869. Prideaux&#x27;s Life of Mahomet, p. 192, ed. 7th. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this difference alone constitutes, in my opinion, a bar to all
          reasoning from one case to the other. The success of a religion
          founded upon a miraculous history shows the credit which was given to
          the history; and this credit, under the circumstances in which it was
          given, i. e. by persons capable of knowing the truth, and interested
          to inquire after it, is evidence of the reality of the history, and,
          by consequence, of the truth of the religion. Where a miraculous
          history is not alleged, no part of this argument can be applied. We
          admit that multitudes acknowledged the pretensions of Mahomet: but,
          these pretensions being destitute of miraculous evidence, we know that
          the grounds upon which they were acknowledged could not be secure
          grounds of persuasion to his followers, nor their example any
          authority to us. Admit the whole of Mahomet&#x27;s authentic history,
          so far as it was of a nature capable of being known or witnessed by
          others, to be true (which is certainly to admit all that the reception
          of the religion can be brought to prove), and Mahomet might still be
          an impostor, or enthusiast, or a union of both. Admit to be true
          almost any part of Christ&#x27;s history, of that, I mean, which was
          public, and within the cognizance of his followers, and he must have
          come from God. Where matter of fact is not in question, where miracles
          are not alleged, I do not see that the progress of a religion is a
          better argument of its truth than the prevalency of any system of
          opinions in natural religion, morality, or physics, is a proof of the
          truth of those opinions. And we know that this sort of argument is
          inadmissible in any branch of philosophy what ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it will be said, if one religion could make its way without
          miracles, why might not another? To which I reply, first, that this is
          not the question; the proper question is not, whether a religious
          institution could be set up without miracles, but whether a religion,
          or a change of religion, founding itself in miracles, could succeed
          without any reality to rest upon? I apprehend these two cases to be
          very different: and I apprehend Mahomet&#x27;s not taking this course,
          to be one proof, amongst others, that the thing is difficult, if not
          impossible, to be accomplished: certainly it was not from an
          unconsciousness of the value and importance of miraculous evidence;
          for it is very observable, that in the same volume, and sometimes in
          the same chapters, in which Mahomet so repeatedly disclaims the power
          of working miracles himself, he is incessantly referring to the
          miracles of preceding prophets. One would imagine, to hear some men
          talk, or to read some books, that the setting up of a religion by dint
          of miraculous pretences was a thing of every day&#x27;s experience:
          whereas, I believe that, except the Jewish and Christian religion,
          there is no tolerably well authenticated account of any such thing
          having been accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The establishment of Mahomet&#x27;s religion was affected by
          causes which in no degree appertained to the origin of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the first twelve years of his mission, Mahomet had recourse
          only to persuasion. This is allowed. And there is sufficient reason
          from the effect to believe that, if he had confined himself to this
          mode of propagating his religion, we of the present day should never
          have heard either of him or it. &quot;Three years were silently
          employed in the conversion of fourteen proselytes. For ten years, the
          religion advanced with a slow and painful progress, within the walls
          of Mecca. The number of proselytes in the seventh year of his mission
          may be estimated by the absence of eighty-three men and eighteen
          women, who retired to Aethiopia.&quot; (Gibbon&#x27;s Hist. vol. ix.
          p. 244, et seq. ed. Dub.) Yet this progress, such as it was, appears
          to have been aided by some very important advantages which Mahomet
          found in his situation, in his mode of conducting his design, and in
          his doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Mahomet was the grandson of the most powerful and honourable family
          in Mecca; and although the early death of his father had not left him
          a patrimony suitable to his birth, he had, long before the
          commencement of his mission, repaired this deficiency by an opulent
          marriage. A person considerable by his wealth, of high descent, and
          nearly allied to the chiefs of his country, taking upon himself the
          character of a religious teacher, would not fail of attracting
          attention and followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Mahomet conducted his design, in the outset especially, with great
          art and prudence. He conducted it as a politician would conduct a
          plot. His first application was to his own family. This gained him his
          wife&#x27;s uncle, a considerable person in Mecca, together with his
          cousin Ali, afterwards the celebrated Caliph, then a youth of great
          expectation, and even already distinguished by his attachment,
          impetuosity, and courage.* He next expressed himself to Abu Beer, a
          man amongst the first of the Koreish in wealth and influence. The
          interest and example of Abu Beer drew in five other principal persons
          in Mecca, whose solicitations prevailed upon five more of the same
          rank. This was the work of three years; during which time everything
          was transacted in secret. Upon the strength of these allies, and under
          the powerful protection of his family, who, however some of them might
          disapprove his enterprise, or deride his pretensions, would not suffer
          the orphan of their house, the relict of their favourite brother, to
          be insulted, Mahomet now commenced his public preaching. And the
          advance which he made during the nine or ten remaining years of his
          peaceable ministry was by no means greater than what, with these
          advantages, and with the additional and singular circumstance of there
          being no established religion at Mecca at that time to contend with,
          might reasonably have been expected. How soon his primitive adherents
          were let into the secret of his views of empire, or in what stage of
          his undertaking these views first opened themselves to his own mind,
          it is not now easy to determine. The event however was, that these,
          his first proselytes, all ultimately attained to riches and honours,
          to the command of armies, and the government of kingdoms. (Gibbon,
          vol. ix. p 244.)
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * Of which Mr. Gibbon has preserved the following specimen: &quot;When
          Mahomet called out in an assembly of his family, Who among you will be
          my companion, and my vizir? Ali, then only in the fourteenth year of
          his age, suddenly replied, O prophet I am the man;—whosoever rises
          against thee, I will dash out his teeth, tear out his eyes, break his
          legs, rip up his belly. O prophet! I will be thy vizir over
          them.&quot; Vol. ix. p. 215. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Arabs deduced their descent from Abraham through the line of
          Ishmael. The inhabitants of Mecca, in common probably with the other
          Arabian tribes, acknowledged, as I think may clearly be collected from
          the Koran, one supreme Deity, but had associated with him many objects
          of idolatrous worship. The great doctrine with which Mahomet set out
          was the strict and exclusive unity of God. Abraham, he told them,
          their illustrous ancestor; Ishmael, the father of their nation; Moses,
          the lawgiver of the Jews; and Jesus, the author of Christianity—had
          all asserted the same thing; that their followers had universally
          corrupted the truth, and that he was now commissioned to restore it to
          the world. Was it to be wondered at, that a doctrine so specious, and
          authorized by names, some or other of which were holden in the highest
          veneration by every description of his hearers, should, in the hands
          of a popular missionary, prevail to the extent in which Mahomet
          succeeded by his pacific ministry?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Of the institution which Mahomet joined with this fundamental
          doctrine, and of the Koran in which that institution is delivered, we
          discover, I think, two purposes that pervade the whole, viz., to make
          converts, and to make his converts soldiers. The following
          particulars, amongst others, may be considered as pretty evident
          indications of these designs:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. When Mahomet began to preach, his address to the Jews, to the
          Christians, and to the Pagan Arabs, was, that the religion which he
          taught was no other than what had been originally their own.—&quot;We
          believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto us, and that
          which hath been sent down unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and
          Jacob, and the Tribes, and that which was delivered unto Moses and
          Jesus, and that which was delivered unto the prophets from their Lord:
          we make no distinction between any of them.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran,
          c. ii. p. 17.) &quot;He hath ordained you the religion which he
          commanded Noah, and which we have revealed unto thee, O Mohammed, and
          which we commanded Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, saying, Observe this
          religion, and be not divided therein.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c.
          xlii. p. 393.) &quot;He hath chosen you, and hath not imposed on you
          any difficulty in the religion which he hath given you, the religion
          of your father Abraham.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. xxii. p. 281.)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The author of the Koran never ceases from describing the future
          anguish of unbelievers, their despair, regret, penitence, and torment.
          It is the point which he labours above all others. And these
          descriptions are conceived in terms which will appear in no small
          degree impressive, even to the modern reader of an English
          translation. Doubtless they would operate with much greater force upon
          the minds of those to whom they were immediately directed. The terror
          which they seem well calculated to inspire would be to many tempers a
          powerful application.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. On the other hand: his voluptuous paradise; his robes of silk, his
          palaces of marble, his riven, and shades, his groves and couches, his
          wines, his dainties; and, above all, his seventy-two virgins assigned
          to each of the faithful, of resplendent beauty and eternal
          youth—intoxicated the imaginations, and seized the passions of his
          Eastern followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But Mahomet&#x27;s highest heaven was reserved for those who fought
          his battles or expended their fortunes in his cause: &quot;Those
          believers who sit still at home, not having any hurt, and those who
          employ their fortunes and their persons for the religion of God, shall
          not be held equal. God hath preferred those who employ their fortunes
          and their persons in that cause to a degree above those who sit at
          home. God had indeed promised every one Paradise; but God had
          preferred those who fight for the faith before those who sit still, by
          adding unto them a great reward; by degrees of honour conferred upon
          them from him, and by granting them forgiveness and mercy.&quot;
          (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. iv. p. 73.) Again; &quot;Do ye reckon the
          giving drink to the pilgrims, and the visiting of the holy temple, to
          be actions as meritorious as those performed by him who believeth in
          God and the last day, and fighteth for the religion of God? They shall
          not be held equal with God.—They who have believed and fled their
          country, and employed their substance and their persons in the defence
          of God&#x27;s true religion, shall be in the highest degree of honour
          with God; and these are they who shall be happy. The Lord sendeth them
          good tidings of mercy from him, and good will, and of gardens wherein
          they shall enjoy lasting pleasures. They shall continue therein for
          ever; for with God is a great reward.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. ix.
          p. 151.) And, once more; &quot;Verily God hath purchased of the true
          believers their souls and their substance, promising them the
          enjoyment of Paradise on condition that they fight for the cause of
          God: whether they slay or be slain, the promise for the same is
          assuredly due by the Law and the Gospel and the Koran.&quot;
          (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. ix. p. 164.)*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * &quot;The sword,&quot; saith Mahomet, &quot;is the key of heaven and
          of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a night spent in
          arms, is of more avail than two months&#x27; fasting or prayer.
          Whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven at the day of
          judgment; his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion, and
          odoriferous as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by
          the wings of angels and cherubim.&quot; Gibbon, vol. ix. p. 256.
          _________
        </p>
        <p>
          5. His doctrine of predestination was applicable, and was applied by
          him, to the same purpose of fortifying and of exalting the courage of
          his adherents.—&quot;If anything of the matter had happened unto us,
          we had not been slain here. Answer; If ye had been in your houses,
          verily they would have gone forth to fight, whose slaughter was
          decreed, to the places where they died.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c.
          iii. p. 54.)
        </p>
        <p>
          6. In warm regions, the appetite of the sexes is ardent, the passion
          for inebriating liquors moderate. In compliance with this distinction,
          although Mahomet laid a restraint upon the drinking of wine, in the
          use of women he allowed an almost unbounded indulgence. Four wives,
          with the liberty of changing them at pleasure, (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c.
          iv. p. 63.) together with the persons of all his captives, (Gibbon,
          vol. ix. p. 225.) was an irresistible bribe to an Arabian warrior.
          &quot;God is minded,&quot; says he, speaking of this very subject,
          &quot;to make his religion light unto you; for man was created
          weak.&quot; How different this from the unaccommodating purity of the
          Gospel! How would Mahomet have succeeded with the Christian lesson in
          his mouth.—&quot;Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her,
          hath committed adultery with her already in his heart&quot;? It must
          be added, that Mahomet did not venture upon the prohibition of wine
          till the fourth year of the Hegira, or the seventeenth of his mission,
          when his military successes had completely established his authority.
          The same observation holds of the fast of the Ramadan, (Mod. Univ.
          Hist. Vol. i. pp. 126 &amp; 112.) and of the most laborious part of
          his institution, the pilgrimage to Mecca. (This latter, however,
          already prevailed amongst the Arabs, and had grown out of their
          excessive veneration for the Caaba. Mahomot&#x27;s law, in this
          respect, was rather a compliance than an innovation. Sale&#x27;s
          Prelim. Disc. p. 122.)

          What has hitherto been collected from the records of the Musselman
          history relates to the twelve or thirteen years of Mahomet&#x27;s
          peaceable preaching, which part alone of his life and enterprise
          admits of the smallest comparison with the origin of Christianity. A
          new scene is now unfolded. The city of Medina, distant about ten
          days&#x27; journey from Mecca, was at that time distracted by the
          hereditary contentions of two hostile tribes. These feuds were
          exasperated by the mutual persecutions of the Jews and Christians, and
          of the different Christian sects by which the city was inhabited.
          (Mod. Univ. Hist. Vol. i. p. 100.) The religion of Mahomet presented,
          in some measure, a point of union or compromise to these divided
          opinions. It embraced the principles which were common to them all.
          Each party saw in it an honourable acknowledgment of the fundamental
          truth of their own system. To the Pagan Arab, somewhat imbued with the
          sentiments and knowledge of his Jewish or Christian fellow-citizen, it
          offered no defensive or very improbable theology. This recommendation
          procured to Mahometanism a more favourable reception at Medina than
          its author had been able, by twelve years&#x27; painful endeavours, to
          obtain for it at Mecca. Yet, after all, the progress of the religion
          was inconsiderable. His missionary could only collect a congregation
          of forty persons. It was not a religious, but a political association,
          which ultimately introduced Mahomet into Medina. Harassed, as it
          should seem, and disgusted by the long continuance of factions and
          disputes, the inhabitants of that city saw in the admission of the
          prophet&#x27;s authority a rest from the miseries which they had
          suffered, and a suppression of the violence and fury which they had
          learned to condemn. After an embassy, therefore, composed of believers
          and unbelievers, (Mod. Univ. Hist. Vol. i. p. 85.) and of persons of
          both tribes, with whom a treaty was concluded of strict alliance and
          support, Mahomet made his public entry, and was received as the
          sovereign of Medina.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this time, or soon after this time, the impostor changed his
          language and his conduct. Having now a town at his command, where to
          arm his party, and to head them with security, he enters upon new
          counsels. He now pretends that a divine commission is given him to
          attack the infidels, to destroy idolatry, and to set up the true faith
          by the sword. (Mod. Univ. Hist. Vol. i. p. 88.) An early victory over
          a very superior force, achieved by conduct and bravery, established
          the renown of his arms, and of his personal character. (Victory of
          Bedr, Mod. Univ. Hist. Vol. i. p. 106.) Every year after this was
          marked by battles or assassinations. The nature and activity of
          Mahomet&#x27;s future exertions may be estimated from the computation,
          that in the nine following years of his life he commanded his army in
          person in eight general engagements, (Mod. Univ. Hist. vol. i. p.
          255.) and undertook, by himself or his lieutenants, fifty military
          enterprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this time we have nothing left to account for, but that Mahomet
          should collect an army, that his army should conquer, and that his
          religion should proceed together with his conquests. The ordinary
          experience of human affairs leaves us little to wonder at in any of
          these effects: and they were likewise each assisted by peculiar
          facilities. From all sides, the roving Arabs crowded round the
          standard of religion and plunder, of freedom and victory, of arms and
          rapine. Beside the highly painted joys of a carnal paradise, Mahomet
          rewarded his followers in this world with a liberal division of the
          spoils, and with the persons of their female captives. (Gibbon, vol.
          ix. p. 255.) The condition of Arabia, occupied by small independent
          tribes, exposed it to the impression, and yielded to the progress of a
          firm and resolute army. After the reduction of his native peninsula,
          the weakness also of the Roman provinces on the north and the west, as
          well as the distracted state of the Persian empire on the east,
          facilitated the successful invasion of neighbouring countries. That
          Mahomet&#x27;s conquests should carry his religion along with them
          will excite little surprise, when we know the conditions which he
          proposed to the vanquished. Death or conversion was the only choice
          offered to idolaters. &quot;Strike off their heads! strike off all the
          ends of their fingers!(Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. viii. p. 140.) kill the
          idolaters, wheresoever ye shall find them!&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran,
          c. ix. p. 149.) To the Jews and Christians was left the somewhat
          milder alternative of subjection and tribute, if they persisted in
          their own religion, or of an equal participation in the rights and
          liberties, the honours and privileges, of the faithful, if they
          embraced the religion of their conquerors. &quot;Ye Christian dogs,
          you know your option; the Koran, the tribute, or the sword.&quot;
          (Gibbon, vol. ix. p. 337.) The corrupted state of Christianity in the
          seventh century, and the contentions of its sects, unhappily so fell
          in with men&#x27;s care of their safety or their fortunes, as to
          induce many to forsake its profession. Add to all which, that
          Mahomet&#x27;s victories not only operated by the natural effect of
          conquest, but that they were constantly represented, both to his
          friends and enemies, as divine declarations in his favour. Success was
          evidence. Prosperity carried with it, not only influence, but proof.
          &quot;Ye have already,&quot; says he, after the battle of Bedr,
          &quot;had a miracle shown you, in two armies which attacked each
          other; one army fought for God&#x27;s true religion, but the other
          were infidels.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. iii. p. 36.) Again;
          &quot;Ye slew not those who were slain at Bedr, but God slew them.—If
          ye desire a decision of the matter between us, now hath a decision
          come unto you.&quot; (Sale&#x27;s Koran, c. viii. p. 141.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Many more passages might be collected out of the Koran to the same
          effect; but they are unnecessary. The success of Mahometanism during
          this, and indeed every future period of its history, bears so little
          resemblance to the early propagation of Christianity, that no
          inference whatever can justly be drawn from it to the prejudice of the
          Christian argument. For what are we comparing? A Galilean peasant
          accompanied by a few fishermen with a conqueror at the head of his
          army. We compare Jesus, without force, without power, without support,
          without One external circumstance of attraction or influence,
          prevailing against the prejudices, the learning, the hierarchy, of his
          country; against the ancient religious opinions, the pompous religious
          rites, the philosophy, the wisdom, the authority, of the Roman empire,
          in the most polished and enlightened period of its existence,—with
          Mahomet making his way amongst Arabs; collecting followers in the
          midst of conquests and triumphs, in the darkest ages and countries of
          the world, and when success in arms not only operated by that command
          of men&#x27;s wills and persons which attend prosperous undertakings,
          but was considered as a sure testimony of Divine approbation. That
          multitudes, persuaded by this argument, should join the train of a
          victorious chief; that still greater multitudes should, without any
          argument, bow down before irresistible power—is a conduct in which we
          cannot see much to surprise us; in which we can see nothing that
          resembles the causes by which the establishment of Christianity was
          effected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success, therefore, of Mahometanism stands not in the way of this
          important conclusion; that the propagation of Christianity, in the
          manner and under the circumstances in which it was propagated, is an
          unique in the history of the species. A Jewish peasant overthrew the
          religion of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have, nevertheless, placed the prevalency of the religion amongst
          the auxiliary arguments of its truth; because, whether it had
          prevailed or not, or whether its prevalency can or cannot be accounted
          for, the direct argument remains still. It is still true that a great
          number of men upon the spot, personally connected with the history and
          with the Author of the religion, were induced by what they heard and
          saw, and knew, not only to change their former opinions, but to give
          up their time, and sacrifice their ease, to traverse seas and kingdoms
          without rest and without weariness, to commit themselves to extreme
          dangers, to undertake incessant toils, to undergo grievous sufferings,
          and all this solely in consequence, and in support, of their belief of
          facts, which, if true, establish the truth of the religion, which, if
          false, they must have known to be so.
