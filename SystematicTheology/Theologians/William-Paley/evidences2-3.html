        <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
        <p>THE CANDOUR OF THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</p>
        <p>
          I make this candour to consist in their putting down many passages,
          and noticing many circumstances, which no writer whatever was likely
          to have forged; and which no writer would have chosen to appear in his
          book who had been careful to present the story in the most
          unexceptionable form, or who had thought himself at liberty to carve
          and mould the particulars of that story according to his choice, or
          according to his judgment of the effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strong and well-known example of the fairness of the evangelists
          offers itself in their account of Christ&#x27;s resurrection, namely,
          in their unanimously stating that after he was risen he appeared to
          his disciples alone. I do not mean that they have used the exclusive
          word alone; but that all the instances which they have recorded of his
          appearance are instances of appearance to his disciples; that their
          reasonings upon it, and allusions to it, are confined to this
          supposition; and that by one of them Peter is made to say, &quot;Him
          God raised up the third day, and showed him openly, not to all the
          people, but to witnesses chosen before of God, even to us who did eat
          and drink with him after he rose from the dead.&quot; (Acts x. 40,
          41.) The most common understanding must have perceived that the
          history of the resurrection would have come with more advantage if
          they had related that Jesus appeared, after he was risen, to his foes
          as well as his friends, to the scribes and Pharisees, the Jewish
          council, and the Roman governor: or even if they had asserted the
          public appearance of Christ in general unqualified terms, without
          noticing, as they have done, the presence of his disciples on each
          occasion, and noticing it in such a manner as to lead their readers to
          suppose that none but disciples were present. They could have
          represented in one way as well as the other. And if their point had
          been to have their religion believed, whether true or false; if they
          had fabricated the story ab initio; or if they had been disposed
          either to have delivered their testimony as witnesses, or to have
          worked up their materials and information as historians, in such a
          manner as to render their narrative as specious and unobjectionable as
          they could; in a word, if they had thought of anything but of the
          truth of the case, as they understood and believed it; they would in
          their account of Christ&#x27;s several appearances after his
          resurrection, at least have omitted this restriction. At this distance
          of time, the account as we have it is perhaps more credible than it
          would have been the other way; because this manifestation of the
          historians&#x27; candour is of more advantage to their testimony than
          the difference in the circumstances of the account would have been to
          the nature of the evidence. But this is an effect which the
          evangelists would not foresee: and I think that it was by no means the
          case at the time when the books were composed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Gibbon has argued for the genuineness of the Koran, from the
          confessions which it contains, to the apparent disadvantage of the
          Mahometan cause. (Vol. ix. c. 50, note 96.) The same defence
          vindicates the genuineness of our Gospels, and without prejudice to
          the cause at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some other instances in which the evangelists honestly
          relate what they must have perceived would make against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this kind is John the Baptist&#x27;s message preserved by Saint
          Matthew (xi. 2) and Saint Luke (vii. 18): &quot;Now when John had
          heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
          and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or look we for
          another?&quot; To confess, still more to state, that John the Baptist
          had his doubts concerning the character of Jesus, could not but afford
          a handle to cavil and objection. But truth, like honesty, neglects
          appearances. The same observation, perhaps, holds concerning the
          apostacy of Judas.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * I had once placed amongst these examples of fair concession the
          remarkable words of Saint Matthew in his account of Christ&#x27;s
          appearance upon the Galilean mountain: &quot;And when they saw him
          they worshipped him; but some doubted.&quot; (Chap. xxviii. 17.) I
          have since, however, been convinced, by what is observed concerning
          this passage in Dr. Townshend&#x27;s Discourse (Page 177.) upon the
          Resurrection, that the transaction, as related by Saint Matthew, was
          really this: &quot;Christ appeared first at a distance; the greater
          part of the company, the moment they saw him, worshipped, but some as
          yet, i.e. upon this first distant view of his person, doubted;
          whereupon Christ came up to them, and spake to them,&quot;+ &amp;c.:
          that the doubt, therefore, was a doubt only at first for a moment, and
          upon his being seen at a distance, and was afterwards dispelled by his
          nearer approach, and by his entering into conversation with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          + Saint Matthew&#x27;s words are: kai proselthon o Iesous elalesen
          autois [and having come toward them, Jesus spoke]. This intimates that
          when he first appeared it was at a distance, at least from many of the
          spectators. Ib. p. 197. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          John vi. 66. &quot;From that time, many of his disciples went back,
          and walked no more with him.&quot; Was it the part of a writer who
          dealt in suppression and disguise to put down this anecdote? Or this,
          which Matthew has preserved (xii. 58)? &quot;He did not many mighty
          works there, because of their unbelief.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, in the same evangelist (v. 17, 18): &quot;Think not that I am
          come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but
          to fulfil; for, verily, I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass,
          one jot, or one tittle, shall in no wise pass from the law, till all
          be fulfilled.&quot; At the time the Gospels were written, the apparent
          tendency of Christ&#x27;s mission was to diminish the authority of the
          Mosaic code, and it was so considered by the Jews themselves. It is
          very improbable, therefore, that, without the constraint of truth,
          Matthew should have ascribed a saying to Christ, which, primo intuitu,
          militated with the judgment of the age in which his Gospel was
          written. Marcion thought this text so objectionable, that he altered
          the words, so as to invert the sense. (Lardner, Cred., vol. xv. p.
          422.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more (Acts xxv. 18): &quot;They brought none accusation against
          him of such things as I supposed; but had certain questions against
          him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus which was dead, whom
          Paul affirmed to be alive.&quot; Nothing could be more in the
          character of a Roman governor than these words. But that is not
          precisely the point I am concerned with. A mere panegyrist, or a
          dishonest narrator, would not have represented his cause, or have made
          a great magistrate represent it, in this manner, i.e. in terms not a
          little disparaging, and bespeaking, on his part, much unconcern and
          indifference about the matter. The same observation may be repeated of
          the speech which is ascribed to Gallio (Acts xviii. 15): &quot;If it
          be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for
          I will be no judge of such matters.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, where do we discern a stronger mark of candour, or less
          disposition to extol and magnify, than in the conclusion of the same
          history? in which the evangelist, after relating that Paul, on his
          first arrival at Rome, preached to the Jews from morning until
          evening, adds, &quot;And some believed the things which were spoken,
          and some believed not.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The following, I think, are passages which were very unlikely to have
          presented themselves to the mind of a forger or a fabulist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matt. xxi. 21. &quot;Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say
          unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this
          which is done unto the fig-tree, but also, if ye shall say unto this
          mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou east into the sea, it shall be
          done; all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, it
          shall be done.&quot; (See also chap. xvii. 20. Luke xvii. 6.) It
          appears to me very improbable that these words should have been put
          into Christ&#x27;s mouth, if he had not actually spoken them. The term
          &quot;faith,&quot; as here used, is perhaps rightly interpreted of
          confidence in that internal notice by which the apostles were
          admonished of their power to perform any particular miracle. And this
          exposition renders the sense of the text more easy. But the words
          undoubtedly, in their obvious construction, carry with them a
          difficulty which no writer would have brought upon himself
          officiously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke ix. 59. &quot;And he said unto another, Follow me: but he said,
          Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him,
          Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of
          God.&quot; (See also Matt. viii. 21.) This answer, though very
          expressive of the transcendent importance of religious concerns, was
          apparently harsh and repulsive; and such as would not have been made
          for Christ if he had not really used it. At least some other instance
          would bare been chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following passage, I, for the same reason, think impossible to
          have been the production of artifice, or of a cold forgery:—&quot;But
          I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a
          cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to
          his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; but whosoever
          shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire
          (Gehennae).&quot; Matt. v. 22. It is emphatic, cogent, and well
          calculated for the purpose of impression; but is inconsistent with the
          supposition of art or wariness on the part of the relator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The short reply of our Lord to Mary Magdalen, after his resurrection
          (John xx. 16, 17), &quot;Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended unto
          my Father,&quot; in my opinion must have been founded in a reference
          or allusion to some prior conversation, for the want of knowing which
          his meaning is hidden from us. This very obscurity, however, is a
          proof of genuineness. No one would have forged such an answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          John vi. The whole of the conversation recorded in this chapter is in
          the highest degree unlikely to be fabricated, especially the part of
          our Saviour&#x27;s reply between the fiftieth and the fifty-eighth
          verse. I need only put down the first sentence: &quot;I am the living
          bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread he
          shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give him is my flesh,
          which I will give for the life of the world.&quot; Without calling in
          question the expositions that have been given of this passage, we may
          be permitted to say, that it labours under an obscurity, in which it
          is impossible to believe that any one, who made speeches for the
          persons of his narrative, would have voluntarily involved them. That
          this discourse was obscure, even at the time, is confessed by the
          writer who had preserved it, when he tells us, at the conclusion, that
          many of our Lord&#x27;s disciples, when they had heard this, said,
          &quot;This is a hard saying; who can hear it?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ&#x27;s taking of a young child, and placing it in the midst of
          his contentious disciples (Matt. xviii. 2), though as decisive a proof
          as any could be of the benignity of his temper, and very expressive of
          the character of the religion which he wished to inculcate, was not by
          any means an obvious thought. Nor am I acquainted with anything in any
          ancient writing which resembles it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The account of the institution of the eucharist bears strong internal
          marks of genuineness. If it had been feigned, it would have been more
          full; it would have come nearer to the actual mode of celebrating the
          rite as that mode obtained very early in the Christian churches; and
          it would have been more formal than it is. In the forged piece called
          the Apostolic Constitutions, the apostles are made to enjoin many
          parts of the ritual which was in use in the second and third
          centuries, with as much particularity as a modern rubric could have
          done. Whereas, in the history of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, as we read it
          in Saint Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, there is not so much as the command to
          repeat it. This, surely, looks like undesignedness. I think also that
          the difficulty arising from the conciseness of Christ&#x27;s
          expression, &quot;This is my body,&quot; would have been avoided in a
          made-up story. I allow that the explication of these words given by
          Protestants is satisfactory; but it is deduced from a diligent
          comparison of the words in question with forms of expression used in
          Scripture, and especially by Christ upon other occasions. No writer
          would arbitrarily and unnecessarily have thus cast in his
          reader&#x27;s way a difficulty which, to say the least, it required
          research and erudition to clear up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it ought to be observed that the argument which is built upon
          these examples extends both to the authenticity of the books, and to
          the truth of the narrative; for it is improbable that the forger of a
          history in the name of another should have inserted such passages into
          it: and it is improbable, also, that the persons whose names the books
          hear should have fabricated such passages; or even have allowed them a
          place in their work, if they had not believed them to express the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following observation, therefore, of Dr. Lardner, the most candid
          of all advocates, and the most cautious of all inquirers, seems to be
          well founded:—&quot;Christians are induced to believe the writers of
          the Gospel by observing the evidences of piety and probity that appear
          in their writings, in which there is no deceit, or artifice, or
          cunning, or design.&quot; &quot;No remarks,&quot; as Dr. Beattie hath
          properly said, &quot;are thrown in to anticipate objections; nothing
          of that caution which never fails to distinguish the testimony of
          those who are conscious of imposture; no endeavour to reconcile the
          reader&#x27;s mind to what may be extraordinary in the
          narrative.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I beg leave to cite also another author, (Duchal, pp. 97, 98.) who has
          well expressed the reflection which the examples now brought forward
          were intended to suggest. &quot;It doth not appear that ever it came
          into the mind of these writers to consider how this or the other
          action would appear to mankind, or what objections might be raised
          upon them. But without at all attending to this, they lay the facts
          before you, at no pains to think whether they would appear credible or
          not. If the reader will not believe their testimony, there is no help
          for it: they tell the truth and attend to nothing else. Surely this
          looks like sincerity, and that they published nothing to the world but
          that they believed themselves.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          As no improper supplement to this chapter, I crave a place here for
          observing the extreme naturalness of some of the things related in the
          New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark ix. 23. &quot;Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all
          things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father
          of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help
          thou mine unbelief.&quot; This struggle in the father&#x27;s heart,
          between solicitude for the preservation of his child, and a kind of
          involuntary distrust of Christ&#x27;s power to heal him, is here
          expressed with an air of reality which could hardly be counterfeited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again (Matt. xxi. 9), the eagerness of the people to introduce Christ
          into Jerusalem, and their demand, a short time afterwards, of his
          crucifixion, when he did not turn out what they expected him to be, so
          far from affording matter of objection, represents popular favour in
          exact agreement with nature and with experience, as the flux and
          reflux of a wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rulers and Pharisees rejecting Christ, whilst many of the common
          people received him, was the effect which, in the then state of Jewish
          prejudices, I should have expected. And the reason with which they who
          rejected Christ&#x27;s mission kept themselves in countenance, and
          with which also they answered the arguments of those who favoured it,
          is precisely the reason which such men usually give:—&quot;Have any of
          the Scribes or Pharisees believed on him?&quot; (John vii. 48.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In our Lord&#x27;s conversation at the well (John iv. 29), Christ had
          surprised the Samaritan woman with an allusion to a single particular
          in her domestic situation, &quot;Thou hast had five husbands; and he
          whom thou now hast is not thy husband.&quot; The woman, soon after
          this, ran back to the city, and called out to her neighbours,
          &quot;Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.&quot;
          This exaggeration appears to me very natural; especially in the
          hurried state of spirits into which the woman may be supposed to have
          been thrown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lawyer&#x27;s subtilty in running a distinction upon the word
          neighbour, in the precept, &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
          thyself,&quot; was no less natural than our Saviour&#x27;s answer was
          decisive and satisfactory. (Luke x. 20.) The lawyer of the New
          Testament, it must be observed, was a Jewish divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behaviour of Gallio (Acts xviii. 12-17), and of Festus (xxv. 18,
          19), have been observed upon already.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consistency of Saint Paul&#x27;s character throughout the whole of
          his history (viz. the warmth and activity of his zeal, first against,
          and then for, Christianity) carries with it very much of the
          appearance of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also some properties, as they may be called, observable in
          the Gospels; that is, circumstances separately suiting with the
          situation, character, and intention of their respective authors.

          Saint Matthew, who was an inhabitant of Galilee, and did not join
          Christ&#x27;s society until some time after Christ had come into
          Galilee to preach, has given us very little of his history prior to
          that period. Saint John, who had been converted before, and who wrote
          to supply omissions in the other Gospels, relates some remarkable
          particulars which had taken place before Christ left Judea, to go into
          Galilee. (Hartley&#x27;s Observations, vol. ii. p. 103.)

          Saint Matthew (xv. 1) has recorded the cavil of the Pharisees against
          the disciples of Jesus, for eating &quot;with unclean hands.&quot;
          Saint Mark has also (vii. 1) recorded the same transaction (taken
          probably from Saint Matthew), but with this addition: &quot;For the
          Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands often, eat
          not, holding the tradition of the elders: and when they come from the
          market, except they wash, they eat not: and many other things there be
          which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups and pots,
          brazen vessels, and of tables.&quot; Now Saint Matthew was not only a
          Jew himself, but it is evident, from the whole structure of his
          Gospel, especially from his numerous references to the Old Testament,
          that he wrote for Jewish readers. The above explanation, therefore, in
          him, would have been unnatural, as not being wanted by the readers
          whom he addressed. But in Mark, who, whatever use he might make of
          Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, intended his own narrative for a general
          circulation, and who himself travelled to distant countries in the
          service of the religion, it was properly added.
