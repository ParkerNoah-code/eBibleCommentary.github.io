        <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the history, of which the last chapter contains an abstract, there
          are a few observations which it may be proper to make, by way of
          applying its testimony to the particular propositions for which we
          contend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Although our Scripture history leaves the general account of the
          apostles in an early part of the narrative, and proceeds with the
          separate account of one particular apostle, yet the information which
          it delivers so far extends to the rest, as it shows the nature of the
          service. When we see one apostle suffering persecution in the
          discharge of this commission, we shall not believe, without evidence,
          that the same office could, at the same time, be attended with ease
          and safety to others. And this fair and reasonable inference is
          confirmed by the direct attestation of the letters, to which we have
          so often referred. The writer of these letters not only alludes, in
          numerous passages, to his own sufferings, but speaks of the rest of
          the apostles as enduring like sufferings with himself. &quot;I think
          that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were, appointed to
          death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and
          to men; even unto this present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and
          are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place; and
          labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being
          persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat: we are made as
          the filth of the earth, and as the offscouring of all things unto this
          day.&quot; (I Cor. iv. 9, et seq.) Add to which, that in the short
          account that is given of the other apostles in the former part of the
          history, and within the short period which that account comprises, we
          find, first, two of them seized, imprisoned, brought before the
          Sanhedrim, and threatened with further punishment; (Acts iv. 3, 21.)
          then, the whole number imprisoned and beaten; (Acts v. 18, 40.) soon
          afterwards, one of their adherents stoned to death, and so hot a
          persecution raised against the sect as to drive most of them out of
          the place; a short time only succeeding, before one of the twelve was
          beheaded, and another sentenced to the same fate; and all this passing
          in the single city of Jerusalem, and within ten years after the
          Founder&#x27;s death, and the commencement of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We take no credit at present for the miraculous part of the
          narrative, nor do we insist upon the correctness of single passages of
          it. If the whole story be not a novel, a romance; the whole action a
          dream; if Peter, and James, and Paul, and the rest of the apostles
          mentioned in the account, be not all imaginary persons; if their
          letters be not all forgeries, and, what is more, forgeries of names
          and characters which never existed; then is there evidence in our
          hands sufficient to support the only fact we contend for (and which, I
          repeat again, is, in itself, highly probable), that the original
          followers of Jesus Christ exerted great endeavours to propagate his
          religion, and underwent great labours, dangers, and sufferings, in
          consequence of their undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The general reality of the apostolic history is strongly
          confirmed by the consideration, that it, in truth, does no more than
          assign adequate causes for effects which certainly were produced; and
          describe consequences naturally resulting from situations which
          certainly existed. The effects were certainly there, of which this
          history sets forth the cause, and origin, and progress. It is
          acknowledged on all hands, because it is recorded by other testimony
          than that of the Christians themselves, that the religion began to
          prevail at that time, and in that country. It is very difficult to
          conceive how it could begin without the exertions of the Founder and
          his followers, in propagating the new persuasion. The history now in
          our hands describes these exertions, the persons employed, the means
          and endeavours made use of, and the labours undertaken in the
          prosecution of this purpose. Again, the treatment which the history
          represents the first propagators of the religion to have experienced
          was no other than what naturally resulted from the situation in which
          they were confessedly placed. It is admitted that the religion was
          adverse, in great degree, to the reigning opinions, and to the hopes
          and wishes of the nation to which it was first introduced; and that it
          overthrew, so far as it was received, the established theology and
          worship of every other country. We cannot feel much reluctance in
          believing that when the messengers of such a system went about not
          only publishing their opinions, but collecting proselytes, and forming
          regular societies of proselytes, they should meet with opposition in
          their attempts, or that this opposition should sometimes proceed to
          fatal extremities. Our history details examples of this opposition,
          and of the sufferings and dangers which the emissaries of the religion
          underwent, perfectly agreeable to what might reasonably be expected,
          from the nature of their undertaking, compared with the character of
          the age and country in which it was carried on.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The records before us supply evidence of what formed another
          member of our general proposition, and what, as hath already been
          observed, is highly probable, and almost a necessary consequence of
          their new profession, viz., that, together with activity and courage
          in propagating the religion, the primitive followers of Jesus assumed,
          upon their conversion, a new and peculiar course of private life.
          Immediately after their Master was withdrawn from them, we hear of
          their &quot;continuing with one accord in prayer and
          supplication;&quot; (Acts i. 14.) of their &quot;continuing daily with
          one accord in the temple&quot; (Acts ii. 46.) Of &quot;many being
          gathered together praying.&quot; (Acts xii. 12.) We know that strict
          instructions were laid upon the converts by their teachers. Wherever
          they came, the first word of their preaching was, &quot;Repent!&quot;
          We know that these injunctions obliged them to refrain from many
          species of licentiousness, which were not, at that time, reputed
          criminal. We know the rules of purity, and the maxims of benevolence,
          which Christians read in their books; concerning which rules it is
          enough to observe, that, if they were, I will not say completely
          obeyed, but in any degree regarded, they could produce a system of
          conduct, and, what is more difficult to preserve, a disposition of
          mind, and a regulation of affections, different from anything to which
          they had hitherto been accustomed, and different from what they would
          see in others. The change and distinction of manners, which resulted
          from their new character, is perpetually referred to in the letters of
          their teachers. &quot;And you hath he quickened, who were dead in
          trespasses and sins, wherein in times past ye walked, according to the
          course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air,
          the Spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; among
          whom also we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of
          our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind, and
          were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.&quot; (Eph. ii
          1-3. See also Tit. iii. 3.)—&quot;For the time past of our life may
          suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in
          lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and
          abominable idolatries; wherein they think it strange that ye run not
          with them to the same excess of riot.&quot; (1 Pet. iv. 3, 4.) Saint
          Paul, in his first letter to the Corinthians, after enumerating, as
          his manner was, a catalogue of vicious characters, adds, &quot;Such
          were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified.&quot; (1
          Cor. vi. 11.) In like manner, and alluding to the same change of
          practices and sentiments, he asked the Roman Christians, &quot;what
          fruit they had in those things, whereof they are now ashamed?&quot;
          (Rom. vi. 21.) The phrases which the same writer employs to describe
          the moral condition of Christians, compared with their condition
          before they became Christians, such as &quot;newness of life,&quot;
          being &quot;freed from sin,&quot; being &quot;dead to sin;&quot;
          &quot;the destruction of the body of sin, that, for the future, they
          should not serve sin;&quot; &quot;children of light and of the
          day,&quot; as opposed to &quot;children of darkness and of the
          night;&quot; &quot;not sleeping as others;&quot; imply, at least, a
          new system of obligation, and, probably, a new series of conduct,
          commencing with their conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The testimony which Pliny bears to the behaviour of the new sect in
          his time, and which testimony comes not more than fifty years after
          that of St. Paul, is very applicable to the subject under
          consideration. The character which this writer gives of the Christians
          of that age, and which was drawn from a pretty accurate inquiry,
          because he considered their moral principles as the point in which the
          magistrate was interested, is as follows:—He tells the emperor,
          &quot;that some of those who had relinquished the society, or who, to
          save themselves, pretended that they had relinquished it, affirmed
          that they were wont to meet together on a stated day, before it was
          light, and sang among themselves alternately a hymn to Christ as a
          God; and to bind themselves by an oath, not to the commission of any
          wickedness, but that they would not be guilty of theft, or robbery, or
          adultery; that they would never falsify their word, or deny a pledge
          committed to them, when called upon to return it.&quot; This proves
          that a morality, more pure and strict than was ordinary, prevailed at
          that time in Christian societies. And to me it appears, that we are
          authorised to carry his testimony back to the age of the apostles;
          because it is not probable that the immediate hearers and disciples of
          Christ were more relaxed than their successors in Pliny&#x27;s time,
          or the missionaries of the religion than those whom they taught.
