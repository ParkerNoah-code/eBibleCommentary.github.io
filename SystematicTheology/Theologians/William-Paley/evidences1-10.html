        <h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
        <p>RECAPITULATION.</p>
        <p>
          The reader will now be pleased to recollect, that the two points which
          form the subject of our present discussion are, first, that the
          Founder of Christianity, his associates, and immediate followers,
          passed their lives in labours, dangers, and sufferings; secondly, that
          they did so in attestation of the miraculous history recorded in our
          Scriptures, and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of
          that history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument, by which these two propositions have been maintained by
          us, stands thus:
        </p>
        <p>
          No historical fact, I apprehend, is more certain, than that the
          original propagators of Christianity voluntarily subjected themselves
          to lives of fatigue, danger, and suffering, in the prosecution of
          their undertaking. The nature of the undertaking; the character of the
          persons employed in it; the opposition of their tenets to the fixed
          opinions and expectations of the country in which they first advanced
          them; their undissembled condemnation of the religion of all other
          countries; their total want of power, authority, or forceâ€”render it in
          the highest degree probable that this must have been the case. The
          probability is increased by what we know of the fate of the Founder of
          the institution, who was put to death for his attempt; and by what we
          also know of the cruel treatment of the converts to the institution,
          within thirty years after its commencement: both which points are
          attested by heathen writers, and, being once admitted, leave it very
          incredible that the primitive emissaries of the religion, who
          exercised their ministry, first, amongst the people who had destroyed
          their Master, and, afterwards, amongst those who persecuted their
          converts, should themselves escape with impunity, or pursue their
          purpose in ease and safety. This probability, thus sustained by
          foreign testimony, is advanced, I think, to historical certainty, by
          the evidence of our own books; by the accounts of a writer who was the
          companion of the persons whose sufferings he relates; by the letters
          of the persons themselves by predictions of persecutions ascribed to
          the Founder of the religion, which predictions would not have been
          inserted in his history, much less have been studiously dwelt upon, if
          they had not accorded with the event, and which, even if falsely
          ascribed to him, could only have been so ascribed, because the event
          suggested them; lastly, by incessant exhortations to fortitude and
          patience, and by an earnestness, repetition, and urgency upon the
          subject, which were unlikely to have appeared if there had not been,
          at the time, some extraordinary call for the exercise of these
          virtues.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is made out also, I think, with sufficient evidence, that both the
          teachers and converts of the religion, in consequence of their new
          profession, took up a new course of life and behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next great question is, what they did this FOR. That it was for a
          miraculous story of some kind or other, is to my apprehension
          extremely manifest; because, as to the fundamental article, the
          designation of the person, viz. that this particular person, Jesus of
          Nazareth, ought to be received as the Messiah, or as a messenger from
          God, they neither had, nor could have, anything but miracles to stand
          upon. That the exertions and sufferings of the apostles were for the
          story which we have now, is proved by the consideration that this
          story is transmitted to us by two of their own number, and by two
          others personally connected with them; that the particularity of the
          narrative proves that the writers claimed to possess circumstantial
          information, that from their situation they had full opportunity of
          acquiring such information, that they certainly, at least, knew what
          their colleagues, their companions, their masters taught; that each of
          these books contains enough to prove the truth of the religion; that
          if any one of them therefore be genuine, it is sufficient; that the
          genuineness, however, of all of them is made out, as well by the
          general arguments which evince the genuineness of the most undisputed
          remains of antiquity, as also by peculiar and specific proofs, viz. by
          citations from them in writings belonging to a period immediately
          contiguous to that in which they were published; by the distinguished
          regard paid by early Christians to the authority of these books;
          (which regard was manifested by their collecting of them into a
          volume, appropriating to that volume titles of peculiar respect,
          translating them into various languages, digesting them into
          harmonies, writing commentaries upon them, and, still more
          conspicuously, by the reading of them in their public assemblies in
          all parts of the world) by an universal agreement with respect to
          these books, whilst doubts were entertained concerning some others; by
          contending sects appealing to them; by the early adversaries of the
          religion not disputing their genuineness, but, on the contrary,
          treating them as the depositaries of the history upon which the
          religion was founded; by many formal catalogues of these, as of
          certain and authoritative writings, published in different and distant
          parts of the Christian world; lastly, by the absence or defect of the
          above-cited topics of evidence, when applied to any other histories of
          the same subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are strong arguments to prove that the books actually proceeded
          from the authors whose names they bear (and have always borne, for
          there is not a particle of evidence to show that they ever went under
          any other); but the strict genuineness of the books is perhaps more
          than is necessary to the support of our proposition. For even
          supposing that, by reason of the silence of antiquity, or the loss of
          records, we knew not who were the writers of the four Gospels, yet the
          fact that they were received as authentic accounts of the transaction
          upon which the religion rested, and were received as such by
          Christians at or near the age of the apostles, by those whom the
          apostles had taught, and by societies which the apostles had founded;
          this fact, I say, connected with the consideration that they are
          corroborative of each other&#x27;s testimony, and that they are
          further corroborated by another contemporary history taking up the
          story where they had left it, and, in a narrative built upon that
          story, accounting for the rise and production of changes in the world,
          the effects of which subsist at this day; connected, moreover, with
          the confirmation which they receive from letters written by the
          apostles themselves, which both assume the same general story, and, as
          often as occasions lead them to do so, allude to particular parts of
          it; and connected also with the reflection, that if the apostles
          delivered any different story it is lost; (the present and no other
          being referred to by a series of Christian writers, down from their
          age to our own; being like-wise recognised in a variety of
          institutions, which prevailed early and universally, amongst the
          disciples of the religion;) and that so great a change as the oblivion
          of one story and the substitution of another, under such
          circumstances, could not have taken place: this evidence would be
          deemed, I apprehend, sufficient to prove concerning these books, that,
          whoever were the authors of them, they exhibit the story which the
          apostles told, and for which, consequently, they acted and they
          suffered.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be so, the religion must be true. These men could not be
          deceivers. By only not bearing testimony, they might have avoided all
          these sufferings, and have lived quietly. Would men in such
          circumstances pretend to have seen what they never saw; assert facts
          which they had no knowledge of; go about lying to teach virtue; and,
          though not only convinced of Christ&#x27;s being an impostor, but
          having seen the success of his imposture in his crucifixion, yet
          persist in carrying it on; and so persist, as to bring upon themselves
          for nothing, and with a full knowledge of the consequence, enmity and
          hatred, danger and death?
