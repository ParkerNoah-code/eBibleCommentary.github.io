        <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original
          witnesses of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we consider, first, the prevalency of the religion at this hour;
          secondly, the only credible account which can be given of its origin,
          viz. the activity of the Founder and his associates; thirdly, the
          opposition which that activity must naturally have excited; fourthly,
          the fate of the Founder of the religion, attested by heathen writers,
          as well as our own; fifthly, the testimony of the same writers to the
          sufferings of Christians, either contemporary with, or immediately
          succeeding, the original settlers of the institution; sixthly,
          predictions of the suffering of his followers ascribed to the Founder
          of the religion, which ascription alone proves, either that such
          predictions were delivered and fulfilled, or that the writers of
          Christ&#x27;s life were induced by the event to attribute such
          predictions to him; seventhly, letters now in our possession, written
          by some of the principal agents in the transaction, referring
          expressly to extreme labours, dangers, and sufferings, sustained by
          themselves and their companions; lastly, a history purporting to be
          written by a fellow-traveller of one of the new teachers, and, by its
          unsophisticated correspondency with letters of that person still
          extant, proving itself to be written by some one well acquainted with
          the subject of the narrative, which history contains accounts of
          travels, persecutions, and martyrdoms, answering to what the former
          reasons lead us to expect: when we lay together these considerations,
          which taken separately are, I think correctly such as I have stated
          them in the preceding chapters, there cannot much doubt remain upon
          our minds but that a number of persons at that time appeared in the
          world, publicly advancing an extraordinary story, and for the sake of
          propagating the belief of that story, voluntarily incurring great
          personal dangers, traversing seas and kingdoms, exerting great
          industry, and sustaining great extremities of ill usage and
          persecution. It is also proved that the same persons, in consequence
          of their persuasion, or pretended persuasion, of the truth of what
          they asserted, entered upon a course of life in many respects new and
          singular.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the clear and acknowledged parts of the case, I think it to be
          likewise in the highest degree probable, that the story for which
          these persons voluntarily exposed themselves to the fatigues and
          hardships which they endured was a miraculous story; I mean, that they
          pretended to miraculous evidence of some kind or other. They had
          nothing else to stand upon. The designation of the person, that is to
          say, that Jesus of Nazareth, rather than any other person, was the
          Messiah, and as such the subject of their ministry, could only be
          founded upon supernatural tokens attributed to him. Here were no
          victories, no conquests, no revolutions, no surprising elevation of
          fortune, no achievements of valour, of strength, or of policy, to
          appeal to; no discoveries in any art or science, no great efforts of
          genius or learning to produce. A Galilean peasant was announced to the
          world as a divine lawgiver. A young man of mean condition, of a
          private and simple life, and who had wrought no deliverance for the
          Jewish nation, was declared to be their Messiah. This, without
          ascribing to him at the same time some proofs of his mission, (and
          what other but supernatural proofs could there be?) was too absurd a
          claim to be either imagined, or attempted, or credited. In whatever
          degree, or in whatever part, the religion was argumentative, when it
          came to the question, &quot;Is the carpenter&#x27;s son of Nazareth
          the person whom we are to receive and obey?&quot; there was nothing
          but the miracles attributed to him by which his pretensions could be
          maintained for a moment. Every controversy and every question must
          presuppose these: for, however such controversies, when they did
          arise, might and naturally would, be discussed upon their own grounds
          of argumentation, without citing the miraculous evidence which had
          been asserted to attend the Founder of the religion (which would have
          been to enter upon another, and a more general question), yet we are
          to bear in mind, that without previously supposing the existence or
          the pretence of such evidence, there could have been no place for the
          discussion of the argument at all. Thus, for example, whether the
          prophecies, which the Jews interpreted to belong to the Messiah, were
          or were not applicable to the history of Jesus of Nazareth, was a
          natural subject of debate in those times; and the debate would proceed
          without recurring at every turn to his miracles, because it set out
          with supposing these; inasmuch as without miraculous marks and tokens
          (real or pretended), or without some such great change effected by his
          means in the public condition of the country, as might have satisfied
          the then received interpretation of these prophecies, I do not see how
          the question could ever have been entertained. Apollos, we read,
          &quot;mightily convinced the Jews, showing by the Scriptures that
          Jesus was Christ;&quot; (Acts xviii. 28.) but unless Jesus had
          exhibited some distinction of his person, some proof of supernatural
          power, the argument from the old Scriptures could have had no place.
          It had nothing to attach upon. A young man calling himself the Son of
          God, gathering a crowd about him, and delivering to them lectures of
          morality, could not have excited so much as a doubt among the Jews,
          whether he was the object in whom a long series of ancient prophecies
          terminated, from the completion of which they had formed such
          magnificent expectations, and expectations of a nature so opposite to
          what appeared; I mean no such doubt could exist when they had the
          whole case before them, when they saw him put to death for his
          officiousness, and when by his death the evidence concerning him was
          closed. Again, the effect of the Messiah&#x27;s coming, supposing
          Jesus to have been he, upon Jews, upon Gentiles, upon their relation
          to each other, upon their acceptance with God, upon their duties and
          their expectations; his nature, authority, office, and agency; were
          likely to become subjects of much consideration with the early
          votaries of the religion, and to occupy their attention and writings.
          I should not however expect, that in these disquisitions, whether
          preserved in the form of letters, speeches, or set treatises, frequent
          or very direct mention of his miracles would occur. Still, miraculous
          evidence lay at the bottom of the argument. In the primary question,
          miraculous pretensions and miraculous pretensions alone, were what
          they had to rely upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the original story was miraculous, is very fairly also inferred
          from the miraculous powers which were laid claim to by the Christians
          of succeeding ages. If the accounts of these miracles be true, it was
          a continuation of the same powers; if they be false, it was an
          imitation, I will not say of what had been wrought, but of what had
          been reported to have been wrought, by those who preceded them. That
          imitation should follow reality, fiction should be grafted upon truth;
          that, if miracles were performed at first, miracles should be
          pretended afterwards; agrees so well with the ordinary course of human
          affairs, that we can have no great difficulty in believing it. The
          contrary supposition is very improbable, namely, that miracles should
          be pretended to by the followers of the apostles and first emissaries
          of the religion, when none were pretended to, either in their own
          persons or that of their Master, by these apostles and emissaries
          themselves.
