        <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
        <p>
          But they with whom we argue have undoubtedly a right to select their
          own examples. The instances with which Mr. Hume has chosen to confront
          the miracles of the New Testament, and which, therefore, we are
          entitled to regard as the strongest which the history of the world
          could supply to the inquiries of a very acute and learned adversary,
          are the three following:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The cure of a blind and of a lame man of Alexandria, by the emperor
          Vespasian, as related by Tacitus;
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The restoration of the limb of an attendant in a Spanish church,
          as told by Cardinal de Retz; and,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The cures said to be performed at the tomb of the abbe Paris in
          the early part of the eighteenth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The narrative of Tacitus is delivered in these terms: &quot;One of
          the common people of Alexandria, known to be diseased in his eyes, by
          the admonition of the god Serapis, whom that superstitious nation
          worship above all other gods, prostrated himself before the emperor,
          earnestly imploring from him a remedy for his blindness, and
          entreating that he would deign to anoint with his spittle his cheeks
          and the balls of his eyes. Another, diseased in his hand, requested,
          by the admonition of the same god, that he might be touched by the
          foot of the emperor. Vespasian at first derided and despised their
          application; afterwards, when they continued to urge their petitions,
          he sometimes appeared to dread the imputation of vanity; at other
          times, by the earnest supplication of the patients, and the persuasion
          of his flatterers, to be induced to hope for success. At length he
          commanded an inquiry to be made by the physicians, whether such a
          blindness and debility were vincible by human aid. The report of the
          physicians contained various points: that in the one, the power of
          vision was not destroyed, but would return if the obstacles were
          removed; that in the other, the diseased joints might be restored, if
          a healing power were applied; that it was, perhaps, agreeable to the
          gods to do this; that the emperor was elected by divine assistance;
          lastly, that the credit of the success would be the emperor&#x27;s,
          the ridicule of the disappointment would fall upon the patients.
          Vespasian believing that everything was in the power of his fortune,
          and that nothing was any longer incredible, whilst the multitude which
          stood by eagerly expected the event, with a countenance expressive of
          joy, executed what he was desired to do. Immediately the hand was
          restored to its use, and light returned to the blind man. They who
          were present relate both these cures, even at this time, when there is
          nothing to be gained by lying.&quot; (Tacit. Hist. lib. iv.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, though Tacitus wrote this account twenty-seven years after the
          miracle is said to have been performed, and wrote at Rome of what
          passed at Alexandria, and wrote also from report; and although it does
          not appear that he had examined the story or that he believed it, (but
          rather the contrary,) yet I think his testimony sufficient to prove
          that such a transaction took place: by which I mean, that the two men
          in question did apply to Vespasian; that Vespasian did touch the
          diseased in the manner related; and that a cure was reported to have
          followed the operation. But the affair labours under a strong and just
          suspicion, that the whole of it was a concerted imposture brought
          about by collusion between the patients, the physician, and the
          emperor. This solution is probable, because there was everything to
          suggest, and everything to facilitate such a scheme. The miracle was
          calculated to confer honour upon the emperor, and upon the god
          Serapis. It was achieved in the midst of the emperor&#x27;s flatterers
          and followers; in a city and amongst a populace before-hand devoted to
          his interest, and to the worship of the god: where it would have been
          treason and blasphemy together to have contradicted the fame of the
          cure, or even to have questioned it. And what is very observable in
          the account is, that the report of the physicians is just such a
          report as would have been made of a case in which no external marks of
          the disease existed, and which, consequently, was capable of being
          easily counterfeited; viz. that in the first of the patients the
          organs of vision were not destroyed, that the weakness of the second
          was in his joints. The strongest circumstance in Tacitus&#x27;s
          narration is, that the first patient was &quot;notus tabe
          oculorum,&quot; remarked or notorious for the disease in his eyes. But
          this was a circumstance which might have found its way into the story
          in its progress from a distant country, and during an interval of
          thirty years; or it might be true that the malady of the eyes was
          notorious, yet that the nature and degree of the disease had never
          been ascertained; a case by no means uncommon. The emperor&#x27;s
          reserve was easily affected: or it is possible he might not be in the
          secret. There does not seem to be much weight in the observation of
          Tacitus, that they who were present continued even then to relate the
          story when there was nothing to be gained by the lie. It only proves
          that those who had told the story for many years persisted in it. The
          state of mind of the witnesses and spectators at the time is the point
          to be attended to. Still less is there of pertinency in Mr.
          Hume&#x27;s eulogium on the cautious and penetrating genius of the
          historian; for it does not appear that the historian believed it. The
          terms in which he speaks of Serapis, the deity to whose interposition
          the miracle was attributed, scarcely suffer us to suppose that Tacitus
          thought the miracle to be real: &quot;by the admonition of the god
          Serapis, whom that superstitious nation (dedita superstitionibus gens)
          worship above all other gods.&quot; To have brought this supposed
          miracle within the limits of comparison with the miracles of Christ,
          it ought to have appeared that a person of a low and private station,
          in the midst of enemies, with the whole power of the country opposing
          him, with every one around him prejudiced or interested against his
          claims and character, pretended to perform these cures, and required
          the spectators, upon the strength of what they saw, to give up their
          firmest hopes and opinions, and follow him through a life of trial and
          danger; that many were so moved as to obey his call, at the expense
          both of every notion in which they had been brought up, and of their
          ease, safety, and reputation; and that by these beginnings a change
          was produced in the world, the effects of which remain to this day: a
          case, both in its circumstances and consequences, very unlike anything
          we find in Tacitus&#x27;s relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The story taken from the Memoirs of Cardinal de Retz, which is the
          second example alleged by Mr. Hume, is this: &quot;In the church of
          Saragossa in Spain, the canons showed me a man whose business it was
          to light the lamps; telling me, that he had been several years at the
          gate with one leg only. I saw him with two.&quot; (Liv. iv. A.D.
          1654.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is stated by Mr. Hume, that the cardinal who relates this story did
          not believe it; and it nowhere appears that he either examined the
          limb, or asked the patient, or indeed any one, a single question about
          the matter. An artificial leg, wrought with art, would be sufficient,
          in a place where no such contrivance had ever before been heard of, to
          give origin and currency to the report. The ecclesiastics of the place
          would, it is probable, favour the story, inasmuch as it advanced the
          honour of their image and church. And if they patronized it, no other
          person at Saragossa, in the middle of the last century, would care to
          dispute it. The story likewise coincided not less with the wishes and
          preconceptions of the people than with the interests of their
          ecclesiastical rulers: so that there was prejudice backed by
          authority, and both operating upon extreme ignorance, to account for
          the success of the imposture. If, as I have suggested, the contrivance
          of an artificial limb was then new, it would not occur to the cardinal
          himself to suspect it; especially under the carelessness of mind with
          which he heard the tale, and the little inclination he felt to
          scrutinize or expose its fallacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The miracles related to have been wrought at the tomb of the abbe
          Paris admit in general of this solution. The patients who frequented
          the tomb were so affected by their devotion, their expectation, the
          place, the solemnity, and, above all, by the sympathy of the
          surrounding multitude, that many of them were thrown into violent
          convulsions, which convulsions, in certain instances, produced a
          removal of disorder, depending upon obstruction. We shall, at this
          day, have the less difficulty in admitting the above account, because
          it is the very same thing as hath lately been experienced in the
          operations of animal magnetism: and the report of the French
          physicians upon that mysterious remedy is very applicable to the
          present consideration, viz. that the pretenders to the art, by working
          upon the imaginations of their patients, were frequently able to
          produce convulsions; that convulsions so produced are amongst the most
          powerful, but, at the same time, most uncertain and unmanageable
          applications to the human frame which can be employed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Circumstances which indicate this explication, in the case of the
          Parisian miracles, are the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They were tentative. Out of many thousand sick, infirm, and
          diseased persons who resorted to the tomb, the professed history of
          the miracles contains only nine cures.
        </p>
        <p>2. The convulsions at the tomb are admitted.</p>
        <p>
          3. The diseases were, for the most part, of that sort which depends
          upon inaction and obstruction, as dropsies, palsies, and some tumours.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The cures were gradual; some patients attending many days, some
          several weeks, and some several months.
        </p>
        <p>5. The cures were many of them incomplete.</p>
        <p>
          6. Others were temporary. (The reader will find these particulars
          verified in the detail, by the accurate inquiries of the present
          bishop of Sarum, in his Criterion of Miracles, p. 132, et seq.)
        </p>
        <p>
          So that all the wonder we are called upon to account for is, that out
          of an almost innumerable multitude which resorted to the tomb for the
          cure of their complaints, and many of whom were there agitated by
          strong convulsions, a very small proportion experienced a beneficial
          change in their constitution, especially in the action of the nerves
          and glands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the cases alleged do not require that we should have recourse
          to this solution. The first case in the catalogue is scarcely
          distinguishable from the progress of a natural recovery. It was that
          of a young man who laboured under an inflammation of one eye, and had
          lost the sight of the other. The inflamed eye was relieved, but the
          blindness of the other remained. The inflammation had before been
          abated by medicine; and the young man, at the time of his attendance
          at the tomb, was using a lotion of laudanum. And, what is a still more
          material part of the case, the inflammation, after some interval,
          returned. Another case was that of a young man who had lost his sight
          by the puncture of an awl, and the discharge of the aqueous humour
          through the wound. The sight, which had been gradually returning, was
          much improved during his visit to the tomb, that is, probably in the
          same degree in which the discharged humour was replaced by fresh
          secretions. And it is observable, that these two are the only cases
          which, from their nature, should seem unlikely to be affected by
          convulsions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one material respect I allow that the Parisian miracles were
          different from those related by Tacitus, and from the Spanish miracle
          of the cardinal de Retz. They had not, like them, all the power and
          all the prejudice of the country on their side to begin with. They
          were alleged by one party against another, by the Jansenists against
          the Jesuits. These were of course opposed and examined by their
          adversaries. The consequence of which examination was that many
          falsehoods were detected, that with something really extraordinary
          much fraud appeared to be mixed. And if some of the cases upon which
          designed misrepresentation could not be charged were not at the time
          satisfactorily accounted for, it was because the efficacy of strong
          spasmodic affections was not then sufficiently known. Finally, the
          cause of Jansenism did not rise by the miracles, but sunk, although
          the miracles had the anterior persuasion of all the numerous adherents
          of that cause to set out with.
        </p>
        <p>
          These, let us remember, are the strongest examples which the history
          of ages supplies. In none of them was the miracle unequivocal; by none
          of them were established prejudices and persuasions overthrown; of
          none of them did the credit make its way, in opposition to authority
          and power; by none of them were many induced to commit themselves, and
          that in contradiction to prior opinions, to a life of mortification,
          danger, and sufferings; none were called upon to attest them at the
          expense of their fortunes and safety.*
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * It may be thought that the historian of the Parisian miracles, M.
          Montgeron, forms an exception to this last assertion. He presented his
          book (with a suspicion, as it should seem, of the danger of what he
          was doing) to the king; and was shortly afterwards committed to
          prison; from which he never came out. Had the miracles been
          unequivocal, and had M. Montgeron been originally convinced by them, I
          should have allowed this exception. It would have stood, I think,
          alone in the argument of our adversaries. But, beside what has been
          observed of the dubious nature of the miracles, the account which M.
          Montgeron has himself left of his conversion shows both the state of
          his mind and that his persuasion was not built upon external
          miracles.—&quot;Scarcely had he entered the churchyard when he was
          struck,&quot; he tells us, &quot;with awe and reverence, having never
          before heard prayers pronounced with so much ardour and transport as
          he observed amongst the supplicants at the tomb. Upon this, throwing
          himself on his knees, resting his elbows on the tombstone and covering
          his face with his hands, he spake the following prayer. O thou, by
          whose intercession so many miracles are said to be performed, if it be
          true that a part of thee surviveth the grave, and that thou hast
          influence with the Almighty, have pity on the darkness of my
          understanding, and through his mercy obtain the removal of it.&quot;
          Having prayed thus, &quot;many thoughts,&quot; as he sayeth,
          &quot;began to open themselves to his mind; and so profound was his
          attention that he continued on his knees four hours, not in the least
          disturbed by the vast crowd of surrounding supplicants. During this
          time, all the arguments which he ever heard or read in favour of
          Christianity occurred to him with so much force, and seemed so strong
          and convincing, that he went home fully satisfied of the truth of
          religion in general, and of the holiness and power of that person
          who,&quot; as he supposed, &quot;had engaged the Divine Goodness to
          enlighten his understanding so suddenly.&quot; (Douglas&#x27;s Crit of
          Mir. p. 214.)
