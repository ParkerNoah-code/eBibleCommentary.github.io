        <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
        <p>UNDESIGNED COINCIDENCES.</p>
        <p>
          Between the letters which bear the name of Saint Paul in our
          collection and his history in the Acts of the Apostles there exist
          many notes of correspondency. The simple perusal of the writings is
          sufficient to prove that neither the history was taken from the
          letters, nor the letters from the history. And the undesignedness of
          the agreements (which undesignedness is gathered from their latency,
          their minuteness, their obliquity, the suitableness of the
          circumstances in which they consist to the places in which those
          circumstances occur, and the circuitous references by which they are
          traced out) demonstrates that they have not been produced by
          meditation, or by any fraudulent contrivance. But coincidences, from
          which these causes are excluded, and which are too close and numerous
          to be accounted for by accidental concurrences of fiction, must
          necessarily have truth for their foundation. This argument appeared to
          my mind of so much value (especially for its assuming nothing beside
          the existence of the books), that I have pursued it through Saint
          Paul&#x27;s thirteen epistles, in a work published by me four years
          ago, under the title of Horae Paulinae. I am sensible how feebly any
          argument which depends upon an induction of particulars is represented
          without examples. On which account I wished to have abridged my own
          volume, in the manner in which I have treated Dr. Lardner&#x27;s in
          the preceding chapter. But, upon making the attempt, I did not find it
          in my power to render the articles intelligible by fewer words than I
          have there used. I must be content, therefore, to refer the reader to
          the work itself. And I would particularly invite his attention to the
          observations which are made in it upon the first three epistles. I
          persuade myself that he will find the proofs, both of agreement, and
          undesignedness, supplied by these epistles, sufficient to support the
          conclusion which is there maintained, in favour both of the
          genuineness of the writings and the truth of the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          It remains only, in this place, to point out how the argument bears
          upon the general question of the Christian history.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Saint Paul in these letters affirms, in unequivocal terms, his
          own performance of miracles, and, what ought particularly to be
          remembered, &quot;That miracles were the signs of an Apostle.&quot;
          (Rom. xv. 18, 19. 2 Cor. xii. 12.) If this testimony come from Saint
          Paul&#x27;s own hand, it is invaluable. And that it does so, the
          argument before us fixes in my mind a firm assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, it shows that the series of action represented in the
          epistles of Saint Paul was real; which alone lays a foundation for the
          proposition which forms the subject of the first part of our present
          work, viz. that the original witnesses of the Christian history
          devoted themselves to lives of toil, suffering, and danger, in
          consequence of their belief of the truth of that history, and for the
          sake of communicating the knowledge of it to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, it proves that Luke, or whoever was the author of the Acts of
          the Apostles (for the argument does not depend upon the name of the
          author, though I know no reason for questioning it), was well
          acquainted with Saint Paul&#x27;s history; and that he probably was,
          what he professes himself to be, a companion of Saint Paul&#x27;s
          travels; which, if true, establishes, in a considerable degree, the
          credit even of his Gospel, because it shows that the writer, from his
          time, situation, and connexions, possessed opportunities of informing
          himself truly concerning the transactions which he relates. I have
          little difficulty in applying to the Gospel of Saint Luke what is
          proved concerning the Acts of the Apostles, considering them as two
          parts of the same history; for though there are instances of second
          parts being forgeries, I know none where the second part is genuine,
          and the first not so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will only observe, as a sequel of the argument, though not noticed
          in my work, the remarkable similitude between the style of Saint
          John&#x27;s Gospel and of Saint John&#x27;s Epistle. The style of
          Saint John&#x27;s is not at all the style of Saint Paul&#x27;s
          Epistles, though both are very singular; nor is it the style of Saint
          James&#x27;s or of Saint Peter&#x27;s Epistles: but it bears a
          resemblance to the style of the Gospel inscribed with Saint
          John&#x27;s name, so far as that resemblance can be expected to
          appear, which is not in simple narrative, so much as in reflections,
          and in the representation of discourses. Writings so circumstanced
          prove themselves, and one another, to be genuine. This correspondency
          is the more valuable, as the epistle itself asserts, in Saint
          John&#x27;s manner, indeed, but in terms sufficiently explicit, the
          writer&#x27;s personal knowledge of Christ&#x27;s history: &quot;That
          which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen
          with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,
          of the word of life; that which we have seen and heard, declare we
          unto you.&quot; (Ch. i. ver. 1â€”3.)Who would not desire, who perceives
          not the value of an account delivered by a writer so well informed as
          this?
