        <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
        <p>REJECTION OF CHRISTIANITY.</p>
        <p>
          We acknowledge that the Christian religion, although it converted
          great numbers, did not produce an universal, or even a general
          conviction in the minds of men of the age and countries in which it
          appeared. And this want of a more complete and extensive success is
          called the rejection of the Christian history and miracles; and has
          been thought by some to form a strong objection to the reality of the
          facts which the history contains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The matter of the objection divides itself into two parts; as it
          relates to the Jews, and as it relates to Heathen nations: because the
          minds of these two descriptions of men may have been, with respect to
          Christianity, under the influence of very different causes. The case
          of the Jews, inasmuch as our Saviour&#x27;s ministry was originally
          addressed to them, offers itself first to our consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now upon the subject of the truth of the Christian religion; with us
          there is but one question, viz., whether the miracles were actually
          wrought? From acknowledging the miracles, we pass instantaneously to
          the acknowledgment of the whole. No doubt lies between the premises
          and the conclusion. If we believe the works of any one of them, we
          believe in Jesus. And this order of reasoning has become so universal
          and familiar that we do not readily apprehend how it could ever have
          been otherwise. Yet it appears to me perfectly certain, that the state
          of thought in the mind of a Jew of our Saviour&#x27;s age was totally
          different from this. After allowing the reality of the miracle, he had
          a great deal to do to persuade himself that Jesus was the Messiah.
          This is clearly intimated by various passages of the Gospel history.
          It appears that, in the apprehension of the writers of the New
          Testament, the miracles did not irresistibly carry even those who saw
          them to the conclusion intended to be drawn from them; or so compel
          assent, as to leave no room for suspense, for the exercise of candour,
          or the effects of prejudice. And to this point, at least, the
          evangelists may he allowed to be good witnesses; because it is a point
          in which exaggeration or disguise would have been the other way. Their
          accounts, if they could he suspected of falsehood, would rather have
          magnified than diminished the effects of the miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          John vii. 21—31. &quot;Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done
          one work, and ye all marvel.—If a man on the Sabbath-day receive
          circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry
          at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath-day?
          Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
          Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to
          kill? But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him: do the
          rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? Howbeit we know this
          man, whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he
          is. Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
          me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but He that
          sent me is true, whom ye know not. But I know Him, for I am from Him,
          and He hath sent me. Then they sought to take him: but no man laid
          hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. And many of the
          people believed on him and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more
          miracles than those which this man hath done?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage is very observable. It exhibits the reasoning of
          different sorts of persons upon the occasion of a miracle which
          persons of all sorts are represented to have acknowledged as real. One
          sort of men thought that there was something very extraordinary in all
          this; but that still Jesus could not be the Christ, because there was
          a circumstance in his appearance which militated with an opinion
          concerning Christ in which they had been brought up, and of the truth
          of which, it is probable, they had never entertained a particle of
          doubt, viz. That &quot;when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he
          is.&quot; Another sort were inclined to believe him to be the Messiah.
          But even these did not argue as we should; did not consider the
          miracle as of itself decisive of the question; as what, if once
          allowed, excluded all further debate upon the subject; but founded
          their opinion upon a kind of comparative reasoning, &quot;When Christ
          cometh, will he do more miracles than those which this man hath
          done?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Another passage in the same evangelist, and observable for the same
          purpose, is that in which he relates the resurrection of Lazarus;
          &quot;Jesus,&quot; he tells us (xi. 43, 44), &quot;when he had thus
          spoken, cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth: and he that was
          dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face
          was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and
          let him go.&quot; One might have suspected, that at least all those
          who stood by the sepulchre, when Lazarus was raised, would have
          believed in Jesus. Yet the evangelist does not so represent
          it:—&quot;Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
          things which Jesus did, believed on him; but some of them went their
          ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.&quot;
          We cannot suppose that the evangelist meant by this account to leave
          his readers to imagine, that any of the spectators doubted about the
          truth of the miracle. Far from it. Unquestionably, he states the
          miracle to have been fully allowed; yet the persons who allowed it
          were, according to his representation, capable of retaining hostile
          sentiments towards Jesus. &quot;Believing in Jesus&quot; was not only
          to believe that he wrought miracles, but that he was the Messiah. With
          us there is no difference between these two things; with them there
          was the greatest; and the difference is apparent in this transaction.
          If Saint John has represented the conduct of the Jews upon this
          occasion truly (and why he should not I cannot tell, for it rather
          makes against him than for him), it shows clearly the principles upon
          which their judgment proceeded. Whether he has related the matter
          truly or not, the relation itself discovers the writer&#x27;s own
          opinion of those principles: and that alone possesses considerable
          authority. In the next chapter, we have a reflection of the evangelist
          entirely suited to this state of the case: &quot;But though he had
          done so many miracles before them, yet believed they not on him.&quot;
          (Chap. xii. 37.) The evangelist does not mean to impute the defect of
          their belief to any doubt about the miracles, but to their not
          perceiving, what all now sufficiently perceive, and what they would
          have perceived had not their understandings been governed by strong
          prejudices, the infallible attestation which the works of Jesus bore
          to the truth of his pretensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ninth chapter of Saint John&#x27;s Gospel contains a very
          circumstantial account of the cure of a blind man; a miracle submitted
          to all the scrutiny and examination which a sceptic could propose. If
          a modern unbeliever had drawn up the interrogatories, they could
          hardly have been more critical or searching. The account contains also
          a very curious conference between the Jewish rulers and the patient,
          in which the point for our present notice is, their resistance of the
          force of the miracle, and of the conclusion to which it led, after
          they had failed in discrediting its evidence. &quot;We know that God
          spake unto Moses, but as for this fellow, we know not whence he
          is.&quot; That was the answer which set their minds at rest. And by
          the help of much prejudice, and great unwillingness to yield, it might
          do so. In the mind of the poor man restored to sight, which was under
          no such bias, and felt no such reluctance, the miracle had its natural
          operation. &quot;Herein,&quot; says he, &quot;is a marvellous thing,
          that ye know not from whence he is, yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now
          we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper
          of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began, was
          it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
          If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.&quot; We do not find
          that the Jewish rulers had any other reply to make to this defence,
          than that which authority is sometimes apt to make to argument,
          &quot;Dost thou teach us?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          If it shall be inquired how a turn of thought, so different from what
          prevails at present, should obtain currency with the ancient Jews; the
          answer is found in two opinions which are proved to have subsisted in
          that age and country. The one was their expectation of a Messiah of a
          kind totally contrary to what the appearance of Jesus bespoke him to
          be; the other, their persuasion of the agency of demons in the
          production of supernatural effects. These opinions are not supposed by
          us for the purpose of argument, but are evidently recognised in the
          Jewish writings as well as in ours. And it ought moreover to be
          considered, that in these opinions the Jews of that age had been from
          their infancy brought up; that they were opinions, the grounds of
          which they had probably few of them inquired into, and of the truth of
          which they entertained no doubt. And I think that these two opinions
          conjointly afford an explanation of their conduct. The first put them
          upon seeking out some excuse to themselves for not receiving Jesus in
          the character in which he claimed to be received; and the second
          supplied them with just such an excuse as they wanted. Let Jesus work
          what miracles he would, still the answer was in readiness, &quot;that
          he wrought them by the assistance of Beelzebub.&quot; And to this
          answer no reply could be made, but that which our Saviour did make, by
          showing that the tendency of his mission was so adverse to the views
          with which this being was, by the objectors themselves, supposed to
          act, that it could not reasonably be supposed that he would assist in
          carrying it on. The power displayed in the miracles did not alone
          refute the Jewish solution, because the interposition of invisible
          agents being once admitted, it is impossible to ascertain the limits
          by which their efficiency is circumscribed. We of this day may be
          disposed possibly to think such opinions too absurd to have been ever
          seriously entertained. I am not bound to contend for the credibility
          of the opinions. They were at least as reasonable as the belief in
          witchcraft. They were opinions in which the Jews of that age had from
          their infancy been instructed; and those who cannot see enough in the
          force of this reason to account for their conduct towards our Saviour,
          do not sufficiently consider how such opinions may sometimes become
          very general in a country, and with what pertinacity, when once become
          so, they are for that reason alone adhered to. In the suspense which
          these notions and the prejudices resulting from them might occasion,
          the candid and docile and humble-minded would probably decide in
          Christ&#x27;s favour; the proud and obstinate, together with the giddy
          and the thoughtless, almost universally against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This state of opinion discovers to us also the reason of what some
          choose to wonder at, why the Jews should reject miracles when they saw
          them, yet rely so much upon the tradition of them in their own
          history. It does not appear that it had ever entered into the minds of
          those who lived in the time of Moses and the prophets to ascribe their
          miracles to the supernatural agency of evil being. The solution was
          not then invented. The authority of Moses and the prophets being
          established, and become the foundation of the national polity and
          religion, it was not probable that the later Jews, brought up in a
          reverence for that religion, and the subjects of that polity, should
          apply to their history a reasoning which tended to overthrow the
          foundation of both.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The infidelity of the Gentile world, and that more especially of
          men of rank and learning in it, is resolvable into a principle which,
          in my judgment, will account for the inefficacy of any argument or any
          evidence whatever, viz. contempt prior to examination. The state of
          religion amongst the Greeks and Romans had a natural tendency to
          induce this disposition. Dionysius Halicarnassensis remarks, that
          there were six hundred different kinds of religions or sacred rites
          exercised at Rome. (Jortin&#x27;s Remarks on Eccl. Hist. Vol. i. p.
          371.) The superior classes of the community treated them all as
          fables. Can we wonder, then, that Christianity was included in the
          number, without inquiry into its separate merits, or the particular
          grounds of its pretensions? It might be either true or false for
          anything they knew about it. The religion had nothing in its character
          which immediately engaged their notice. It mixed with no politics. It
          produced no fine writers. It contained no curious speculations. When
          it did reach their knowledge, I doubt not but that it appeared to them
          a very strange system,—so unphilosophical,—dealing so little in
          argument and discussion, in such arguments however and discussions as
          they were accustomed to entertain. What is said of Jesus Christ, of
          his nature, office, and ministry, would be in the highest degree alien
          from the conceptions of their theology. The Redeemer and the destined
          Judge of the human race a poor young man, executed at Jerusalem with
          two thieves upon a cross! Still more would the language in which the
          Christian doctrine was delivered be dissonant and barbarous to their
          ears. What knew they of grace, of redemption, of justification, of the
          blood of Christ shed for the sins of men, of reconcilement, of
          mediation? Christianity was made up of points they had never thought
          of; of terms which they had never heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was presented also to the imagination of the learned Heathen under
          additional disadvantage, by reason of its real, and still more of its
          nominal, connexion with Judaism. It shared in the obloquy and ridicule
          with which that people and their religion were treated by the Greeks
          and Romans. They regarded Jehovah himself only as the idol of the
          Jewish nation, and what was related of him as of a piece with what was
          told of the tutelar deities of other countries; nay, the Jews were in
          a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous race; so that
          whatever reports of a miraculous nature came out of that country were
          looked upon by the Heathen world as false and frivolous. When they
          heard of Christianity, they heard of it as a quarrel amongst this
          people about some articles of their own superstition. Despising,
          therefore, as they did, the whole system, it was not probable that
          they would enter, with any degree of seriousness or attention, into
          the detail of its disputes or the merits of either side. How little
          they knew, and with what carelessness they judged of these matters,
          appears, I think, pretty plainly from an example of no less weight
          than that of Tacitus, who, in a grave and professed discourse upon the
          history of the Jews, states that they worshipped the effigy of an ass.
          (Tacit. Hist. lib. v. c. 2.) The passage is a proof how prone the
          learned men of those times were, and upon how little evidence, to heap
          together stories which might increase the contempt and odium in which
          that people was holden. The same foolish charge is also confidently
          repeated by Plutarch. (Sympos. lib. iv. quaest. 5.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is observable that all these considerations are of a nature to
          operate with the greatest force upon the highest ranks; upon men of
          education, and that order of the public from which writers are
          principally taken: I may add also upon the philosophical as well as
          the libertine character; upon the Antonines or Julian, not less than
          upon Nero or Domitian; and, more particularly, upon that large and
          polished class of men who acquiesced in the general persuasion, that
          all they had to do was to practise the duties of morality, and to
          worship the Deity more patrio; a habit of thinking, liberal as it may
          appear, which shuts the door against every argument for a new
          religion. The considerations above mentioned would acquire also
          strength from the prejudices which men of rank and learning
          universally entertain against anything that originates with the vulgar
          and illiterate; which prejudice is known to be as obstinate as any
          prejudice whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet Christianity was still making its way: and, amidst so many
          impediments to its progress, so much difficulty in procuring audience
          and attention, its actual success is more to be wondered at, than that
          it should not have universally conquered scorn and indifference, fixed
          the levity of a voluptuous age, or, through a cloud of adverse
          prejudications, opened for itself a passage to the hearts and
          understandings of the scholars of the age.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the cause which is here assigned for the rejection of Christianity
          by men of rank and learning among the Heathens, namely, a strong
          antecedent contempt, accounts also for their silence concerning it. If
          they had rejected it upon examination, they would have written about
          it; they would have given their reasons. Whereas, what men repudiate
          upon the strength of some prefixed persuasion, or from a settled
          contempt of the subject, of the persons who propose it, or of the
          manner in which it is proposed, they do not naturally write books
          about, or notice much in what they write upon other subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The letters of the younger Pliny furnish an example of this silence,
          and let us, in some measure, into the cause of it. From his celebrated
          correspondence with Trajan, we know that the Christian religion
          prevailed in a very considerable degree in the province over which he
          presided; that it had excited his attention; that he had inquired into
          the matter just so much as a Roman magistrate might be expected to
          inquire, viz., whether the religion contained any opinions dangerous
          to government; but that of its doctrines, its evidences, or its books,
          he had not taken the trouble to inform himself with any degree of care
          or correctness. But although Pliny had viewed Christianity in a nearer
          position than most of his learned countrymen saw it in, yet he had
          regarded the whole with such negligence and disdain (further than as
          it seemed to concern his administration), that, in more than two
          hundred and forty letters of his which have come down to us, the
          subject is never once again mentioned. If, out of this number, the two
          letters between him and Trajan had been lost, with what confidence
          would the obscurity of the Christian religion have been argued from
          Pliny&#x27;s silence about it, and with how little truth!
        </p>
        <p>
          The name and character which Tacitus has given to Christianity,
          &quot;exitiabilis superstitio&quot; (a pernicious superstition), and
          by which two words he disposes of the whole question of the merits or
          demerits of the religion, afford a strong proof how little he knew, or
          concerned himself to know, about the matter. I apprehend that I shall
          not be contradicted, when I take upon me to assert, that no unbeliever
          of the present age would apply this epithet to the Christianity of the
          New Testament, or not allow that it was entirely unmerited. Read the
          instructions given by a great teacher of the religion to those very
          Roman converts of whom Tacitus speaks; and given also a very few years
          before the time of which he is speaking; and which are not, let it be
          observed, a collection of fine sayings brought together from different
          parts of a large work, but stand in one entire passage of a public
          letter, without the intermixture of a single thought which is
          frivolous or exceptionable:—&quot;Abhor that which is evil, cleave to
          that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another, with
          brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; not slothful in
          business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope;
          patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing to
          the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them which
          persecute you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do
          rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind one towards
          another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be
          not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to no man evil for evil.
          Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as
          much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Avenge not
          yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written,
          Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord: therefore, if thine
          enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for, in so
          doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of
          evil, but overcome evil with good.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
          no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
          Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of
          God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For
          rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then
          not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have
          praise of the same: for he is the minister of God to thee for good.
          But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the
          sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
          wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject,
          not only for wrath, but also for conscience&#x27; sake. For, for this
          cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God&#x27;s ministers,
          attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all
          their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom;
          fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

          &quot;Owe no man anything, but to love one another; for he that loveth
          another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit
          adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
          bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other
          commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, Thou shalt
          love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour;
          therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

          &quot;And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
          out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
          The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off
          the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us
          walk honestly as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in
          chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.&quot; (Romans,
          xii. 9—xiii. 13.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Read this, and then think of &quot;exitiabilis superstitio!&quot; Or,
          if we be not allowed, in contending with Heathen authorities, to
          produce our books against theirs, we may at least be permitted to
          confront theirs with one another. Of this &quot;pernicious
          superstition&quot; what could Pliny find to blame, when he was led, by
          his office, to institute something like an examination into the
          conduct and principles of the sect? He discovered nothing but that
          they were went to meet together on a stated day before it was light,
          and sing among themselves a hymn to Christ as a God, and to bind
          themselves by an oath, not to the commission of any wickedness, but,
          not to be guilty of theft, robbery, or adultery; never to falsify
          their word, nor to deny a pledge committed to them, when called upon
          to return it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the words of Tacitus we may build the following observations:
        </p>
        <p>
          First; That we are well warranted in calling the view under which the
          learned men of that age beheld Christianity an obscure and distant
          view. Had Tacitus known more of Christianity, of its precepts, duties,
          constitution, or design, however he had discredited the story, he
          would have respected the principle. He would have described the
          religion differently, though he had rejected it. It has been very
          satisfactorily shown, that the &quot;superstition&quot; of the
          Christians consisted in worshipping a person unknown to the Roman
          calendar; and that the &quot;perniciousness&quot; with which they were
          reproached was nothing else but their opposition to the established
          polytheism; and this view of the matter was just such an one as might
          be expected to occur to a mind which held the sect in too much
          contempt to concern itself about the grounds and reasons of their
          conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly; We may from hence remark how little reliance can be placed
          upon the most acute judgments in subjects which they are pleased to
          despise; and which, of course, they from the first consider as
          unworthy to be inquired into. Had not Christianity survived to tell
          its own story, it must have gone down to posterity as a
          &quot;pernicious superstition;&quot; and that upon the credit of
          Tacitus&#x27;s account, much, I doubt not, strengthened by the name of
          the writer, and the reputation of his sagacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly; That this contempt, prior to examination, is an intellectual
          vice, from which the greatest faculties of mind are not free. I know
          not, indeed, whether men of the greatest faculties of mind are not the
          most subject to it. Such men feel themselves seated upon an eminence.
          Looking down from their height upon the follies of mankind, they
          behold contending tenets wasting their idle strength upon one another
          with the common disdain of the absurdity of them all. This habit of
          thought, however comfortable to the mind which entertain it, or
          however natural to great parts, is extremely dangerous; and more apt
          than almost any other disposition to produce hasty and contemptuous,
          and, by consequence, erroneous judgments, both of persons and
          opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly; We need not be surprised at many writers of that age not
          mentioning Christianity at all, when they who did mention it appear to
          have entirely misconceived its nature and character; and, in
          consequence of this misconception, to have regarded it with negligence
          and contempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the knowledge of the greatest part of the learned heathens, the
          facts of the Christian history could only come by report. The books,
          probably, they had never looked into. The settled habit of their minds
          was, and long had been, an indiscriminate rejection of all reports of
          the kind. With these sweeping conclusions truth hath no chance. It
          depends upon distinction. If they would not inquire, how should they
          be convinced? It might be founded in truth, though they, who made no
          search, might not discover it.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Men of rank and fortune, of wit and abilities, are often found,
          even in Christian countries, to be surprisingly ignorant of religion,
          and of everything that relates to it. Such were many of the heathens.
          Their thoughts were all fixed upon other things; upon reputation and
          glory, upon wealth and power, upon luxury and pleasure, upon business
          or learning. They thought, and they had reason to think, that the
          religion of their country was fable and forgery, a heap of
          inconsistent lies; which inclined them to suppose that other religions
          were no better. Hence it came to pass, that when the apostles preached
          the Gospel, and wrought miracles in confirmation of a doctrine every
          way worthy of God, many Gentiles knew little or nothing of it, and
          would not take the least pains to inform themselves about it. This
          appears plainly from ancient history.&quot; (Jortin&#x27;s Disc. on
          the Christ. Rel. p. 66, ed. 4th.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it by no means unreasonable to suppose that the heathen
          public, especially that part which is made up of men of rank and
          education, were divided into two classes; these who despised
          Christianity beforehand, and those who received it. In correspondency
          with which division of character the writers of that age would also be
          of two classes; those who were silent about Christianity, and those
          who were Christians. &quot;A good man, who attended sufficiently to
          the Christian affairs, would become a Christian; after which his
          testimony ceased to be pagan and became Christian.&quot; (Hartley,
          Obs. p. 119.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I must also add, that I think it sufficiently proved, that the notion
          of magic was resorted to by the heathen adversaries of Christianity,
          in like manner as that of diabolical agency had before been by the
          Jews. Justin Martyr alleges this as his reason for arguing from
          prophecy rather than from miracles. Origen imputes this evasion to
          Celsus; Jerome to Porphyry; and Lactantius to the heathen in general.
          The several passages which contain these testimonies will be produced
          in the next chapter. It being difficult, however, to ascertain in what
          degree this notion prevailed, especially the superior ranks of the
          heathen communities, another, and think an adequate, cause has been
          assigned for their infidelity. It is probable that in many cases the
          two causes would together.
