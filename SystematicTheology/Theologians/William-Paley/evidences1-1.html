        <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
        <p>
          There is satisfactory evidence that many, professing to be original
          witness of the Christian miracles, passed their lives in labours,
          dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their of
          belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the same
          motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support this proposition, two points are necessary to be made out:
          first, that the Founder of the institution, his associates and
          immediate followers, acted the part which the proposition imputes to
          them: secondly, that they did so in attestation of the miraculous
          history recorded in our Scriptures, and solely in consequence of their
          belief of the truth of this history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we produce any particular testimony to the activity and
          sufferings which compose the subject of our first assertion, it will
          be proper to consider the degree of probability which the assertion
          derives from the nature of the case, that is, by inferences from those
          parts of the case which, in point of fact, are on all hands
          acknowledged.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, the Christian Religion exists, and, therefore, by some
          means or other, was established. Now it either owes the principle of
          its establishment, i. e. its first publication, to the activity of the
          Person who was the founder of the institution, and of those who were
          joined with him in the undertaking, or we are driven upon the strange
          supposition, that, although they might lie by, others would take it
          up; although they were quiet and silent, other persons busied
          themselves in the success and propagation of their story. This is
          perfectly incredible. To me it appears little less than certain, that,
          if the first announcing of the religion by the Founder had not been
          followed up by the zeal and industry of his immediate disciples, the
          attempt must have expired in its birth. Then as to the kind and degree
          of exertion which was employed, and the mode of life to which these
          persons submitted, we reasonably suppose it to be like that which we
          observe in all others who voluntarily become missionaries of a new
          faith. Frequent, earnest, and laborious preaching, constantly
          conversing with religious persons upon religion, a sequestration from
          the common pleasures, engagements, and varieties of life, and an
          addiction to one serious object, compose the habits of such men. I do
          not say that this mode of life is without enjoyment, but I say that
          the enjoyment springs from sincerity. With a consciousness at the
          bottom of hollowness and falsehood, the fatigue and restraint would
          become insupportable. I am apt to believe that very few hypocrites
          engage in these undertakings; or, however, persist in them long.
          Ordinarily speaking, nothing can overcome the indolence of mankind,
          the love which is natural to most tempers of cheerful society and
          cheerful scenes, or the desire, which is common to all, of personal
          ease and freedom, but conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, it is also highly probable, from the nature of the case,
          that the propagation of the new religion was attended with difficulty
          and danger. As addressed to the Jews, it was a system adverse, not
          only to their habitual opinions but to those opinions upon which their
          hopes, their partialities, their pride, their consolation, was
          founded. This people, with or without reason, had worked themselves
          into a persuasion, that some signal and greatly advantageous change
          was to be effected in the condition of their country, by the agency of
          a long-promised messenger from heaven.* The rulers of the Jews, their
          leading sect, their priesthood, had been the authors of this
          persuasion to the common people. So that it was not merely the
          conjecture of theoretical divines, or the secret expectation of a few
          recluse devotees, but it was become the popular hope and Passion, and,
          like all popular opinions, undoubting and impatient of contradiction.
          They clung to this hope under every misfortune of their country, and
          with more tenacity as their dangers and calamities increased. To find,
          therefore, that expectations so gratifying were to be worse than
          disappointed; that they were to end in the diffusion of a mild
          unambitious religion, which, instead of victories and triumphs,
          instead of exalting their nation and institution above the rest of the
          world, was to advance those whom they despised to an equality with
          themselves, in those very points of comparison in which they most
          valued their own distinction, could be no very pleasing discovery to a
          Jewish mind; nor could the messengers of such intelligence expect to
          be well received or easily credited. The doctrine was equally harsh
          and novel. The extending of the kingdom of God to those who did not
          conform to the law of Moses was a notion that had never before entered
          into the thoughts of a Jew.

          The character of the new institution was, in other respects also,
          ungrateful to Jewish habits and principles. Their own religion was in
          a high degree technical. Even the enlightened Jew placed a great deal
          of stress upon the ceremonies of his law, saw in them a great deal of
          virtue and efficacy; the gross and vulgar had scarcely anything else;
          and the hypocritical and ostentatious magnified them above measure, as
          being the instruments of their own reputation and influence. The
          Christian scheme, without formally repealing the Levitical code,
          lowered its estimation extremely. In the place of strictness and zeal
          in performing the observances which that code prescribed, or which
          tradition had added to it, the new sect preached up faith,
          well-regulated affections, inward purity, and moral rectitude of
          disposition, as the true ground, on the part of the worshipper, of
          merit and acceptance with God. This, however rational it may appear,
          or recommending to us at present, did not by any means facilitate the
          plan then. On the contrary, to disparage those qualities which the
          highest characters in the country valued themselves most upon, was a
          sure way of making powerful enemies. As if the frustration of the
          national hope was not enough, the long-esteemed merit of ritual zeal
          and punctuality was to be decried, and that by Jews preaching to Jews.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ruling party at Jerusalem had just before crucified the Founder of
          the religion. That is a fact which will not be disputed. They,
          therefore, who stood forth to preach the religion must necessarily
          reproach these rulers with an execution which they could not but
          represent as an unjust and cruel murder. This would not render their
          office more easy, or their situation more safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to the interference of the Roman government which was then
          established in Judea, I should not expect, that, despising as it did
          the religion of the country, it would, if left to itself, animadvert,
          either with much vigilance or much severity, upon the schisms and
          controversies which arose within it. Yet there was that in
          Christianity which might easily afford a handle of accusation with a
          jealous government. The Christians avowed an unqualified obedience to
          a new master. They avowed also that he was the person who had been
          foretold to the Jews under the suspected title of King. The spiritual
          nature of this kingdom, the consistency of this obedience with civil
          subjection, were distinctions too refined to be entertained by a Roman
          president, who viewed the business at a great distance, or through the
          medium of very hostile representations. Our histories accordingly
          inform us, that this was the turn which the enemies of Jesus gave to
          his character and pretensions in their remonstrances with Pontius
          Pilate. And Justin Martyr, about a hundred years afterwards, complains
          that the same mistake prevailed in his time: &quot;Ye, having heard
          that we are waiting for a kingdom, suppose without distinguishing that
          we mean a human kingdom, when in truth we speak of that which is with
          God.&quot;* And it was undoubtedly a natural source of calumny and
          misconstruction.

          The preachers of Christianity had, therefore, to contend with
          prejudice backed by power. They had to come forward to a disappointed
          people, to a priesthood possessing a considerable share of municipal
          authority, and actuated by strong motives of opposition and
          resentment; and they had to do this under a foreign government, to
          whose favour they made no pretensions, and which was constantly
          surrounded by their enemies. The well-known, because the experienced,
          fate of reformers, whenever the reformation subverts some reigning
          opinion, and does not proceed upon a change that has already taken
          place in the sentiments of a country, will not allow, much less lead
          us to suppose that the first propagators of Christianity at Jerusalem
          and in Judea, under the difficulties and the enemies they had to
          contend with, and entirely destitute as they were of force, authority,
          or protection, could execute their mission with personal ease and
          safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us next inquire, what might reasonably be expected by the
          preachers of Christianity when they turned themselves to the heathen
          public. Now the first thing that strikes us is, that the religion they
          carried with them was exclusive. It denied without reserve the truth
          of every article of heathen mythology, the existence of every object
          of their worship. It accepted no compromise, it admitted no
          comprehension. It must prevail, if it prevailed at all, by the
          overthrow of every statue, altar, and temple in the world, It will not
          easily be credited, that a design, so bold as this was, could in any
          age be attempted to be carried into execution with impunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          For it ought to be considered, that this was not setting forth, or
          magnifying the character and worship of some new competitor for a
          place in the Pantheon, whose pretensions might he discussed or
          asserted without questioning the reality of any others: it was
          pronouncing all other gods to be false, and all other worship vain.
          From the facility with which the polytheism of ancient nations
          admitted new objects of worship into the number of their acknowledged
          divinities, or the patience with which they might entertain proposals
          of this kind, we can argue nothing as to their toleration of a system,
          or of the publishers and active propagators of a system, which swept
          away the very foundation of the existing establishment. The one was
          nothing more than what it would be, in popish countries, to add a
          saint to the calendar; the other was to abolish and tread under foot
          the calendar itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, it ought also to be considered, that this was not the case
          of philosophers propounding in their books, or in their schools,
          doubts concerning the truth of the popular creed, or even avowing
          their disbelief of it. These philosophers did not go about from place
          to place to collect proselytes from amongst the common people; to form
          in the heart of the country societies professing their tenets; to
          provide for the order, instruction and permanency of these societies;
          nor did they enjoin their followers to withdraw themselves from the
          public worship of the temples, or refuse a compliance with rites
          instituted by the laws.* These things are what the Christians did, and
          what the philosophers did not; and in these consisted the activity and
          danger of the enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          * The best of the ancient philosophers, Plato, Cicero, and Epictetus,
          allowed, or rather enjoined, men to worship the gods of the country,
          and in the established form. See passages to this purpose collected
          from their works by Dr. Clarke, Nat. and Rev. Rel. p. 180. ed.
          v—Except Socrates, they all thought it wiser to comply with the laws
          than to contend. _________
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, it ought also to be considered, that this danger proceeded
          not merely from solemn acts and public resolutions of the state, but
          from sudden bursts of violence at particular places, from the licence
          of the populace, the rashness of some magistrates and negligence of
          others; from the influence and instigation of interested adversaries,
          and, in general, from the variety and warmth of opinion which an
          errand so novel and extraordinary could not fail of exciting. I can
          conceive that the teachers of Christianity might both fear and suffer
          much from these causes, without any general persecution being
          denounced against them by imperial authority. Some length of time, I
          should suppose, might pass, before the vast machine of the Roman
          empire would be put in motion, or its attention be obtained to
          religious controversy: but, during that time, a great deal of ill
          usage might be endured, by a set of friendless, unprotected
          travellers, telling men, wherever they came, that the religion of
          their ancestors, the religion in which they had been brought up, the
          religion of the state, and of the magistrate, the rites which they
          frequented, the pomp which they admired, was throughout a system of
          folly and delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor do I think that the teachers of Christianity would find protection
          in that general disbelief of the popular theology, which is supposed
          to have prevailed amongst the intelligent part of the heathen public.
          It is by no means true that unbelievers are usually tolerant. They are
          not disposed (and why should they?) to endanger the present state of
          things, by suffering a religion of which they believe nothing to be
          disturbed by another of which they believe as little. They are ready
          themselves to conform to anything; and are, oftentimes, amongst the
          foremost to procure conformity from others, by any method which they
          think likely to be efficacious. When was ever a change of religion
          patronized by infidels? How little, not withstanding the reigning
          scepticism, and the magnified liberality of that age, the true
          principles of toleration were understood by the wisest men amongst
          them, may be gathered from two eminent and uncontested examples. The
          younger Pliny, polished as he was by all the literature of that soft
          and elegant period, could gravely pronounce this monstrous
          judgment:—&quot;Those who persisted in declaring themselves
          Christians, I ordered to be led away to punishment, (i. e. to
          execution,) for I DID NOT DOUBT, whatever it was that they confessed,
          that contumacy and inflexible obstinacy ought to be punished.&quot;
          His master Trajan, a mild and accomplished prince, went, nevertheless,
          no further in his sentiments of moderation and equity than what
          appears in the following rescript:—&quot;The Christians are not to be
          sought for; but if any are brought before you, and convicted, they are
          to be punished.&quot; And this direction he gives, after it had been
          reported to him by his own president, that, by the most strict
          examination, nothing could be discovered in the principles of these
          persons, but &quot;a bad and excessive superstition,&quot;
          accompanied, it seems, with an oath or mutual federation, &quot;to
          allow themselves in no crime or immoral conduct whatever.&quot; The
          truth is, the ancient heathens considered religion entirely as an
          affair of state, as much under the tuition of the magistrate as any
          other part of the police. The religion of that age was not merely
          allied to the state; it was incorporated into it. Many of its offices
          were administered by the magistrate. Its titles of pontiffs, augurs,
          and flamens, were borne by senators, consuls, and generals. Without
          discussing, therefore, the truth of the theology, they resented every
          affront put upon the established worship, as a direct opposition to
          the authority of government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add to which, that the religious systems of those times, however ill
          supported by evidence, had been long established. The ancient religion
          of a country has always many votaries, and sometimes not the fewer,
          because its origin is hidden in remoteness and obscurity. Men have a
          natural veneration for antiquity, especially in matters of religion.
          What Tacitus says of the Jewish was more applicable to the heathen
          establishment: &quot;Hi ritus, quoquo modo inducti, antiquitate
          defenduntur.&quot; It was also a splendid and sumptuous worship. It
          had its priesthood, its endowments, its temples. Statuary, painting,
          architecture, and music, contributed their effect to its ornament and
          magnificence. It abounded in festival shows and solemnities, to which
          the common people are greatly addicted, and which were of a nature to
          engage them much more than anything of that sort among us. These
          things would retain great numbers on its side by the fascination of
          spectacle and pomp, as well as interest many in its preservation by
          the advantage which they drew from it. &quot;It was moreover
          interwoven,&quot; as Mr. Gibbon rightly represents it, &quot;with
          every circumstance of business or pleasure, of public or private life,
          with all the offices and amusements of society.&quot; On the due
          celebration also of its rites, the people were taught to believe, and
          did believe, that the prosperity of their country in a great measure
          depended.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am willing to accept the account of the matter which is given by Mr.
          Gibbon: &quot;The various modes of worship which prevailed in the
          Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true, by the
          philosopher as equally false, and by the magistrate as equally
          useful:&quot; and I would ask from which of these three classes of men
          were the Christian missionaries to look for protection or impunity?
          Could they expect it from the people, &quot;whose acknowledged
          confidence in the public religion&quot; they subverted from its
          foundation? From the philosopher, who, &quot;considering all religious
          as equally false,&quot; would of course rank theirs among the number,
          with the addition of regarding them as busy and troublesome zealots?
          Or from the magistrate, who, satisfied with the &quot;utility&quot; of
          the subsisting religion, would not be likely to countenance a spirit
          of proselytism and innovation:—a system which declared war against
          every other, and which, if it prevailed, must end in a total rupture
          of public opinion; an upstart religion, in a word, which was not
          content with its own authority, but must disgrace all the settled
          religions of the world? It was not to be imagined that he would endure
          with patience, that the religion of the emperor and of the state
          should be calumniated and borne down by a company of superstitious and
          despicable Jews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly; the nature of the case affords a strong proof, that the
          original teachers of Christianity, in consequence of their new
          profession, entered upon a new and singular course of life. We may be
          allowed to presume, that the institution which they preached to
          others, they conformed to in their own persons; because this is no
          more than what every teacher of a new religion both does, and must do,
          in order to obtain either proselytes or hearers. The change which this
          would produce was very considerable. It is a change which we do not
          easily estimate, because, ourselves and all about us being habituated
          to the institutions from our infancy, it is what we neither experience
          nor observe. After men became Christians, much of their time was spent
          in prayer and devotion, in religious meetings, in celebrating the
          Eucharist, in conferences, in exhortations, in preaching, in an
          affectionate intercourse with one another, and correspondence with
          other societies. Perhaps their mode of life, in its form and habit,
          was not very unlike the Unitas Fratrum, or the modern methodists.
          Think then what it was to become such at Corinth, at Ephesus, at
          Antioch, or even at Jerusalem. How new! How alien from all their
          former habits and ideas, and from those of everybody about them! What
          a revolution there must have been of opinions and prejudices to bring
          the matter to this!

          We know what the precepts of the religion are; how pure, how
          benevolent, how disinterested a conduct they enjoin; and that this
          purity and benevolence are extended to the very thoughts and
          affections. We are not, perhaps, at liberty to take for granted that
          the lives of the preachers of Christianity were as perfect as their
          lessons; but we are entitled to contend, that the observable part of
          their behaviour must have agreed in a great measure with the duties
          which they taught. There was, therefore, (which is all that we
          assert,) a course of life pursued by them, different from that which
          they before led. And this is of great importance. Men are brought to
          anything almost sooner than to change their habit of life, especially
          when the change is either inconvenient, or made against the force of
          natural inclination, or with the loss of accustomed indulgences. It is
          the most difficult of all things to convert men from vicious habits to
          virtuous ones, as every one may judge from what he feels in himself,
          as well as from what he sees in others.* It is almost like making men
          over again.

          Left then to myself, and without any more information than a knowledge
          of the existence of the religion, of the general story upon which it
          is founded, and that no act of power, force, and authority was
          concerned in its first success, I should conclude, from the very
          nature and exigency of the case, that the Author of the religion,
          during his life, and his immediate disciples after his death, exerted
          themselves in spreading and publishing the institution throughout the
          country in which it began, and into which it was first carried; that,
          in the prosecution of this purpose, they underwent the labours and
          troubles which we observe the propagators of new sects to undergo;
          that the attempt must necessarily have also been in a high degree
          dangerous; that, from the subject of the mission, compared with the
          fixed opinions and prejudices of those to whom the missionaries were
          to address themselves, they could hardly fail of encountering strong
          and frequent opposition; that, by the hand of government, as well as
          from the sudden fury and unbridled licence of the people, they would
          oftentimes experience injurious and cruel treatment; that, at any
          rate, they must have always had so much to fear for their personal
          safety, as to have passed their lives in a state of constant peril and
          anxiety; and lastly, that their mode of life and conduct, visibly at
          least, corresponded with the institution which they delivered, and, so
          far, was both new, and required continual self-denial.
