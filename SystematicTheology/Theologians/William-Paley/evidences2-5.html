        <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
        <p>ORIGINALITY OF OUR SAVIOUR&#x27;S CHARACTER.</p>
        <p>
          The Jews, whether right or wrong, had understood their prophecies to
          foretell the advent of a person who by some supernatural assistance
          should advance their nation to independence, and to a supreme degree
          of splendour and prosperity. This was the reigning opinion and
          expectation of the times. Now, had Jesus been an enthusiast, it is
          probable that his enthusiasm would have fallen in with the popular
          delusion, and that, while he gave himself out to be the person
          intended by these predictions, he would have assumed the character to
          which they were universally supposed to relate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had he been an impostor, it was his business to have flattered the
          prevailing hopes, because these hopes were to be the instruments of
          his attraction and success.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is better than conjectures is the fact, that all the
          pretended Messiahs actually did so. We learn from Josephus that there
          were many of these. Some of them, it is probable, might be impostors,
          who thought that an advantage was to be taken of the state of public
          opinion. Others, perhaps, were enthusiasts, whose imagination had been
          drawn to this particular object by the language and sentiments which
          prevailed around them. But whether impostors or enthusiasts, they
          concurred in producing themselves in the character which their
          countrymen looked for, that is to say, as the restorers and deliverers
          of the nation, in that sense in which restoration and deliverance were
          expected by the Jews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why therefore Jesus, if he was, like them, either an enthusiast or
          impostor, did not pursue the same conduct as they did, in framing his
          character and pretensions, it will be found difficult to explain. A
          mission, the operation and benefit of which was to take place in
          another life, was a thing unthought of as the subject of these
          prophecies. That Jesus, coming to them as their Messiah, should come
          under a character totally different from that in which they expected
          him; should deviate from the general persuasion, and deviate into
          pretensions absolutely singular and originalâ€”appears to be
          inconsistent with the imputation of enthusiasm or imposture, both
          which by their nature I should expect would, and both which,
          throughout the experience which this very subject furnishes, in fact,
          have followed the opinions that obtained at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be said that Jesus, having tried the other plan, turned at
          length to this; I answer, that the thing is said without evidence;
          against evidence; that it was competent to the rest to have done the
          same, yet that nothing of this sort was thought of by any.
