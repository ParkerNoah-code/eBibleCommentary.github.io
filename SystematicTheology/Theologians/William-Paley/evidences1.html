        <h2>PART I.</h2>
        <p>
          OF THE DIRECT HISTORICAL EVIDENCE OF CHRISTIANITY, AND WHEREIN IT IS
          DISTINGUISHED FROM THE EVIDENCE ALLEGED FOR OTHER MIRACLES.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two propositions which I shall endeavour to establish are these:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That there is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be
          original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in
          labours, dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation
          of the accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of
          their belief of those accounts; and that they also submitted, from the
          same motives, to new rules of conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That there is not satisfactory evidence that persons professing to
          be original witnesses of other miracles, in their nature as certain as
          these are, have ever acted in the same manner, in attestation of the
          accounts which they delivered, and properly in consequence of their
          belief of those accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first of these prepositions, as it forms the argument will stand
          at the head of the following nine chapters.
