<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Let Us Not Grow Weary</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    "And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if 
    we faint not." Galatians 6:9</p>
<p align="justify">In the verses before the text, the Apostle had laid down 
    a <b>proposition</b>, "What a man sows that shall he reap," verse 7. He who 
    sows in sin—shall reap in sorrow. He who sows the seeds of grace—shall reap 
    glory. There is the proposition.</p>
<p align="justify">In the text, the Apostle makes the <b>application</b>: 
    "Let us not be weary in well-doing." We who have sown the good seed of 
    repentance and a holy life, "Let us not be weary; for in due season we shall 
    reap, if we faint not." There is in the text, then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The exhortation: "Let us not be weary."</p>
<p align="justify">II. The argument: "We shall reap in due season."</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The exhortation. </p></b></font>"Let us not be weary." 
<p align="justify">There is something <i>implied</i>—that we are apt to be 
    weary in well-doing. </p>
<p align="justify">There is something <i>expressed</i>—that we ought not to 
    be weary in well-doing.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The thing implied—we are apt to be weary in 
    well-doing.</p></b></font> This weariness is not from the regenerate part but 
    the fleshly part; as Peter's sinking in the water was not from faith in 
    Christ, but from fear. This weariness in a Christian course is occasioned 
    from four things:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) From the revilings of the world.</p></b></font> Psalm 
    71:10, "My enemies speak against me." <i>Innocence is no shield against 
    reproach. </i>But why should this make us weary of well-doing? Did not Jesus 
    Christ undergo reproach for us, when the Jews put a crown of thorns on His 
    head, and bowed the knee in scorn? Is it any dishonor to us to be reproached 
    for doing that which is good? Is it any disparagement to a virgin to be 
    reproached for her beauty and chastity? We should bind our reproaches for 
    Christ—as a crown about our head. Now a spirit of glory rests upon us. 1 
    Peter 4:14, "If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are 
    blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you." He who clips our 
    credit to make it weigh lighter—makes our crown heavier.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) That which is apt to occasion weariness in 
    well-doing, is the present sufferings we are exposed to.</p></b></font> 2 
    Corinthians 4:8, "We are troubled on every side." But why should this make 
    us weary in well-doing? Is not our life a warfare? It is no more strange to 
    meet with sufferings for Christ—than for a mariner to meet with storms, or a 
    soldier to meet with bullets. Do we not consider upon what terms we are 
    entered into religion? Did we not vow in baptism to fight under Christ's 
    banner? Does our Lord not tell us that we must take up the cross and follow 
    Him? Matthew 16:24. Is not this part of the legacy Christ has bequeathed us? 
    John 16:33. We would like to partake of Christ's glory—but not of His 
    sufferings. Besides, does not many a man suffer for his sins? Do not men's 
    lusts bring them to an untimely end? Do men suffer for their sins—and do we 
    think it too much, if we suffer for Christ? How did Paul rejoice in 
    sufferings! 2 Corinthians 7:4. How did he glory in it! "As a woman that is 
    proud of her jewels," said Chrysostom. Why should sufferings make us faint? 
    Who would not be willing to tread upon a few thorns, who is going to a 
    kingdom!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) That which is apt to occasion weariness in 
    well-doing, is the deferring of the reward.</p></b></font> We are apt to be 
    discouraged and grow weary—if we do not immediately have what we desire. We 
    are all for <i>present pay</i>. But consider, first, that our work is not 
    yet done. We have not yet finished the faith. The servant does not receive 
    his pay, until his work is done. Even Christ's reward was deferred until He 
    had done His work. When He had completed our redemption and said upon the 
    cross, "It is finished"—then He entered into glory. 
<p align="justify">Second, God defers the reward—to make heaven more welcome 
    to us. After all our praying, weeping, and suffering—how sweet will the joys 
    of paradise taste!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4) That which is apt to occasion weariness in 
    well-doing, is the greatness and difficulty of a Christian's work. </p></b>
</font>But why should this make us weary? Difficulty whets a noble mind. The 
    soldier's life has its difficulties, but they raise his spirits the more. He 
    loves to encounter hardship and will endure at bloody fight for a golden 
    harvest. Besides, where the least principle of grace is, it renders the way 
    of religion easy and pleasant. When the magnet draws—it is easy for the iron 
    to move. When God's Spirit draws—we move in the way of religion with ease 
    and delight. Christ's service is freedom. Psalm 119:45, "I will walk at 
    liberty." To <i>serve </i>God, to <i>love </i>God, to <i>enjoy </i>God—is 
    the sweetest liberty in the world. Besides, while we serve God—we gratify 
    ourselves. When a man who digs in a mine sweats—he gets gold; while we 
    glorify God—we promote our own glory.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There is something expressed—that we ought not to be 
    weary in well-doing.</p></b></font> We should not grow weary in a Christian 
    course. We should not tire in our race. "Let us not be weary in well-doing". 
    The Greek word "to be weary" signifies to shrink back like a coward in a 
    war. Let it not he thus with us; let us not shrink back from Christ's 
    colors. Hebrews 4:14, "Let us hold fast our profession." We must not only 
    hold <i>forth </i>our profession—but hold <i>fast </i>our profession. The 
    crown is not given to him who <i>fights</i>—but to him who <i>overcomes</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of reproof.</p></b></font> It reproves such as are 
    weary of well-doing. These are <i>falling stars</i>, 2 Timothy 4:10. Demas 
    forsook God and, afterwards, became a priest in an idol temple. Hosea 8:3, 
    "Israel has cast off the thing that is good." Many have thrown off Christ's 
    livery; they have left off a holy course of life. They have turned to 
    worldliness or wantonness. Galatians 5:7, "You did run well—who hindered 
    you?" Why did you tire in your race? 2 Peter 2:21, "It would be better if 
    they had never known the right way to live than to know it and then reject 
    the holy commandments that were given to them."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. </p></b></font>Let us not be weary in 
    well-doing. Consider:
<p align="justify">1. The way of true religion is honorable. Shall we he 
    weary of that which is noble? If indeed the Christian religion were a thing 
    that would bring shame or loss as the ways of sin do—then we would have 
    cause to desert it and grow weary of it; but it brings honor. Proverbs 4:9, 
    "She shall give to your head an ornament of grace." Why then should we be 
    weary of well-doing?</p>
<p align="justify">2. The beauty of a Christian is to hold on in piety, 
    without being weary. Acts 21:16, "Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple." It is 
    a beautiful sight to see silver hairs, crowned with golden virtue. The 
    beauty of a thing is when it comes to be finished; the beauty of a picture 
    is when it is drawn out in its full lineaments and laid in its orient 
    colors. The beauty of a Christian is when he has finished his faith, 2 
    Timothy 4:7. It was the glory of the church of Thyatira that she kept her 
    best wine until last. Revelation 2:19, "I know your works—your love, 
    faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the 
    first."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Such as are weary of well-doing—it is a sign they 
    never acted in religion from a choice, or from a principle of faith. Rather, 
    they acted from the external spring of applause or preferment, so that, when 
    these fail, their seeming goodness ceases.</p>
<p align="justify">4. God is never weary of doing us good. Therefore, we 
    should not be weary of serving Him. A king who is continually obliging his 
    subjects with gifts—those subjects have no cause to be weary of serving 
    their prince.</p>
<p align="justify">5. If we grow weary and throw off religion, we make all 
    we have done null and void. Ezekiel 18:24, "When the righteous turns away 
    from his righteousness, all his righteousness that he has done shall not be 
    mentioned." He who has been serving God and doing angel's work; if once he 
    grows weary and desists, he unravels all his work and misses the recompense 
    of reward. He who runs <i>half </i>a race, and then tires, loses the 
    garland! Oh, what folly is it to do well awhile and, by apostasy—to undo 
    all! As if the artist with a pencil should draw a fair picture—and then come 
    with his sponge and wipe it out again.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Consider the examples of such as have continued their 
    progress unweariedly in a Christian course. The Apostle sets before our eyes 
    a cloud of witnesses, Hebrews 12:1, "Being compassed about with so great a 
    cloud of witnesses, let us run the race which is set before us." Let us run 
    it with <i>swiftness </i>and <i>constancy</i>. How many noble martyrs and 
    confessors of old have walked in the ways of God, though they have been 
    strewn with thorns! They scorned preferments, laughed at imprisonments, and 
    their love to Christ burned hotter than the fire! When Polycarp came before 
    the proconsul who bade him deny Christ, he replied, "I have served Christ 
    these eighty-six years, and He has not once hurt me. Shall I deny Him now?" 
    Tertullian said that such was the constancy of the primitive saints, that 
    the persecutors cried out, "What a misery is this, that we are more weary in 
    tormenting them—than they are in enduring torment!" Let us tread in their 
    steps who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.</p>
<p align="justify">7. It will be our comfort on our deathbed, to review a 
    well-spent life. It was Augustine's wish that he might have a quiet, easy 
    death. If anything makes our pillow easy at death, it will be this: that you 
    have been unwearied in God's work. This will be a deathbed cordial. Did you 
    ever know any to repent at death, that they had been too holy? Many have 
    repented that they have followed the world too much—but not that they have 
    prayed too much—not that they have repented too much. What has made death 
    sweet but that they have finished their course and kept the faith.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Think of the great reward we shall have if we do not 
    give over or grow weary—and that is glory and immortality. This glory is 
    ponderous. It is called a <i>weight </i>of glory, 2 Corinthians 4:17. The 
    weight adds to the worth. The weightier a crown of gold is, the more it is 
    worth.</p>
<p align="justify">This glory is satisfying. Psalm 17:15, "I shall be 
    satisfied when I awake with Your likeness." This glory will abundantly 
    recompense all our labors and sufferings. The joy of harvest, will make 
    amends for all the labor in sowing. Oh, what harvest shall the saints reap! 
    It will be always reaping time in heaven, and this reaping will be in due 
    season. So the Apostle says in the text, "We shall reap in due season." The 
    farmer does not desire to reap until the season. He will not reap his corn 
    while it is green—but when it is ripe. Just so, we shall reap the reward of 
    glory in due season. When our work is done, when our sins our purged out, 
    when our graces are come to their full growth—then is the season of reaping. 
    Therefore, let us not be weary of well-doing—but hold on in prayer, reading, 
    and all the exercises of piety. We shall "reap in due season, if we faint 
    not. "<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The Argument. </p></b></font>"We shall reap in due 
    season." To keep us from fainting, know that the reward promised is very 
    near. Roman 13:11, "Our salvation is nearer than when we believed." We are 
    but within a few days march of the heavenly Canaan; it is but a few more 
    prayers and tears shed—and we shall be perfect in glory! As that martyr 
    Taylor said, "I have but one stile more to go over—and I shall be at my 
    Father's house!" Wait but a while, Christians, and your trouble shall be 
    over and your coronation-day shall come! Christ, who is the oracle of truth 
    has said, "Surely I come quickly!" Revelation 22:20. <i>Death's </i>coming 
    is sooner than <i>Christ's </i>personal coming—and then begins the saint's 
    blessed jubilee.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION.</p></b></font> What means shall we use that we may 
    not wax weary in a Christian course?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1.</p></b></font> Let us shake off spiritual sloth. 
    Sloth says, "There is a lion in the way." He who is slothful will soon grow 
    weary; he is more fit to lie on his couch—than to run a race! <i>It is a 
    strange sight to see a busy devil—and an idle Christian!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2.</p></b></font> If we would not grow weary, let us 
    pray for persevering grace. It was David's prayer, Psalm 119:117, "Hold me 
    up—and I shall be safe." It was Beza's prayer, "Lord, perfect what You have 
    begun in me." That we may hold on a Christian course, let us labor for three 
    persevering graces: faith, hope, and love.
<b>
<p align="justify">Faith </p></b>keeps from fainting. Faith gives a substance to 
    things not seen, and makes them to be as it were present, Hebrews 11. As a 
    telescope makes those things which are at a distance near to the eye, so 
    does faith. Heaven and glory seem near. A Christian will not be weary of 
    service—who has the crown in his eye.
<p align="justify">The second persevering grace is <b>hope</b>. Hope 
    animates the spirits; it is to the soul as cork to the net—which keeps it 
    from sinking. Hope breeds patience and patience breeds perseverance. Hope is 
    compared to an anchor, Hebrew 6:19. The Christian never sins, but when he 
    casts away his anchor of hope!</p>
<p align="justify">The third persevering grace is <b>love</b>. Love makes a 
    man so that he is never weary. Love may be compared to the rod of myrtle in 
    the traveler's hand, which refreshes him and keeps him from being weary in 
    his journey. He who loves the world is never weary of following the world; 
    he who loves God will never be weary of serving Him. The reason why saints 
    and angels in heaven are never weary of praising and worshiping God, is 
    because their love to God is perfect, and love turns service into delight. 
    Get the love of God in your hearts—and you will run in His ways and not be 
    weary!</p>
