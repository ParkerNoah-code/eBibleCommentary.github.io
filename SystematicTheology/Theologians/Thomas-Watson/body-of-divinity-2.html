<p align="center">3. The ETERNITY of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is, "God is eternal." "From 
    everlasting to everlasting, you are God."</p>
<p align="justify"><b>There are three kinds of beings:</b></p>
<p align="justify">1. Such beings as had a <i>beginning</i>—and shall have 
    an <i>end. </i>Such as all animate creatures—the animals, birds, fish—which 
    at death are destroyed and return to dust. Their being ends with their life.
    </p>
<p align="justify">2. Such beings as had a <i>beginning</i>—but shall have
    <i>no end. </i>Such as angels and the souls of men, which are eternal once 
    they are brought into existence—they abide forever. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Such as is <i>without beginning</i>—and <i>without 
    ending</i>. This is proper only to God. He is <i>from </i>everlasting—<i>to
    </i>everlasting. This is God's title, a jewel of his crown. He is called 
    "the King eternal." <i>Jehovah </i>is a word that properly sets forth God's 
    eternity. It is a word so dreadful, that the Jews trembled to name or read 
    it; and used <i>Adonai</i>, 'Lord,' in its place. <i>Jehovah </i>contains in 
    it time past, present, and to come. "I am the Alpha and the Omega—says the 
    Lord God—who <b>is</b>, and who <b>was</b>, and who <b>is to come</b>, the 
    Almighty." Revelation 1:8. This verse illustrates the word Jehovah; (who <i>
    is</i>) he subsists of himself, having a pure and independent being; (who <i>
    was</i>) God alone, was before time; there is no searching into the records 
    of eternity; (who <i>is to come</i>).</p>
<p align="justify">"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever!" Psalm 
    45:6. The doubling of the word ratifies the certainty of it, as the doubling 
    of Pharaoh's dream. His <i>kingdom </i>has no end; his <i>crown </i>has no 
    successors. </p>
<p align="justify">I shall prove that God alone could be eternal—without <i>
    beginning</i>. <i>Angels </i>could not be eternal; they are but creatures, 
    and though spirits—they were created. Therefore their beginning may be 
    known; their antiquity may be searched into. If you ask, <i>when were they 
    created? </i>Some think before the world was; but not so: for what was 
    before time was eternal. The first origin of angels reaches back no further, 
    than the beginning of the world. It is thought by the learned, that the 
    angels were made on the day on which the heavens were made. "When the 
    morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy." 
    Jerome, Gregory, and venerable Bede understand it, that when God laid the 
    foundation-stone of the world, the angels being then created, sang anthems 
    of joy and praise. </p>
<p align="justify">It is proper to God only to be eternal, without 
    beginning. He is Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. No creature can 
    write itself <i>Alpha</i>, that is only a flower of the crown of heaven. 
    Exod 3:14. "I am who I am," that is, "I am the one who always is. I am he 
    who exists <i>from</i>, and <i>to </i>eternity!" "The Lord will reign 
    forever and ever!" Exodus 15:18. "The Lord is King forever and ever!" Psalm 
    10:16. </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Here is thunder and lightning to the WICKED. </p></b>
</font>"Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven 
    golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever!" 
    Revelation 15:7. God is eternal, therefore the torments of the wicked are 
    eternal! God lives forever; and as long as God lives, he will be punishing 
    the damned! This should be as the handwriting upon the wall, which should 
    have this effect— "and his face turned pale with fear. Such terror gripped 
    him that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way beneath him." 
    Daniel 5:6. The sinner takes liberty to sin; he breaks God's laws, like a 
    wild beast that breaks over the hedge, and leaps into forbidden pasture; he 
    sins with greediness, as if he thought he could not sin fast enough. "They 
    don't care anymore about right and wrong, and they have given themselves 
    over to immoral ways. Their lives are filled with all kinds of impurity and 
    greed." Ephesians 4:19. But remember, one of God's names is <i>Eternal</i>, 
    and as long as God is eternal he has time enough to reckon with all his 
    enemies. To make sinners tremble, let them think of these three things: the 
    torments of the damned are without intermission, without mixture, and 
    eternal.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Without intermission. </p></b></font>Their pains shall 
    be acute and sharp, and no relaxation; the fire shall not be slackened or 
    abated. "They have no rest day nor night;" like one who has his joints 
    stretched continually on the rack, and has no ease. The wrath of God is 
    compared to a <i>stream </i>of brimstone. Isa 30:33. Why to a stream? 
    Because a stream runs without intermission; so God's wrath runs like a 
    stream, and pours out without intermission. In the pains of this present 
    life, there is some abatement and intermission; the fever abates; after a 
    fit of the stone, the patient has some ease; but the pains of hell are 
    intense and violent. The damned soul never says, "I am now more at ease."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Without mixture. </p></b></font>Hell is a place of pure 
    justice. In this life, God in anger remembers mercy, he mixes compassion 
    with suffering. Asher's shoe was of iron—but his foot was dipped in oil. 
    Affliction is the iron shoe—but mercy is mixed with it; the foot is dipped 
    in oil. But the torments of the damned have no mixture. "They shall drink of 
    the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out <i>without mixture</i>." 
    No mixture of mercy.
<p align="justify">How is the cup of wrath said to be <i>mixed?</i> "For the 
    Lord holds a cup in his hand; it is full of foaming wine <i>mixed </i>with 
    spices. He pours the wine out in judgment, and all the wicked must drink it, 
    draining it to the dregs!" Psalm 75:8. Yet in the Revelation it is said to 
    be <i>without mixture</i>. It is mixed, that is, it is full of all the 
    ingredients that may make it bitter; the worm, the fire, the curse of God, 
    all these are bitter ingredients. It is a mixed cup—yet it is without 
    mixture; there shall be nothing to afford the least comfort, no mixture of 
    mercy, and so without mixture. In the <i>sacrifice of jealousy</i>, Numb 
    5:15, no oil was put to it; so, in the torments of the damned, there is no 
    oil of mercy to abate their sufferings.</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(3.) Without cessation, eternal. </p></font>The pleasures of 
    sin are but for a season—but the torments of the wicked are forever! </b>
    Sinners have a short feast—but a long reckoning! Origen erroneously thought, 
    that after a thousand years, the damned would be released out of their 
    misery; but the worm, the fire, the prison—are all eternal. "The smoke of 
    their torment rises forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or 
    night." Revelation 14:11. "The torments of hell keep on punishing, they 
    never end," Prosper. <i>Eternity </i>is a sea without bottom and banks. 
    After millions of years, there is not one minute in eternity spent; and the 
    damned must be ever burning—but never consumed, always dying—but never dead. 
    "They shall seek death—but shall not find it." 
<p align="justify">The fire of hell is such, as multitudes of tears will not 
    quench it; and length of time will not finish it! The vial of God's wrath 
    will be always dropping upon the sinner! As long as God is eternal, he lives 
    to be avenged upon the wicked. Oh eternity! eternity! who can fathom it? 
    Mariners have their plummets to measure the depths of the sea; but what line 
    or plummet shall we use to fathom the depth of eternity? The breath of the 
    Lord kindles the infernal lake, Isa 30:33; where shall we have buckets to 
    quench <i>that </i>fire? </p>
<p align="justify">Oh eternity! If all the body of the earth and sea were 
    turned to sand, and all the air up to the starry heaven were nothing but 
    sand, and<i> a little bird </i>should come every thousand years, and fetch 
    away in her bill but the tenth part of a grain of all that heap of sand; 
    what numberless years would be spent before that vast heap of sand would be 
    fetched away! Yet, if at the end of all that time, the sinner might come out 
    of hell, there would be some <i>hope</i>. But that word "Forever" breaks the 
    heart. "The smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever." What a 
    terror is this to the wicked--enough to put them into a cold sweat, to 
    think, as long as God is eternal, he lives forever to be avenged upon them!</p>
<p align="justify">Here the question may be asked—<font color="#008000"><b>Why 
    should sin that is committed in a short time, be punished eternally?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">We must hold with Augustine, "that God's judgments on the 
    wicked, may be <i>secret</i>—but never <i>unjust</i>." The reason why sin 
    committed in a short time is eternally punished, is, because every sin is 
    committed against an infinite essence, which nothing less than eternity of 
    punishment can satisfy. Why is treason punished with death—but because it is 
    against the king's person, which is sacred; much more that offence which is 
    against God's crown and dignity is of a heinous and infinite nature, and 
    cannot be satisfied with less than eternal punishment.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of comfort to the GODLY. </p></b></font>God is 
    eternal, therefore he lives forever to reward the godly. "To those who seek 
    for glory and honor, eternal life." The people of God are now in a suffering 
    condition. "Bonds and afflictions await me." The wicked are clad in purple, 
    and fare deliciously, while the godly suffer. The <i>goats </i>climb upon 
    high mountains, while Christ's <i>sheep </i>are in the valley of slaughter. 
    But here is the comfort—God is eternal, and he has appointed eternal 
    recompenses for the saints. In heaven are fresh delights, and sweetness 
    without excess. That which is the crown and zenith of heaven's happiness, 
    is—that it is "eternal." Were there but the least suspicion that this glory 
    must cease, it would much eclipse, yes, embitter it; but it is eternal. "An 
    eternal weight of glory." 
<p align="justify">What angel can span eternity? The saints shall bathe 
    themselves in the <i>rivers </i>of divine pleasure; and these rivers can 
    never be dried up. "At your right hand are pleasures for evermore." This is 
    the highest strain in the apostle's rhetoric, "Forever with the Lord!" In 
    heaven, there is peace without trouble, ease without pain, glory without 
    end; "forever with the Lord!" </p>
<p align="justify">Let this comfort the saints in all their troubles; their 
    sufferings are but short—but their reward is eternal! Eternity makes heaven 
    to be heaven! Eternity is the diamond in the ring! Oh blessed <i>day, </i>
    which shall have <i>no night! </i>The <i>sunlight of glory </i>shall rise 
    upon the soul, and never set! Oh blessed <i>spring</i>, that shall have no 
    autumn, or fall of the leaf. The Roman emperors have three crowns set upon 
    their heads—the first of iron, the second of silver, the third of gold; so 
    the Lord sets three crowns on his children—grace, comfort, and glory. The 
    saints' crown is eternal, "You shall receive a crown of glory which never 
    fades away!" The wicked have a never-dying worm; and the godly a 
    never-fading crown! Oh how should this be a spur to virtue! How willing 
    should we be to work for God! Though we have nothing here on earth, God has 
    time enough to reward his people. The crown of eternity shall be set upon 
    their head!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Of exhortation.</p></b></font> <i>Study </i>
    eternity. Our thoughts should chiefly run upon eternity. We all wish for 
    something that may delight our mind. If we could have lived, as Augustine 
    says, from the infancy of the world to the world's old age, what is 
    this—compared to eternity? What is time, measured with eternity? As the 
    earth is but a small point, compared to the heavens. Just so, <b>time </b>is 
    scarcely a moment—compared to eternity! And then, what is this poor life 
    which crumbles away so fast? <i>Oh, think of eternity! 
</i>
<p align="justify">Brethren, we are every day <i>traveling to eternity</i>; 
    and whether we wake or sleep—we are going our journey. Some of us are upon 
    the <i>borders </i>of eternity. Oh study the shortness of life—and length of 
    eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">More particularly think of <i>God's </i>eternity and the
    <i>soul's </i>eternity. Think of <b>God's </b>eternity. He is the <i>Ancient 
    of Days</i>, who was before all time. There is a figurative description of 
    God, "As I kept watching, thrones were set in place, and <i>the Ancient of 
    Days </i>took His seat. His <i>clothing </i>was white like snow, and the <i>
    hair </i>of His head like whitest wool. His throne was flaming fire; its 
    wheels were blazing fire. A river of fire was flowing, coming out from His 
    presence. Thousands upon thousands served Him; ten thousand times ten 
    thousand stood before Him. The court was convened, and the books were 
    opened." Daniel 7:9-10. His clothing was white like snow, which signifies 
    his majesty. His hair, like the pure wool, signifies his holiness. His 
    title, <i>the Ancient of Days</i>, signifies his eternity. </p>
<p align="justify">The thought of God's eternity should make us have high 
    adoring thoughts of God. We are apt to have low, irreverent thoughts of him. 
    "You thought I was such a one as yourself," weak and mortal. But if we would 
    think of God's eternity, when all our power ceases—he is King eternal, his 
    crown flourishes forever, he can make us happy or miserable forever—this 
    would make us have adoring thoughts of God. "The twenty-four elders <i>fall 
    down</i> before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for 
    ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne." Revelation 4:10. 
    The saints <i>fall down</i>, to signify by that humble posture, that they 
    are not worthy to sit in God's presence. They fall down and they worship him 
    who lives forever and ever; they do as it were, kiss his feet. They cast 
    their crowns before the throne, they lay all their honor at his feet; thus 
    they show humble adoration to the eternal essence. Study God's eternity, it 
    will make us adore him—where we cannot fathom him. </p>
<p align="justify">Think of the <b>soul's </b>eternity. As God is eternal, 
    so he has made <i>us </i>eternal. We are never-dying creatures; we are 
    shortly entering upon our eternal state—either of eternal happiness or 
    eternal misery. Have serious thoughts of this. Say, "O my soul, which of 
    these two eternities is likely to be your portion? I must shortly depart 
    hence, and where then shall I go—to which of these eternities, either of 
    glory or misery shall I go?" The serious meditation on the eternal state we 
    are to pass into, would work strongly with us.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Thoughts of eternal torments, are a good antidote 
    against sin. </p></b></font>Sin tempts with its pleasure; but when we think of 
    eternity, it may cool the intemperate heat of lust. Shall I, for the 
    pleasure of sin for a season—endure eternal pain? Sin, like those locusts, 
    Rev 9:7, seems to have on its head a crown like gold—but it has in it a tail 
    like a scorpion, verse 10, and a sting in its tail; and this sting can never 
    be plucked out. Shall I venture eternal wrath? Is sin committed so sweet—as 
    lying in hell forever is bitter? This thought would make us flee from sin, 
    as Moses fled from the serpent!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The serious thoughts of eternal happiness would very 
    much take us off from worldly things. </p></b></font>What are these sublunary 
    things, compared to eternity! They are quickly gone. They greet us—and then 
    take their farewell. But I am to enter upon an <i>everlasting </i>estate; I 
    hope to live with him who is eternal. What then, is the present fleeting 
    world to me? To those who stand upon the top of the Alps—the great cities 
    below are small things in their eyes. Just so, to him who has his thoughts 
    fixed on his eternal state after this life—all these earthly things seem as 
    nothing in his eye. What is the glory of this world? How poor and 
    contemptible, compared with an eternal weight of glory!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The serious thoughts of an eternal state, either of 
    happiness or misery, should have a powerful influence upon whatever we take 
    in hand.</p></b></font> Every work we do promotes either a <i>blessed </i>
    eternity<i>, </i>or a <i>cursed </i>eternity. Every <i>good </i>action sets 
    us a step nearer to an eternity of happiness. Every <i>bad </i>action sets 
    us a step nearer to an eternity of misery. Oh what influence should the 
    thoughts of eternity have upon our pious duties! It should make us do them 
    with all our might. Duty well performed, lifts a Christian higher towards 
    heaven, and sets a Christian a step nearer to a blessed eternity!

<p align="center">4. The IMMUTABILITY of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's <b>unchangeableness</b>. </p>
<p align="justify">"I am the Lord, and <b>I do not change</b>." Malachi 3:6
    </p>
<p align="justify">God is unchangeable in his <b>nature</b>, and in his <b>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] There is no eclipse of his brightness.</p></b></font> His 
    essence shines with a fixed luster. "Who does not <i>change </i>like 
    shifting shadows," James 1:17. "You remain the same, and your years will 
    never end," Psalm 102:27. All <i>created </i>things are full of 
    vicissitudes. Princes and emperors are subject to change. Sesostris, an 
    Egyptian prince, having subdued many <i>kings </i>in war, made them draw his 
    chariot, like horses, as if he intended them to eat grass, as God did King 
    Nebuchadnezzar. The crown has many successors. <i>Kingdoms </i>have their 
    eclipses and convulsions. What has become of the glory of Athens? The pomp 
    of Troy? [Now corn grows, where the great city of Troy once stood]. Though 
    kingdoms have a <i>head of gold</i>, they have <i>feet of clay</i>. 
<p align="justify">The <i>heavens </i>change. "They will perish, but you 
    remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change 
    them and they will be discarded. But you remain the same, and your years 
    will never end." Psalm 102:26-27. The heavens are the most ancient records, 
    where God has written his glory with a sunbeam—yet these shall change. 
    Though I do not think they shall be destroyed as to their substance—yet they 
    shall be changed as to their qualities; they shall melt with fervent heat, 
    and so be more refined and purified. 2 Peter 3:12. Thus the heavens shall be 
    changed—but not <i>he </i>who dwells in heaven. "I am the Lord, and <b>I do 
    not change</b>."</p>
<p align="justify">The best <i>saints </i>have their eclipses and changes. 
    Look upon a Christian in his spiritual estate, and he is full of variation. 
    Though the <i>seed of grace </i>does not <i>die</i>—yet its beauty and 
    activity often <i>wither</i>. A Christian has his <i>anguish fits</i> in 
    piety. Sometimes his faith is at a high tide—and sometimes low ebb; 
    sometimes his love flames—and at another time is like fire in the embers, 
    and he has lost his first love. How strong was David's grace at one time! 
    "God is my rock, in him will I trust." At another time he says, "I shall one 
    day perish by the hand of Saul." What Christian can say he does not find a 
    change in his <i>graces</i>; that the bow of his faith never unbends, the 
    strings of his violin never slacken? Surely we shall never meet with such 
    Christians until we meet them in heaven! But God is without any shadow of 
    change. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>angels </i>were subject to change; they were 
    created holy—but mutable. "The angels which kept not their first estate." 
    Jude 6. These <i>morning </i>stars of heaven were <i>falling </i>stars. But 
    God's glory shines with a fixed brightness. In God there is nothing which 
    can change, for better or worse. He cannot change for the <i>better</i>—because 
    then he would not now be perfect. He cannot change for the worse—for then he 
    would cease to be perfect. He is immutably holy, immutably good; there is no 
    shadow of change in him.</p>
<p align="justify">But when Christ, who is God, assumed the human nature—was 
    there a change in God?</p>
<p align="justify">If the divine nature had been converted into the human, 
    or the human into the divine, there would have been a change—but they were 
    not. The human nature was distinct from the divine nature. Therefore there 
    was no change. A cloud over the sun makes no change in the the sun. Just so, 
    though the divine nature is covered with the human nature, it makes no 
    change in the divine nature.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] There is no end put to his being.</p></b></font> "Who 
    alone has immortality." The Godhead cannot die. An infinite essence cannot 
    be changed into finite; and God is infinite. He is eternal, consequently he 
    is not mortal. To be eternal and mortal is a contradiction.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See the excellence of the divine nature in its 
    immutability. </p></b></font>This is the glory of the Godhead. Mutableness 
    denotes <i>weakness</i>, and is not in God, who is "the <i>same</i>, 
    yesterday, and today, and forever." <i>Men </i>are fickle and mutable, like 
    Reuben, "unstable as water." Men are changeable in their <i>principles</i>. 
    If their faces altered as fast as their opinions—we would not recognize 
    them. Men are changeable in their <i>resolutions</i>; just as the wind that 
    blows in the east, presently turns about to the west. They resolve to be 
    virtuous—but quickly give up of their resolutions. Their minds are like a 
    sick man's pulse, which alters every half hour. The apostle Jude compares 
    them to <i>waves of the sea</i>, and <i>wandering stars</i>. They are not <i>
    pillars </i>in God's temple—but <i>reeds</i> shaken by the wind. Others are 
    changeable in their <i>friendship</i>. They quickly <i>love</i>—and quickly
    <i>hate</i>. Sometimes they will press you to their bosom; later they will 
    excommunicate you out of their favor. They change as the chameleon, into 
    several colors. But God is immutable—he does not change.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: See the vanity of the creature. </p></b></font>There 
    are changes in everything, but in God. "Lowborn men are but a breath, the 
    highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together 
    they are only a breath." Psalm 62:9. We look for more from the creature, 
    than God has put in it. The creature has two evils in it—it promises more 
    than we find—and it fails us when we most need it. A man desires to have his 
    corn harvested—but the rain falls; the mariner is for a voyage—but the wind 
    does not blow, or is contrary; one depends upon another for the payment of a 
    promise, and he fails, and is like a foot out of joint. Who can find a fixed 
    stability in the vain creature? It is as if one should build houses on the 
    sand, where the sea comes in and overflows. The creature is true to nothing 
    but deceit—and is constant only in its disappointments. It is no more 
    astonishing to see changes in the creature, than to see the moon dressing 
    itself in a new shape and figure. Expect to meet with changes in everything, 
    but God.

<font color="#b07050"><b>

    almost boiled away to nothing, and if you lose friends by death—there is a 
    double eclipse. But the comfort is—God is unchangeable. I may lose these 
    things—but I cannot lose my God; he never dies. When the fig-tree and 
    olive-tree failed, God did not fail. "I will rejoice in the God of my 
    salvation." Flowers in the garden die—but a man's portion remains. Just so, 
    outward things die and change—but "you are the strength of my heart, and my 
    portion forever."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) In case of sadness of spirit. </p></b></font>God seems 
    to cast off the soul in desertion. "My Beloved had withdrawn himself." Yet, 
    God is unchangeable. He is immutable in his love; he may change his <i>
    countenance</i>—but not his <i>heart! </i>"I have loved you with an <i>
    everlasting </i>love." Jer 31:1. Hebrew<i>—a love of eternity</i>. If once 
    God's electing love rises upon the soul—it never sets. "Though the mountains 
    be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not 
    be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed—says the Lord, who has 
    compassion on you." Isaiah 54:10. God's love stands firmer than the 
    mountains. His love to Christ is unchangeable; and he will no more cease 
    loving believers, than he will cease loving Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Of exhortation.</p></b></font> Get a saving 
    interest in the unchangeable God, then you are as a rock in the 
    sea—immoveable in the midst of all changes.
<b>
<p align="justify">How shall I get a part in the unchangeable God?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">By having a change wrought in you. "But you are 
    washed—but you are sanctified." By this change we are savingly interested in 
    the unchangeable God.</p>
<p align="justify">Trust to that God, who alone is unchangeable. "Cease from 
    man," stop trusting to the <i>reed</i>—but trust to the <i>Rock </i>of ages. 
    He who is by faith engarrisoned in God, is safe in all changes; he is like a 
    boat that is tied to an immoveable rock. He who trusts in God, trusts in 
    that which cannot fail him; for God is unchangeable. "I will never leave 
    you, nor forsake you." <i>Health </i>may leave us, <i>riches</i>, <i>friends
    </i>may leave us; "but," says God, "I will never leave you; my <i>power </i>
    shall support you; my <i>Spirit </i>shall sanctify you; my <i>mercy </i>
    shall save you! I will never leave you!" Oh trust in this unchangeable God!
    </p>
<p align="justify">God is jealous of two things; of our <i>love</i>, and of 
    our <i>trust</i>. He is jealous of our <b>love</b>, lest we love the 
    creature more than him; therefore he makes it prove bitter. God is jealous 
    of our <b>trust</b>, lest we should place more confidence in the creature, 
    than in him, therefore he makes it prove unfaithful. Outward comforts are 
    given us as food along the way—to refresh us, not as crutches to lean on. If 
    we make the creature an idol, what we make our <i>trust, </i>God will make 
    our <i>shame</i>. Oh trust in the immortal God! Like Noah's dove, we have no 
    footing for our souls, until we get into <i>the ark of God's 
    unchangeableness.</i> "Those who trust in the Lord shall be like mount Zion, 
    which cannot be removed."</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. God is unchangeable in his DECREE.</p></b></font> What he 
    has decreed from eternity is unalterable. "My purpose will stand, and I will 
    do all that I please." Isaiah 46:10. God's eternal counsel or decree, is 
    immutable. If he changed his decree, it must be from some defect of wisdom 
    or foresight, for that is the reason why men change their purposes; they see 
    something afterwards, which they did not see before. But this cannot be the 
    cause why God should alter his decree, because his knowledge is perfect—he 
    sees all things in one entire prospect before him.
<p align="justify">But is not God said to<b> repent? </b>This seems to be a 
    change in his decree? "The Lord repented of the evil that he said he would 
    do unto them."</p>
<p align="justify">Repentance is attributed to God, <i>figuratively</i>. "He 
    is not a man, that he should repent." There may be a change in God's <i>work</i>—but 
    not in his <i>will</i>. He may will a change—but not change his will. "God 
    may change his sentence—but not his decree." A king may cause sentence to be 
    passed upon a malefactor whom he intends to save; so God threatened 
    destruction to Nineveh—but the people of Nineveh repenting, God spared them. 
    Here God changed his sentence—but not his decree; it was what had lain in 
    the womb of his purpose from eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">But if God's decree is unchangeable, and cannot be 
    reversed, then to what purpose should we use the <b>means</b>? Our endeavors 
    towards salvation cannot alter his decree.</p>
<p align="justify">The decree of God does not affect my endeavor; for he who 
    decreed my salvation, decreed it in the use of means; and if I neglect the 
    means I reprobate myself. No man argues thus: "God has decreed how long I 
    shall live, therefore I will not use any means to preserve my life, I will 
    not eat and drink." As God has decreed the length of my life, in the use of 
    means—so God has decreed my salvation in the use of the Word and of prayer. 
    As a man who refuses food murders himself—just so, he who refuses to work 
    out his salvation destroys himself. The vessels of mercy are said to be <i>
    prepared </i>unto glory. How are they prepared, but by being sanctified? and 
    that cannot be, but in the use of means. Therefore let not God's decree, 
    take you off from holy endeavors. It is a good saying of Preston, "Have you 
    a heart to pray to God? it is a sign that no decree of wrath has passed 
    against you."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: If God's decree is eternal and unchangeable, 
    then God does not elect upon our <i>foreseen </i>faith, as the Arminians 
    maintain.</p></b></font> "The children being not yet born, that the purpose of 
    God according to election might stand, it was said, Jacob have I loved, Esau 
    have I hated." Romans 9:11, 13. We are not elected <i>for </i>our 
    holiness—but <i>to </i>holiness. Eph 1:1. If we are not <i>justified </i>for 
    our faith, much less are we <i>elected </i>for our faith. We are said to be 
    justified <i>through </i>faith as an instrument—but not <i>for </i>faith as 
    a cause; and, if not justified <i>for </i>faith, then much less elected <i>
    for </i>faith. God's decree of election, is eternal and unchangeable, and 
    therefore depends not upon foreseen faith. "As many as were ordained to 
    eternal life, believed." They were not elected because they believed—but 
    they believed because they were elected.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If God's decree is unchangeable, it gives 
    comfort in two cases. </p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Concerning God's providence towards his church.</p></b></font> 
    We are ready to quarrel with Providence, if everything does not accord with 
    our desire. Remember God's work goes on, and nothing happens, but what he 
    has decreed from eternity. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) God has decreed troubles for the church's good.</p></b></font> 
    The <i>troubles </i>of God's church, are like the angel's troubling the 
    water, which made way for <i>healing </i>his people. God has decreed 
    troubles in the church. "His fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem." 
    The wheels in a watch move contrary to one another—but they all carry on the 
    motion of the watch. Just so, the wheels of Providence often move contrary 
    to our desires—but still they carry on God's unchangeable decree. "Many 
    shall be made white." God lets the <i>waters of affliction</i> be poured on 
    his people—to make them white. Therefore, do not murmur at God's dealings! 
    His work goes on; nothing happens, but what he has wisely decreed from 
    eternity. Everything shall promote God's design, and fulfill his decree.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Comfort to the GODLY in regard of their 
    salvation. </p></b></font>"The foundation of God stands sure, having this 
    seal—The Lord knows those who are his." God's counsel of election is 
    unchangeable. Once elected—forever elected. "I will not blot his name out of 
    the book of life." The book of God's decree has no <i>errata </i>in it, no 
    blottings out. Once justified, never unjustified. "Repentance shall be hid 
    from my eyes." Hos 13:14. God never repents of his electing love. "He loved 
    them to the end." Therefore, if you are a believer, comfort yourself with 
    this—the immutability of God's decree.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: To conclude with a word to the WICKED, who 
    march furiously against God and his people—let them know that God's decree 
    is unchangeable. </p></b></font>God will not alter it, nor can they break it! 
    While they resist God's will, they fulfill it. There is a two-fold will of 
    God—the will of God's <i>precept</i>, and the will of his <i>decree</i>. 
    While the wicked resist the will of God's precept, they fulfill the will of 
    his permissive decree. Judas betrays Christ, Pilate condemns him, the 
    soldiers crucify him; while they resist the will of God's precepts, they 
    fulfill the will of his permissive decree. "For, in fact, in this city both 
    Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 
    assembled together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, to do 
    whatever Your hand and Your plan had predestined to take place." Acts 
    4:27-28. 
<p align="justify">God commands one thing, they do the contrary. While they 
    disobey his command, they fulfill his permissive decree. If a man sets up 
    two nets, one of silk, the other of iron, the silken net may be broken, not 
    the iron one. Just so, while men break the silken net of God's command, they 
    are taken in the iron net of his decree; while they sit backward to God's 
    precepts, they row forward to his decrees. God decrees to <i>permit </i>
    their sin, and then to <i>punish </i>them for their sin permitted.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">5. The WISDOM of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's wisdom, which is one of the 
    brightest beams of the Godhead. "He is wise in heart." The heart is the seat 
    of wisdom. Among the Hebrews, the heart is put for wisdom. "Men of 
    understanding," Job 34:34. The Hebrew is "Men of heart." God is wise in 
    heart, that is, he is most wise. </p>
<p align="justify">God <b>alone </b>is wise—he solely and wholly possesses 
    all wisdom; therefore he is called, "the only wise God." All the treasures 
    of wisdom are locked up in him, and no creature can have any wisdom but as 
    God is pleased to give it out of his treasury. </p>
<p align="justify">God is <b>perfectly </b>wise; there is no defect in his 
    wisdom. Men may be wise in some things—but in other things they show 
    imprudence and weakness. But God is the exemplar and pattern of wisdom, and 
    the pattern must be perfect. "As your heavenly Father is perfect." Matthew 
    5:48. God's wisdom appears in two things: </p>
<p align="justify">I. His infinite intelligence. </p>
<p align="justify">II. His exact working.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. His infinite INTELLIGENCE.</p></b></font> He knows the 
    most profound secrets. "Our Lord is great, vast in power; <b>His 
    understanding is infinite</b>." Psalm 147:5. "There is a God in heaven who
    <i>reveals secrets</i>, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what <i>will 
    happen in the future</i>." Daniel 2:28. He knows the thoughts, which are the 
    most intricate subtle things. "I know full well what you are thinking." Job 
    21:27. "The Lord knows the thoughts of man." Psalm 94:11. Let sin be 
    contrived ever so secretly, God will pull off all masks and disguises, and 
    make a heart-anatomy. He knows all future contingencies; all things are 
    before him in one clear prospect.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. His exact and meticulous WORKING. </p></b></font>He is 
    wise in heart; his wisdom lies in his <b>works</b>. These works of God are 
    bound up in three great volumes, where we may read his wisdom.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The work of CREATION.</p></b></font> The creation is both 
    a monument of God's power, and a looking-glass in which we may see his 
    wisdom. None but a wise God could so meticulously contrive the world. Behold 
    the earth decked with variety of <i>flowers</i>, which are both for beauty 
    and fragrance. Behold the heaven bespangled with <i>lights</i>. We may see 
    the glorious wisdom of God blazing in the sun, twinkling in the stars. His 
    wisdom is seen in marshaling and <i>ordering everything in its proper place 
    and sphere</i>. If the sun had been set lower, it would have burnt us; if 
    higher, it would not have warmed us with its beams. God's wisdom is seen in 
    appointing the <i>seasons </i>of the year. "You have made summer and 
    winter." If it had been all summer, the heat would have scorched us; if all 
    winter, the cold would have killed us. The wisdom of God is seen in <i>
    chequering the dark and the light</i>. If it had been all night, there would 
    have been no labor; if all day, there would have been no rest. Wisdom is 
    seen in <i>mixing the elements</i>, as the earth with the sea. If it had 
    been all sea, we would have lacked bread; if it had been all earth, we would 
    have lacked water. The wisdom of God is seen in <i>preparing and ripening 
    the fruits </i>of the earth, in the wind and frost which prepare the fruits, 
    and in the sun and rain which ripen the fruits. God's wisdom is seen in 
    setting bounds to the <i>sea</i>, and so wisely contriving it, that though 
    the sea is higher than many parts of the earth—yet it should not overflow 
    the earth. We may cry out with the Psalmist, "O Lord, how manifold are your 
    works! in wisdom have you made them all." There is nothing to be seen in 
    this world, but <i>miracles of God's wisdom. 
</i>
<p align="justify">God's wisdom is seen in ordering <i>social </i>things, 
    that one shall have need of another. The poor need the rich man's money, and 
    the rich need the poor man's labor. God makes one trade depend upon 
    another—that one may be helpful to another, and that mutual love may be 
    preserved.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The second work wherein God's wisdom shines forth is 
    the work of REDEMPTION.</p></b></font> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Redemption is the masterpiece of divine wisdom.</p></b></font> 
    God has contrived a way for happiness for sinful man—and still uphold his 
    justice! We may cry out with the apostle, "O the depth of the riches both of 
    the wisdom and knowledge of God!" This has astonished men and angels. If God 
    had left <i>us </i>to find out a way of salvation when we were lost—we could 
    neither have had a head to devise, nor a heart to desire—what God's infinite 
    wisdom had planned for us. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Mercy </p></i>had a mind to save sinners, and was loath that 
    the justice of God should be wronged. "It is a pity," says Mercy, "that such 
    a noble creature as man should be eternally undone; and yet God's justice 
    must not be a loser. What way then shall be found out? Angels cannot satisfy 
    for the wrong done to God's justice; nor is it fit that one nature should 
    sin—and another nature suffer. What then? Shall man be forever lost?" Now, 
    while <i>Mercy </i>was thus debating with itself, what to do for the 
    recovery of fallen man, the <i>Wisdom </i>of God stepped in—and thus the 
    oracle spoke: "Let God become man; let the Second Person in the Trinity 
    become incarnate, and suffer; and so for fitness he shall be man, and for 
    ability he shall be God! Thus justice may be satisfied, and man saved!" O 
    the depth of the riches of the wisdom of God—thus to make <i>justice </i>and
    <i>mercy </i>to kiss each other! Great is this mystery, "God manifest in the 
    flesh." What wisdom was this—that Christ should be made sin—yet know no sin; 
    that God should condemn the sin—yet save the sinner! Here was wisdom—to find 
    out the way of salvation. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The means by which salvation is applied—sets forth 
    God's wisdom</p></b></font>—that salvation should be by faith, not by works. 
    Faith is a humble grace—it gives all to Christ; it is an adorer of free 
    grace. And free grace being advanced here, God has his glory; and it is his 
    highest wisdom to exalt his own glory. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The way of working faith—declares God's wisdom.</p></b></font> 
    It is wrought by the word preached. "Faith comes by hearing." What is the <i>
    weak breath of a man—</i>to convert a soul? It is like whispering in the 
    ears of a dead man. This is foolishness in the eye of the world; but the 
    Lord loves to show his wisdom by that which seems folly. "He has chosen the 
    foolish things of the world to confound the wise." Why so? "So that no one 
    can ever boast in the presence of God." 
<p align="justify">If God were to convert by the ministry of <i>angels</i>—then 
    we would be ready to glory in angels, and give that honor to them which is 
    due to God; but when God works by weak tools, makes use of men who are of 
    like passions with ourselves, and by them converts, then the power is 
    plainly seen to be of God. "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to 
    show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us!" Herein is 
    God's wisdom seen, that no flesh may glory in his Presence.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The wisdom of God wonderfully appears in the works of 
    his PROVIDENCE. </p></b></font>Every providence has a <i>mercy </i>or a <i>
    wonder </i>enrapt up in it. The wisdom of God, in his works of providence, 
    appears:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By effecting great things—by small contemptible 
    means.</p></b></font> He cured the stung Israelites, by a brazen serpent. If 
    some sovereign antidote had been used, if the balm of Gilead had been 
    brought, there would have been some likelihood of a cure; but what was there 
    in a brazen serpent? It was a mere <i>model</i>—and not a <i>real </i>
    serpent; and it was not physically applied to him who was wounded; he was 
    only to <i>look </i>upon it; yet this wrought a cure! The less probability 
    in the <i>instrument</i>—the more is God's wisdom seen!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The wisdom of God is seen in doing his work, by that 
    which to the eye of flesh seems quite contrary.</p></b></font> God intended to 
    advance Joseph, and to make all his brethren's sheaves bow to his sheaf. 
    Now, what way does he take? First <b>Joseph </b>is thrown into the pit; then 
    sold into Egypt; then after that put in prison. But by his imprisonment God 
    made way for his advancement. For God to save in an <i>ordinary </i>
    way—would not so much display his wisdom. But when he goes <i>strangely </i>
    to work, and <i>saves </i>in that very way in which we think he will <i>
    destroy</i>—his wisdom shines forth in a most conspicuous manner!
<p align="justify">God would make <b>Israel </b>victorious, and what way 
    does he take? He <i>lessens </i>Gideon's army. "The people that are with you 
    are too many." He reduces the army of thirty-two thousand, to three hundred; 
    and by taking away the <i>means </i>of victory, makes Israel victorious. </p>
<p align="justify">God had a design to bring his people out of <b>Egypt</b>, 
    and a strange course he takes to effect it! He stirred up the hearts of the 
    Egyptians to hate them. "He turned their heart to hate his people." The more 
    they hated and oppressed Israel, the more God plagued the Egyptians, and the 
    more glad they were to let Israel go. The Egyptians were urgent that they 
    might send them out of the land in haste. </p>
<p align="justify">God had a mind to save <b>Jonah </b>when he was cast into 
    the sea—so he let the fish swallow him up, and so brought him to the shore.
    </p>
<p align="justify">God would save <b>Paul</b>, and all who were in the ship 
    with him—but the ship must be wrecked, so that they could all came safely to 
    land upon the broken pieces of the ship. Acts 27:74. </p>
<p align="justify">In reference to the <b>church</b>, God often goes by <i>
    contrary </i>means, and makes the enemy do his work. God can make a straight 
    stroke, with a crooked stick. He has often made his church <i>grow </i>and
    <i>flourish </i>by <i>persecution</i>. "The showers of blood have made her 
    more fruitful," says Julian. Exod 1:10. "Come, we must deal shrewdly with 
    them or they will become even more numerous." But the way the Egyptians took 
    to suppress them, made them multiply. Verse 12. "But the more they were 
    oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to 
    dread the Israelites." Just like the soil—the more it is <i>harrowed</i>, 
    the better crop it bears. The apostles were scattered by persecution, and 
    their scattering was like the scattering of seed. They went up and down, and 
    preached the gospel, and brought daily converts. Paul was put in prison, and 
    his chains were the means of spreading the gospel. "Now I want you to know, 
    brothers, that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the 
    advancement of the gospel." Philippians 1:12.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The wisdom of God is seen in making the most 
    desperate evils, to work to the good of his children.</p></b></font> As several 
    poisonous ingredients, wisely tempered by the skill of the apothecary, make 
    a sovereign medicine—so God makes the most deadly afflictions work together 
    for the good of his children. He uses severe afflictions to purify them, and 
    prepare them for heaven. "For our momentary light affliction is producing 
    for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory!" 2 Corinthians 
    4:17. These <i>hard frosts</i> hasten the spring flowers of glory! The wise 
    God, by <i>a divine chemistry</i>, turns our afflictions into cordials. He 
    makes his people <i>gainers </i>by <i>losses</i>; and turns their <i>crosses
    </i>into <i>blessings</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) The wisdom of God is seen in this—that the sins of 
    men shall carry on God's work; yet he himself should have no hand in their 
    sin.</p></b></font> The Lord <i>permits </i>sin—but does not <i>approve </i>it. 
    He has a hand in the <i>action </i>in which sin is—but not in the <i>sin </i>
    of the action. As in the crucifying of Christ, so far as it was a natural 
    action, God concurred; if he had not given the Jews life and breath, they 
    could not have done it; but as it was a sinful action, so God abhorred it. A 
    musician plays upon a violin which is out of tune; the musician is the cause 
    of the sound—but the jarring and discord is from the violin itself. Just so, 
    men's <i>natural </i>motion is from God—but their <i>sinful </i>motion is 
    from themselves. When a man rides on a lame horse, his riding is the cause 
    why the horse goes—but the lameness is from the horse itself. Herein is 
    God's wisdom—that the sins of men carry on his work—yet he has no hand in 
    them!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) The wisdom of God is seen in helping in desperate 
    cases. </p></b></font>God loves to show his wisdom—when human help and wisdom 
    fail. Exquisite lawyers love to wrestle with difficult law cases, as this 
    more shows their skill. God's wisdom is never at a loss; but when 
    providences are darkest, then the <i>morning star of deliverance </i>
    appears. "He remembered us in our <i>low </i>estate." Sometimes God melts 
    away the spirits of his enemies. "The Lord has surely given the whole land 
    into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us." Joshua 
    2:24. Sometimes he finds them other work to do, and sounds a retreat to 
    them, as he did to Saul when he was pursuing David. "The Philistines are in 
    the land." When the church seems to be upon destruction, and her peace and 
    liberty ready to be sacrificed, then the deliverance comes.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) God's wisdom is seen in befooling wise men, and in 
    making their wisdom the means of their overthrow.</p></b></font> Ahithophel had 
    deep understanding. "The counsel Ahithophel gave was like that of one who 
    inquires of God;" but he consulted his own shame. "The Lord turned his 
    counsel into foolishness." "God takes the wise in their own craftiness;" 
    that is, when they think to deal wisely, he not only <i>disappoints </i>
    them—but <i>ensnares </i>them. The snares they lay for others, catch 
    themselves! "They have fallen into the pit they dug for others. They have 
    been caught in their own trap." God loves to counterplot politicians; he 
    makes use of their own wit to undo them. He hangs Haman up on his own 
    gallows.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Adore the wisdom of God.</p></b></font> It is an 
    infinite deep; the angels cannot search into it. "Oh, the depth of the 
    riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable His 
    judgments and untraceable His ways!" Romans 11:33. As we should <i>adore</i> 
    the wisdom of God—so we should <i>rest </i>in the wisdom of God. God sees 
    what condition is best for us. Did we believe the wisdom of God, it would 
    keep us from murmuring. <b>Rest </b>in God's wisdom.

<p align="justify">(1.) Rest in God's wisdom—in lack of spiritual comfort.
    </p></b></font>God is wise; he sometimes sees it good, that we should be without 
    comfort. Perhaps we would be lifted up in pride if we had spiritual 
    enlargements; as Paul, with his revelations. "Especially because of the 
    extraordinary revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a 
    thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me so I 
    would not exalt myself." 2 Corinthians 12:7. It is hard to have the heart 
    low—when comfort is high. God sees <i>humility </i>to be better for us than
    <i>joy</i>. It is better to lack comfort, and be humble—than to have it, and 
    be proud! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Rest in God's wisdom—in lack of bodily strength</p></b></font>, 
    rest in God's wisdom. He sees what is best. Perhaps the less health—the more 
    grace. Perhaps the weaker in body—the stronger in faith. "Though our outward 
    man is perishing—yet the inward man is renewed day by day." At Rome there 
    were two laurel trees; when the one withered, the other flourished. When God 
    shakes the <i>tree </i>of the body, he is gathering the <i>fruits </i>of 
    righteousness. "No <i>discipline </i>seems enjoyable at the time, but 
    painful. Later on, however, it yields the fruit of peace and righteousness 
    to those who have been trained by it." Hebrews 12:11.<b> Sickness is God's 
    lance—to let out the poison of sin. </b>"The Lord did this to purge away 
    Israels' sin." Isaiah 27:9. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>

    ready to kill ourselves with worry—let us rest in God's wisdom. He knows 
    best what he has to do. "Your way went through the sea, and Your path 
    through the great waters, but <i>Your footprints were unseen</i>." Psalms 
    77:19. <b>Trust his heart—where you cannot trace his hand. </b>God is most 
    in his way, when we think he is most out of the way. When we think God's 
    church is, as it were, in the grave, and there is a tombstone laid upon her, 
    his wisdom can roll away the stone from the sepulcher. "Christ comes leaping 
    over <i>mountains</i>." Either his <i>power </i>can remove the mountain, or 
    his <i>wisdom </i>knows how to leap over it! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Rest in God's wisdom—in case we are low in the 
    world, or have but little oil in our cruse</p></b></font>—let us rest in God's

    us from pride or worldliness. </i>God knew if your <i>estate </i>had not 
    been lost—your <i>soul </i>would have been lost. God saw that <i>riches </i>
    would be a snare unto you. "But those who want to be rich fall into 
    temptation, a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge 
    people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all 
    kinds of evil, and by craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and 
    pierced themselves with many pains." 1 Timothy 6:9-10. Are you troubled that 
    God has prevented a snare? God will make you rich in faith. What you lack in 
    temporals, shall be made up in spirituals. God will give you more of his 
    love. You are weak in estate—but God will make you strong in assurance. Oh 
    rest in God's wisdom! He will carve the choicest piece for you!

    Kings 3:9-10. Here is encouragement for us; "If any one lacks wisdom, let

    "Lord, give me wisdom, to know the fallacy of my heart; the subtleties of

<p align="center">6. The OMNIPOTENCE of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's power. "If I speak of 
    strength, lo, he is strong." In this chapter is a magnificent description of 
    God's power. "Lo, he is strong." The Hebrew word for <i>strong </i>signifies 
    a <i>conquering</i>, <i>prevailing strength</i>. "He is strong." The 
    superlative degree is intended here; namely, He is <i>most </i>strong. He is 
    called <i>El-shaddai</i>, 'God Almighty'. His almightiness lies in this—that 
    he can do whatever is feasible. Divines distinguish between authority and 
    power. God has both.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. He has a sovereign right and AUTHORITY over man.</p></b></font> 
    He can do with his creatures as he pleases. Who shall dispute with God? who 
    shall ask him a reason of his doings? "All the people of the earth are 
    nothing compared to him. He has the power to do as he pleases among the 
    angels of heaven and with those who live on earth. No one can stop him or 
    challenge him, saying—What do you mean by doing these things?" Daniel 4:35. 
    God sits as judge in the highest court; he calls the monarchs of the earth 
    to the bar, and is not bound to give a reason of his proceedings. "He puts 
    down one, and raises up another." He has <i>salvation </i>and <i>damnation
    </i>in his power. He has the <i>key of justice</i> in his hand, to lock up 
    whomever he will, in the fiery prison of hell! And he has the <i>key of 
    mercy</i> in his hand, to open heaven's gate to whomever he pleases! The 
    name engraved upon his vesture is, "King of kings, and Lord of lords!" He 
    sits Lord paramount, and who can call him to account? The world is <i>God's 
    house</i>, and shall not he do what desires will in his own house? "I will 
    have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have 
    compassion. It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on 
    God's mercy." Romans 9:15-16. "My purpose will stand, and I will do all that 
    I please!" Isaiah 46:10. "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, 
    reigns!" Revelation 19:6. "Our God is in heaven and does whatever He 
    pleases." Psalm 115:3. "The Lord does whatever He pleases in heaven and on 
    earth, in the seas and all the depths." Psalm 135:6.
<p align="justify">It was God who made King Nebuchadnezzar to eat grass; and 
    who threw the angels to hell when they sinned. "How you are fallen from 
    heaven, O shining star, son of the morning! You have been thrown down to the 
    earth." Isa 14:12. "He sets bounds to the sea, and bridles the proud waves." 
    God is the supreme monarch, all power is seated originally in him. "The 
    powers that be, are ordained of God." Kings hold their crowns of him. "By me 
    kings reign."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. As God has authority, so he has infinite POWER.</p></b></font> 
    What is authority without power? "He is mighty in strength." This power of 
    God is seen.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] In the CREATION.</p></b></font> To create requires 
    infinite power. All the world cannot make a fly. God's power in creating is 
    evident; because he needs <i>no instruments</i> to work with; he can work 
    without tools; because he needs <i>no matter </i>to work upon; he creates 
    matter, and then works upon it; and because he works <i>without labor</i>; 
    "He <i>spoke</i>, and it was done."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The power of God is seen in the CONVERSION of souls.</p></b></font> 
    The same power draws a sinner to God, which drew Christ out of the grave to 
    heaven. Eph 1:19. Greater power is put forth in <i>conversion, </i>than in
    <i>creation</i>. When God made the world, he met with no opposition; as he 
    had nothing to <i>help </i>him, so he had nothing to <i>hinder </i>him. But 
    when he converts a sinner, he meets with <i>opposition</i>. <i>Satan </i>
    opposes him, and the sinner's <i>heart </i>opposes him; a sinner is angry 
    with converting grace. The world was the "work of God's <i>fingers</i>." 
    Conversion is the "work of God's <i>arm</i>." In the creation, God wrought 
    but one miracle, he only <i>spoke </i>the word. But, in conversion, he works 
    many miracles; the <i>blind </i>man is made to see, the <i>dead </i>man is 
    raised, the <i>deaf </i>man hears the voice of the Son of God. Oh, the 
    infinite power of Jehovah! Before his scepter, angels veil and prostrate 
    themselves, and kings cast their crowns at his feet!
<p align="justify">"He touches the land, and it shall melt." "He removes the 
    earth out of her place." An earthquake makes the earth tremble upon her 
    pillars—but God shakes it out of its place; he can remove the earth from its 
    center. He can do what he will; his <i>power </i>is as large as his <i>will</i>. 
    Were men's power as large as their will, what work would they make in the 
    world! God's power is of equal extent with his will. He with a word can 
    unpin the wheels, and break the axle of the creation. He can do "more than 
    we can think." He can suspend natural agents. He sealed up the lions' 
    mouths; he made the fire not to burn; he made the waters to stand up on a 
    heap; he caused the sun to go ten degrees backward in the dial of Ahaz. What 
    can overcome Omnipotence? "He humbles the spirit of leaders; He is feared by 
    the kings of the earth." Psalm 76:12. </p>
<p align="justify">He counter-works his enemies; he pulls down their flags 
    and banners of pride, frustrates their counsels, breaks their forces; and he 
    does it with ease, with the turning of his hand; "with his breath," a look, 
    a glance of his eye is all it needs cost God to destroy his enemies. "The 
    Lord <i>looked </i>down on the Egyptian army from the pillar of fire and 
    cloud, and he threw them into confusion." Exod 14:24. Who shall stop him in 
    his march? God commands, and all creatures in heaven and earth obey him. </p>
<p align="justify">Xerxes, the Persian monarch, threw fetters into the sea, 
    when its waves swelled, as if he would have chained the waters; but when God
    <i>speaks</i>, the wind and sea obey him. If he says but the word, the stars 
    fight in their courses against Sisera; if he stamps with his foot, an army 
    of angels shall presently be in battalia. What can omnipotent power not do? 
    "The Lord is a man of war." "He has a mighty arm." "God's power is a 
    glorious power."</p>
<p align="justify">It is an <b>irresistible </b>power. "Who has resisted his 
    will?" To contest with him, is as if the thorns should set themselves in 
    battle array against the fire; or, as if an infirm child should fight with 
    an archangel. If the sinner is once taken in God's iron net, there is no 
    escape. "There is none who can deliver out of my hand."</p>
<p align="justify">God's power is <b>inexhaustible</b>; it is never spent or 
    wasted. Men, while they exercise their strength, weaken it; but God has an 
    everlasting spring of strength in himself. Though he spends his arrows upon 
    his enemies—yet he does not spend his strength. "I will heap calamities upon 
    them and spend my arrows against them." Deut 32:23. "Have you never heard or 
    understood? Don't you know that the Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator 
    of all the earth? He never grows faint or weary." Isaiah 40:28.</p>
<p align="justify">God cannot do all things, because he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p align="justify">Though God can do all things, he cannot do that which 
    stains the glory of his Godhead. He cannot sin; he cannot do that which 
    implies a contradiction. To be a God of truth, and yet deny himself, is a 
    contradiction.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: If God is infinite in power, let us FEAR him.</p></b></font> 
    We fear such as are in power. "Do you not fear Me? Do you not tremble before 
    Me?" Jer 5:52. He has power to cast our souls and bodies into hell. "Who 
    knows the power of his wrath?" The same breath that made us—can dissolve us! 
    "His fury is poured out like fire; the rocks are thrown down by him." 
    Solomon says, "The <i>king's </i>command is backed by great power. No one 
    can resist or question it;" how much more is the command of God! Oh let us 
    fear this mighty God! The fear of God will drive out all other base fear.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: See the deplorable condition of WICKED men.</p></b></font> 
    (1.) This power of God is not for them. (2.) This power of God is against 
    the wicked.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) This power of God is not for them.</p></b> They have no 
    union with God, therefore they have no warrant to lay claim to his power. 
    His power is no relief to them. He has power to forgive sins—but he will not 
    put forth his power towards an impenitent sinner. God's power is an eagle's 
    wing, to carry the saints to heaven; but what privilege is that to the 
    wicked? Though a man will carry his <i>child </i>in his arms over a 
    dangerous stream—yet he will not carry an <i>enemy</i>. God's power is not 
    engaged to help those who fight against him. Let miseries come upon the 
    wicked, they have none to help them; they are like a ship in a storm without 
    a pilot, and driven upon the rocks.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) This power of God is against the wicked.</p></b> God's 
    power will not be the sinner's <i>shield </i>to defend him—but a <i>sword
    </i>to wound him! God's power will bind the sinner in chains. His power 
    serves to revenge the wrong done to his mercy. He will be Almighty to damn 
    the sinner. Now, in what a dreadful condition is every unbeliever? God's 
    power is engaged against him! "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands 
    of the living God!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: It reproves such as do not BELIEVE the power 
    of God.</p></b></font> We say we do not doubt of God's power—but his will. But 
    indeed it is his power that we question. "Is anything too hard for God?" We 
    stagger through unbelief, as if the arm of God's power were shrunk, and he 
    could not help in desperate cases. Take away a king's power, and we unking 
    him; take away the Lord's power, and we ungod him. Yet how guilty of this 
    are we! Did not <i>Israel </i>question God's power? "Can he prepare a table 
    in the wilderness?" They thought the wilderness was a fitter place for 
    making graves, than spreading a table. Did not <i>Martha </i>doubt Christ's 
    power? "He has been dead <i>four </i>days." If Christ had been there while 
    Lazarus was sick, or when he had just died, Martha did not question but he 
    could have raised him; but he had lain in the grave <i>four </i>days, and 
    now she seemed to question his power. Christ had as much to do, to raise her 
    faith as to raise her dead brother. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Moses</p></i>, though a holy man, limited God's power through 
    unbelief. "But Moses said, "There are 600,000 foot soldiers here with me, 
    and yet you promise them meat for a whole month! Even if we butchered all 
    our flocks and herds, would that satisfy them? Even if we caught all the 
    fish in the sea, would that be enough?" Then the Lord said to Moses, "Is 
    there any limit to my power? Now you will see whether or not my word comes 
    true!" Numbers 11:21-23. This is a great affront to God, to deny his power. 
    That men doubt of God's power, appears by their taking indirect courses; for 
    they would not defraud in their dealings, and use false weights, if they 
    believed the power of God could provide for them; and by depending more upon 
    second causes than upon God. "Even when the disease became life threatening, 
    he did not seek the Lord's help but sought help only from his physicians." 2 
    Chronicles 16:12.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: If God is infinite in power, let us take heed 
    of hardening our hearts against him.</p></b></font> "Who has hardened himself 
    against him and prospered?" Job sends a challenge to all creatures in heaven 
    and earth. Who ever took up the sword against God, and came off conqueror? 
    For a person to go on daringly in any sin, is to harden his heart against 
    God, and to raise a war against heaven. Let him remember God is <i>El-Shaddai</i>, 
    almighty; he will be too hard for those who oppose him. "Have you an arm 
    like God?" Such as will not bow to his <i>golden scepter</i>, shall be 
    broken with his <i>iron rod</i>. 
<p align="justify">Julian hardened his heart against God, he opposed him to 
    his face; but what did he get at last? Did he prosper? Being wounded in 
    battle, he threw up his blood into the air, and said to Christ, "O Galilean, 
    you have overcome! I acknowledge your power, whose name and truth I have 
    opposed." Will <i>folly </i>contend with wisdom; <i>weakness </i>with power; 
    the <i>finite </i>with the infinite? Oh take heed of hardening your heart 
    against God! He can send legions of angels to avenge his quarrel. It is 
    better to meet God with tears in your eyes—than weapons in your hand. You 
    may overcome him sooner by repentance—than by resistance.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Get a saving interest in God, and then this 
    glorious power is engaged for you. </p></b></font>He promises under oath, that 
    he will put forth the whole power of his Godhead for the good of his people. 
    "The Lord Almighty is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel." This 
    almightiness of God's power is a wonderful support and comfort to the 
    believer. It was Samson's riddle. "Out of the strong came forth sweetness;" 
    so out of the attribute of God's power, out of this strong, comes forth 
    sweetness. It is COMFORT in several cases.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) In case of strong corruption.</p></b> "My sins," says a 
    child of God, "are potent. I have no power against this army that comes 
    against me. I pray, and humble my soul by fasting; but my sins return upon 
    me!" Ay, but do you believe the power of God? The strong God can conquer 
    your strong corruption; though sin is too hard for <i>you</i>—yet not for <i>
    him! </i>He can soften hard hearts, and quicken the dead. "Is anything too 
    hard for the Lord?" Set his power to work, by faith and prayer. Say, "Lord! 
    it is not for your honor that the devil should be so prevalent within me; 
    oh, break the head of this leviathan! Abba, Father, all things are possible 
    to you!"
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) In case of strong temptation.</p></b> Satan is called 
    the strong man; but remember the power of God. Christ is called, "The <i>
    Lion </i>of the tribe of Judah," he has broken the serpent's head upon the 
    cross. Satan is a <i>chained </i>enemy, and a <i>conquered </i>enemy. Our <i>
    Michael </i>is stronger than the dragon.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Comfort in case of weakness of grace, and fear of 
    falling away.</p></b> "I pray—but I cannot send out strong cries. I believe—but 
    the hand of my faith shakes and trembles." Cannot God strengthen weak 
    grace?" "My strength is made perfect in weakness: most gladly therefore will 
    I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon 
    me." "I fear I shall not hold out!" Christian, do you believe the power of 
    God? Has not God preserved your grace thus far? May you not set up your 
    Ebenezer? God has kept your grace hitherto—as a spark in the midst of the 
    ocean; and is not he able still to keep it? "God, in his mighty power, will 
    protect you until you receive this salvation." 1 Peter 1:5. God's <i>mercy
    </i>pardons us—but his <i>power </i>preserves us. He who by his power keeps 
    the stars, that they do not fall from their orbs—keeps our grace that it 
    does not fail.
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Comfort in case of deficiency in your estate. </p></b>
    God can multiply the oil in the cruse; miraculously he can raise up 
    supplies. Cannot he who provides for the <i>birds </i>of the air, provide 
    for his <i>children</i>? Cannot he who clothes the <i>lilies </i>clothe his
    <i>lambs</i>?
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Comfort in regard of the resurrection.</p></b> It seems 
    difficult to believe, that the bodies of men, after being eaten up by worms, 
    devoured by beasts and fish, or burned to ashes, should be raised the same 
    bodies; but if we believe the power of God, it is no great wonder. Which is 
    harder—to create, or raise the dead? He who can <i>make </i>a body of 
    nothing, can <i>restore </i>it to its parts when mingled and blended with 
    other substances. "With God all things are possible." If we believe the 
    first article of the creed—that God is almighty; we may quickly believe the 
    other article—the resurrection of the body. God can raise the dead because 
    of his <i>power</i>, and he cannot but raise them because of his <i>truth</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">(6.) It is comfort in reference to the church of God.</p></b> 
    He can save and deliver it when it is brought low. The enemies have power in 
    their hand—but God will restrain them. He can either <i>confine </i>the 
    enemy's power, or <i>confound </i>it. "If God is for us, who can be against 
    us?" God can create rejoicing in Jerusalem. The church in Ezekiel is 
    compared to dry bones—but God made breath to enter into them, and they 
    lived. The <i>ship of the church </i>may be tossed, because sin is in it—but 
    it shall not be overwhelmed, because Christ is in it. All the church's pangs 
    shall help forward her deliverance. "God is our refuge and strength, always 
    ready to help in times of trouble. So we will not fear, even if earthquakes 
    come and the mountains crumble into the sea. Let the oceans roar and foam. 
    Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge!" Psalm 46:1-3.
