<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Beauty of Grace</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><i>"May grace and peace be multiplied to you."</i> 1 
    Peter 1:2 </p>
<p align="justify">The blessed apostle, having felt the efficacy and 
    sovereignty of grace, is taken up with the thoughts of it; and so sweet is 
    this <i>wine of paradise, </i>that he commends it to those dispersed 
    Christians to whom he writes, wishing them all an increase of it.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"May grace and peace be multiplied to you."</p></i> The words 
    run in the form of a salutation. When we greet our friends, we cannot wish 
    them a greater blessing than <i>grace </i>and <i>peace</i>. Other mercies 
    lie outside the pale—and are dispersed in common to men; but grace is a 
    special gift bestowed on those who are the favorites of heaven. Observe the
    <i>connection </i>and the <i>order </i>of the words.
<p align="justify">The <b>connection</b>: grace <i>and </i>peace. The way to 
    have peace is to have grace; grace is the breeder of peace; the one is the 
    root, the other the flower. Peace is the sweet water which distills from a 
    gracious heart.</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>order</b>: first grace, then peace; grace has the 
    priority. Grace and peace are two sisters—but grace is the eldest sister; 
    and give me permission at this time to prefer the elder before the younger. 
    "<i>May grace be multiplied to you</i>." </p>

<p align="justify">Here we shall consider:<br/>
      the meaning of grace; <br/>
      the author of grace; <br/>
      why it is called grace; <br/>
      the necessity of grace.</p>

<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The MEANING of grace.</p></b></font> This word "grace" has 
    various acceptable uses in Scripture:
<p align="justify">Grace is sometimes taken for <b>the favor of God</b>. 
    Genesis 6:8: "Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." God cast a gracious 
    aspect upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">Grace is taken for <b>beauty</b>, as when we say 
    something is graceful. James 1:11, "The flower fails—and the grace of the 
    fashion of it perishes."</p>
<p align="justify">Grace is taken figuratively—and improperly, for <b>the 
    show of grace</b>; as we call that a face in a looking-glass which is but 
    the idea and resemblance of a face. So John 2:23: "Many believed in His 
    name." That believing was but a show of faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Grace is taken in a genuine and proper sense, as in our 
    text: <i>"May grace be multiplied to you."</i> It may admit this 
    description: <b>grace is the infusion of a new and holy principle into the 
    heart, whereby it is changed from what it was—and is made after God's own 
    heart. </b>Grace does not make a moral change only—but a sacred one; it 
    biases the soul heavenward—and stamps upon it the image and superscription 
    of God.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The AUTHOR or efficient cause of grace</p></b></font>, 
    namely, the Spirit of God, who is therefore called "the Spirit of grace" in 
    Zechariah 12:10. The Spirit is the fountain from whence the crystal streams 
    of grace flow. Man, as Clemens Alexandrinus observes, is God's harp or 
    timbrel; the harp will not sound unless touched with the finger. So the 
    heart of man cannot put forth any sweet melody or harmony until first it is 
    touched with the finger of God's Spirit.
<p align="justify">This blessed Spirit works grace in the subject, both <i>
    universally </i>and <i>progressively</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Universally</p></b>. 1 Thessalonians 5:23: "May the God of 
    peace sanctify you wholly." The Spirit of God infuses grace into all the 
    faculties of the soul. Though grace is wrought but in part—yet in every 
    part. In the <i>understanding, </i>grace works light; in the <i>conscience</i>, 
    grace works tenderness; in the <i>will</i>, grace works consent; in the <i>
    affections</i>, grace works harmony. Therefore grace is compared to <i>
    leaven </i>in Matthew 13:33, because it swells itself in the whole soul and 
    makes the life to swell and rise as high as heaven.
<b>
<p align="justify">Progressively</p></b>. The Spirit of God works grace 
    progressively. He carries it on from one degree to another. The Pelagians 
    hold that the <i>beginning </i>of grace is from God—but the <i>progress </i>
    of grace is from ourselves. They teach that God is the <i>Author </i>of our 
    faith—and we are the <i>finishers</i>. God shall lay the first stone, and we 
    the superstructure. But, alas, we need the continual influence of the Spirit 
    to carry on the work of grace in our hearts. Should God withdraw His Spirit 
    from the most holy men, their grace might fail and be annihilated. If the 
    sun withdraws its light, though ever so little, there follows darkness in 
    the air. We need not only saving grace—but assisting, exciting and upholding 
    grace. The ship needs not only the sails—but the winds to carry it. We need 
    not only the sails of our abilities and endeavors—but the wind of the 
    Spirit. to blow us to the heavenly port.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Why is the work of holiness in the heart called grace?</p></b></font>

<p align="justify">First, because it has a supereminence above nature. It is 
    a flower that does not grow in nature's garden; it is of a divine 
    extraction. By <i>reason </i>we live the life of men; by <i>grace </i>we 
    live the life of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, it is called grace because it is a work of free 
    grace; every link in the golden chain of our salvation is wrought and 
    enameled with free grace. That one should be sanctified and not another is 
    of grace; that God should pass by many of the noble, rich and learned—and 
    graft His heavenly endowments upon a more wild stock, of a churlish nature 
    and weaker parts—may well be called "grace."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. Why is saving grace not bestowed upon all?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. We must hold with Zanchius that there is always a 
    just reason for God's will. But in particular I answer:</p>
<p align="justify">God gives grace to one and denies it to another—to show 
    His sovereignty. God is not bound to give grace to all. Romans 9:15: "I will 
    have mercy on whom I will have mercy." Suppose two malefactors were brought 
    before the king; one he will pardon—but not the other. If any demands the 
    reason, he will answer, "It is my prerogative." So God will give grace to 
    one and not to another. He will make one a vessel of mercy, the other a 
    vessel of wrath—and this is His prerogative. The apostle has silenced all 
    disputes in this kind in Romans 9:20-21: "But who are you, O man, to talk 
    back to God? Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you 
    make me like this?' Does not the potter have the right to make out of the 
    same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?" 
    If we could suppose a plant to speak, it might ask, "Why was not I made a 
    bird or an animal? Why should I not have the ability to reason?" Just so it 
    is when vain man enters into contest with God and demands, "Why should not I 
    have grace as well as another?" Do not dispute against God's sovereignty; 
    let not the clay contend with the almighty Potter.</p>
<p align="justify">God may justly deny His grace to any wicked man, because 
    once he had grace and lost it. If a father gave his son stock to trade with 
    and the son loses it, the father is not bound to set him up again. God gave 
    Adam a stock of grace to begin the world with. Adam lost it and made all his 
    children bankrupt. And God is not obliged to give him grace again.</p>
<p align="justify">God may justly deny His grace to every wicked man because 
    he is a despiser of grace. He tramples this pearl under foot (Proverbs 1:7). 
    Is God bound to give grace to those who despise it? If a king's pardon is 
    rejected once, he is not bound to offer it any more.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The NECESSITY of grace.</p></b></font> Grace is most 
    needful because it fits us for communion with God. 2 Corinthians 6:14: "What 
    communion has light with darkness?" God can no more converse with an 
    ungracious soul—than a king can converse with a swine. It is by grace that 
    we keep a constant fellowship with heaven.<br/>
 
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">APPLICATION</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Exhortation.</p></b></font> Let me with the greatest zeal 
    and earnestness, persuade all who have souls to save—to endeavor after 
    grace. Grace will be desirable at death; it is useful now—and more 
    seasonable to look after. Proverbs 4:7: "With all your getting, get 
    understanding." Alexander was presented with a rich cabinet that had 
    belonged to King Darius; he reserved it to put Homer's works in, since he 
    considered those to be of great value. The heart is a spiritual cabinet into 
    which the jewel of grace should be put; we should desire <i>grace </i>above 
    other things, above the <i>gifts </i>of the Spirit, nay, above the <i>
    comforts </i>of the Spirit. Comfort is sweet—but <i>grace </i>is better than 
    comfort, just as bread is better than honey. We may go to heaven without 
    comfort—but not without <i>grace</i>. It is grace which makes us blessed in 
    life and death.
<p align="justify">I shall show you <font color="#0000ff"><b>twelve rare 
    excellencies in grace</b></font>. I shall set this fair virgin of grace 
    before you, hoping that you will be enticed to fall in love with it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Grace has a soul-QUICKENING excellency in it. </p></b>
</font>Hebrews 10:38: "The just shall live by faith." Men void of grace are 
    dead; they have breath—yet lack life. They are walking dead men (Ephesians 
    2:1). The life of sin—is the death of the soul; a sinner has all the signs 
    of one who is dead. He has no <i>pulse</i>—the affections are the pulse of 
    the soul; his pulse does not beat after God. He has no <i>feeling</i>. 
    Ephesians 4:19: "Who being past feeling." Dead things have no <i>beauty</i>; 
    there is no beauty in a dead flower. Dead things are not capable of 
    privilege; the dead heir is not crowned. But grace is the vital artery of 
    the soul; it not only irradiates, but animates. Therefore it is called "the 
    light of life" in John 8:12. Believers are said to have their grave clothes 
    pulled off, and to be alive from the dead (Romans 6:13). By grace the soul 
    is grafted into Christ, the true Vine (John 15:5)—and is made not only 
    living but lively (1 Peter 1:3). Grace puts forth a divine energy into the 
    soul.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Grace has a soul-ENRICHING excellency.</p></b></font> 1 
    Corinthians 1:5: "You are enriched in all knowledge." As the sun enriches 
    the world with its golden beams, so knowledge bespangles and enriches the 
    mind. Faith is an enriching grace. James 2:5 speaks of being "rich in 
    faith." <i>Faith brings Christ's riches into the soul!</i> Faith entitles 
    the soul to the promises. The promises are full of riches: justification, 
    adoption and glory; and faith is the key which unlocks this cabinet of the 
    promises and empties their treasure into the soul. The riches of grace excel 
    all other riches. Grace "is more profitable than silver and yields better 
    returns than gold." (Proverbs 3:14).
<p align="justify">These riches make a man wise. Wisdom is the best 
    possession; other riches cannot make one wise. A man may have a full purse 
    and an empty brain. A rich heir, though he lives until he becomes of age, 
    may never comes to years of discretion; but these riches of grace have the 
    power to make a man wise. Psalm 111:10: "The fear of the Lord is the 
    beginning of wisdom." The saints are compared to <i>wise </i>virgins in 
    Matthew 25. Grace makes a man wise to know Satan's devices and subtleties (2 
    Corinthians 2:11); it makes him wise unto salvation (2 Timothy 3:15). Grace 
    puts the serpent's eye—in the dove's head.</p>
<p align="justify">These spiritual riches sanctify other riches. Riches 
    without grace are hurtful; they are <i>golden snares</i>; they are the <i>
    bellows of pride </i>and the <i>fuel of lust</i>. They set open hell's gates 
    for men; they are unblessed blessings.</p>
<p align="justify">But grace sanctifies our riches; it corrects the poison; 
    it takes away the curse; it makes other riches beneficial to us. These 
    riches shall be certificates of God's love, wings to lift us up to paradise. 
    Thus grace, by a divine chemistry, extracts <i>heaven </i>out of <i>earth</i>—and 
    gives us not only venison—but the blessing.</p>
<p align="justify">Grace satisfies while other riches cannot (Ecclesiastes 
    5:10). Riches can no more fill the heart—than a triangle can fill a circle; 
    but grace fills up every chink and space of the soul. It dilates the heart, 
    and ravishes the affections with joy (Romans 15:13), which joy, as 
    Chrysostom said, is a foretaste of heaven.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Grace has a soul-ADORNING excellency.</p></b></font> Grace 
    puts a beauty and luster upon a person. 1 Peter 3:3-5: "Don't be concerned 
    about the outward beauty that depends on fancy hairstyles, expensive 
    jewelry, or beautiful clothes. You should be known for the beauty that comes 
    from within, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so 
    precious to God. That is the way the holy women of old made themselves 
    beautiful." If a man has gold and jewels, expensive clothing, hanging 
    tapestries, these adorn the house, not the man; the glory of a man is grace. 
    Proverbs 4:9: "She shall give to your head an ornament of grace." The graces 
    are a <i>chain of pearls</i>, which adorns Christ's bride; the heart inlaid 
    and enameled with grace is like the king's daughter—all glorious within 
    (Psalm 45:13). A gracious soul is the image of God, meticulously drawn with 
    the pencil of the Holy Spirit. A heart beautified with grace is the angels' 
    joy (Luke 15:7)—and is God's lesser heaven (Isaiah 57:15; Ephesians 3:17).
<p align="justify">Grace exceeds reason. Grace changes <i>corruption </i>
    into <i>perfection</i>; nothing so graces a man as grace does. Grace is the 
    purest complexion of the soul, for it makes it like God. Grace is the <i>
    flower of delight </i>which Christ loves to smell. Grace is to the soul—as 
    the <i>eye </i>to the body, as the <i>sun </i>to the world, as the <i>
    diamond </i>to the ring—it bespangles and beautifies. A soul decked with 
    grace is as the dove covered with silver wings and golden feathers!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Grace has a soul-CLEANSING excellency. </p></b></font>By 
    nature we are defiled; sin makes things filthy (2 Corinthians 7:1). A 
    sinner's heart is so black that nothing but hell can equal it; but grace is 
    a spiritual laver—and therefore it is called "the washing of regeneration" 
    in Titus 3:5. The grace of repentance cleanses. Mary's tears, as they washed 
    Christ's feet—so they washed her heart. Faith has a cleansing virtue. Acts 
    15:9: "Having purified their hearts by faith." Grace whitens the soul; it 
    takes out the leopard spots—and turns it into an azure beauty. Grace is of a 
    celestial nature; though it does not wholly remove sin—it does subdue it. 
    Though it does not keep sin out, it does keep it under control. Though sin 
    in a gracious soul does not totally die—yet it dies daily. Grace makes the 
    heart into a spiritual temple which has this inscription on it: <i>"Holiness 
    to the Lord!"
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Grace has a soul-STRENGTHENING excellency.</p></b></font> 
    Grace enables a man to do that which exceeds the power of nature. Grace 
    teaches us to mortify our sins, to love our enemies—and to prefer the glory 
    of Christ before our own lives. Thus the three Hebrew children in Daniel, by 
    the power of grace, marched in the face of death; neither the sound of the 
    music could allure them—nor the heat of the furnace frighten them (Daniel 
    3:17). Grace is a Christian's armor, which does more than any other armor 
    can—it not only defends him, but puts courage into him. Grace makes us not 
    only bear suffering—but rejoice in suffering (Romans 5:3). A soul steeled 
    and animated with grace, can tread upon the lion and adder (Psalm 91:13), 
    and with the leviathan can laugh at the shaking of a spear (Job 41:29). Thus 
    does grace infuse a heroic spirit and drive strength into a man—making him 
    act above the sphere of nature.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Grace has a soul-RAISING excellency.</p></b></font> Grace 
    is a divine spark which ascends. When the heart is divinely touched with the 
    magnet of the Spirit—it is drawn up to God. Proverbs 15:24: "The path of the 
    wise leads to life above." Grace raises a man above others; he lives in the
    <i>altitudes, </i>while others creep on the earth and are almost buried in 
    it. A Christian, by the wings of grace, flies aloft; the saints mount up as 
    eagles (Isaiah 40:31). A believer is a citizen of heaven; there he trades by 
    faith. Grace shoots the heart above the world (Psalm 139:17; Philippians 
    3:21). Grace gives us <i>conformity </i>to Christ and <i>communion </i>with 
    Him. 1 John 1:3: "Our fellowship is with the Father—and with His Son Jesus." 
    A man full of grace has Christ in his heart—and the world under his feet! 
    Grace humbles—yet elevates.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Grace has a PERFUMING excellency.</p></b></font> Grace 
    makes us a sweet fragrance to God. Hence grace is compared to those spices 
    which are most odoriferous and fragrant: myrrh, cinnamon, and frankincense 
    (Song of Solomon 4:14). There is a double perfume that grace sends forth.
    
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First, it perfumes our NAMES</p></b></font>. Hebrews 11:2: 
    "By faith the elders obtained a good report." Grace was the spice which 
    perfumed their names. <i>How </i>renowned was Abraham for his faith, <i>
    Moses </i>for his meekness, or <i>Phinehas </i>for his zeal? What a fresh 
    perfume their names send forth to this day. The very wicked cannot but see a 
    resplendent majesty in the graces of the saints; and though with their 
    tongues they revile grace—yet with their hearts they reverence it. Thus 
    grace is aromatic; it embalms the names of men. When a gracious person 
    dies—he carries a good <i>conscience </i>with him, and leaves a <i>good </i>
    name behind him.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, grace perfumes our DUTIES</p></b></font>. Psalm 
    141:2: "Let my prayer be set forth before You as incense." Noah's sacrifice 
    was a perfume. Genesis 8:21: "The Lord smelled a sweet fragrance." The sighs 
    of a wicked man are an offensive breath; his solemn sacrifice is dung 
    (Malachi 2:3). There is such a foul stench coming from a sinner's duties, 
    that God will not come near! Who can endure the smell of a dead corpse? "I 
    hate all your show and pretense—the hypocrisy of your religious festivals 
    and solemn assemblies. I will not accept your burnt offerings and grain 
    offerings. I won't even notice all your choice peace offerings. Away with 
    your hymns of praise! They are only noise to my ears. I will not listen to 
    your music, no matter how lovely it is." Amos 5:21-23. 
<p align="justify">But grace gives a fragrance and redolence to our holy 
    things. Hebrews 11:4: "It was by faith that Abel brought a more acceptable 
    offering to God than Cain did. God accepted Abel's offering." Abel's 
    sacrifice was better-scented. God smelled a sweet fragrance in it, for He 
    accepted his gifts. If it is asked what this testimony was that God gave of 
    Abel's sacrifice, Jerome said that God set his sacrifice on fire (1 Kings 
    18:38), so from heaven testifying His acceptance of Abel's offering. And if 
    grace so perfumes you, wear this flower not in your bosoms—but in your 
    hearts!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Grace has a soul-ENNOBLING excellency.</p></b></font> 
    Grace ennobles a man. Grace makes us vessels of honor; it sets us above 
    princes and nobles. Theodosius thought it more dignity to be Christ's 
    servant, and wear His livery laced with the silver graces of the Spirit—than 
    to be great and renowned in the world. Isaiah 43:4: "Since you were precious 
    in My sight, you have been honorable." 
<p align="justify">Sin debases a man. Christ tells wicked men of their 
    pedigree in John 8:44: "You are of your father the devil." They may put a 
    cloven foot in their chariots. An ungracious person is a vile person. Nahum 
    1:14: "<i>You are vile</i>." The Hebrew word for "vile" signifies to be 
    lightly esteemed; there is nothing so vile but an ungracious man will do it. 
    He is pliable to anything; he is like wire, which will be bent any way. He 
    will snare his conscience, stain his credit, and run as a slave after the 
    sinful injunctions of men. But grace ennobles; he who is divinely inspired, 
    as he is high born (1 John 3:1), so he acts suitable to his birth. He hates 
    whatever is hypocritical and sordid. The saints are called <i>kings </i>and
    <i>priests </i>for their dignity (Revelation 1:6), and <i>jewels </i>for 
    their value (Malachi 3:17).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Grace has a soul-SECURING excellency.</p></b></font> Grace 
    brings <i>safety </i>along with it. You all desire to be safe in dangerous 
    times; if <i>sword </i>or <i>pestilence </i>comes, if <i>death </i>peeps in 
    at your windows—would you be safe? Nothing will secure you in times of 
    danger—but grace. Grace is the best lifeguard; it puts Christians out of 
    gunshot, and frees them from the power of <i>hell </i>and <i>damnation</i>. 
    Proverbs 10:2: "Righteousness delivers from death." Do not righteous men 
    die? Yes—but righteousness delivers from the sting of the first death, and 
    the fear of the second death. It was the saying of one, "I am not afraid to 
    die—but to be damned." But here is a believer's comfort—the fire of God's 
    wrath can never kindle upon him! Grace is God's own image stamped on the 
    soul—and He will not destroy His own image! 
<p align="justify">Xerxes the Persian, when he destroyed all the temples in 
    Greece, caused the temple of Diana to be preserved for its beautiful 
    structure. Just so, that soul which has the beauty of holiness shining in 
    it, shall be preserved for the glory of the structure. God will not allow 
    His own temple to be destroyed. Would you be secured in evil times? Get 
    grace and fortify this garrison; a good conscience is a Christian's royal 
    fort. David's enemies lay round about him; yet, he said, "I lay down and 
    slept. I woke up in safety, for the Lord was watching over me" (Psalm 3:5). 
    A good conscience can sleep in the mouth of a cannon. Grace is a Christian's 
    coat of armor, which fears neither the arrow nor the bullet. True grace may 
    be shot <i>at</i>—but can never be shot <i>through</i>. Grace puts the soul 
    into Christ, and there it is safe—as the bee is safe in the hive, and as the 
    dove is safe in the ark. Romans 8:1: "There is no condemnation to those who 
    are in Christ Jesus."</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">10. Grace has a heart-ESTABLISHING excellency in it.</p></font>
</b>Hebrews 13:9: "It is a good thing that the heart is established with 
    grace." Before the infusion of grace, the heart is like a ship without a 
    ballast; it wavers and tosses, being ready to overturn. Therefore a man void 
    of grace is called a double-minded man in James 1:8. He acts for and 
    against—as if he had two souls. He is unresolved: today of one mind, 
    tomorrow of another. Today he will hear a preacher who is orthodox, tomorrow 
    one who is heterodox. He will be as the times are—and change his religion as 
    fast as the chameleon does his color. Hearts unsanctified will be unsettled; 
    they will join the popular side. They will follow not what is best—but what 
    is safest; they are not for that religion which has the Word to guide it—but 
    for that which has the sword to back it. This is what Seneca called a mind 
    that rolls up and down, and settles nowhere.
<p align="justify">But grace consolidates and fixes the heart. Psalm 57:7: 
    "My heart is fixed, O God." Hypocrites are like meteors in the air—but David 
    was a fixed star. Grace keeps the heart upright; and the more sincere, the 
    more steadfast. Grace carries the heart to God as the center, and there it 
    rests (Psalm 116; Psalm 7). A gracious heart cleaves to God, and let 
    whatever changes come, the soul is settled as a ship at anchor.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. Grace has a PREPARATORY excellency in it.</p></b></font> 
    Grace prepares and fits us for glory. Glory is the highest peg of our 
    felicity; it transcends all our thoughts. Glory can have no hyperbole. Now 
    grace tunes and fits the soul for glory. 2 Peter 1:3: "Who has called us to 
    glory and virtue." Virtue leads to glory. First you <i>cleanse </i>the 
    vessel, and then pour in wine. God first cleanses us by His grace, and then 
    pours in the wine of glory. The <i>silver link of <b>grace </b></i>draws the<i> 
    golden link of <b>glory </b>after it!</i> Indeed, grace differs little from 
    glory. Grace is glory in the bud—and glory is grace in the full flower. 
    Glory is nothing but the consummation of grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">12. Grace has an ABIDING excellency.</p></b></font> Temporal 
    things are for a season—but grace has eternity stamped upon it. It is called 
    "durable riches" in Proverbs 8:18. Other riches take wings and fly from us; 
    grace takes wings and flies with us to heaven. Some tell us of falling away 
    from grace. I grant that "<i>seeming </i>grace" may be lost—as a blazing 
    comet will spend and evaporate. Saving grace may fail in the <i>degree</i>; 
    it may suffer an eclipse; it may lose all its sweet fruit of joy and 
    peace—but still there is sap in the vine, and the seed of God remains (1 
    John 3:9). 
<p align="justify">Grace is a blossom of eternity. 1 John 2:27 speaks of 
    "the anointing which abides." Colors laid in oil are durable; those hearts 
    which are laid in oil, and have the anointing of God, hold their colors and 
    endure forever. Grace is compared to a <i>river of the water of life </i>in 
    John 7:38. This river can never be dried up, for the Spirit of God is the 
    spring that feeds it. Grace is not like a lease which soon expires. So the 
    Pelagians would make it: today a believer, tomorrow an unbeliever; today 
    justified, tomorrow unjustified. This would be like a lease soon run out; 
    but God settles grace on the saints as an inheritance, and He will see that 
    the legacy shall never be cut off. He who has true grace can no more fall 
    away than the angels—which are fixed stars in their heavenly orbs.</p>
<p align="justify">The arguments to prove the perpetuation of grace are:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God's election</p></b></font>, which I ground upon Romans 
    8:29-30: "For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the 
    likeness of his Son." Predestination is the grand cause of the saint's 
    preservation. God chooses to salvation, as well as to faith (2 Thessalonians 
    2:13). What shall make God's election void?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The power of God. </p></b></font>1 Peter 1:5: "We are kept 
    by the power of God through faith unto salvation." I deny not, but that 
    grace in itself may perish (our grace is no better coin than Adam's). But 
    grace in God's keeping cannot perish; the saints' graces of themselves may 
    break as glasses—but these glasses in the hand of God never break.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. God's solemn engagement. </p></b></font>The Lord has 
    passed it under hand and seal. He has given bond for the saints' 
    perseverance. Jeremiah 32:40: "I will make an everlasting covenant with 
    them, that I will not turn away from them, and they shall not depart from 
    Me." A believer's charter is confirmed under the broad seal of heaven; and 
    if grace does not endure to eternity—it is either because God lacks <i>power
    </i>to make good what He has decreed, or <i>truth </i>to make good what He 
    has promised; either of which, to assert, would be blasphemy.
<p align="justify">Besides all this, Jesus Christ our blessed High Priest, 
    who has the golden plate on His forehead, appears in the court of heaven for 
    His people. And as He poured out blood on the cross, so He pours forth 
    prayers in heaven for the saints' perseverance. Hebrews 7:25: "He ever lives 
    to make intercession for them." And Christ is not only a Priest—but a Son; 
    and therefore He will prevail. And also, which puts the matter out of doubt, 
    what Christ prays for as He is man—He has power to give as He is God. John 
    17:24: "Father, I will." When He says, "Father," there He prays as man. When 
    He says, "I will," there He gives as God.</p>
<p align="justify">So that grace is an abiding thing; Christians, you may 
    lose your friends, your estates, and your lives—but you shall never lose 
    your grace. Those who hold falling away from grace, would make a believer 
    wear Cain's mark, which was a continual shaking and trembling in his flesh. 
    They would spill a Christian's cordial, and break a link of the chain of 
    salvation.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Examination.</p></b></font> Let us test whether our grace 
    is true; there is something which looks like grace—which is not true grace. 
    Chrysostom said that the devil has a counterfeit chain to all the graces, 
    and he would deceive us with it. Jewelers have ways to try their precious 
    stones; let us try our grace by a Scripture touchstone. The <i>painted </i>
    Christian shall have a <i>painted </i>paradise!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">True grace is seen by an aversion and antipathy against 
    sin.</p></b></font> Psalm 119:104: "I hate <i>every </i>false way." Grace sets 
    itself against one's <i>darling </i>sins (Psalm 18:23), and against the sins 
    of the times (Revelation 2:2).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">True grace is known by its growth</p></b></font>; growth 
    evidences life. Dead things do not grow. A picture will not grow. Just so, a 
    hypocrite, who is but a picture of piety, does not grow. But a sincere 
    Christian grows in love to Christ, in humility, and in good works. Hosea 
    14:5: "I will be to Israel like a refreshing dew from heaven. It will 
    blossom like the lily; it will send roots deep into the soil like the cedars 
    in Lebanon. 
<p align="justify">6 Its branches will spread out like those of beautiful 
    olive trees, as fragrant as the cedar forests of Lebanon." When the Spirit 
    of God distills as dew upon the soul—it makes grace flourish and put forth 
    into maturity.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">True grace will make us willing to suffer for Christ. </p></b>
</font>Grace is like gold: it will abide the fiery trial (1 Peter 1:7). And 
    if, upon a serious scrutiny and trial, we find that we have the right jewel, 
    the grace of God in truth (Colossians 1:6), this will be a deathbed cordial. 
    We may, with Simeon, depart in peace, being assured that though we cannot <i>
    resist </i>death—yet we shall <i>overcome </i>it.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Direction. </p></b></font>Let me lay down some 
    directions for the attaining of grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 1. If we would be enriched with this jewel of 
    grace—let us take pains for it.</p></b></font> We are bid to make a search after 
    knowledge, as a man who searches for a vein of gold or hidden treasure. 
    (Proverbs 2:2-3). Our salvation cost Christ <i>blood</i>—it will cost us <i>
    sweat</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 2. Let us go to God for grace. </p></b></font>He is 
    called "the God of all grace" in 1 Peter 5:10. We could <i>lose </i>grace of 
    ourselves—but we cannot <i>find </i>it of ourselves. The sheep can <i>wander
    </i>from the fold—but cannot <i>return </i>without the help of the shepherd. 
    Go to the God of all
<p align="justify">grace. He is the first <i>planter</i>, the <i>promoter</i>, 
    and the <i>perfecter </i>of grace. God is the Father of lights (James 1:17). 
    He must light up this candle of grace in the soul. Grace is in His gift. </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, then, go to God in prayer; lay your heart before Him: 
    "Lord, I lack grace. I lack a humble, believing heart; and You are the God 
    of all grace. All my springs are in You. Oh, enrich me with grace; do not 
    deny me this before I die. What is gold in the bag—if I have no oil in the 
    lamp? Give me that anointing of God. I read in Your Word of the fruits of 
    the Spirit. Lord, my heart is barren soil; plant some of these supernatural 
    fruits in me so that I may be more useful and serviceable. Lord, I cannot be 
    put off with other things. Who will You give grace to—if not to such as ask, 
    and are resolved not to stop asking?"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 3. If you would have grace, engage the prayers 
    of others on your behalf.</p></b></font> He is likely to be rich—who has several 
    stocks going. He is in the way of spiritual thriving—who has several stocks 
    of prayer going for him. If you had a child who was sick, you would beg the 
    prayers of others. You have a soul that is sick, sick with pride and lust, 
    sick unto death. Oh, beg the prayers of godly friends that God will heal you 
    with His grace. Moses and Jacob had much power with God; believers can 
    prevail sometimes not only for themselves—but for their friends. A godly 
    man's prayers may do you more good, than if he should bestow upon you all 
    his lands of inheritance.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Direction 4. If you would have grace, frequent the means 
    of grace.</p></b></font> Lie at the pool of Bethesda; wait at the posts of 
    wisdom's door. Inward grace is wrought by outward means; the preaching the 
    Word is the engine that God uses to work grace; it is called "the rod of His 
    strength" (Psalm 110:2) and "the breath of His lips" (Isaiah 11:4). By this 
    God causes breath to enter; out of this golden pipe of the sanctuary, God 
    empties the <i>golden oil of grace </i>into the soul. The ministry of the 
    gospel is called the ministry of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3:8, because 
    the Spirit of God ordinarily makes use of this to work grace. This ministry 
    of the Spirit is to be preferred before the ministry of angels.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. Why is the Word preached the ordinary means to 
    convey grace? Why not conversation or reading?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. The reason is because God has appointed it to 
    this end, and He will grace His own ordinances. 1 Corinthians 11: "It 
    pleased God." What reason could be given why the waters of Damascus should 
    not have as sovereign a virtue to heal Naaman's leprosy, as the waters of 
    Jordan? Only this, because the Lord appointed and sanctified the one to this 
    work—and not the other. If therefore we would have grace, let us wait where 
    the manna falls, and there expect the dew of the Spirit to fall with manna. 
    The power of God goes along with His Word.</p>
<p align="justify">How we should delight in ordinances! Sleidan said there 
    was a church in France formerly which the Protestants called "paradise," as 
    if they thought themselves in paradise while they were in the house of God. 
    Those ordinances should be our paradise, which are the power of God to 
    salvation.</p>
