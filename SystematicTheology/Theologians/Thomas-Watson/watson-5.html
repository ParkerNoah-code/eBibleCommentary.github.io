<p align="center">The OMNIPRESENCE of God</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">God is <b>infinite</b>. All created beings are finite. 
    The Greek word for "infinite" signifies "without bounds or limits." <i>God 
    is not confined to any <b>place</b></i>. He is infinite, and so is present 
    in all places at once. His center is everywhere. "In no place is God's Being 
    either confined or excluded," Augustine. "Behold, the heaven and heaven of 
    heavens cannot contain you." The Turks build their temples open at the top, 
    to show that God cannot be confined to them—but is in all places by his 
    presence. God's essence is not limited either to the regions above, or to 
    the terrestrial globe—but is everywhere. As philosophers say of the soul, 
    "the soul is in every part of the body," in the eye, heart, foot; so we may 
    say of God, his essence is everywhere; his circuit is in heaven, and in 
    earth, and sea, and he is in all places of his circuit at once. "This is to 
    be infinite." God, who bounds everything else, is himself without bounds. He 
    sets bounds to the sea, "Hitherto shall you come, and no further!" He sets 
    bounds to the angels; they, like the cherubim, move and stand at his 
    appointment, but he is infinite, without bounds. He who can span the 
    heavens, and weigh the earth in scales, must needs be infinite!</p>
<p align="justify">Vorstius maintains that God is in all places at once—but 
    not in regard of his essence; but by his virtue and influence: as the body 
    of the sun is in heaven, it only sends forth its beams and influences to the 
    earth; or as a king, who is in all places of his kingdom <i>authoritatively</i>, 
    by his power and authority—but he is personally on his throne.</p>
<p align="justify">God, who is infinite, is in all places at once, not only 
    by his <i>influence</i>—but by his <i>essence</i>; for, if his essence fills 
    all places, then he must needs be there in person. Jer 23:34. "Do not I fill 
    heaven and earth?"</p>
<p align="justify">But does not God say that heaven is his throne?</p>
<p align="justify">It is also said, that a humble heart is his throne. The 
    humble heart is his throne, in regard to his <i>gracious </i>presence; and 
    heaven is his throne, in regard to his <i>glorious </i>presence; and yet 
    neither of these thrones will hold him, for the heaven of heavens cannot 
    contain him.</p>
<p align="justify">But if God is infinite in all places—he is in <i>impure
    </i>places, and mingles with impurity.</p>
<p align="justify">Though God is in all places, in the <i>heart of a sinner
    </i>by his inspection, and in <i>hell </i>by his justice—yet he does not 
    mingle with the impurity, or receive the least tincture of evil. "The divine 
    nature does not intermix with created matter, nor is contaminated by its 
    impurities," Augustine. No more than the sun shining on a dunghill is 
    defiled, or its beauty spotted; or than Christ going among sinners was 
    defiled, whose Godhead was a sufficient antidote against infection.</p>
<p align="justify">God must needs be infinite in all places at once, not 
    only in regard to the simplicity and purity of his nature—but in regard to 
    his power, which being so glorious, who can set bounds to him, or prescribe 
    him a circuit to walk in? It is as if the drop should limit the ocean, or a 
    candle set bounds to the sun.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: If God is infinite, present in all places at 
    once, then it is certain he governs all things in his own person</p></b></font>, 
    and needs no proxies or deputies to help him to carry on his government. He 
    is in all places in an instant, and manages all affairs both in the earth 
    and heaven. A king cannot be in all places of his kingdom in his own person, 
    therefore he is forced to govern by deputies and viceregents, and they often 
    pervert justice. But God, being infinite, needs no deputies, he is present 
    in all places, he sees all with his own eyes, and hears all with his own 
    ears; he is everywhere in his own person, therefore is fit to be the judge 
    of the world; he will do everyone right.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If God is infinite by his omnipresence, then see 
    the greatness and immenseness of the divine majesty! </p></b></font>What a great 
    God do we serve! "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, and the glory, and the 
    majesty, and you are exalted as head above all." Well may the Scripture 
    display the greatness of his glory, who is infinite in all places. He 
    transcends our weak conceptions; how can our finite understanding comprehend 
    him who is infinite? He is infinitely above all our praises. "Blessed be 
    your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise." Oh what 
    a poor nothing is man, when we think of God's infiniteness! As the stars 
    disappear at the rising of the sun, oh, how does a man shrink into nothing, 
    when infinite majesty shines forth in its glory! "The <i>nations </i>are as 
    a drop in the bucket, or the small dust of the balance!" On what a little of 
    that drop are we individuals! The heathen thought they had sufficiently 
    praised Jupiter when they called him <i>great Jupiter</i>. Of what immense 
    majesty is God, who fills all places at once!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: If God is infinite, filling heaven and earth, 
    see what a full portion the saints have. They have him who is infinite for 
    their portion! </p></b></font>His fullness is an infinite fullness; and he is 
    infinitely sweet, as well as infinitely full. If a cup is filled with wine, 
    there is a sweet fullness—but still it is finite; but God is a sweet 
    fullness, and it is infinite. He is infinitely full of beauty and of love. 
    His riches are called <i>unsearchable</i>, because they are infinite, Eph 
    3:8. Stretch your thoughts as much as you can, there is that in God which 
    exceeds; it is an infinite fullness. He is said to do abundantly for us, 
    above all that we can ask. "Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more 
    than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within 
    us," Ephesians 3:20. What can an ambitious person ask? He can ask crowns and 
    kingdoms, millions of worlds; but God can give more than we can <i>ask</i>, 
    nay, more than we can <i>imagine</i>, because he is infinite!
<p align="justify">We can imagine—what if all the dust were turned to 
    silver—what if every flower were a ruby—what if every sand in the sea a 
    diamond; yet God can give more than we can imagine, because he is infinite.<b> 
    Oh how rich are they who have the infinite God for their portion!</b> Well 
    might David say, "Surely I have a delightful inheritance!" Psalm 16:6. </p>
<p align="justify">We may go with the bee from flower to flower—but we shall 
    never have full satisfaction until we come to the infinite God! Jacob said: 
    "I have enough!" In the Hebrew it is, "I have all!" because he had the 
    infinite God for his portion! Gen 33:11. God being an infinite fullness, 
    there is no fear of lack for any of the heirs of heaven. Though there are 
    millions of saints and angels, who have a share in God's riches—yet he has 
    enough for them all, because he is infinite! Though a thousand men behold 
    the sun—there is light enough for them all. Put ever so many buckets into 
    the sea—there is water enough to fill them. Though an innumerable company of 
    saints and angels are to be filled out of God's fullness—yet God, being 
    infinite, has enough to satisfy them. God has land enough to give to all his 
    heirs. There can be no lack, in that which is infinite.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: If God is infinite, he fills all places, and is 
    everywhere present. </p></b></font>This is dreadful to the wicked. God is their 
    enemy, and they cannot escape him, nor flee from him, for he is everywhere 
    present! They are never out of his eye, nor out of his reach. "Your hand 
    shall find out all your enemies." What caves or thickets can men hide 
    in—that God cannot find them? Go where they will, he is present. "Where 
    shall I flee from your presence?" If a man owes a debt to another he may 
    make his escape, and flee into another land, where the creditor cannot find 
    him. "But where shall I flee from <i>your </i>presence?" God is infinite, he 
    is in all places; so that he will find out his enemies and punish them!
<p align="justify">But is it not said that "Cain <i>went out </i>from the 
    presence of the Lord?" Gen 4:16.</p>
<p align="justify">The meaning is, he went out from the church of God, where 
    the visible signs of God's presence were, and where God in a special manner 
    manifested his sweet presence to his people; but Cain could not go out of 
    God's sight; for God being infinite is everywhere present. Sinners can 
    escape from neither an accusing conscience, nor from a revenging God!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: If God is everywhere present, then for a 
    Christian to walk with God is not impossible. </p></b></font>God is not only in 
    heaven—but he is in earth too. Heaven is his throne, there he sits; the 
    earth is his footstool, there he stands. He is everywhere present, therefore 
    we may come to walk with God. "Enoch walked with God." If God was confined 
    to heaven, a trembling soul might think, "How can I converse with God, how 
    can I walk with him who lives above the upper region?" But God is not 
    confined to heaven; he is omnipresent; he is <i>above </i>us—yet he is <i>
    about </i>us, he is <i>near </i>to us. "He is not far from each one of us." 
    Acts 17:27. He is not far from the assembly of the saints, "God has taken 
    His place in the divine assembly," Psalm 82:1. He is present with us, God is 
    in everyone of us; so that here on earth we may walk with God. 
<p align="justify">In heaven the saints <i>rest </i>with him, on earth they
    <i>walk </i>with him. To walk with God is to walk by faith. We are said to 
    "draw near to God," Heb 10:22, and to see him, Heb 11:27, "As seeing him who 
    is invisible," and to have fellowship with him. 1 John 1:3, "Our fellowship 
    is with the Father." Thus we may take a turn with him every day by faith. It 
    is slighting God not to walk with him. If a king was in our presence, it 
    would be slighting him to neglect him, and play with the pet. There is no 
    walk in the world so sweet as to walk with God. "They shall walk in the 
    light of your countenance." "Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord." 
    It is like walking among beds of spices, which send forth a fragrant 
    perfume.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use six: If God is infinite in his glorious essence, 
    learn to admire—where you cannot fathom. </p></b></font>The angels wear a veil, 
    they cover their faces, as adoring this infinite majesty. Isa 6:6. Elijah 
    wrapped himself in a mantle when God's glory passed by. Admire—where you 
    cannot fathom. "Can you by searching find out God?" Here on earth, we see 
    some beams of his glory, we see him in the looking-glass of the creation; we 
    see him in his picture—his image shines in the saints. But who can search 
    out all his essential glory? What angel can measure these pyramids? "Can you 
    by searching find out God?" He is infinite. We can no more search out his 
    infinite perfections, than a man upon the top of the highest mountain can 
    take a star in his hand! Oh, have God-admiring thoughts! Adore where you 
    cannot fathom!
<p align="justify">There are many mysteries in nature which we cannot 
    fathom; why the sea should be higher than the earth—yet not drown it; why 
    the Nile should overflow in summer, when, by the course of nature, the 
    waters are lowest. "As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body 
    is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the 
    Maker of all things." Ecclesiastes 11:5. If these things perplex us, how may 
    the infinite mystery of the Deity transcend our most raised intellectuals! 
    Ask the geometrician, if he can, with a ruler, measure the heavens. Just 
    so—we are unable are we to measure the infinite perfections of God. In 
    heaven we shall see God <i>clearly</i>—but not <i>fully</i>, for he is 
    infinite. He will communicate himself to us, according to the capacity of 
    our vessel—but not the immenseness of his nature. Adore then where you 
    cannot fathom!</p>
<p align="justify">If God is infinite in all places, let us not limit him. 
    "They limited the Holy One of Israel." <i>It is limiting God to confine him 
    within the narrow compass of our reason. </i>Reason thinks God must go such 
    a way to work, or the business will never be effected. This is to limit God 
    to our reason; whereas he is infinite, and his ways are past finding out. In 
    the deliverance of the church, it is limiting God, either to set him a time, 
    or prescribe him a method for deliverance. God will deliver Zion—but he will 
    be left to his own liberty; he will not be tied to a place, to a time, or to 
    an instrument, which were to limit him, and then he should not be infinite. 
    God will go his own way, he will confound human reason, he will work by 
    improbabilities, he will save in such a way as we think would destroy. Now 
    he acts like himself, like an infinite wonder-working God. "Oh, the depth of 
    the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his 
    judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!" Romans 11:33. <br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">The KNOWLEDGE of God</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>"The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are 
    weighed." Glorious things are spoken of God; he transcends our thoughts, and 
    the praises of angels. <i>God's glory lies chiefly in his <b>attributes</b>, 
    which are the several beams by which the divine nature shines forth. </i>
    Among other of his orient excellencies, this is not the least—"the Lord is a 
    God of knowledge;" or as the Hebrew word is, "A God of knowledges." He has a 
    full idea and cognisance of all things; the world is to him a transparent 
    body. He makes a heart-anatomy. "I am he who searches the thoughts and the 
    heart." The clouds are no canopy, the night is no curtain—to draw between us 
    and his sight. "Even in darkness I cannot hide from you. To you the night 
    shines as bright as day. Darkness and light are both alike to you." </p>
<p></p>
<p>There is not a <b>word </b>we whisper but God hears it. 
    "There is not a word in my tongue—but lo, O Lord, you know it altogether." 
    There is not the most subtle <b>thought </b>that comes into our mind—but God 
    perceives it. "I know their thoughts." Thoughts speak as loud in God's 
    ears—as words do in ours. All our <b>actions</b>, though ever so subtly 
    contrived, and secretly conducted, are visible to the eye of Omniscience. "I 
    know their works." Achan hid the Babylonish garment in the earth—but God 
    brought it to light. Minerva was drawn in such curious colors, and so lively 
    pencilled, that whichever way one turned, Minerva's eyes were upon him. Just 
    so, whichever way we turn ourselves, God's eye is upon us! </p>
<p></p>
<p>"<i>Him who is perfect in knowledge</i>." God knows 
    whatever is knowable; he knows future contingencies. He foretold Israel's 
    coming out of Babylon, and the virgin's conceiving. By this the Lord proves 
    the truth of his Godhead, against idol gods. "Tell us the coming events, 
    then we will know that you are gods." The perfection of God's knowledge is 
    primary. He is the original, the pattern, and prototype of all knowledge; 
    others borrow their knowledge of him; the angels light their lamps at this 
    glorious sun. </p>
<p></p>
<p>God's knowledge is <b>pure</b>. It is not contaminated 
    with the object. Though God knows sin—yet it is to hate and punish it. No 
    evil can mix or incorporate with his knowledge, any more than the sun can be 
    defiled with the vapors which arise from the earth. God's knowledge is 
    facile; it is without any difficulty. We study and search for knowledge. 
    Prov 2:2. "If you <i>seek </i>for her as for silver." The lamp of God's 
    knowledge is so infinitely bright, that all things are intelligible to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God's knowledge is <b>infallible</b>; there is no mistake 
    in His knowledge. Human knowledge is subject to error. A physician may 
    mistake the treatment of a disease; but God's knowledge is unerring. He can 
    neither deceive, nor be deceived. He cannot deceive--because he is truth; 
    nor be deceived—because He has infinite wisdom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God's knowledge is <b>instantaneous</b>. Our knowledge is 
    successive, one thing after another. We argue from the effect to the cause. 
    God knows things past, present, and to come—at once; they are all before him 
    in one entire prospect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>God's knowledge is <b>retentive</b>; he never loses any 
    of his knowledge; he <i>remembers </i>as well as <i>understands</i>. Many 
    things elapse out of our minds—but God's knowledge is eternalized. Things 
    transacted a thousand years ago, are as fresh to him as if they were done 
    but the last minute. Thus he is perfect in knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But is it not said, "I will go down and see if what they 
    have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. Then I will know."</p>
<p></p>
<p>It could not be that God was ignorant; because there is 
    mention made of a cry; but the Lord speaks there <i>after the manner of a 
    judge</i>, who will first examine the cause before he passes the sentence. 
    When he is upon a work of justice he is not in a hurry, as if he did not 
    care where he hits; but he goes straight against offenders. "He lays 
    judgement to the line, and righteousness to the plummet."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hos 13:12, "The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up, his sin 
    is hid." ("The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record."
    <i>NIV translation</i>.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not that his sin is hid from God—but his sin is hid; that 
    is<i>—the sins of Ephraim have been collected and stored away for 
    punishment. </i>That this is the meaning, is clear by the foregoing words, 
    his iniquity is <i>collected</i>. As the clerk of the court binds up the 
    indictments of malefactors in a bundle, and at the trial brings out the 
    indictments and reads them in court; so God binds up men's sins in a bundle, 
    and, at the day of judgment, this bundle shall be opened, and all their sins 
    brought to light before men and angels!</p>
<p></p>
<p>God is <b>infinite </b>in knowledge. He cannot but be so; 
    for he who gives being to things, must needs have a clear inspection of 
    them. "He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, 
    shall he not see?" He who makes a watch or engine, knows all the workmanship 
    in it. God, who made the heart, knows all its movements. He is full of eyes, 
    like Ezekiel's wheels, and, as Austin says, <i>Totus oculus</i>, "All eye." 
    It ought to be so; for he is the "Judge of all the world." There are so many 
    causes to be brought before him, and so many people to be tried, that he 
    must have a perfect knowledge, or he could not do justice. A human judge 
    cannot proceed without a jury, the jury must search the cause, and give in 
    the verdict; but God can judge without a jury. He knows all things in and of 
    himself, and needs no witnesses to inform him. A human judge judges only 
    matters of <i>fact</i>—but God judges the <i>heart</i>. He not only judges 
    wicked <i>actions</i>—but wicked <i>designs</i>. He sees the treason of the 
    heart, and punishes it.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use one: </p></b></font>Is God infinite in knowledge? Is he 
    light, and in him is there no darkness? <font color="#008000"><b>Then how 
    unlike are they to God who are darkness, and in whom is no light, who are 
    destitute of knowledge, such as the heathen who never heard of God! </b>
</font>And are there not many among us, who are no better than <i>baptized 
    heathen? </i>who need to seek the first principles of the oracles of God. It 
    is sad, that after the <i>sun of the gospel </i>has shined so long in our 
    horizon, that the veil should still be upon their heart. Such as are 
    enveloped in ignorance cannot give God a reasonable service. Rom 12:2. <b>
    Ignorance is the nurse of impiety. </b>The schoolmen say, "Every sin is 
    founded upon ignorance". Jer 9:3, "They proceed from one evil to another, 
    and they do not take Me into account." Where ignorance reigns in the 
    understanding, lust rages in the affections. Prov 19:2, "That the mind be 
    without knowledge, it is not good." Such have neither faith nor fear: no 
    faith; for knowledge carries the torch before faith. "Those who know your 
    name shall put their trust in you." A man can no more believe without 
    knowledge, than the eye can see without light. He can have no fear of God; 
    for how can they fear him whom they do not know? The covering of Haman's 
    face was a sad presage of death. When people's minds are covered with 
    ignorance, it is a covering of the face, which is a fatal forerunner of 
    destruction. "The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s 
    feeding-trough, but Israel does not know; My people do not understand." 
    Isaiah 1:3 
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use two: If God is a God of infinite knowledge, then see 
    the folly of hypocrisy.</p></b></font> "Hypocrites do not actually <i>do </i>
    good, they merely make a <i>show </i>of it," Melanchthon. They carry it fair 
    with men—but care not how bad their hearts are; they live in secret sin. 
    "They say—How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?" Psalm 73:11. 
    "What does God know? Can He judge through thick darkness?" Job 22:13 "God 
    has forgotten, he hides his face, he will never see it." But, "His 
    understanding is infinite!" He has a window to look into men's hearts! He 
    has a key to open up the heart; he beholds all the sinful workings of men's 
    spirits, as in a glass bee-hive we can see the bees working in their combs. 
    Matt 6:6, "Your Father who sees in secret." God sees in secret. As a 
    merchant enters debts in his book, so God has his debt-book, in which he 
    enters every sin. Jeroboam's wife disguised herself, so that the prophet 
    would not know her; but he discerned her. "When Ahijah heard her footsteps 
    at the door, he called out—Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending 
    to be someone else? I have bad news for you!" 1 Kings 14:6. The hypocrite 
    thinks to disguise and juggle with God—but God will unmask him. "God shall 
    bring every work into judgement, with every secret thing." "For they have 
    done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their 
    neighbors' wives and in my name have spoken lies, which I did not tell them 
    to do. <b>I know it and am a witness to it</b>—declares the Lord." Jeremiah 
    29:23
<p></p>
<p>Ay—but the hypocrite hopes he shall color over his sin, 
    and make it look very good. Absalom masks over his treason with the pretense 
    of a religious vow. Judas cloaks his envy at Christ, and his covetousness, 
    with the pretense of "charity to the poor." Jehu makes religion a cloak for 
    his selfish design. But God sees through these fig-leaves! You may see a 
    jade under his gilt trappings. "My eyes are on all their ways; they are not 
    hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. Jeremiah 16:17. <b>
    He who has an <i>eye </i>to see—will find a <i>hand </i>to punish!</b></p>
<font color="#008000">
<p>Use three: Is God so infinite in knowledge? Then we 
    should always feel as under his omniscient eye. </p></font>"We ought to live 
    as if always in full view of God," Seneca. Let us place David's prospect 
    before our eye, "I have set the Lord always before me." Seneca counseled 
    Lucilius, that whatever he was doing, he should imagine some of the Roman 
    nobles stood before him, and then he would do nothing dishonorable. The 
    consideration of God's omniscience would be preventive of much sin. The eye 
    of <i>man </i>will restrain from sin; and will not <i>God's eyes </i>much 
    more? "Will he even assault the queen right here in the palace, <i>before my 
    very eyes? </i>the king roared." Esther 7:8. Will we sin when our Judge 
    looks on? Would men speak so vainly, if they considered God overheard them?
    
<p></p>
<p>Latimer took heed to every word in his examination, when 
    he heard the pen go behind the hangings. Just so, what care would people 
    have of their words, if they remembered that God heard, and his pen was 
    writing everything down in heaven? Would people commit immorality, if they 
    believed God was a spectator of their wickedness, and would make them do 
    penance in hell for it? Would they defraud in their dealings, and use false 
    weights, if they knew God saw them, and for making their weights lighter 
    would make their damnation heavier?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Viewing ourselves as under the eye of God's omniscience, 
    would cause reverence in the worship of God. God sees the frame and demeanor 
    of our hearts, when we come before him. How would this call in our 
    straggling thoughts? How would it animate and invigorate duty? It would make 
    us put <i>fire </i>to the incense. We must worship God with the utmost zeal 
    and intenseness of spirit. To think that <i>God is in this place </i>would 
    add <i>wings </i>to prayer, and <i>oil </i>to the flame of our devotion!</p>

<p>Use four: Is God's knowledge infinite? Study sincerity, 
    be what you seem.</p></b></font> "The Lord does not look at the things man looks 
    at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart." 1 
    Samuel 16:7. Men judge the heart by the actions. God judges the actions by 
    the heart. If the heart is sincere, God will see the <i>faith </i>and bear 
    with the <i>failing</i>. Asa had his blemishes—but his heart was right with 
    God. God saw his <i>sincerity</i>, and pardoned his <i>infirmity</i>. 
    Sincerity in a Christian is like chastity in a wife, which excuses many 
    failings. Sincerity makes our duties acceptable, like musk among linen, 
    which perfumes it. As Jehu said to Jehonadab, "Is your heart right with me? 
    And he said, It is. If it is—give me your hand; and he took him up into the 
    chariot." Just so, if God sees that our heart is right, that we love him, 
    and aim at his glory—he says, "Give me your prayers and tears; now you shall 
    come up with me into the chariot of glory!" Sincerity makes our services to 
    be golden, and God will not cast away the gold, though it may lack some 
    weight. Is God omniscient, and his eye chiefly upon the heart? Wear the <i>
    belt of truth</i> about you, and never leave it off.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use five: Is God a God of infinite knowledge? Then there 
    is comfort</p></b></font>, (1.) To the saints in particular. (2.) To the church 
    in general.
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(1.) Comfort to SAINTS in particular. </p></b>In case of 
    private devotion. Christian, you set hours apart for God, your thoughts run 
    upon him as your treasure; God takes notice of every good thought. "He had a 
    book of remembrance written for those who thought upon his name." You enter 
    into your closet, and pray to your Father in secret; he hears every sigh and 
    groan! "My groaning is not hidden from you." You water the seed of your 
    prayer with tears—God bottles every tear! "You keep track of all my sorrows. 
    You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one 
    in your book!" Psalm 56:8. When the secrets of all hearts shall be opened, 
    God will make an honorable mention of the zeal and devotion of his people, 
    and he himself will be the herald of their praises. "Then shall every man 
    have praise of God."
<p></p>
<p>The infiniteness of God's knowledge is a comfort, in the 
    case of saints who have not a clear knowledge of themselves. They find so 
    much corruption, that they judge they have no grace. "If it is so--why am I 
    thus? If I have grace, why is my heart in so dead and earthly a frame?" Oh 
    remember, God is of infinite knowledge—he can spy grace where you cannot; he 
    can see grace hidden under corruption, as the stars may be hidden behind a 
    cloud. God can see that holiness in you, which you can not discern in 
    yourself. He can spy <i>the flower of grace </i>in you, though overtopped 
    with weeds. "Because there is some good thing in him." God sees some good 
    thing in His people--when they can see no good in themselves; and though 
    they judge themselves harshly, He will forgive their sins and infirmities!</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is comfort in respect of personal injuries. It is the 
    saints' lot to suffer. The <i>head </i>being crowned with thorns, the <i>
    feet </i>must not tread upon roses. If saints find a real purgatory, it is 
    in this life; but this is their comfort—that God sees the wrong which is 
    done to them; the pupil of his eye is touched, and is he not sensible of it? 
    Paul was scourged by cruel hands. "Thrice was I beaten with rods;" as if you 
    should see a slave whip the king's son! God beholds it. "I know their 
    sorrows." The wicked make wounds in the backs of the saints, and then pour 
    in vinegar; but God writes down their cruelty. Believers are a part of 
    Christ's mystical body; and for every drop of a saint's blood spilt—God puts 
    a drop of wrath in his vial!</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(2.) Comfort to the CHURCH of God in general. </p></b>If God 
    is a God of knowledge, he sees all the plots of the enemies against Zion, 
    and can make them abortive. The wicked are treacherous, having borrowed 
    their skill from the old serpent! They dig deep, to hide their counsels from 
    God—but he sees them, and can easily counterwork them. The dragon is 
    described with <i>seven heads</i>—to show how he plots against the church; 
    but God is described with <i>seven eyes—</i>to show that he sees all the 
    plots and stratagems of the enemies; and when they deal treacherously, he 
    can easily confound them. "Come," says Pharaoh, "let us deal wisely." But he 
    never more played the fool, than when he thought to deal wisely. "During the 
    last watch of the night the Lord <i>looked </i>down from the pillar of fire 
    and cloud at the Egyptian army, and threw it into confusion." Exodus 14:24. 
    How may this, like sap in the vine, comfort the church of God in her earthly 
    state! The Lord has an eye in all the councils and machinations of the 
    enemy; he sees them in their efforts, and can blow them up in their own 
    mine!<br/>
 
<p></p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">The ETERNITY of God</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>The next attribute is, "God is eternal." "From 
    everlasting to everlasting, you are God." </p>
<p></p>
<p>There are three kinds of beings:</p>
<p>1. Such beings as had a <i>beginning</i>—and shall have 
    an <i>end. </i>Such as all animate creatures—the animals, birds, fish—which 
    at death are destroyed and return to dust. Their being ends with their life.
    </p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Such beings as had a <i>beginning</i>—but shall have
    <i>no end. </i>Such as angels and the souls of men, which are eternal once 
    they are brought into existence—they abide forever. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Such as is <i>without beginning</i>—and <i>without 
    ending</i>. This is proper only to God. He is <i>from </i>everlasting—<i>to
    </i>everlasting. This is God's title, a jewel of his crown. He is called 
    "the King eternal." <i>Jehovah </i>is a word that properly sets forth God's 
    eternity. It is a word so dreadful, that the Jews trembled to name or read 
    it; and used <i>Adonai</i>, 'Lord,' in its place. <i>Jehovah </i>contains in 
    it time past, present, and to come. "I am the Alpha and the Omega—says the 
    Lord God—who <b>is</b>, and who <b>was</b>, and who <b>is to come</b>, the 
    Almighty." Revelation 1:8. This verse illustrates the word Jehovah; (who <i>
    is</i>) he subsists of himself, having a pure and independent being; (who <i>
    was</i>) God alone, was before time; there is no searching into the records 
    of eternity; (who <i>is to come</i>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever!" Psalm 
    45:6. The doubling of the word ratifies the certainty of it, as the doubling 
    of Pharaoh's dream. His <i>kingdom </i>has no end; his <i>crown </i>has no 
    successors. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I shall prove that God alone could be eternal—without <i>
    beginning</i>. <i>Angels </i>could not be eternal; they are but creatures, 
    and though spirits—they were created. Therefore their beginning may be 
    known; their antiquity may be searched into. If you ask, <i>when were they 
    created? </i>Some think before the world was; but not so: for what was 
    before time was eternal. The first origin of angels reaches back no further, 
    than the beginning of the world. It is thought by the learned, that the 
    angels were made on the day on which the heavens were made. "When the 
    morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy." 
    Jerome, Gregory, and venerable Bede understand it, that when God laid the 
    foundation-stone of the world, the angels being then created, sang anthems 
    of joy and praise. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It is proper to God only to be eternal, without 
    beginning. He is Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. No creature can 
    write itself <i>Alpha</i>, that is only a flower of the crown of heaven. 
    Exod 3:14. "I am who I am," that is, "I am the one who always is. I am he 
    who exists <i>from</i>, and <i>to </i>eternity!" "The Lord will reign 
    forever and ever!" Exodus 15:18. "The Lord is King forever and ever!" Psalm 
    10:16. </p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>Use one: Here is thunder and lightning to the WICKED. </p></b>
</font>"Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven 
    golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever!" 
    Revelation 15:7. God is eternal, therefore the torments of the wicked are 
    eternal! God lives forever; and as long as God lives, he will be punishing 
    the damned! This should be as the handwriting upon the wall, which should 
    have this effect— "and his face turned pale with fear. Such terror gripped 
    him that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way beneath him." 
    Daniel 5:6. The sinner takes liberty to sin; he breaks God's laws, like a 
    wild beast that breaks over the hedge, and leaps into forbidden pasture; he 
    sins with greediness, as if he thought he could not sin fast enough. "They 
    don't care anymore about right and wrong, and they have given themselves 
    over to immoral ways. Their lives are filled with all kinds of impurity and 
    greed." Ephesians 4:19. But remember, one of God's names is <i>Eternal</i>, 
    and as long as God is eternal he has time enough to reckon with all his 
    enemies. To make sinners tremble, let them think of these three things: the 
    torments of the damned are without intermission, without mixture, and 
    eternal.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>(1.) Without intermission. </p></b></font>Their pains shall 
    be acute and sharp, and no relaxation; the fire shall not be slackened or 
    abated. "They have no rest day nor night;" like one who has his joints 
    stretched continually on the rack, and has no ease. The wrath of God is 
    compared to a <i>stream </i>of brimstone. Isa 30:33. Why to a stream? 
    Because a stream runs without intermission; so God's wrath runs like a 
    stream, and pours out without intermission. In the pains of this present 
    life, there is some abatement and intermission; the fever abates; after a 
    fit of the stone, the patient has some ease; but the pains of hell are 
    intense and violent. The damned soul never says, "I am now more at ease."
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>(2.) Without mixture. </p></b></font>Hell is a place of pure 
    justice. In this life, God in anger remembers mercy, he mixes compassion 
    with suffering. Asher's shoe was of iron—but his foot was dipped in oil. 
    Affliction is the iron shoe—but mercy is mixed with it; the foot is dipped 
    in oil. But the torments of the damned have no mixture. "They shall drink of 
    the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out <i>without mixture</i>." 
    No mixture of mercy. 
<p></p>
<p>How is the cup of wrath said to be <i>mixed?</i> "For the 
    Lord holds a cup in his hand; it is full of foaming wine <i>mixed </i>with 
    spices. He pours the wine out in judgment, and all the wicked must drink it, 
    draining it to the dregs!" Psalm 75:8. Yet in the Revelation it is said to 
    be <i>without mixture</i>. It is mixed, that is, it is full of all the 
    ingredients that may make it bitter; the worm, the fire, the curse of God, 
    all these are bitter ingredients. It is a mixed cup—yet it is without 
    mixture; there shall be nothing to afford the least comfort, no mixture of 
    mercy, and so without mixture. In the <i>sacrifice of jealousy</i>, Numb 
    5:15, no oil was put to it; so, in the torments of the damned, there is no 
    oil of mercy to abate their sufferings.</p>
<p></p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p>(3.) Without cessation, eternal. </p></font>The pleasures of 
    sin are but for a season—but the torments of the wicked are forever! </b>
    Sinners have a short feast—but a long reckoning! Origen erroneously thought, 
    that after a thousand years, the damned would be released out of their 
    misery; but the worm, the fire, the prison—are all eternal. "The smoke of 
    their torment rises forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or 
    night." Revelation 14:11. "The torments of hell keep on punishing, they 
    never end," Prosper. <i>Eternity </i>is a sea without bottom and banks. 
    After millions of years, there is not one minute in eternity spent; and the 
    damned must be ever burning—but never consumed, always dying—but never dead. 
    "They shall seek death—but shall not find it." 
<p></p>
<p>The fire of hell is such, as multitudes of tears will not 
    quench it; and length of time will not finish it! The vial of God's wrath 
    will be always dropping upon the sinner! As long as God is eternal, he lives 
    to be avenged upon the wicked. Oh eternity! eternity! who can fathom it? 
    Mariners have their plummets to measure the depths of the sea; but what line 
    or plummet shall we use to fathom the depth of eternity? The breath of the 
    Lord kindles the infernal lake, Isa 30:33; where shall we have buckets to 
    quench <i>that </i>fire? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh eternity! If all the body of the earth and sea were 
    turned to sand, and all the air up to the starry heaven were nothing but 
    sand, and<i> a little bird </i>should come every thousand years, and fetch 
    away in her bill but the tenth part of a grain of all that heap of sand; 
    what numberless years would be spent before that vast heap of sand would be 
    fetched away! Yet, if at the end of all that time, the sinner might come out 
    of hell, there would be some <i>hope</i>. But that word "Forever" breaks the 
    heart. "The smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever." What a 
    terror is this to the wicked--enough to put them into a cold sweat, to 
    think, as long as God is eternal, he lives forever to be avenged upon them!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here the question may be asked—<font color="#008000"><b>Why 
    should sin that is committed in a short time, be punished eternally?</b></font></p>

<p></p>
<p>We must hold with Augustine, "that God's judgments on the 
    wicked, may be <i>secret</i>—but never <i>unjust</i>." The reason why sin 
    committed in a short time is eternally punished, is, because every sin is 
    committed against an infinite essence, which nothing less than eternity of 
    punishment can satisfy. Why is treason punished with death—but because it is 
    against the king's person, which is sacred; much more that offence which is 
    against God's crown and dignity is of a heinous and infinite nature, and 
    cannot be satisfied with less than eternal punishment.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of comfort to the GODLY. </p></b></font>God is 
    eternal, therefore he lives forever to reward the godly. "To those who seek 
    for glory and honor, eternal life." The people of God are now in a suffering 
    condition. "Bonds and afflictions await me." The wicked are clad in purple, 
    and fare deliciously, while the godly suffer. The <i>goats </i>climb upon 
    high mountains, while Christ's <i>sheep </i>are in the valley of slaughter. 
    But here is the comfort—God is eternal, and he has appointed eternal 
    recompenses for the saints. In heaven are fresh delights, and sweetness 
    without excess. That which is the crown and zenith of heaven's happiness, 
    is—that it is "eternal." Were there but the least suspicion that this glory 
    must cease, it would much eclipse, yes, embitter it; but it is eternal. "An 
    eternal weight of glory." 
<p align="justify">What angel can span eternity? The saints shall bathe 
    themselves in the <i>rivers </i>of divine pleasure; and these rivers can 
    never be dried up. "At your right hand are pleasures for evermore." This is 
    the highest strain in the apostle's rhetoric, "Forever with the Lord!" In 
    heaven, there is peace without trouble, ease without pain, glory without 
    end; "forever with the Lord!" </p>
<p align="justify">Let this comfort the saints in all their troubles; their 
    sufferings are but short—but their reward is eternal! Eternity makes heaven 
    to be heaven! Eternity is the diamond in the ring! Oh blessed <i>day, </i>
    which shall have <i>no night! </i>The <i>sunlight of glory </i>shall rise 
    upon the soul, and never set! Oh blessed <i>spring</i>, that shall have no 
    autumn, or fall of the leaf. The Roman emperors have three crowns set upon 
    their heads—the first of iron, the second of silver, the third of gold; so 
    the Lord sets three crowns on his children—grace, comfort, and glory. The 
    saints' crown is eternal, "You shall receive a crown of glory which never 
    fades away!" The wicked have a never-dying worm; and the godly a 
    never-fading crown! Oh how should this be a spur to virtue! How willing 
    should we be to work for God! Though we have nothing here on earth, God has 
    time enough to reward his people. The crown of eternity shall be set upon 
    their head!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Of exhortation.</p></b></font> <i>Study </i>
    eternity. Our thoughts should chiefly run upon eternity. We all wish for 
    something that may delight our mind. If we could have lived, as Augustine 
    says, from the infancy of the world to the world's old age, what is 
    this—compared to eternity? What is time, measured with eternity? As the 
    earth is but a small point, compared to the heavens. Just so, <b>time </b>is 
    scarcely a moment—compared to eternity! And then, what is this poor life 
    which crumbles away so fast? <i>Oh, think of eternity! 
</i>
<p align="justify">Brethren, we are every day <i>traveling to eternity</i>; 
    and whether we wake or sleep—we are going our journey. Some of us are upon 
    the <i>borders </i>of eternity. Oh study the shortness of life—and length of 
    eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">More particularly think of <i>God's </i>eternity and the
    <i>soul's </i>eternity. Think of <b>God's </b>eternity. He is the <i>Ancient 
    of Days</i>, who was before all time. There is a figurative description of 
    God, "As I kept watching, thrones were set in place, and <i>the Ancient of 
    Days </i>took His seat. His <i>clothing </i>was white like snow, and the <i>
    hair </i>of His head like whitest wool. His throne was flaming fire; its 
    wheels were blazing fire. A river of fire was flowing, coming out from His 
    presence. Thousands upon thousands served Him; ten thousand times ten 
    thousand stood before Him. The court was convened, and the books were 
    opened." Daniel 7:9-10. His clothing was white like snow, which signifies 
    his majesty. His hair, like the pure wool, signifies his holiness. His 
    title, <i>the Ancient of Days</i>, signifies his eternity. </p>
<p align="justify">The thought of God's eternity should make us have high 
    adoring thoughts of God. We are apt to have low, irreverent thoughts of him. 
    "You thought I was such an one as yourself," weak and mortal. But if we 
    would think of God's eternity, when all our power ceases—he is King eternal, 
    his crown flourishes forever, he can make us happy or miserable forever—this 
    would make us have adoring thoughts of God. "The twenty-four elders <i>fall 
    down</i> before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for 
    ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne." Revelation 4:10. 
    The saints <i>fall down</i>, to signify by that humble posture, that they 
    are not worthy to sit in God's presence. They fall down and they worship him 
    who lives forever and ever; they do as it were, kiss his feet. They cast 
    their crowns before the throne, they lay all their honor at his feet; thus 
    they show humble adoration to the eternal essence. Study God's eternity, it 
    will make us adore him—where we cannot fathom him. </p>
<p align="justify">Think of the <b>soul's </b>eternity. As God is eternal, 
    so he has made <i>us </i>eternal. We are never-dying creatures; we are 
    shortly entering upon our eternal state—either of eternal happiness or 
    eternal misery. Have serious thoughts of this. Say, "O my soul, which of 
    these two eternities is like to be your portion? I must shortly depart 
    hence, and where then shall I go—to which of these eternities, either of 
    glory or misery shall I go?" The serious meditation on the eternal state we 
    are to pass into, would work strongly with us.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Thoughts of eternal torments, are a good antidote 
    against sin. </p></b></font>Sin tempts with its pleasure; but when we think of 
    eternity, it may cool the intemperate heat of lust. Shall I, for the 
    pleasure of sin for a season—endure eternal pain? Sin, like those locusts, 
    Rev 9:7, seems to have on its head a crown like gold—but it has in it a tail 
    like a scorpion, verse 10, and a sting in its tail; and this sting can never 
    be plucked out. Shall I venture eternal wrath? Is sin committed so sweet—as 
    lying in hell forever is bitter? This thought would make us flee from sin, 
    as Moses fled from the serpent!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The serious thoughts of eternal happiness would very 
    much take us off from worldly things. </p></b></font>What are these sublunary 
    things, compared to eternity! They are quickly gone. They greet us—and then 
    take their farewell. But I am to enter upon an <i>everlasting </i>estate; I 
    hope to live with him who is eternal. What then, is the present fleeting 
    world to me? To those who stand upon the top of the Alps—the great cities 
    below are small things in their eyes. Just so, to him who has his thoughts 
    fixed on his eternal state after this life—all these earthly things seem as 
    nothing in his eye. What is the glory of this world? How poor and 
    contemptible, compared with an eternal weight of glory!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The serious thoughts of an eternal state, either of 
    happiness or misery, should have a powerful influence upon whatever we take 
    in hand.</p></b></font> Every work we do promotes either a <i>blessed </i>
    eternity<i>, </i>or a <i>cursed </i>eternity. Every <i>good </i>action sets 
    us a step nearer to an eternity of happiness. Every <i>bad </i>action sets 
    us a step nearer to an eternity of misery. Oh what influence should the 
    thoughts of eternity have upon our pious duties! It should make us do them 
    with all our might. Duty well performed, lifts a Christian higher towards 
    heaven, and sets a Christian a step nearer to a blessed eternity!

</b></font>

    Nebuchadnezzar. The crown has many successors. <i>Kingdoms </i>have their

    of Troy? [Now corn grows, where the great city of Troy once stood]. Though 
    kingdoms have a <i>head of gold</i>, they have <i>feet of clay</i>. 
<p></p>
<p>The <i>heavens </i>change. "They will perish, but you 
    remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change 
    them and they will be discarded. But you remain the same, and your years 
    will never end." Psalm 102:26-27. The heavens are the most ancient records, 
    where God has written his glory with a sunbeam—yet these shall change. 
    Though I do not think they shall be destroyed as to their substance—yet they 
    shall be changed as to their qualities; they shall melt with fervent heat, 
    and so be more refined and purified. 2 Peter 3:12. Thus the heavens shall be 
    changed—but not <i>he </i>who dwells in heaven. "I am the Lord, and <b>I do 
    not change</b>."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The best <i>saints </i>have their eclipses and changes. 
    Look upon a Christian in his spiritual estate, and he is full of variation. 
    Though the <i>seed of grace </i>does not <i>die</i>—yet its beauty and 
    activity often <i>wither</i>. A Christian has his <i>aguish fits</i> in 
    piety. Sometimes his faith is at a high tide—and sometimes low ebb; 
    sometimes his love flames—and at another time is like fire in the embers, 
    and he has lost his first love. How strong was David's grace at one time! 
    "God is my rock, in him will I trust." At another time he says, "I shall one 
    day perish by the hand of Saul." What Christian can say he does not find a 
    change in his <i>graces</i>; that the bow of his faith never unbends, the 
    strings of his violin never slacken? Surely we shall never meet with such 
    Christians until we meet them in heaven! But God is without any shadow of 
    change. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The <i>angels </i>were subject to change; they were 
    created holy—but mutable. "The angels which kept not their first estate." 
    Jude 6. These <i>morning </i>stars of heaven were <i>falling </i>stars. But 
    God's glory shines with a fixed brightness. In God there is nothing which 
    can change, for better or worse. He cannot change for the <i>better</i>—because 
    then he would not now be perfect. He cannot change for the worse—for then he 
    would cease to be perfect. He is immutably holy, immutably good; there is no 
    shadow of change in him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when Christ, who is God, assumed the human nature—was 
    there a change in God?</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the divine nature had been converted into the human, 
    or the human into the divine, there would have been a change—but they were 
    not. The human nature was distinct from the divine nature. Therefore there 
    was no change. A cloud over the sun makes no change in the the sun. Just so, 
    though the divine nature is covered with the human nature, it makes no 
    change in the divine nature.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>[2] There is no end put to his being.</p></b></font> "Who 
    alone has immortality." The Godhead cannot die. An infinite essence cannot 
    be changed into finite; and God is infinite. He is eternal, consequently he 
    is not mortal. To be eternal and mortal is a contradiction.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use one: See the excellence of the divine nature in its 
    immutability. </p></b></font>This is the glory of the Godhead. Mutableness 
    denotes <i>weakness</i>, and is not in God, who is "the <i>same</i>, 
    yesterday, and today, and forever." <i>Men </i>are fickle and mutable, like 
    Reuben, "unstable as water." Men are changeable in their <i>principles</i>. 
    If their faces altered as fast as their opinions—we would not recognize 
    them. Men are changeable in their <i>resolutions</i>; just as the wind that 
    blows in the east, presently turns about to the west. They resolve to be 
    virtuous—but quickly give up of their resolutions. Their minds are like a 
    sick man's pulse, which alters every half hour. The apostle Jude compares 
    them to <i>waves of the sea</i>, and <i>wandering stars</i>. They are not <i>
    pillars </i>in God's temple—but <i>reeds</i> shaken by the wind. Others are 
    changeable in their <i>friendship</i>. They quickly <i>love</i>—and quickly
    <i>hate</i>. Sometimes they will press you to their bosom; later they will 
    excommunicate you out of their favor. They change as the chameleon, into 
    several colors. But God is immutable—he does not change.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use two: See the vanity of the creature. </p></b></font>There 
    are changes in everything, but in God. "Lowborn men are but a breath, the 
    highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together 
    they are only a breath." Psalm 62:9. We look for more from the creature, 
    than God has put in it. The creature has two evils in it—it promises more 
    than we find—and it fails us when we most need it. A man desires to have his 
    corn harvested—but the rain falls; the mariner is for a voyage—but the wind 
    does not blow, or is contrary; one depends upon another for the payment of a 
    promise, and he fails, and is like a foot out of joint. Who can find a fixed 
    stability in the vain creature? It is as if one should build houses on the 
    sand, where the sea comes in and overflows. The creature is true to nothing 
    but deceit—and is constant only in its disappointments. It is no more 
    astonishing to see changes in the creature, than to see the moon dressing 
    itself in a new shape and figure. Expect to meet with changes in everything, 
    but God.

<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use three: Comfort to the godly.</p></b></font> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(1.) In case of losses. </p></b></font>If an estate, you are 
    almost boiled away to nothing, and if you lose friends by death—there is a 
    double eclipse. But the comfort is—God is unchangeable. I may lose these 
    things—but I cannot lose my God; he never dies. When the fig-tree and 
    olive-tree failed, God did not fail. "I will rejoice in the God of my 
    salvation." Flowers in the garden die—but a man's portion remains. Just so, 
    outward things die and change—but "you are the strength of my heart, and my 
    portion forever."
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(2.) In case of sadness of spirit. </p></b></font>God seems 
    to cast off the soul in desertion. "My Beloved had withdrawn himself." Yet, 
    God is unchangeable. He is immutable in his love; he may change his <i>
    countenance</i>—but not his <i>heart! </i>"I have loved you with an <i>
    everlasting </i>love." Jer 31:1. Hebrew<i>—a love of eternity</i>. If once 
    God's electing love rises upon the soul—it never sets. "Though the mountains 
    be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not 
    be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed—says the Lord, who has 
    compassion on you." Isaiah 54:10. God's love stands firmer than the 
    mountains. His love to Christ is unchangeable; and he will no more cease 
    loving believers, than he will cease loving Christ.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use four: Of exhortation.</p></b></font> Get a saving 
    interest in the unchangeable God, then you are as a rock in the 
    sea—immoveable in the midst of all changes.
<p></p>
<b>
<p>How shall I get a part in the unchangeable God?</p>
</b>
<p></p>
<p>By having a change wrought in you. "But you are 
    washed—but you are sanctified." By this change we are savingly interested in 
    the unchangeable God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trust to that God, who alone who is unchangeable. "Cease 
    from man," stop trusting to the <i>reed</i>—but trust to the <i>Rock </i>of 
    ages. He who is by faith engarrisoned in God, is safe in all changes; he is 
    like a boat that is tied to an immoveable rock. He who trusts in God, trusts 
    in that which cannot fail him; for God is unchangeable. "I will never leave 
    you, nor forsake you." <i>Health </i>may leave us, <i>riches</i>, <i>friends
    </i>may leave us; "but," says God, "I will never leave you; my <i>power </i>
    shall support you; my <i>Spirit </i>shall sanctify you; my <i>mercy </i>
    shall save you! I will never leave you!" Oh trust in this unchangeable God!
    </p>
<p></p>
<p>God is jealous of two things; of our <i>love</i>, and of 
    our <i>trust</i>. He is jealous of our <b>love</b>, lest we love the 
    creature more than him; therefore he makes it prove bitter. God is jealous 
    of our <b>trust</b>, lest we should place more confidence in the creature, 
    than in him, therefore he makes it prove unfaithful. Outward comforts are 
    given us as food along the way—to refresh us, not as crutches to lean on. If 
    we make the creature an idol, what we make our <i>trust, </i>God will make 
    our <i>shame</i>. Oh trust in the immortal God! Like Noah's dove, we have no 
    footing for our souls, until we get into <i>the ark of God's 
    unchangeableness.</i> "Those who trust in the Lord shall be like mount Zion, 
    which cannot be removed."</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p>II. God is unchangeable in his DECREE.</p></b></font> What he 
    has decreed from eternity is unalterable. "My purpose will stand, and I will 
    do all that I please." Isaiah 46:10. God's eternal counsel or decree, is 
    immutable. If he changed his decree, it must be from some defect of wisdom 
    or foresight, for that is the reason why men change their purposes; they see 
    something afterwards, which they did not see before. But this cannot be the 
    cause why God should alter his decree, because his knowledge is perfect—he 
    sees all things in one entire prospect before him.
<p></p>
<p>But is not God said to<b> repent? </b>This seems to be a 
    change in his decree? "The Lord repented of the evil that he said he would 
    do unto them."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Repentance is attributed to God, <i>figuratively</i>. "He 
    is not a man, that he should repent." There may be a change in God's <i>work</i>—but 
    not in his <i>will</i>. He may will a change—but not change his will. "God 
    may change his sentence—but not his decree." A king may cause sentence to be 
    passed upon a malefactor whom he intends to save; so God threatened 
    destruction to Nineveh—but the people of Nineveh repenting, God spared them. 
    Here God changed his sentence—but not his decree; it was what had lain in 
    the womb of his purpose from eternity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But if God's decree be unchangeable, and cannot be 
    reversed, then to what purpose should we use the <b>means</b>? Our endeavors 
    towards salvation cannot alter his decree.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The decree of God does not affect my endeavor; for he who 
    decreed my salvation, decreed it in the use of means; and if I neglect the 
    means I reprobate myself. No man argues thus: "God has decreed how long I 
    shall live, therefore I will not use any means to preserve my life, I will 
    not eat and drink." As God has decreed the length of my life, in the use of 
    means—so God has decreed my salvation in the use of the Word and of prayer. 
    As a man who refuses food murders himself—just so, he who refuses to work 
    out his salvation destroys himself. The vessels of mercy are said to be <i>
    prepared </i>unto glory. How are they prepared, but by being sanctified? and 
    that cannot be, but in the use of means. Therefore let not God's decree, 
    take you off from holy endeavors. It is a good saying of Preston, "Have you 
    a heart to pray to God? it is a sign that no decree of wrath has passed 
    against you."</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use one: If God's decree is eternal and unchangeable, 
    then God does not elect upon our <i>foreseen </i>faith, as the Arminians 
    maintain.</p></b></font> "The children being not yet born, that the purpose of 
    God according to election might stand, it was said, Jacob have I loved, Esau 
    have I hated." Romans 9:11, 13. We are not elected <i>for </i>our 
    holiness—but <i>to </i>holiness. Eph 1:1. If we are not <i>justified </i>for 
    our faith, much less are we <i>elected </i>for our faith. We are said to be 
    justified <i>through </i>faith as an instrument—but not <i>for </i>faith as 
    a cause; and, if not justified <i>for </i>faith, then much less elected <i>
    for </i>faith. God's decree of election, is eternal and unchangeable, and 
    therefore depends not upon foreseen faith. "As many as were ordained to 
    eternal life, believed." They were not elected because they believed—but 
    they believed because they were elected.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use two: If God's decree be unchangeable, it gives 
    comfort in two cases. </p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(1.) Concerning God's providence towards his church.</p></b></font> 
    We are ready to quarrel with Providence, if everything does not accord with 
    our desire. Remember God's work goes on, and nothing happens, but what he 
    has decreed from eternity. 
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(2.) God has decreed troubles for the church's good.</p></b></font> 
    The <i>troubles </i>of God's church, are like the angel's troubling the 
    water, which made way for <i>healing </i>his people. God has decreed 
    troubles in the church. "His fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem." 
    The wheels in a watch move contrary to one another—but they all carry on the 
    motion of the watch. Just so, the wheels of Providence often move contrary 
    to our desires—but still they carry on God's unchangeable decree. "Many 
    shall be made white." God lets the <i>waters of affliction</i> be poured on 
    his people—to make them white. Therefore, do not murmur at God's dealings! 
    His work goes on, nothing happens, but what he has wisely decreed from 
    eternity. Everything shall promote God's design, and fulfill his decree.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use three: Comfort to the GODLY in regard of their 
    salvation. </p></b></font>"The foundation of God stands sure, having this 
    seal—The Lord knows those who are his." God's counsel of election is 
    unchangeable. Once elected, forever elected. "I will not blot his name out 
    of the book of life." The book of God's decree has no errata in it, no 
    blottings out. Once justified, never unjustified. "Repentance shall be hid 
    from my eyes." Hos 13:14. God never repents of his electing love. "He loved 
    them to the end." Therefore, if you are a believer, comfort yourself with 
    this—the immutability of God's decree.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>Use four: To conclude with a word to the WICKED, who 
    march furiously against God and his people—let them know that God's decree 
    is unchangeable. </p></b></font>God will not alter it, nor can they break it! 
    While they resist God's will, they fulfill it. There is a two-fold will of 
    God—the will of God's <i>precept</i>, and the will of his <i>decree</i>. 
    While the wicked resist the will of God's precept, they fulfill the will of 
    his permissive decree. Judas betrays Christ, Pilate condemns him, the 
    soldiers crucify him; while they resist the will of God's precepts, they 
    fulfill the will of his permissive decree. "For, in fact, in this city both 
    Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 
    assembled together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, to do 
    whatever Your hand and Your plan had predestined to take place." Acts 
    4:27-28. 
<p></p>
<p>God commands one thing, they do the contrary. While they 
    disobey his command, they fulfill his permissive decree. If a man sets up 
    two nets, one of silk, the other of iron, the silken net may be broken, not 
    the iron one. Just so, while men break the silken net of God's command, they 
    are taken in the iron net of his decree; while they sit backward to God's 
    precepts, they row forward to his decrees. God decrees to <i>permit </i>
    their sin, and then to <i>punish </i>them for their sin permitted.<br/>

<p></p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">The WISDOM of God</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>The next attribute is God's wisdom, which is one of the 
    brightest beams of the Godhead. "He is wise in heart." The heart is the seat 
    of wisdom. Among the Hebrews, the heart is put for wisdom. "Men of 
    understanding," Job 34:34. The Hebrew is "Men of heart." God is wise in 
    heart, that is, he is most wise. </p>
<p></p>
<p>God <b>alone </b>is wise—he solely and wholly possesses 
    all wisdom; therefore he is called, "the only wise God." All the treasures 
    of wisdom are locked up in him, and no creature can have any wisdom but as 
    God is pleased to give it out of his treasury. </p>
<p></p>
<p>God is <b>perfectly </b>wise; there is no defect in his 
    wisdom. Men may be wise in some things—but in other things they show 
    imprudence and weakness. But God is the exemplar and pattern of wisdom, and 
    the pattern must be perfect. "As your heavenly Father is perfect." Matthew 
    5:48. God's wisdom appears in two things: </p>
<p>I. His infinite intelligence. </p>
<p>II. His exact working.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>I. His infinite INTELLIGENCE.</p></b></font> He knows the 
    most profound secrets. "Our Lord is great, vast in power; <b>His 
    understanding is infinite</b>." Psalm 147:5. "There is a God in heaven who
    <i>reveals secrets</i>, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what <i>will 
    happen in the future</i>." Daniel 2:28. He knows the thoughts, which are the 
    most intricate subtle things. "I know full well what you are thinking." Job 
    21:27. "The Lord knows the thoughts of man." Psalm 94:11. Let sin be 
    contrived ever so secretly, God will pull off all masks and disguises, and 
    make a heart-anatomy. He knows all future contingencies; all things are 
    before him in one clear prospect.
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>II. His exact and meticulous WORKING. </p></b></font>He is 
    wise in heart; his wisdom lies in his <b>works</b>. These works of God are 
    bound up in three great volumes, where we may read his wisdom.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[1] The work of CREATION.</p></b></font> The creation is both 
    a monument of God's power, and a looking-glass in which we may see his 
    wisdom. None but a wise God could so meticulously contrive the world. Behold 
    the earth decked with variety of <i>flowers</i>, which are both for beauty 
    and fragrance. Behold the heaven bespangled with <i>lights</i>. We may see 
    the glorious wisdom of God blazing in the sun, twinkling in the stars. His 
    wisdom is seen in marshaling and <i>ordering everything in its proper place 
    and sphere</i>. If the sun had been set lower, it would have burnt us; if 
    higher, it would not have warmed us with its beams. God's wisdom is seen in 
    appointing the <i>seasons </i>of the year. "You have made summer and 
    winter." If it had been all summer, the heat would have scorched us; if all 
    winter, the cold would have killed us. The wisdom of God is seen in <i>
    chequering the dark and the light</i>. If it had been all night, there would 
    have been no labor; if all day, there would have been no rest. Wisdom is 
    seen in <i>mixing the elements</i>, as the earth with the sea. If it had 
    been all sea, we would have lacked bread; if it had been all earth, we would 
    have lacked water. The wisdom of God is seen in <i>preparing and ripening 
    the fruits </i>of the earth, in the wind and frost which prepare the fruits, 
    and in the sun and rain which ripen the fruits. God's wisdom is seen in 
    setting bounds to the <i>sea</i>, and so wisely contriving it, that though 
    the sea is higher than many parts of the earth—yet it should not overflow 
    the earth. We may cry out with the Psalmist, "O Lord, how manifold are your 
    works! in wisdom have you made them all." There is nothing to be seen in 
    this world, but <i>miracles of God's wisdom. 
</i>
<p></p>
<p>God's wisdom is seen in ordering <i>social </i>things, 
    that one shall have need of another. The poor need the rich man's money, and 
    the rich need the poor man's labor. God makes one trade depend upon 
    another—that one may be helpful to another, and that mutual love may be 
    preserved.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[2] The second work wherein God's wisdom shines forth is 
    the work of REDEMPTION.</p></b></font> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p></p>
<p>(1.) Redemption is the masterpiece of divine wisdom.</p></b></font> 
    God has contrived a way for happiness for sinful man—and yet uphold his 
    justice! We may cry out with the apostle, "O the depth of the riches both of 
    the wisdom and knowledge of God!" This has astonished men and angels. If God 
    had left <i>us </i>to find out a way of salvation when we were lost—we could 
    neither have had a head to devise, nor a heart to desire—what God's infinite 
    wisdom had planned for us. 
<i>
<p></p>
<p>Mercy </p></i>had a mind to save sinners, and was loath that 
    the justice of God should be wronged. "It is a pity," says Mercy, "that such 
    a noble creature as man should be eternally undone; and yet God's justice 
    must not be a loser. What way then shall be found out? Angels cannot satisfy 
    for the wrong done to God's justice; nor is it fit that one nature should 
    sin—and another nature suffer. What then? Shall man be forever lost?" Now, 
    while <i>Mercy </i>was thus debating with itself, what to do for the 
    recovery of fallen man, the <i>Wisdom </i>of God stepped in—and thus the 
    oracle spoke: "Let God become man; let the Second Person in the Trinity 
    become incarnate, and suffer; and so for fitness he shall be man, and for 
    ability he shall be God! Thus justice may be satisfied, and man saved!" O 
    the depth of the riches of the wisdom of God—thus to make <i>justice </i>and
    <i>mercy </i>to kiss each other! Great is this mystery, "God manifest in the 
    flesh." What wisdom was this—that Christ should be made sin—yet know no sin; 
    that God should condemn the sin—yet save the sinner! Here was wisdom—to find 
    out the way of salvation. 
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(2.) The means by which salvation is applied—sets forth 
    God's wisdom</p></b></font>—that salvation should be by faith, not by works. 
    Faith is a humble grace—it gives all to Christ; it is an adorer of free 
    grace. And free grace being advanced here, God has his glory; and it is his 
    highest wisdom to exalt his own glory. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p></p>
<p>(3.) The way of working faith—declares God's wisdom.</p></b></font> 
    It is wrought by the word preached. "Faith comes by hearing." What is the <i>
    weak breath of a man—</i>to convert a soul? It is like whispering in the 
    ears of a dead man. This is foolishness in the eye of the world; but the 
    Lord loves to show his wisdom by that which seems folly. "He has chosen the 
    foolish things of the world to confound the wise." Why so? "So that no one 
    can ever boast in the presence of God." 
<p></p>
<p>If God were to convert by the ministry of <i>angels</i>—then 
    we would be ready to glory in angels, and give that honor to them which is 
    due to God; but when God works by weak tools, makes use of men who are of 
    like passions with ourselves, and by them converts, then the power is 
    plainly seen to be of God. "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to 
    show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us!" Herein is 
    God's wisdom seen, that no flesh may glory in his Presence.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[3] The wisdom of God wonderfully appears in the works of 
    his PROVIDENCE. </p></b></font>Every providence has a <i>mercy </i>or a <i>
    wonder </i>enrapt up in it. The wisdom of God, in his works of providence, 
    appears:

    some sovereign antidote had been used, if the balm of Gilead had been 
    brought, there would have been some likelihood of a cure; but what was there 
    in a brazen serpent? It was a mere <i>model</i>—and not a <i>real </i>
    serpent; and it was not physically applied to him who was wounded; he was 
    only to <i>look </i>upon it; yet this wrought a cure! The less probability

<p></p>
<p>(2.) The wisdom of God is seen in doing his work, by that 
    which to the eye of flesh seems quite contrary.</p></b></font> God intended to 
    advance Joseph, and to make all his brethren's sheaves bow to his sheaf. 
    Now, what way does he take? First <b>Joseph </b>is thrown into the pit; then 
    sold into Egypt; then after that put in prison. But by his imprisonment God 
    made way for his advancement. For God to save in an <i>ordinary </i>
    way—would not so much display his wisdom. But when he goes <i>strangely </i>
    to work, and <i>saves </i>in that very way in which we think he will <i>
    destroy</i>—his wisdom shines forth in a most conspicuous manner!
<p></p>
<p>God would make <b>Israel </b>victorious, and what way 
    does he take? He <i>lessens </i>Gideon's army. "The people that are with you 
    are too many." He reduces the army of thirty-two thousand, to three hundred; 
    and by taking away the <i>means </i>of victory, makes Israel victorious. </p>
<p></p>
<p>God had a design to bring his people out of <b>Egypt</b>, 
    and a strange course he takes to effect it! He stirred up the hearts of the 
    Egyptians to hate them. "He turned their heart to hate his people." The more 
    they hated and oppressed Israel, the more God plagued the Egyptians, and the 
    more glad they were to let Israel go. The Egyptians were urgent that they 
    might send them out of the land in haste. </p>
<p></p>
<p>God had a mind to save <b>Jonah </b>when he was cast into 
    the sea—so he let the fish swallow him up, and so brought him to the shore.
    </p>
<p></p>
<p>God would save <b>Paul</b>, and all who were in the ship 
    with him—but the ship must be wrecked, so that they could all came safely to 
    land upon the broken pieces of the ship. Acts 27:74. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In reference to the <b>church</b>, God often goes by <i>
    contrary </i>means, and makes the enemy do his work. God can make a straight 
    stroke, with a crooked stick. He has often made his church <i>grow </i>and
    <i>flourish </i>by <i>persecution</i>. "The showers of blood have made her 
    more fruitful," says Julian. Exod 1:10. "Come, we must deal shrewdly with 
    them or they will become even more numerous." But the way the Egyptians took 
    to suppress them, made them multiply. Verse 12. "But the more they were 
    oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to 
    dread the Israelites." Just like the soil—the more it is <i>harrowed</i>, 
    the better crop it bears. The apostles were scattered by persecution, and 
    their scattering was like the scattering of seed. They went up and down, and 
    preached the gospel, and brought daily converts. Paul was put in prison, and 
    his chains were the means of spreading the gospel. "Now I want you to know, 
    brothers, that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the 
    advancement of the gospel." Philippians 1:12.</p>

<p>(3.) The wisdom of God is seen in making the most 
    desperate evils, to work to the good of his children.</p></b></font> As several 
    poisonous ingredients, wisely tempered by the skill of the apothecary, make 
    a sovereign medicine—so God makes the most deadly afflictions work together 
    for the good of his children. He uses severe afflictions to purify them, and 
    prepare them for heaven. "For our momentary light affliction is producing 
    for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory!" 2 Corinthians 
    4:17. These <i>hard frosts</i> hasten the spring flowers of glory! The wise 
    God, by <i>a divine chemistry</i>, turns our afflictions into cordials. He 
    makes his people <i>gainers </i>by <i>losses</i>; and turns their <i>crosses
    </i>into <i>blessings</i>.

<p>(4.) The wisdom of God is seen in this—that the sins of 
    men shall carry on God's work; yet he himself should have no hand in their 
    sin.</p></b></font> The Lord <i>permits </i>sin—but does not <i>approve </i>it. 
    He has a hand in the <i>action </i>in which sin is—but not in the <i>sin </i>
    of the action. As in the crucifying of Christ, so far as it was a natural 
    action, God concurred; if he had not given the Jews life and breath, they 
    could not have done it; but as it was a sinful action, so God abhorred it. A 
    musician plays upon a violin which is out of tune; the musician is the cause 
    of the sound—but the jarring and discord is from the violin itself. Just so, 
    men's <i>natural </i>motion is from God—but their <i>sinful </i>motion is 
    from themselves. When a man rides on a lame horse, his riding is the cause 
    why the horse goes—but the lameness is from the horse itself. Herein is 
    God's wisdom—that the sins of men carry on his work—yet he has no hand in 
    them!

<p>(5.) The wisdom of God is seen in helping in desperate 
    cases. </p></b></font>God loves to show his wisdom—when human help and wisdom 
    fail. Exquisite lawyers love to wrestle with difficult law cases, as this 
    more shows their skill. God's wisdom is never at a loss; but when 
    providences are darkest, then the <i>morning star of deliverance </i>
    appears. "He remembered us in our <i>low </i>estate." Sometimes God melts 
    away the spirits of his enemies. "The Lord has surely given the whole land 
    into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us." Joshua 
    2:24. Sometimes he finds them other work to do, and sounds a retreat to 
    them, as he did to Saul when he was pursuing David. "The Philistines are in 
    the land." When the church seems to be upon destruction, and her peace and 
    liberty ready to be sacrificed, then the deliverance comes.

<p>(6.) God's wisdom is seen in befooling wise men, and in

    deep understanding. "The counsel Ahithophel gave was like that of one who 
    inquires of God;" but he consulted his own shame. "The Lord turned his 
    counsel into foolishness." "God takes the wise in their own craftiness;" 
    that is, when they think to deal wisely, he not only <i>disappoints </i>
    them—but <i>ensnares </i>them. The snares they lay for others, catch 
    themselves! "They have fallen into the pit they dug for others. They have 
    been caught in their own trap." God loves to counterplot politicians; he 
    makes use of their own wit to undo them. He hangs Haman up on his own 
    gallows.

<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>(1.) In lack of spiritual comfort. </p></b></font>God is 
    wise; he sometimes sees it good, that we should be without comfort. Perhaps 
    we would be lifted up in pride if we had spiritual enlargements; as Paul, 
    with his revelations. "Especially because of the extraordinary revelations. 
    Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given 
    to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me so I would not exalt myself." 2 
    Corinthians 12:7. It is hard to have the heart low—when comfort is high. God 
    sees <i>humility </i>to be better for us than <i>joy</i>. It is better to 
    lack comfort, and be humble—than to have it, and be proud!

<p>(2.) In lack of bodily strength</p></b></font>, rest in God's 
    wisdom. He sees what is best. Perhaps the less health—the more grace. 
    Perhaps the weaker in body—the stronger in faith. "Though our outward man is 
    perishing—yet the inward man is renewed day by day." At Rome there were two 
    laurel trees; when the one withered, the other flourished. When God shakes 
    the <i>tree </i>of the body, he is gathering the <i>fruits </i>of 
    righteousness. "No <i>discipline </i>seems enjoyable at the time, but 
    painful. Later on, however, it yields the fruit of peace and righteousness 
    to those who have been trained by it." Hebrews 12:11.<b> Sickness is God's

    to do. "Your way went through the sea, and Your path through the great 
    waters, but <i>Your footprints were unseen</i>." Psalms 77:19. <b>Trust his 
    heart—where you cannot trace his hand. </b>God is most in his way, when we 
    think he is most out of the way. When we think God's church is, as it were, 
    in the grave, and there is a tombstone laid upon her, his wisdom can roll 
    away the stone from the sepulcher. "Christ comes leaping over <i>mountains</i>." 
    Either his <i>power </i>can remove the mountain, or his <i>wisdom </i>knows

    worldliness. God knew if your <i>estate </i>had not been lost—your <i>soul
    </i>would have been lost. God saw that <i>riches </i>would be a snare unto 
    you. "But those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many 
    foolish and harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction. 
    For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and by craving it, 
    some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many 
    pains." 1 Timothy 6:9-10. Are you troubled that God has prevented a snare? 
    God will make you rich in faith. What you lack in temporals, shall be made 
    up in spirituals. God will give you more of his love. You are weak in

<font size="4">The JUSTICE of God</font></p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>The next attribute is God's justice. All God's attributes 
    are in unity, and are the same with his essence. Though he has several 
    attributes whereby he is made known to us—yet he has but one essence. A 
    cedar tree may have several branches—yet it is but one cedar. So there are 
    several attributes of God whereby we conceive of him—but only one entire 
    essence. Well, then, concerning God's justice. "Just and righteous is he." 
    "His justice and great righteousness." God is said to dwell in justice. 
    "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne." Psalm 89:14. 
    In God, <i>power </i>and <i>justice </i>meet. Power holds the scepter, and 
    justice holds the balance.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>I. What is God's justice?</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>"Justice is to give everyone his due." God's justice is 
    the rectitude of his nature, whereby he is carried to the doing of that 
    which is righteous and equal. "Shall not he render to every man according to 
    his works?" God is an impartial judge. He judges the cause. Men often judge 
    the person—but not the cause; which is not justice—but malice. "I will go 
    down and <i>see </i>whether they have done according to the cry which is 
    come up unto me." When the Lord is upon a punitive act, he weighs things in 
    the balance; he does not punish rashly. Concerning God's justice, I shall 
    lay down these six positions:</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[1] God cannot but be just.</p></b></font> His holiness is 
    the cause of his justice. Holiness will not allow him to do anything but 
    what is righteous. He can no more be unjust, than he can be unholy.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[2] God's will is the supreme rule of justice</p></b></font>; 
    it is the standard of equity. His will is <i>wise </i>and <i>good</i>. God 
    wills nothing but what is <i>just</i>; and therefore <i>it is just, because 
    he wills it.
</i><b><font color="#0000ff">
<p></p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p>[3] God does justice, <i>naturally</i>.</p></font> </b>
    Justice flows from his nature. Men may act unjustly, because they are bribed 
    or forced to. But God will not be <i>bribed</i>, because of his justice; he 
    cannot be <i>forced</i>, because of his power. He does justice out of love 
    to justice. "You love righteousness."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[4] Justice is the perfection of the divine nature.</p></b></font> 
    Aristotle says, "Justice comprehends in it all virtues." To say God is just, 
    is to say, he is all that is excellent; all perfections meet in him, as 
    lines in a center. He is not only just—but justice itself.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[5] God never did, nor can do, the least wrong to his 
    creatures.</p></b></font> God's justice has been wronged—but his justice never 
    did any wrong. God may not act according to the rigor of the law; he abates 
    something of his severity. He might inflict heavier penalties than he does. 
    "You have punished us less than our iniquities deserve." <i>Our mercies are 
    more than we deserve, and our punishments less.
</i><b><font color="#008000">
<p></p>
<p>[6] God's justice is such that it is not fit for any man 
    or angel to expostulate with him, or demand a reason of his actions.</p></font>
</b>God has not only authority on his side—but equity. "I will make justice 
    the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line." Isa 28:17. It is below 
    him to give an account to us, of his proceedings. Which of these two should 
    prevail—God's justice or man's reason? "Who are you, O man, to talk back to 
    God? Shall what is formed say to him who formed it—Why did you make me like 
    this?" Romans 9:20. The plumb line of our reason is too short—to fathom the 
    depth of God's justice. Rom 11:33. "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the 
    wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments and 
    untraceable His ways!" We are to adore God's justice, where we cannot see 
    the reason of it.
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>II. God's justice runs in two channels.</p></b></font> It is 
    seen in two things, the distribution of rewards and punishments.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[1] In rewarding the virtuous.</p></b></font> "Truly there is 
    a reward for the righteous." The saints shall not serve him for nothing; 
    though they may be losers <i>for </i>him, they shall not be losers <i>by </i>
    him. "God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love, which you 
    have showed to his name." He gives a reward, not because we have <i>deserved
    </i>it—but because he has <i>promised </i>it.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[2] He is just in punishing offenders. </p></b></font>He is 
    just. (1.) Because he punishes sinners by a law. "Where there is no law, 
    there is no transgression." But God has given men a law, and they break it, 
    therefore he punishes them justly. (2.) God is just in punishing the wicked, 
    because he never punished them, but upon full proof and evidence. What 
    greater evidence than for a man's own conscience to be witness against him! 
    There is nothing God charges upon a sinner but conscience sets its seal to 
    the truth of it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p></p>
<p>Use one: See here another flower of God's crown—he is 
    just and righteous.</p></b></font> He is the exemplar and pattern of justice.
<p></p>
<b>
<p>How can it be consistent with God's justice, that the 
    wicked should prosper in the world? </p></b>"Why does the way of the wicked 
    prosper? Why do the treacherous live at ease?" Jeremiah 12:1. Such as are 
    highest in sin--are often highest in prosperity. This has led many to 
    question God's justice. Diogenes seeing a thief live on affluently, said, 
    "Surely God has cast off the government of the world, and does not care how 
    things go on here below."
<p></p>
<p>(1.) The wicked may be sometimes instruments to do God's 
    work. Though they do not <i>design </i>his glory—yet they may <i>promote </i>
    it. Cyrus was instrumental in the building of God's temple in Jerusalem. 
    There is some kind of justice, that they should have a temporal reward. God 
    lets those prosper under whose wing his people are sheltered. <i>God will 
    not be in any man's debt. </i>"Who has kindled a fire on my altar for 
    nothing?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2.) God lets men go on in sin, and prosper, that he may 
    leave them more inexcusable. "I gave her space to repent of her 
    fornication." God adjourns the sessions, spins out his mercies towards 
    sinners; and if they repent not, his patience will be a witness against 
    them, and his justice will be more cleared in their condemnation. "That you 
    might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge."</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3.) God does not always let the wicked prosper in their 
    sin. Some he punishes openly, that his justice may be taken notice of. "The 
    Lord is known by the judgement which he executes;" that is, his justice is 
    seen by striking men dead in the very act of sin. Thus he struck Zimri and 
    Cozbi in the act of uncleanness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(4.) If God lets men prosper a while in their sin, his 
    vial of wrath is all this while filling; his sword is all this time 
    sharpening. Though God may forbear with men a while—yet long forbearance is 
    no forgiveness. <i>The longer God is in taking his blow, the heavier it will 
    be at last! As long as there is eternity, God has time enough to reckon with 
    his enemies!</i></p>

<p></p>
<p>God's justice may be as a sleeping lion—but the lion will 
    awake at last, and roar upon the sinner! Do not Nero, and Julian, and Cain, 
    now meet with God's justice?</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>But God's own people often suffer great afflictions</p></b></font>; 
    they are injured and persecuted. "This is what the wicked are like—always 
    carefree, they increase in wealth. Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; 
    in vain have I washed my hands in innocence. For I am afflicted all day 
    long, and punished every morning." Psalm 73:12-14. How can this be 
    consistent with God's justice?
<p></p>
<p>(I,) That is a true rule of Austin, <i>"God's ways of 
    judgement are sometimes <b>secret</b>—but never <b>unjust</b>!" </i>The Lord 
    never afflicts his people without a cause; he cannot be unjust towards them. 
    There is some good in the godly, therefore the wicked afflict them; there is 
    some evil in them, therefore God afflicts them. God's own children have 
    their blemishes. "But aren't you also guilty of sins against the Lord your 
    God?" 2 Chronicles 28:10. These spiritual diamonds—have they no <i>flaws</i>? 
    Do we not read of the <i>spots </i>of God's children? Are not they guilty of 
    much pride, censoriousness, passion, worldliness? Though, by their 
    profession, they should resemble the birds of paradise, to fly above, and 
    feed upon the dew of heaven; yet, as the serpent, they lick the dust. These 
    sins of God's people, do more provoke God than the sins of others. "The Lord 
    saw this and was filled with loathing. He was provoked to anger by his own 
    sons and daughters." Deut 32:19. The sins of others pierce Christ's side; 
    the sins of His people wound his heart. Therefore is not God just in all the 
    afflictions which befall them? "You only have I chosen of all the families 
    of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins." Amos 3:2. I 
    will punish you sooner, surer, sorer, than others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2.) The trials and sufferings of the godly, are to 
    refine and purify them. God's furnace is in Zion. Is it any injustice in God 
    to put his gold into the furnace to purify it? Is it any injustice in God, 
    by afflicting his people, to make them partakers of his holiness? What more 
    proclaims God's faithfulness, than to take such a course with them as may 
    make them better? "In faithfulness you have afflicted me."</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3.) What injustice is it in God to inflict a less 
    punishment; in order to prevent a greater punishment? The best of God's 
    children have that in them which is meritorious of hell. Does God do them 
    any wrong, if he uses only the <i>rod</i>, where they have deserved the <i>
    scorpion</i>? Is the father unjust, if he only <i>corrects </i>his child, 
    who has deserved to be <i>disinherited</i>? If God deals so favorably with 
    his children, he only puts <i>wormwood </i>in their cup, whereas he might 
    put <i>fire </i>and <i>brimstone! </i>They should rather admire his mercy 
    than complain of his injustice.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>How can it stand with God's justice, that all men being 
    equally guilty by nature, he does pass by one and save another? Why does he 
    not deal with all alike?</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>"Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid." "Does 
    the Almighty pervert justice?"</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) God is not bound to give an account of his actions 
    to his creatures. If none may question a king, much less God. It is 
    sufficient that God is Lord paramount; he has a sovereign power over his 
    creatures, therefore can do no injustice. "Has not the potter power over the 
    clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to 
    dishonor?" God has liberty in his own bosom, to save one, and not another; 
    and his justice is not at all impeached or blemished. If two men owe you 
    money, you may, without any injustice, remit the debt to one, and exact it 
    of the other. If two malefactors are condemned to die, the king may pardon 
    the one and not the other: he is not unjust if he lets one suffer, because 
    he offended the law; nor if he saves the other, because he will make use of 
    his prerogative as he is king.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Though some are saved and others perish—yet there is 
    no unrighteousness in God; because, whoever perishes, his destruction is of 
    himself. "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself." God offers grace— and the 
    sinner refuses it. Is God bound to give grace? If a surgeon comes to heal a 
    man's wound, and he will not be healed—is the surgeon bound to heal him? "I 
    have called—and you refused." "Israel would not submit to me." Psalm 81:11. 
    God is not bound to <i>force </i>his mercies upon men. If they willfully 
    oppose the offer of grace, their sin is to be regarded as the cause of their 
    perishing, and not God's justice.</p>

<p align="justify">(1.) They are unjust in their courts of law—they pervert 
    justice. "They decree unrighteous decrees." The Hebrew word for a judge's <i>
    robe </i>signifies prevarication, deceit, or injustice, which is more often 
    true of the judge than of the robe. What is a good law without a good judge?
    <i>Injustice </i>lies in two things—either not to punish where there is a 
    fault, or, to punish where there is no fault. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Men are unjust in their dealings. This is, [1] In 
    using false weights. "The balances of deceit are in his hand." It is sad to 
    have the Bible in one hand, and false weights in the other. Or, [2] In 
    adulterating commodities. "Your wine is <i>mixed </i>with water," or when 
    bad grain is mixed with good, and sold for pure grain. I can never believe 
    he is good in the first table of the law—who is not good in the second. He 
    cannot be godly, who is not just. Though God does not bid you be as 
    omnipotent as he is—yet he bids you be as just as he is.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Imitate God in justice. </p></b></font>Let 
    Christ's golden maxim be observed, "in everything, do to others what you 
    would have them do to you." Matt 7:12. You would not have them wrong 
    you—neither must you wrong them; rather <i>suffer </i>wrong—than <i>do </i>
    wrong. "Why do you not rather <i>be </i>wronged?" Oh be exemplary for 
    justice! Let justice be your ornament. "I put on righteousness (namely, 
    justice) as a robe and a diadem." A robe for its graceful beauty; and I put 
    it on, [and I was clothed in righteousness]. A judge puts on his robe, and 
    takes it off again at <i>night</i>; but Job did so put on justice, as he did 
    not take it off until <i>death</i>. We must not lay off this robe of justice 
    until we lay down our bodies in the grave. If you have anything of God in 
    you, you will be like him. By every <i>unjust </i>action, you deny 
    yourselves to be Christians, you stain the glory of your profession. Heathen 
    will rise up in judgement against you. The sun might sooner alter his 
    course, than God could be turned from doing justice.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: If God is just, there will be a day of 
    judgment. </p></b></font>Now things are out of course; sin is rampant, saints 
    are wronged, they are often defeated in a righteous cause, they can meet 
    with no justice here, justice is turned into wormwood. But there is a day 
    coming, when God will set things right; he will do every man justice; he 
    will crown the righteous, and condemn the wicked. "He has appointed a day in 
    which he will judge the world" If God is a just God, he will take vengeance. 
    God has given men a law to live by, and they break it. There must be a day 
    for the execution of offenders. A law not executed is but like a wooden 
    dagger—for a show. At the last day, God's sword shall be drawn out against 
    offenders; then his justice shall be revealed before all the world. "God 
    will judge the world in righteousness." "Shall not the Judge of all the 
    earth do right?"<b> The wicked shall drink a sea of wrath—but not sip one 
    drop of injustice!</b> At that day shall all mouths be stopped, and God's 
    justice shall be fully vindicated from all the cavils and clamors of unjust 
    men.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Comfort to the true penitent. </p></b></font>As God 
    is a just God, he will pardon him. If man acknowledges his sin—God spares 
    him. "If we confess our sins (that is confess and forsake), he is <i>just
    </i>to forgive us our sins." God is not only <i>merciful, </i>but <i>just</i>. 
    Why just? Because he has promised to forgive such. "He who conceals his sins 
    does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy." 
    Proverbs 28:13. If your heart has been broken <i>for </i>and <i>from </i>
    sin—you may not only plead God's <i>mercy</i>—but his <i>justice </i>for the 
    pardoning of your sin. Show him his promise, and he cannot deny himself.

<font size="4">The MERCY of God</font></p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>The next attribute is God's goodness or mercy. <i>Mercy
    </i>is the result and effect—of God's <i>goodness</i>. So then this is the 
    next attribute, God's goodness or mercy. The most learned of the heathens 
    thought they gave their God Jupiter two golden characters when they styled 
    him <i>good </i>and <i>great</i>. Both these meet in God, <i>goodness </i>
    and <i>greatness</i>; <i>mercy </i>and <i>majesty</i>. God is essentially 
    good <i>in </i>himself, and relatively good <i>to </i>us. "You <i>are </i>
    good, and <i>do </i>good." This relative goodness is nothing else but his 
    mercy, which is an innate propensity in God to pity and support such as are 
    in misery.</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p></p>
<p>I. Concerning God's mercy, I shall lay down these twelve 
    positions.</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p>[1] It is the great design of the Scripture to represent 
    God as merciful.</p></font></b> This is a loadstone to draw sinners to him. "I 
    am the Lord, I am the Lord, the merciful and gracious God. I am slow to 
    anger and rich in unfailing love and faithfulness. I show this unfailing 
    love to many thousands by forgiving every kind of sin and rebellion. Even so 
    I do not leave sin unpunished." Exodus 34:6-7. Here are six expressions to 
    set forth God's mercy, and but one to set forth his justice. "God's mercy is 
    far above the heavens." God is represented as a king, with a <i>rainbow </i>
    about his throne. Rev 4:4. The rainbow was an emblem of mercy. The Scripture 
    represents God in <i>white robes of mercy—</i>more often than with garments 
    rolled in blood; with his <i>golden scepter—</i>more often than his iron 
    rod.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[2] God is more inclined to mercy, than wrath.</p></b></font> 
    Mercy is his <i>darling </i>attribute, which he most delights in. "Who is a 
    God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant 
    of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show 
    mercy." Micah 7:18. Mercy pleases him. "It is delightful to the mother," 
    says Chrysostom, "to have her breasts drawn; so it is to God to have the 
    breasts of his mercy drawn." "Fury is not in me," that is, I do not delight 
    in it. Acts of severity are rather <i>forced </i>from God; he does not 
    afflict willingly. "For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to 
    the children of men." Lamentations 3:33. 
<p></p>
<p>The bee naturally gives honey, it stings only when it is 
    provoked. Just so, God does not punish until he can bear no longer. "So that 
    the Lord could bear no longer, because of the evil of your doings." Mercy is 
    God's right hand that he is most used to; inflicting punishment is called 
    his "strange work." He is not used to it. When the Lord would shave off the 
    pride of a nation, he is said to use a <i>hired </i>razor, as if he had none 
    of his own. "On that day the Lord will use a <i>razor hired </i>from beyond 
    the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave the head, the hair on the 
    legs, and to remove the beard as well." Isaiah 7:20. "He is <i>slow </i>to 
    anger," but "<i>ready </i>to forgive."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[3] There is no condition—but we may spy mercy in it. </p></b>
</font>When the church was in captivity, she cried out, "It is of the Lord's 
    mercies that we are not consumed." Geographers write of Syracuse in Sicily, 
    that it is so situated that the sun is never out of sight. In all 
    afflictions we may see some <i>sunshine of mercy</i>. That <i>outward </i>
    and <i>inward </i>troubles do not come together is mercy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[4] Mercy sweetens all God's other attributes.</p></b></font> 
    God's holiness without mercy, and his justice without mercy—would be 
    dreadful. When the water was bitter, and Israel could not drink, Moses cast 
    a tree into the waters, and then they were made sweet. How bitter and 
    dreadful were the other attributes of God—did not mercy sweeten them! Mercy 
    sets God's power on work to help us; it makes his justice become our friend.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[5] God's mercy is one of the most orient pearls of his 
    crown; it makes his Godhead appear amiable and lovely.</p></b></font> When Moses 
    said to God, "I beseech you—show me your <i>glory</i>;" the Lord answered 
    him, "I will make all my <i>goodness </i>pass before you, and I will show 
    you <i>mercy</i>." God's mercy is his glory. His holiness makes him 
    illustrious; his mercy makes him endearing.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[6] Even the worst people taste God's mercy</p></b></font>. 
    Such as fight against God's mercy, taste of it; the wicked have some <i>
    crumbs </i>from <i>mercy's table</i>. "The Lord is good to <i>all</i>." 
    Sweet dewdrops are on the <i>thistle</i>, as well as on the <i>rose</i>. The 
    diocese where mercy visits is very large. Pharaoh's <i>head </i>was crowned, 
    though his <i>heart </i>was hardened.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[7] Mercy coming to us in salvation, is sweetest. </p></b>
</font>It was mercy that God would give Israel rain, and bread to the full, 
    and peace, and victory over their enemies—but it was a greater mercy that 
    God would be their God. To have <i>health </i>is a mercy—but to have <i>
    Christ </i>and salvation is a greater mercy. Saving mercy, is like the 
    diamond in the ring, which casts a more sparkling luster.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[8] One act of mercy engages God to another.</p></b></font> 
    Men argue thus, "I have shown you kindness already, therefore trouble me no 
    more." But, because God has shown saving mercy, he is more ready still to 
    show mercy. His mercy in election makes him justify, adopt, glorify; one act 
    of mercy engages God to more. A parent's love to his child makes him always 
    giving.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[9] All the mercy in the creature is derived from God, 
    and is but a drop from this ocean. </p></b></font>The mercy and pity a mother 
    has to her child, is from God; he who puts the milk in her breast puts the 
    compassion in her heart. God is called, "The <i>Father </i>of mercies," 
    because he begets all the mercies in the world. If God has put any kindness 
    into the creature, how much kindness is in him who is the Father of mercy!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[10] As God's mercy makes the saints <i>happy</i>—so it 
    should make them <i>humble</i>.</p></b></font> Mercy is not the fruit of <i>our
    </i>goodness—but the fruit of <i>God's </i>goodness. Mercy is a gift which 
    God bestows. They have no cause to be proud, who live upon the alms of God's 
    mercy. "If I am righteous—yet will I not lift up my head." That is, all my 
    righteousness is the effect of God's mercy, therefore I will be humble and 
    will not lift up my head.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[11] Mercy <i>stays </i>the speedy execution of God's 
    justice.</p></b></font> Sinners continually provoke God, and make "the fury come 
    up in his face." Why is it, that God does not immediately arrest and condemn 
    them? It is not that God <i>cannot </i>do it, for he is armed with 
    omnipotence—but it is from his mercy. Mercy gets a reprieve for the 
    sinner—and stops the speedy process of justice. God would, by his goodness, 
    lead sinners to repentance.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[12] It is dreadful to have mercy as a witness against 
    any one.</p></b></font> It was sad with Haman, when the <i>queen </i>herself 
    accused him. So will it be when this <i>queen of mercy </i>shall stand up 
    against a person and accuse him! It is only mercy that saves a sinner; how 
    sad then to have mercy become an enemy! If mercy is an accuser, who shall be 
    our advocate? The sinner never escapes hell, when <i>mercy </i>draws up the 
    indictment.
<p></p>
<p>I might show you several <b>kinds </b>of mercy—as 
    preventing mercy, sparing mercy, supplying mercy, guiding mercy, accepting 
    mercy, healing mercy, quickening mercy, supporting mercy, forgiving mercy, 
    correcting mercy, comforting mercy, delivering mercy, crowning mercy; but I 
    shall speak of,</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>II. The qualifications or PROPERTIES of God's mercy.</p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[1] God's mercy is FREE. </p></b></font>To set up <i>merit—</i>is 
    to destroy mercy. We cannot <i>deserve </i>mercy, because we are polluted in 
    our blood; nor can we <i>force </i>God to show mercy—for then it would not 
    be mercy. We may force God to <i>punish </i>us—but not to <i>love </i>us. "I 
    will love them <i>freely</i>." Every link in the chain of salvation is 
    wrought and interwoven with free grace. Election is free. "He has <i>chosen
    </i>us in him, according to the good pleasure of his will." Justification is 
    free. "Being <i>justified </i>freely by his grace." Salvation is free. 
    "According to his mercy he <i>saved </i>us." Do not say, "I am <i>unworthy</i>, 
    therefore I cannot be saved;" for mercy is <i>free</i>. If God would show 
    mercy to such only as are worthy—he would show no mercy at all.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[2] God's mercy is an overflowing mercy; it is INFINITE.</p></b></font> 
    "Plenteous in mercy." "Rich in mercy." "Multitude of mercies." The vial of 
    wrath <i>drops</i>—but the fountain of mercy runs in <i>streams</i>. The sun 
    is not so full of light—as God is of mercy. God has <i>morning </i>mercies. 
    "His mercies are new every morning." He has <i>night </i>mercies. "In the 
    night his song shall be with me." God has mercies <i>under </i>heaven, which 
    we taste; and <i>in </i>heaven, which we hope for.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p></p>
<p>[3] God's mercy is ETERNAL.</p></b></font> "The mercy of the 
    Lord is from eternity to eternity." Psalm 103:17. "His mercy endures 
    forever," is repeated twenty-six times in Psalm 136. The souls of the 
    blessed shall be ever bathing themselves in this sweet and pleasant ocean of 
    God's mercy! God's anger to his children lasts but a while, "but his mercy 
    lasts forever." As long as he is God, he will be showing mercy. As his mercy 
    is <i>over</i>flowing, so it is <i>ever</i>-flowing.
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>Use one: We are to look upon God in PRAYER, not in his 
    judgment robes—but clothed with a rainbow full of mercy and clemency.</p></b></font> 
    Add wings to prayer. When Jesus Christ ascended up to heaven, that which 
    made him go up there with joy was, "I go to my <i>Father!"</i> Just so, that 
    which should make our hearts ascend with joy in prayer, is, "We are going to 
    the <i>Father </i>of mercy, who sits upon the throne of grace!" Go to prayer 
    with confidence in God's mercy; as a cold person goes to a fire, saying, "it 
    will <i>warm </i>me, not <i>burn </i>me."
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>Use two: BELIEVE in his mercy. </p></b></font>"I will trust 
    in the mercy of God forever." God's mercy is an <i>open fountain</i>. Let 
    down the <i>bucket of faith</i>—and you may drink of this fountain of 
    salvation. What greater encouragement to believe—than God's mercy? God 
    counts it his glory to be <i>scattering pardons</i>; he is desirous that 
    sinners should touch the golden scepter of his mercy, and live. <b>This 
    willingness in God to show mercy appears two ways:
</b>
<p></p>
<p>(1.) By <i>entreating </i>sinners to come and lay hold on 
    his mercy. "Whoever will, let him come, and take the water of life freely." 
    Mercy woos sinners, it even kneels down to beg them. It would be strange for 
    a prince to beg a condemned man to accept of pardon. God says, "Poor sinner, 
    allow me to love you, be willing to let me save you."</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2.) By his joyfulness when sinners lay hold on his 
    mercy. What is God the better, whether we receive his mercy or not? What is 
    the <i>fountain </i>profited that others drink of it? Yet such is God's 
    goodness, that he rejoices at the salvation of sinners, and is glad when his 
    mercy is accepted! When the prodigal son came home the father was glad, and 
    made a feast to express his joy; so, God rejoices when a poor sinner comes 
    in, and lays hold of his mercy. What an encouragement is here to believe in 
    God! He is a God of pardons. "You are a God of forgiveness, gracious and 
    merciful, slow to become angry, and <i>full of unfailing love and mercy</i>." 
    Neh 9:17. Mercy pleases him. "Where is another God like you, who pardons the 
    sins of the survivors among his people? You cannot stay angry with your 
    people forever, because you delight in showing mercy." Micah 7:18. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing harms us but unbelief. Unbelief stops the current 
    of God's mercy from running. It shuts up God's affections, closes the 
    orifice of Christ's wounds, so that no healing virtue will come out. "He did 
    not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief." Why do you not 
    believe in God's mercy? Do your <i>sins </i>discourage you? God's mercy can 
    pardon great sins, nay, because they are great. "For the sake of your name, 
    O Lord, forgive my iniquity, though it is <i>great</i>." Psalm 25:11. The 
    sea covers the <i>rocks </i>as well as the <i>sands</i>. Some who had a hand 
    in crucifying Christ, found mercy. As far as the heavens are above the 
    earth, so far is God's mercy above our sins! What will entice us to believe, 
    if not the <i>mercy </i>of God?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p></p>
<p>Use three: Take heed of ABUSING the mercy of God. </p></b>
</font>Do not suck poison, out of the sweet flower of God's mercy. Do not 
    think that because God is merciful, you may go on in sin; this is to make 
    God's mercy your enemy. None might touch the ark but the <i>priests</i>, who 
    by their office were more holy. Just so, none may touch the ark of God's 
    mercy, but such as are resolved to be holy. To sin because God's mercy 
    abounds—is the devil's logic! He who sins because of God's mercy—is like one 
    who wounds his head because he has a plaster. He who sins because of God's 
    mercy—shall have judgement without mercy. Mercy <i>abused, </i>turns to <i>
    fury</i>. "Let none of those who hear the warnings of this curse consider 
    themselves immune, thinking, 'I am safe, even though I am walking in my own 
    stubborn way.' This would lead to utter ruin! The Lord will not pardon such 
    people. His anger and jealousy will burn against them. All the curses 
    written in this book will come down on them!" Deuteronomy 29:19-20. 
<p></p>
<p>Nothing is colder than <i>lead </i>when taken out of the 
    mine; and nothing more scalding when it is heated. Nothing is blunter than
    <i>iron</i>—yet nothing is sharper when it is whetted. Just so, nothing is 
    sweeter than mercy—when it is <i>improved</i>; yet nothing is fiercer than 
    mercy—when it is <i>abused! </i>"The mercy of the Lord is upon those who <i>
    fear </i>him." Mercy is not for those who sin and fear not—but for those who 
    fear and sin not. God's mercy is a <i>holy </i>mercy; where it pardons it 
    sanctifies.</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>What shall we do to be savingly interested in God's 
    mercy?</p>
</b>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(1.) Be sensible of your needs. </p></b>See how much you 
    stand in need of pardoning, saving mercy. See yourselves as <i>orphans</i>. 
    "In you, the fatherless find mercy." God bestows the <i>alms of mercy</i> 
    only on such as are <i>indigent</i>. Be emptied of all opinion of 
    self-worthiness. God pours the golden <i>oil of mercy </i>into <i>empty </i>
    vessels.
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(2.) Go to God for mercy. </p></b>"Have mercy upon me, O 
    God!" "Do not put me off with <i>common </i>mercy, which reprobates may 
    have! Give me not only <i>acorns </i>but pearls! Give me not only mercy to 
    feed and clothe me—but mercy to <i>save </i>me! Give me the cream of your 
    mercies! Lord! let me have <i>saving </i>mercy and loving-kindness. Give me 
    such mercy as speaks your electing love to my soul."
<p></p>
<p>"Who <i>crowns </i>you with loving-kindness and tender 
    mercies." Oh pray for mercy! God has <i>treasures </i>of mercy! Prayer is 
    the key which opens these treasures; and in prayer, <i>be sure to carry 
    Christ in your arms</i>, for all the mercy comes through Christ! "So Samuel 
    took a young <i>lamb </i>and offered it to the Lord as a whole burnt 
    offering. He pleaded with the Lord to help Israel—and the Lord answered." 1 
    Samuel 7:9. Carry the <i>lamb Christ </i>in your arms, go in his name, 
    present his merits; say, "Lord! here is Christ's blood, which is the price 
    of my pardon! Lord! show me mercy, because Christ has purchased it!" Though 
    God may refuse us when we come for mercy in our <i>own </i>name—yet he will 
    not when we come in <i>Christ's </i>name. Plead Christ's atonement; this is 
    an argument which God cannot deny.</p>
<p></p>
<b><font color="#b07050">
<p>Use four: Such as have found mercy are exhorted to three 
    things—</p>
</font>
<p></p>
<p>(1.) To be upon Gerizim—the mount of blessing and 
    praising. </p></b>They have not only <i>heard </i>the King of heaven is 
    merciful—but they have <i>found </i>it so! The honeycomb of God's mercy has 
    dropped upon them! When in needs, mercy supplied them; when they were near 
    unto death, mercy raised them from the sick-bed; when covered with guilt, 
    mercy pardoned them. "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, 
    bless his holy name!" Oh, how should the vessels of mercy run over with 
    praise! "I used to scoff at the name of Christ. I hunted down his people, 
    harming them in every way I could. But God had mercy on me." 1 Timothy 1:13. 
    "I am a miracle of mercy! As the sea overflows and breaks down the banks, so 
    the mercy of God broke down the banks of my sin, and mercy sweetly flowed 
    into my soul!"
<p></p>
<p>You who have been <i>monuments of God's mercy</i>—should 
    be <i>trumpets of praise!</i> You who have tasted the Lord is gracious, tell 
    others what experiences you have had of God's mercy, that you may encourage 
    them to seek to him, for mercy. "I will tell you what God has done for my 
    soul." "When I found my heart dead, God's Spirit came upon me mightily, and 
    the blowing of that wind made the withering flowers of my grace revive!" Oh 
    tell others of God's goodness, that you may set others blessing him, and 
    that you may make God's praises live when you are dead.</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(2.) To love God. </p></b>Mercy should be the attraction of 
    love. "I will love you, O Lord, my strength." The Hebrew word for love 
    signifies, <i>to love out of the inward affections</i>. God's <i>justice </i>
    may make us fear him, his <i>mercy </i>makes us love him. If God's mercy 
    will not produce love, what will? We are to love God for giving us our <i>
    food</i>, much more for giving us <i>grace</i>. We are to love God for <i>
    sparing </i>mercy, much more for <i>saving </i>mercy. Surely, that heart is 
    made of marble, which the mercy of God will not dissolve into love. "I would 
    hate my own soul," says Augustine, "if I did not find it loving God."
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(3.) To imitate God in showing mercy.</p></b> As God is the 
    Father of mercy, show yourselves to be his children—by being like him. 
    Ambrose says, "The sum and definition of true religion is—Be rich in works 
    of mercy, be helpful to the bodies and souls of others. Scatter your golden

<font size="4">The TRUTH of God</font></p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<p>The next attribute is God's truth. "A God of truth and 
    without iniquity; just and righteous is he." "For your mercy is great unto 
    the heavens, and your truth unto the clouds." "Plenteous in truth."</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>God is the truth.</p></b> He is true in a physical sense; 
    true in his being: he has a real subsistence, and gives a being to others. 
    He is true in a moral sense; he is truth without error; truth without 
    deceit. God is<i> prima veritas</i>, the pattern and prototype of truth. 
    There is nothing true but what is <i>in </i>God—or comes <i>from </i>God.
<p></p>
<p>I shall speak of God's truth, as it is taken from his 
    veracity in making good his promises. "There has not failed one word of all 
    his good promise." The promise is God's pledge; God's truth is the seal set 
    to his pledge.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p>There are two things to be observed in the promises of 
    God to comfort us. </p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[1] Observe he POWER of God, whereby he is <i>able </i>to 
    fulfill the promise.</p></b></font> God has promised to subdue our corruption. 
    "He will subdue our iniquities." Oh, says a believer, my corruption is so 
    strong, that I am sure I shall never get the mastery of it. Abraham looked 
    at God's power. "Being fully persuaded that what God had promised he was <i>
    able </i>to perform." He believed that God, who could make a world, could 
    make Sarah's dry breasts give suck. It is faith's support—that there is 
    nothing too hard for God. He who could bring water out of a rock, is able to 
    bring to pass his promises.
<p></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p>[2] Observe the TRUTH of God, in the promises. </p></b>
</font>God's truth is the seal set to the promise. "In hope of eternal life, 
    which God, <i>who cannot lie </i>has promised." 'Eternal life'—there is the
    <i>sweetness </i>of the promise. 'God which cannot lie'—there is the <i>
    certainty </i>of it. Mercy <i>makes </i>the promise; truth <i>fulfills </i>
    the promise. God's <i>providences </i>are uncertain—but his <i>promises </i>
    are the 'sure mercies of David." "God is not a man who he should change." 
    The word of a <i>prince </i>cannot always be taken—but <i>God's </i>promise 
    is inviolable. God's truth is one of the richest jewels of his crown, and he 
    has pawned it in a promise. "Although my house be not so with God—yet he has 
    made with me an <i>everlasting </i>covenant, ordered in all things and <i>
    sure</i>." 'Although my house be not so,' that is, though I fail much of 
    that exact purity the Lord requires—yet he has made with me an everlasting 
    covenant, that he will pardon, adopt, and glorify me; and this covenant is 
    ordered in all things and sure. 
<p></p>
<p>"The elements shall melt with fervent heat;" but God's 
    covenant abides firm and inviolable, being sealed with the <i>truth </i>of 
    God. Nay, God has added to his word his <i>oath</i>—wherein he pawns his 
    being, life, and righteousness to make good the promise. If as often as we 
    break <i>our </i>vows with God, he would break promise with us, it would be 
    very deplorable. But his truth is engaged in his promise, therefore it is 
    like the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered. "We are 
    not," says Chrysostom, "to believe our <i>senses </i>so much as we are to 
    believe the <i>promises</i>." Our senses may fail us—but the promise cannot, 
    being built upon the truth of God. God <i>will </i>not deceive the faith of 
    his people; nay, he <i>can</i>not. "God, who cannot lie, has promised." He 
    can as well part with his <i>Deity</i>—as his <i>verity</i>. God is said to 
    be <i>abundant in truth</i>. Exod 34:6. What does that signify? If God has 
    made a promise of mercy to his people, he will be so far from coming <i>
    short </i>of his word—that he will be <i>better </i>than his word. He often 
    does <i>more </i>than he has said—but never <i>less</i>. He is <i>abundant
    </i>in truth.</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(1.) The Lord may sometimes delay a promise—but he will 
    never <i>deny</i> a promise.</p></b> He may <i>delay </i>a promise. God's 
    promise may lie a good while, as seed under ground—but at last it will 
    spring up into a crop. He promised to deliver Israel from the iron 
    furnace—but this promise was over four hundred years in travail, before it 
    gave birth. Simeon had a promise that he should not depart, "until he had 
    seen the Lord's Christ." But it was a long time coming. But a little before 
    his death—he did see Christ. Though God <i>delays </i>the promise—he will 
    never <i>deny</i> a promise. Having given his bond—in due time the money 
    will be paid.
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(2.) God may change his promise—but he will not <i>break
    </i>it.</p></b> Sometimes God changes a temporal promise, into a spiritual 
    promise. "The Lord shall give that which is <i>good</i>." This may not be 
    fulfilled in a <i>temporal </i>sense—but a <i>spiritual </i>sense. God may 
    let a Christian be cut short in temporals—but he makes it up in spirituals. 
    If he does not increase the basket and the store, he gives increase of 
    faith, and inward peace. Here he <i>changes </i>his promise—but he does not
    <i>break </i>it; he gives that which is <i>better</i>. If a man promises to 
    pay me in farthings, and he pays me in a better coin, as in gold, he does 
    not break his promise. "I will not allow my faithfulness to <i>fail</i>." In 
    the Hebrew it is, "I will not allow my faithfulness to <i>lie</i>." 
<p></p>
<b>
<p>How does it consist with the truth of God, that he "wants 
    all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth"—and yet some 
    still perish?</p>
</b>
<p></p>
<p>Augustine understands it, not of every <i>individual </i>
    person—but some of all kinds of people shall be saved. As in the ark, God 
    saved all the living creatures; not every <i>individual</i> bird or fish was 
    saved, for many perished in the flood; but <i>all</i>, that is, <i>some of 
    every kind </i>were saved. In this sense, God will have <i>all </i>to be 
    saved, that is—some out of each of nations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is said, <b>Christ died for all.</b> "He is the Lamb 
    of God who takes away the sins of the <i>world</i>." How does this consist 
    with God's truth, when some are vessels of wrath? Rom 9:92.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(1.) We must qualify the term <b>world</b>. The world is 
    taken either in a limited sense, for the world of the elect; or in a larger 
    sense, for both elect and reprobates. "Christ takes away the sins of the 
    world," that is, the world of the elect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2.) We must qualify also Christ's dying for the world. 
    Christ died <i>sufficiently </i>for all, not <i>effectually</i>. There is 
    the <i>value </i>of Christ's blood, and the <i>virtue </i>of Christ's blood. 
    Christ's blood has <b>value </b>enough to redeem the whole world—but the <b>
    virtue </b>of it is applied only to such as believe. Christ's blood has the 
    value to save all, but it is not efficacious for all. All are not saved, 
    because some put away salvation from them, "We had to speak the word of God 
    to you first. Since you <i>reject </i>it and do not consider yourselves 
    worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles." Acts 13:46. Others <i>
    vilify </i>Christ's blood, counting it an unholy thing.</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>Use one: The truth of God, is a great pillar for our 
    faith.</p></b></font> Were he not a God of truth—we could not believe him—our 
    faith would be an empty dream. But he is truth itself, and not a word which 
    he has spoken shall fall to the ground. 
<p></p>
<p>The truth of God, is the object of trust. The truth of 
    God is an immovable rock, on which we may venture our salvation. Isa 59:15, 
    "Truth fails," that is—truth on earth fails—but not truth in heaven. God can 
    as well cease to be God, as cease to be true. Has God said, he "will do good 
    to the soul who seeks him," and he will "give rest to the weary." Here is a 
    safe anchor-hold, he will not alter the thing which has gone out of his 
    lips. The truth of the God of heaven is engaged for believers. Can we have 
    better security? The whole earth hangs upon the word of God's power—and 
    shall not our faith hang upon the word of God's truth? Where can we rest our 
    faith, but upon God's faithfulness? There is nothing else we can securely 
    believe in, but the truth of God. To trust in <i>ourselves </i>is to build 
    upon quick sands; but the truth of God is a golden pillar for faith to rest 
    upon. God cannot deny himself. "If we believe not—yet he abides faithful; he 
    cannot deny himself." Not to believe God's veracity, is to affront God. "He 
    who believes not, has made God a liar." A person of honor cannot be more 
    affronted or provoked, than when he is not believed, and called a liar. He 
    who denies God's truth, says that God's promise is no better than a forged 
    deed. Can there be a greater affront offered to God?</p>
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>Use two: If God is a God of truth, he is true to his 
    THREATENINGS. </p></b></font>The threatenings are a <i>flying scroll</i> against 
    sinners. God has threatened, "<i>Surely </i>God will crush the heads of his 
    enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins." Psalm 68:21. He 
    has threatened to judge adulterers. Heb 13:3. To be avenged upon the 
    malicious. Psalm 10:14, "You behold mischief and spite, to requite it with 
    your own hand;" and to "rain fire and brimstone upon the sinner." God is as 
    true to his <i>threatenings </i>as to his <i>promises</i>. To show his 
    truth, he has executed his threatenings, and let his thunderbolts of 
    judgement fall upon sinners in <i>this </i>life. He struck <i>Herod </i>in 
    the act of his pride. He has punished blasphemers. Olympius, an Arian 
    bishop, reproached and blasphemed the blessed Trinity, and immediately 
    lightning fell down from the heaven upon him and consumed him. Let us fear 
    the threatening that we may not feel it.
<p></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p>Use three: Is God a God of truth? Let us be like God in 
    truth. </p>
</b></font>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(1.) We must be true in our WORDS.</p></b> Pythagoras being 
    asked what made men like God, answered, "When they speak truth." It is the 
    distinction of a man who shall go to heaven, that "He speaks the truth in 
    his heart."
<b>
<p>Truth in our words, is opposed to all LYING.</p></b> "Putting 
    away lying, speak everyone truth to his neighbor." Lying is when one speaks 
    that as truth, which he knows to be false. A liar is most opposite to the 
    God of truth. There are, as Augustine says, two sorts of lies. There is an
    <b>officious </b>lie—when a man tells a lie for his profit; as, when a 
    tradesman says his commodity cost him so much, when perhaps it did not cost 
    him half so much. He who will lie in his trade—shall lie in hell. There is a
    <i>jesting </i>lie—when a man tells a lie in sport, to make others merry—and 
    goes laughing to hell. He who tells a lie makes himself like the devil. "The 
    devil is a liar, and the father of lies." John 8:44. He deceived our first 
    parents by a lie. Some are so wicked, that they will not only speak an 
    untruth—but will swear to it; nay, they will wish a curse upon themselves, 
    if that untruth is not true. 
<p></p>
<p>I have read of a woman, one Anne Avarie, who in 1575, 
    being in a shop, wished that she might die, if she had not paid for the 
    wares she took, and fell down speechless immediately and died. A liar is not 
    fit to live in a commonwealth. Lying takes away all society and converse 
    with men. How can you converse with a man—when you cannot believe what he 
    says? Lying shuts men out of heaven. "Outside are dogs, and whoever loves 
    and makes a lie." </p>
<p></p>
<p>As it is a great sin to <i>tell </i>a lie—so it is a 
    worse sin to <i>teach </i>a lie. "The prophet that <i>teaches </i>lies." He 
    who teaches error, teaches lies. He spreads the plague; he not only damns 
    himself—but helps to damn others!</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>Truth in our words, is opposed to all DECEIT.</p></b> The 
    heart and tongue should go together, as the dial goes exactly with the sun. 
    To speak fair to one's face, and not to mean what one speaks, is no better 
    than a lie. "His words were smoother than oil—but war was in his heart." 
    Some have an art to flatter and deceive. Jerome, speaking of the Arians, 
    says, "they pretended friendship, they kissed my hands—but plotted mischief 
    against me." "A man who flatters his neighbor, spreads a net for his feet." 
    Deadly poison can be hidden under sweet honey. Falsehood in friendship, is a 
    lie. Counterfeiting friendship, is worse than counterfeiting money.
<p></p>
<b>
<p>(2.) We must be true in our PROFESSION of religion</p></b>. 
    Let <i>practice </i>go along with <i>profession</i>. "Righteousness and true 
    holiness." Hypocrisy in religion is a lie. The hypocrite is like a face in a 
    mirror, which is the 'show of a face'—but no true face. He makes <i>show </i>
    of holiness—but has no <i>truth </i>in it. Ephraim pretended to be that 
    which he was not; and what does God say of him? "Ephraim compasses me about 
    with <i>lies</i>." By a lie in our <i>words</i>, we deny the truth; by a lie 
    in our <i>profession</i>, we disgrace the truth. Not to be to God what we 
    profess to others—is telling a lie; and the Scripture makes it little better 
    than blasphemy. "I know the blasphemy of those who <i>say </i>they are 
    Jews—and are not." 
<p></p>
<p align="justify">Oh! I beseech you, labor to be like God. He is a God of 
    truth. He can as well part with his Deity—as his verity. Be like God, be 
    true in your <i>words</i>, be true in your <i>profession</i>. God's children 
    are children that will not lie. When God sees "truth in the inward parts," 
    and "lips in which is no deceit," he sees his own image—which draws his 
    heart towards us. <i>Likeness </i>produces <i>love.</i></p>
