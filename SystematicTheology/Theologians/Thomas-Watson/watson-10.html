<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Good Shepherd</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="center"><br/>
    "I am the good shepherd. I know My own<br/>
    sheep, and they know Me." John 10:14</p>
<p align="justify">Every line of Scripture has majesty shining in it. Jesus 
    Christ is the very center of the gospel. If the Scripture is the field, 
    Christ is the pearl in this field; and blessed is he who finds this pearl! 
    The Scripture gives various descriptions of Christ. Sometimes He is called a
    <i>Physician</i>—He is the great Healer of souls. Sometimes He is called a
    <i>Captain</i>. Hebrews 2:10, "the Captain of our salvation." Here in the 
    text He is a shepherd, "I am the good Shepherd." And this Shepherd has a 
    flock; so it is in the text, "I know My sheep, and they know Me." These 
    sheep are the elect company of believers; these are His redeemed sheep. 
    First, I shall speak of the sheep, then something of the Shepherd as they 
    relate to one another.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Concerning the SHEEP. </p></b></font>"I know My sheep." 
    The wicked are compared to <i>goats</i>; the saints to <i>sheep</i>. 
    Christ's people are His sheep, and there are some analogies between them and 
    sheep.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, a sheep is an INNOCENT creature.</p></b></font> It is 
    not hurtful or ravenous, as other creatures are—but is very harmless and 
    inoffensive. Just so, those sheep who belong to Christ, and are of His 
    fold—are innocent. Philippians 2:15, "That you may be blameless," that you 
    may be harmless. The Greek word is "without <i>horn</i>," or "without 
    pushing or horning"—that you may be harmless. Christ's people walk as holily 
    as they can, so that they may give no just offense. They would rather suffer 
    wrong—than do wrong. Those who are set upon mischief, are not Christ's sheep 
    but are ravenous birds of prey. Those who would spill <i>Christian blood </i>
    are none of Christ's sheep. These are <i>wolves </i>who have been suckled 
    with the milk of the Romish whore. These are goats whom Christ will set at 
    His left hand, Matthew 25:32.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, a sheep is noted for MEEKNESS</p></b></font> in 
    Scripture; it is a meek creature. Let the shearer take its wool, it does not 
    resist. If you strike a sheep, it does not snarl or fly in your face. All 
    Christ's sheep are meek-spirited, 2 Samuel 16:12. Though a child of God may 
    sometimes fall into a froward fit—yet he grieves for it and weeps for his 
    unmortified passion.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, a sheep is a CLEAN creature</p></b></font>; it is neat 
    and cleanly; it delights most in pure streams and clean pastures. Just so, 
    Christ's sheep are clean and sanctified; holiness is the thing they pray 
    for. Psalm 51:10, "Create in me a clean heart, O God!" Though they are not 
    perfectly holy—yet they are perfecting holiness in the fear of God. They are 
    neat creatures, and would rather die than go through dirty, miry places. 
    Just so, it is with Christ's sheep—they will suffer anything rather than 
    defile their conscience. Genesis 39:9, "How can I do this wickedness, and 
    sin against God?"
<p align="justify">The wicked in Scripture are compared to <i>swine</i>. 
    They wallow in sin—in their wickedness and uncleanness. They are steeped and 
    boiled in sin. Yes—but a good Christian breathes after sanctity. A child of 
    God may fall into sin unawares, as did David—but he does not <i>lie </i>in 
    sin. He recovers himself again by repentance. A sheep may <i>fall </i>into 
    the mire—but it does not <i>lie </i>there; it gets out again.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Fourth, a sheep is a very USEFUL creature. </p></b></font>
    There is nothing about it, that is not of some use—the flesh, the fleece, 
    the skin. Just so, all Christ's sheep, who are the sheep of His pasture, are 
    useful. They are still doing good, they are profitable to others by their 
    knowledge, counsel, example, prayers, and good works. They are useful in 
    their places. The wicked are compared to <i>wood</i>, Ezekiel 15:3, which is 
    good for nothing but fuel. Sinners are useless; their life is scarcely worth 
    a prayer, nor their death scarcely worth a tear. They live to encumber the 
    ground. But God's people are useful; they are called the excellent of the 
    earth, Psalm 16:3. They are blessings in the places where they come.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Fifth, a sheep is a very CONTENTED creature.</p></b></font> 
    It will feed upon any pasture where you put it. Put sheep upon the bare 
    common—and they are content. They feed upon the little they pick up in the 
    fallow ground, a perfect emblem of true saints who are the sheep of Christ. 
    Let God put them into whatever pasture He will and they are content, 
    Philippians 4:11. They have learned in every state therewith to be content. 
    Paul could be in need—or abound. He could be anything that God wanted him to 
    be. He was content with that portion, whatever it was, which providence 
    carved out to him.
<p align="justify">You who are apt to murmur and repine at your condition, 
    and think you never have enough, think to yourselves, "Sheep are content 
    with their pasture; surely were I one of Christ's sheep, I would be 
    content." You who have the least of the world, you have more than you know 
    how to be thankful for. He who has the least bit of bread, will die in God's 
    debt. A sheep is a contented creature.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Sixth, to name no more, a sheep is a TIMOROUS creature.</p></b></font> 
    It is very fearful if any danger approaches. It is easily frightened by the 
    wolf. Thus the saints of God, who are Christ's sheep, pass the time of their 
    sojourning here in fear. They are—fearful of provoking God; fearful of 
    wounding their peace; fearful of temptation; fearful they should come short 
    of heaven through sloth, Hebrews 4:1. It is an earmark of Christ's sheep, 
    that they are endued with the fear of God, Genesis 42:28. This is their 
    earmark, "men fearing God". It's true, the righteous are as bold as a lion 
    in a righteous cause—but timorous and fearful of sinful fear. And, let me 
    tell you, happy is he who in this sense fears always. <i>Holy fear </i>is 
    the best antidote against temptation. The way to be safe, is always to fear.
<p align="justify">To make some <b>use </b>of this, let us all labor to be 
    found in the number of Christ's sheep. All the world is divided into two 
    ranks—sheep and goats. If you would be glad to be found in the day of 
    judgment as Christ's sheep, and sit at His right hand, be much in prayer. 
    Pray to God that He would change your nature, that He would take away your 
    wolfish nature, your fierceness, your frowardness, and that He would 
    transform you into His own image. Labor to be among Christ's sheep, to get 
    into Christ's fold.</p>
<p align="justify">There is only one way in which you do not want to be like 
    sheep—for sheep are apt to <i>wander </i>sometimes from their fold. Take 
    heed that you do not straggle into bypaths of error and heresy. It is 
    dangerous to wander for fear the devil, the wolf, should catch you. Don't go 
    astray as sheep; but in other things resemble sheep in meekness, in 
    patience, in usefulness, in willingness.</p>
<p align="justify">And particularly in this one thing let us labor to 
    resemble sheep, when the <i>shepherd's dog </i>comes near, all the sheep 
    flock together. <i>Persecution </i>should be like the shepherd's dog. It 
    should make all Christ's sheep run together and unite. Do Papists and 
    Formalists agree in persecuting God's people? And shall not the saints of 
    God agree to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace? <i>Love is 
    the earmark by which Christ's sheep are known. </i>John 13:35, "By this 
    shall all men know you are My disciples, if you love one another." It was 
    the <i>harlot </i>who said, "Let the child be divided." It is the Jesuit who 
    says, "Let the Church of God be divided." It is Satan's great design to set 
    his cloven foot among God's people to make division and contention among the 
    sons of Zion. The devil's best music is discord.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh! Let all Christ's people, His sheep, flock together 
    and associate in love. Those who hope to meet together in heaven should not 
    fall out by the way. Unity is the great music in heaven. There is unity in 
    the Trinity—and unity among saints would be a great blessing on earth. For 
    Christians to unite is their interest and wisdom; union is their strength, 
    union is their glory and their ornament. This was the honor of the primitive 
    churches, all of one heart, Acts 2:1. There was but one heart among them. 
    Let the sheep of Christ unite together. When the saints are harmoniously 
    united, then they adorn their blessed Shepherd, the Lord Jesus. So 
    much for the first of these, Christ's sheep.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Concerning  the SHEPHERD. </p></b></font>"I am the good 
    Shepherd." This is as true an epithet as ever was given. Zechariah 13:7, "A 
    good Shepherd." 1 Peter 2:5, "Once you were wandering like lost sheep. But 
    now you have turned to your Shepherd, the Guardian of your souls." Christ is 
    called in Scripture "the chief Shepherd of all," 1 Peter 5:4. Ministers are 
    but shepherds under Him—to look to His flock. Christ is the chief Shepherd. 
    So, then, the observation is this:
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Jesus Christ is the blessed Shepherd of His 
    sheep.</p>
<p align="justify">In Scripture, Christ is called the <i>great </i>Shepherd 
    and the <i>good </i>Shepherd. He is called the great Shepherd in Hebrews 
    13:20-21, and here in the text He is called the good Shepherd. Christ is the 
    great Shepherd, since He <i>made </i>the sheep; and He is the good Shepherd 
    since He <i>saves </i>His sheep. So, you see, He is both the great and the 
    good Shepherd. There are many parallels and analogies between Christ and His 
    sheep. </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Some ways how the Lord Jesus RESEMBLES a shepherd.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A shepherd is APPOINTED to his calling.</p></b></font> 
    John 10:2, "The one who enters by the door—is the shepherd of the sheep." 
    What's the meaning of that? It is that Christ is lawfully called and 
    appointed to His keeping of the sheep.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A shepherd KNOWS his flock—he knows all his flock.</p></b></font> 
    This is in the text, "I am the good Shepherd, I know My sheep," said Christ. 
    Christ's knowing His sheep implies a knowledge of <b>approbation</b>. 
    Christ's knowing His sheep is His <b>loving </b>them. This is a great 
    consolation, that Christ knows all His sheep. He knows every one of their 
    names. John 10:3, "He calls His own sheep by name." He knows all the sighs 
    and groans they make. Psalm 38:9, "My groaning is not hidden from You." 
    Christ knows every tear they shed. "I have seen your tears!" 2 Kings 20:5. 
    He bottles their tears as precious wine. Psalm 56:8, "You keep track of all 
    my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in Your bottle. You have 
    recorded each one in your book." He knows all their sufferings. "I have seen 
    the way the Egyptians are oppressing them." Exodus 3:9. "The Lord saw the 
    bitter suffering of everyone in Israel." 2 Kings 14:26. Christ knows all 
    their good works, all their works of piety and charity. "I know all the 
    things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance." 
    Revelation 2:2. "He will place the <i>sheep </i>at His 
    right hand and the goats at His left. Then the King will say to those on the 
    right—Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared 
    for you from the foundation of the world!" Matthew 25:33-34. What a comfort 
    is this! Christ knows all His sheep by name.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A shepherd MARKS his sheep that he may distinguish 
    them from other strange sheep.</p></b></font> Just so, Jesus Christ, this 
    blessed Shepherd, sets a double mark upon His sheep. One is the earmark of
    <b>election</b>. "I have chosen you," He said. And besides that, He has set 
    another mark upon His sheep. He seals them by His <b>Spirit</b>, Ephesians 
    4:30. The <i>sanctifying graces </i>are the several badges and seals which 
    Christ puts upon His sheep. How will this raise the saints' triumph in 
    heaven! How will this make them bless God—that they should be marked out as
    <i>sheep</i>—when most of the world are marked as <i>goats!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A shepherd SEEKS his sheep when they are lost and gone 
    astray.</p></b></font> Luke 15:4. That is the office of the shepherd—he seeks 
    his sheep. Let me assure you, Christ's sheep are lost naturally. They have 
    strayed far from the fold and are so lost—that they can never find their way 
    home of themselves. A dog or a horse, if lost, can find the way home 
    again—but if a sheep is lost, it can never find its way home. This is the 
    case of all of Christ's sheep—they are so lost that they cannot find their 
    way.
<p align="justify">Now Jesus Christ, this blessed Shepherd, seeks His lost 
    sheep. He left His Father's bosom. He came from heaven on purpose to seek 
    His lost, wandering sheep. Luke 19:10, "The Son of Man has come to seek and 
    to save that which was lost." <i>Zaccheus </i>was a lost sheep, a great 
    sinner, an extortioner. This lost sheep was found upon a sycamore tree! 
    There Christ saw him and called him. Luke 19:5, "Zaccheus, make haste and 
    come down!" Christ entered first into Zaccheus' heart—and then He entered 
    into his house, "This day has salvation come to this house."</p>
<p align="justify">There may be some who are as yet lost sheep. They have 
    wandered from God and have gone on in the ways of sin. But if they belong to 
    this good Shepherd, if they belong to Christ—He will at one time or another, 
    bring all His wandering sheep home—by converting grace.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A shepherd LEADS and GUIDES His sheep.</p></b></font> And 
    thus Christ, this blessed Shepherd, guides His people that they should not 
    go wrong. John 10:3, "He calls His own sheep by name and leads them out." 
    How does Christ guide His people? He guides them with His eye; His eye is 
    never off of them—though their eye is too much off from Him. Psalm 32:8, 
    "You shall guide me with Your eye." That is, "The eye of Your <i>providence
    </i>shall direct me."
<p align="justify">Again, Christ guides His people by the oracle of His holy
    <i>Word</i>. Psalm 73:24, "You shall guide me with Your counsel." And Christ 
    guides His people by the sweet conduct of His <i>Spirit</i>. John 16:13, "He 
    will guide you into all truth. When the Spirit of truth has come unto you, 
    He will guide you into all truth." Besides, Christ appoints <i>ministers </i>
    to be guides. If Christ's sheep go out of the way, His ministers are 
    appointed to bring them back again to the fold.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A shepherd GOVERNS his sheep. </p></b></font>Christ's 
    sheep have as much need of <i>governing</i>, as they do of <i>guiding</i>. 
    He governs His sheep; He orders His people and brings them into a proper 
    state. Christ's pastoral staff is a type and emblem of His governing the 
    saints. Isaiah 9:6, "The government shall be upon His shoulder." Christ's 
    sheep are apt sometimes to be disorderly. They are apt to slight their 
    Shepherd, to grow wanton, to despise their pastor, to quarrel one with 
    another. But now Jesus Christ, this blessed Shepherd, has His laws to bind 
    them, and He has His <i>shepherd's rod </i>to rule them. He brings them into 
    good order. We need as well Christ's <i>rod </i>to govern us—as His <i>blood
    </i>to save us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. A shepherd RELIEVES and FEEDS his sheep along the way.</p></b></font> 
    The Greek word for <i>shepherd </i>signifies to <i>feed</i>. The Lord Jesus 
    mercifully feeds His flock. He won't let them starve. Isaiah 40:11, "He 
    shall feed His flock like a shepherd." Christ feeds His people in the 
    sanctuary. Every ordinance is a fresh pasture for the saints to feed in. 
    Christ feeds souls with the Bread of Life. He fed them with that spiritual 
    supper at His own table. Here is the love of Christ, the great Shepherd of 
    souls—He provides plenty of pasture. Though some would rob Christ's sheep of 
    their green pastures and starve them—yet Christ will feed them. As long as 
    Christ has a spiritual flock of sheep in the world—He will rather work a 
    miracle, than allow them not to be provided for. "He shall feed His flock 
    like a shepherd."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. A shepherd makes it a part of his work to look after 
    his SICK sheep.</p></b></font> Christ's sheep are apt to be sick—some sick with 
    pride, some sick with <i>discontent</i>, some sick with <i>envy</i>, and 
    some sick with <i>covetousness</i>. Christ's sheep are apt to be sick—but He 
    cures all His sheep so that they shall never die of their diseases. Ezekiel 
    34:16, "I will bind up that which is broken, I will strengthen that which is 
    sick." Christ has those sovereign balms and ointments, which can cure the 
    worst distemper. He has appointed the preaching of the Word to be a healer 
    of sin-sick souls, Ezekiel 47. The Word preached is like the waters of the 
    sanctuary, both for <i>food </i>and for <i>medicine</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. A shepherd keeps a continual WATCH over his flock—so 
    that they are not stolen or devoured by the wolf.</p></b></font> Just so, Christ 
    watches over His flock by His omniscience, so that no hurt comes to His 
    elect, so that they are not mortally infected by sin, or ensnared by 
    temptation. Christ has His shepherd's <i>eyes </i>to watch His flock, and He 
    has His shepherd's <i>staff </i>to beat off the wolf!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. A shepherd has COMPASSION on his sheep. </p></b></font>
    Just so, Jesus Christ has tender pity for all His elect. Isaiah 40:11, "He 
    will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will carry the lambs in his arms, 
    holding them close to his heart. He will gently lead the mother sheep with 
    their young." Christ Jesus is tender with His lambs—He holds them close to 
    His heart; and such as are weak and ready to faint—He gently leads. Oh, the 
    pity and compassion of Christ to the elect! He is full of sympathy. The 
    lambs never cry—but their cries go to Christ's heart! Therefore in Scripture 
    Christ is said to be touched with the feeling of their infirmities, Hebrews 
    4:5. Isaiah 63:9, "In all their afflictions, He was afflicted."
<p align="justify">Thus much, as briefly as I could, you have the analogies 
    and parallels between Christ and the shepherd. He is the Shepherd of His 
    flock.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How Christ is a BETTER Shepherd</p></b>.</font> In the second 
    place, I shall show you how Christ is better than any other shepherd, and 
    infinitely excels and transcends them, as it appears in these particulars:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ is a better Shepherd than any other—in respect 
    of the GLORY and DIGNITY of His person.</p></b></font> They are of the earth, 
    earthly—but Christ is a Shepherd from heaven; He is of <i>divine </i>origin. 
    He is equal with God the Father, Philippians 2:6.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ excels other shepherds—in that He CLEANSES and 
    PURIFIES His flock.</p></b></font> Revelation 1:5, Christ "washes us from our 
    sins in His own blood." While Christ's sheep are in the world, they will be 
    apt to get <i>spots</i>—for the world is good for nothing but to spot. One 
    spotted with <i>pride</i>, another spotted with <i>worldliness</i>. Oh, how 
    the people of God deface God's image—by rubbing it against the earth! And 
    the truth is, going too much among the <i>goats </i>defiles them! But Jesus 
    Christ cleanses and purifies His flock and washes away their spots! All 
    Christ's sheep are white and washed in the blood of the Lamb.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ excels all other shepherds—in that He has an 
    art that no other shepherds have—He TEACHES His sheep.</p></b></font> Other 
    shepherds <i>guide </i>their sheep—but they cannot <i>teach </i>them. But 
    Christ teaches all His sheep—who belong to His fold of election. He 
    instructs them in the mysteries of salvation, and He teaches them after the 
    most excellent manner—He teaches like God!
<p align="justify">(1) Christ so teaches all His sheep—that He makes them 
    willing to learn. Psalm 110:3, "They shall be a willing people." Christ not 
    only informs the <i>judgment</i>—but inclines the <i>will </i>to embrace the 
    truth and makes them willing to learn!</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Christ not only teaches the <i>ear</i>—but He teaches 
    the <i>heart!</i> Acts 16:14, "Lydia—whose <i>heart </i>the Lord opened."</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Christ teaches His sheep not only to <i>understand</i>—but 
    He teaches them to <i>obey</i>. Isaiah 2:3, "He will teach us of His ways, 
    and we will go in them." So Christ teaches His sheep after the most 
    excellent manner—He subdues them, and makes them obedient.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Jesus Christ is a better Shepherd than any on earth 
    was before or after—because Christ PRAYS for His sheep!</p></b></font> Many 
    shepherds scarcely pray for themselves. Christ prays for all His elect 
    sheep. John 17:9, "I will pray for them." As Christ <i>knows </i>every sheep 
    by name—so Christ <i>prays </i>for every sheep by name. "I pray for them." 
    And what does Christ pray for them? Why, He prays that they may not <i>
    wander</i>, that they may not <i>tire </i>or <i>faint</i>, that they may not
    <i>die </i>along the way. And this is Christ's prayer for His sheep, John 
    17:11, "Holy Father, <i>keep </i>those whom You have given Me." And this 
    prayer of Christ's prevails with God. If we consider Christ either in His 
    office or in His relation to God, His prayer must be prevalent. Consider Him 
    in His office as He is a Priest; consider Him as He is in relation, as He is 
    a Son. If God could forget Christ as a Priest—yet He could not forget Christ 
    as His Son. John 11:42, "I know You always hear Me." And this prayer of 
    Christ for His elect sheep is <i>perpetual</i>. There is not one minute 
    wherein we can say that Christ is not praying for us. How can these sheep 
    miscarry—when their blessed Shepherd is always <i>watching </i>over them and
    <i>praying </i>for them!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Jesus Christ is a better Shepherd than any other—in 
    that He shows more dear affection and tender LOVE to His sheep than any 
    shepherd in this world ever did. </p></b></font>And no wonder Christ should thus 
    love His sheep. Because they are His own—He has a propriety in them. In John 
    10:27 He calls them "<i>My </i>sheep." A man may be a shepherd—and not be 
    the <i>owner </i>of the flock of sheep. A <i>hireling </i>may take charge of 
    the sheep when, perhaps, he never <i>cared </i>for the sheep, John 10:13. 
    But Christ is the <i>owner </i>of the sheep. Though the pope blasphemously 
    calls himself the <i>Head of the Church</i>, and lords it over Christ's 
    flocks—yet the pope is a usurper. The Lord Jesus is the only rightful owner 
    of His sheep. Hence it follows that Christ has such dear affection and 
    tender love for these sheep, because they are His own.
<p align="justify">Now, that Christ bears more love to His sheep than any 
    other shepherd ever did, appears in these three particulars, (1) He treats 
    His sheep with compassion; (2) He comforts His sheep; and (3) He died for 
    His sheep. Was there ever any love parallel to this?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(1) Christ treats all His sheep with COMPASSION</p></b>. I 
    ground this upon that previously cited Scripture in Isaiah 40:11, "He will 
    feed his flock like a shepherd. He will carry the lambs in his arms, holding 
    them close to his heart. He will gently lead the mother sheep with their 
    young." Christ, you see, is tender of His <i>lambs </i>and puts them in His 
    bosom near His heart; and such as are <i>faint </i>He gently leads. Oh, the 
    mercies of Christ to His elect sheep! That's the first point, Christ loves 
    His sheep and treats them with compassion. His heart yearns over them.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2) Christ not only treats His sheep with compassion—but 
    He COMFORTS them. </p></b>The people of Christ, who are His sheep—are given to
    <i>trembling</i>. Sheep are trembling, fearful creatures, and are apt to be 
    discouraged. Now Christ comforts and revives them. Isaiah 12:1, "You comfort 
    me." Christ comforts His people in two ways:
<p align="justify">First, Christ comforts them in the use of His Word and 
    His supper. In His Word—we hear Christ's voice; in His supper—we have His 
    kiss and embraces. In the use of gospel ordinances the saints are oftentimes 
    upon the Mount of Transfiguration. They feed upon holy manna. Christ gives 
    them suddenly such inward revivings, as carry them above the love of life 
    and the fear of death.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, Christ comforts His people, the flock of His 
    pasture, by His <b>Spirit</b>, who is called the Comforter in John 14:16. 
    The Spirit enables us to work out our adoption; and to read our names in the 
    promises. The Spirit seals up God's love to the heart—upon which there is a 
    current of divine joy running into the soul. Here is Christ's love to His 
    sheep—He comforts them!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(3) Christ shows His love to His elect sheep in that He 
    shed His blood for them!</p></b> John 10:11, "I lay down My life for My sheep!" 
    The death of the Shepherd—is the life of the sheep! Consider Christ's death 
    in a threefold notion, it was painful; it was voluntary; and it was 
    meritorious. In all these ways He shows His love in dying for His sheep.
<p align="justify">First, look upon Christ's death as PAINFUL. If the 
    torment of the <i>body </i>was so great, oh, what was the agony of the <i>
    soul! </i>The Lord Jesus Christ was trodden and squeezed in the winepress of 
    His Father's wrath! The evangelists use three words worthy of observing to 
    express Christ's agony. The text says He began to be <i>amazed</i>, He began 
    to <i>faint</i>, and He began to be <i>exceedingly sorrowful</i>. He felt 
    the equivalent of hell's torment in His soul. Though Christ was anointed with 
    the Holy Spirit, though He was supported with the Deity, though He was 
    comforted with angels from heaven—yet for all that He sweated great drops of 
    blood. Oh, the love of Christ in dying for His sheep! "He began to be filled 
    with <i>anguish </i>and <i>deep distress</i>. My soul is <i>crushed with 
    grief </i>to the point of death!" Matthew 26:37-38.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, consider Christ's death as VOLUNTARY. He parted 
    with His life freely. It is true, Christ's death was <i>necessary </i>with 
    regard to God's decree—but it was voluntary in the respect that Christ 
    cheerfully yielded to suffering. John 10:18, "I lay down My life." The Jews 
    could not have taken away His life if He had not laid it down. Nothing could 
    have forced Christ to have died for His sheep—but His great love for them! 
    Nothing could have bound Him to the cross—but the golden chain of love!</p>
<p align="justify">Third, consider Christ's death as MERITORIOUS. It is the 
    inlet to all spiritual blessings. It procures for us <i>justification </i>of 
    our persons, <i>acceptance </i>of our services, and <i>access </i>to the 
    throne of grace. It procures an entrance into the most holy place—heaven, 
    Hebrews 3:19. Behold, here is the love of Christ in laying down His life for 
    His sheep! He has purchased <i>glorious </i>things for us! There was no way 
    for the sheep to live—but by the death of the Shepherd! And for Christ Jesus 
    to die as a malefactor, having the weight of so many sins lying upon Him—was 
    more than if all the angels had been turned into dust!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Christ is a better Shepherd than any other—in that He 
    can make all the care and pains He takes with His sheep to be successful.
    </p></b></font>This, no other shepherd can do. Other shepherds may lead the 
    sheep to water or to pasture—but they cannot make the sheep have an 
    appetite. They cannot make the pasture nourish the sheep. But Christ, our 
    blessed Shepherd, as He <i>leads </i>His sheep into the pasture, so He can
    <i>cause </i>an appetite in His sheep for their food. He can make them, by 
    speaking a word—to hunger and thirst after righteousness. Jesus Christ 
    provides pastures for His sheep, and He alone can bless these pastures and 
    make them nourishing to the soul. 1 Timothy 4:6, "Nourished up in the words 
    of faith." Christ can bless the blessed Supper. He can make the elements, 
    through the operation of His Spirit, to be spiritual growth and nourishment 
    in His elect sheep. Thus He is a better Shepherd—He can bless the pasture.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Christ is a better Shepherd than any other in the 
    world for He is a pattern and example to all His flock.</p></b></font> He is an 
    example of meekness, humility, and sanctity. He is a pattern for all His 
    flock. In this sense observe, that Christ is said to go <i>before </i>His 
    sheep, John 10:34. How did He go before them? By His holy example. 1 Peter 
    2:21, "Leaving us an example, that you should follow in His steps."
<p align="justify">Jerome, having read the pious life of Delyan, and what an 
    excellent end he made, said, "Delyan shall be the example I will follow." 
    But let all the sheep of Christ say, "Jesus Christ shall be the example that 
    we will follow and imitate." Christ's sheep go astray when they do not tread 
    in the steps of their Shepherd, the Lord Jesus.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Christ Jesus is a better Shepherd than any other, and 
    far excels them, in that He keeps His sheep so secure in His hands, that 
    none can ever pluck them out.</p></b></font> John 10:28, "Neither can any pluck 
    them out of My hand." Not one of Christ's sheep was ever lost! Though a 
    shepherd is ever so careful and vigilant—yet sometimes a sheep may go 
    astray; or be devoured by the wolf. But not one of Christ's elect sheep was 
    ever lost. John 17:12, "Not one of them is lost—but the son of perdition." 
    Judas was never given to Christ—he was not a <i>sheep </i>but a <i>goat</i>! 
    None of His sheep was ever lost.
<p align="justify">Christ's sheep may sometimes go astray by <i>error</i>, 
    and may fall into the acts of <i>sin </i>as did David—but Christ will find 
    them and bring them back again—by speedy repentance. Christ's sheep may be 
    lame and faint, and can hardly walk—but Christ cares for the <i>weak </i>
    sheep as well as the <i>strong </i>sheep. The <i>bruised reed </i>He will 
    not break. The weakest saint alive, is so much a sheep that<i>—he is part of 
    his Shepherd! </i>Christ and believers are one. The sheep cannot 
    perish—without the Shepherd perishing likewise!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Christ is a better Shepherd than any other—in that He 
    puts His sheep into a better pasture at last.</p></b></font> He takes them out 
    of the <i>wilderness </i>here, the <i>valley of tears</i>—and transplants 
    them into <i>paradise</i>, there to feed among the lilies! He gives them 
    eternal life. John 10:28, "I give unto them eternal life." Christ's sheep 
    may lose their golden fleece; men may rob them of their wool; and they may 
    lose their lives for Christ's sake. Yes—but Christ gives them eternal life. 
    Life is sweet—but that word "eternal" makes it far sweeter!<i> Eternal life</i> 
    consists in the fruition of all good things—life, beauty, strength, joy, 
    perfection, and eternity. Here is the excellency of our good Shepherd—He 
    gives His sheep eternal life. He will take them out of the <i>wilderness</i>, 
    where there are <i>fiery serpents</i>—and place them in <i>paradise, </i>
    where they shall feed among the holy cherubim!
<p align="justify">Thus I have shown you how the Lord Jesus <i>resembles </i>
    a shepherd, and how He is a <i>better </i>Shepherd than any other. Give me 
    permission now—to make some <i><b>application</b></i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. </p></b></font>Is the Lord Jesus Christ this great 
    Shepherd who takes such care for His flock, and is He a better Shepherd than 
    any other? Then let us all labor to KNOW our Shepherd. Here in the text 
    Christ says, "I know My sheep; I know them by name." Yes, and He is known by 
    them too. Oh, let us know our blessed Shepherd. Knowing Christ is nothing 
    else but believing in Him. In Scripture, knowledge is sometimes put for 
    faith. Isaiah 53:11, "By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify 
    many." Knowledge is there put for faith. Then do we know our Shepherd, 
    Christ, when we believe in Him.
<p align="justify">The blind world is ignorant of Christ. John 17:25, "The 
    world has not known Me." No? They heard Christ preach—they saw His 
    miracles—but neither oracle nor miracle would work upon them. Christ said, 
    "The world has not known Me." Formalists do not know Christ savingly. They 
    have light but they lack sight—as if the sun should shine upon a blind eye. 
    We know Christ aright when we <i>believe </i>in Him, when we fetch <i>virtue
    </i>from Him, and then we are <i>transformed </i>into His likeness. This is 
    to know Christ. Oh, let us never rest until we know the Guardian and 
    Shepherd of our souls—the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">As our comfort lies in <i>Christ </i>knowing us—so it 
    lies in <i>our </i>knowing Christ. Our comfort lies in Christ's knowing us 
    with a knowledge of approbation—and also in our knowing Christ with a 
    knowledge of apprehension. That's the first use, let us know our Shepherd. 
    Such as do not know Christ will hear Christ say to them, "I never knew you."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2.</p></b></font> Let us not only know our Shepherd—but 
    let us HEARKEN to the voice of our blessed Shepherd, our Lord Jesus. As soon 
    as ever the shepherd comes into the field, the sheep know his voice. Oh, let 
    us hear Christ's voice! John 10:27, "My sheep <i>hear </i>My voice." 
    Christ's voice is in the preaching of the Word. Therefore observe that 
    Christ is said now, just now, to speak from heaven to us, Hebrews 12:25. How 
    does He speak now from heaven, but in the preaching of the Word? Oh, then, 
    hear Christ speak. But take heed, don't hear the voice of a stranger, John 
    10:5. Christ said that they would not follow a stranger. Sheep will not 
    follow a stranger. By stranger is meant one who is heterodox and would bring 
    strange wonders into the church and poison Christ's sheep. As you must 
    hearken to Christ's voice, so take heed that you don't listen to the voice 
    of a stranger.
<p align="justify">Christ's sheep are <i>discerning</i>. He has given them a 
    spirit of discerning, and they are able by their wisdom to distinguish 
    between truth and error. They will not hear the voice of a stranger. We must 
    hear Christ's voice—but when do we hear Christ's voice aright? We hear 
    Christ's voice aright when we obey His voice, and never until then. In John 
    10, and several other places, you read of obeying the voice of Christ. When 
    Christ speaks of self-denial, of meekness and mercifulness, we obey Him and 
    are ambitious to obey Him. A good Christian is like the flower which opens 
    with the sun—he opens to Christ's commands; he cordially obeys Christ. This 
    is to hear Christ's voice.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. </p></b></font>If Christ is the great, blessed, and 
    good Shepherd, then let us all labor to EVIDENCE to ourselves that we belong 
    to this Shepherd, that we are the sheep of Christ's pasture. Let us search 
    and try whether or not we have the earmark of Christ's sheep, whether we are 
    like sheep. A sheep is a <i>pure </i>and <i>clean </i>creature. Are we like 
    the sheep of Christ? Are our hearts cleansed from all filthiness of flesh 
    and spirit? He who lies wallowing in sin—is a swine, not a sheep.
<p align="justify">A sheep is a very <i>useful </i>creature. Everything in a 
    sheep is good for something. The milk, the flesh, the fleece, everything is 
    useful. Are we the sheep of Christ? Are we useful? We should be always doing 
    good; this is the very end of our living, to <i>be </i>good and <i>do </i>
    good.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. </p></b></font>Is Christ this blessed Shepherd better 
    than any other shepherd? Oh, then, let us labor to LOVE and honor this 
    blessed Shepherd! Does the Shepherd die for His sheep—and shall not the 
    sheep love their Shepherd! Those who do not love Christ are not <i>sheep—</i>but
    <i>goats</i>. Give Christ, I beseech you, the best of your love, the cream 
    of your love. The spouse gave Christ the juice of her pomegranate, her 
    spiced wine, Song of Solomon 8:2.
<p align="justify">Love Christ better than estate or relations. Relations 
    may lie in our <i>bosoms</i>—but Christ must lie in our <i>hearts</i>. Our 
    love to the Lord Jesus must be <i>intense </i>and <i>ardent</i>. We should, 
    like seraphim, burn in a holy flame of love for Christ. If a man had three 
    souls, as a philosopher once dreamed, they would all be too little for 
    Christ. Let us so love Christ, and show it, by an open acknowledgment of 
    Christ if we are called to it. This is love, to dare to own Christ, our 
    blessed Shepherd. It is said of the chief rulers, John 12:42, that they 
    believed on Christ but did not confess Him lest they should be put out of 
    the synagogue. Christ will never own that faith, which will never entertain 
    Christ. He who is ashamed of Christ—is a shame to Christ.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 5. </p></b></font>I will but name it—Let us respond to 
    all the love and cost of Christ, our blessed Shepherd. How should we respond 
    to this cost? By holy fruitfulness. 1 Corinthians 9:7, "Who feeds a 
    flock—and does not drink of the milk?" Christ has feasted you as His flock. 
    Christ has feasted you with His body and blood. Oh, then, feast Him with the 
    fruits of righteousness; be fruitful in knowledge; be fruitful in good 
    works.
<p align="justify">I will close all with, "Awaken, north wind—come, south 
    wind! Blow on my garden, and spread the fragrance of its spices. Let my 
    Lover come to His garden and eat its choicest fruits!" Song of Songs 4:16</p>
