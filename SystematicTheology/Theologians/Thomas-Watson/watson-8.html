<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Heart Purity</b></font></p>
<p align="center">By Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify">"Blessed are the <b>pure in heart</b>, for they shall see 
    God." Matthew 5:8</p>
<p align="justify">The holy God, who is 'of purer eyes than to behold 
    iniquity' calls here for heart-purity, and to such as are adorned with this 
    jewel, he promises a glorious and beatific vision of himself: 'they shall 
    see God'. Two things are to be explained the nature of purity; the subject 
    of purity.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The NATURE of purity.</p></b></font> Purity is a sacred 
    refined thing. It stands diametrically opposed to whatever defiles. We must 
    distinguish the various <b>kinds </b>of purity. 
<p align="justify">First, there is a <b>primitive </b>purity which is in God 
    originally and essentially, as light is in the sun. Holiness is the glory of 
    the Godhead: 'Glorious in holiness' (Exodus 15:11). God is the origin, 
    pattern and prototype of all holiness. </p>
<p align="justify">Second, there is a <b>created </b>purity. Thus holiness 
    is in the <i>angels</i>, and was once in <i>Adam</i>. Adam's heart did not 
    have the least spot or tincture of impurity. We call that wine pure which 
    has no mixture; and that gold pure which has no dross mingled with it. Such 
    was Adam's holiness. It was like the wine which comes from the grape, having 
    no mixture. But this is not to be found on earth. We must go to heaven for 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, there is an <b>evangelical </b>purity; whence <i>
    grace is mingled with some sin</i>--like <i>gold </i>in the ore; like <i>
    wine </i>which has a dreg in it; like fine <i>cloth </i>with a blemish; like 
    Nebuchadnezzar's image, part of silver, and part of clay (Daniel 2:35). This 
    mixture God calls purity in a gospel-sense; as a face may be said to be 
    fair, which has some freckles in it. Where there is a study of purity and a 
    loathing ourselves for our impurity--this is to be 'pure in heart'.</p>
<p align="justify">Some by pure in heart, understand <i>chastity</i>, others
    <i>sincerity </i>(Psalm 32:2). But I suppose purity here is to be taken in a 
    larger sense for the several kinds and degrees of holiness. They are said to 
    be pure, who are <i><b>consecrated </b></i>people, having the <i>oil of 
    grace </i>poured upon them. This purity is much mistaken.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Civility </p></i>and <i>morality </i>are not purity. A man 
    may be clothed with great moral virtues, such as justice, charity, prudence, 
    temperance--and yet go to hell.
<i>
<p align="justify">Profession </p></i>is not purity. A man may have a name to 
    live and yet be dead (Revelation 3:1). He may be swept by civility and 
    garnished by profession—yet the devil may dwell in the house. The blazing 
    comet is no star. The hypocrite's <i>tongue </i>may be silver—yet his <i>
    heart </i>stone. 
<p align="justify">Purity consists in two things; rectitude of mind, a 
    prizing holiness in the judgment (Psalm 119:30); conformity of will, an 
    embracing of holiness in the affections (Psalm 119:97). A pure soul is cast 
    into the mold of holiness. Holiness is a blood that runs in his veins.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The SUBJECT of purity.</p></b></font> The heart--'pure in 
    heart'. Purity of heart does not exclude purity of life, no more than the 
    pureness of the fountain excludes the pureness of the stream. But it is 
    called purity of heart, because the heart is the main thing in true 
    religion, and there can be no purity of life without it. A Christian's great 
    care should be to keep the heart pure, as one would especially preserve the
    <i>spring </i>from being poisoned. In a duel, a man will chiefly guard and 
    fence his heart, so a wise Christian should above all things keep his heart 
    pure. Take heed that the love of sin does not get in there--lest it prove 
    fatal.
<p align="justify">Christians should above all things breathe after heart 
    purity: 'Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience' (1 Timothy 
    3:9). Justification <i>causes </i>our happiness, sanctification <i>evidences
    </i>it.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The REASONS for purity.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Purity is a thing called for in Scripture.</p></b></font> 
    'Be holy for I am holy' (1 Peter 1:16). It is not only the minister bids you 
    be holy—but God himself calls for it. What would the Holy God do with unholy 
    servants?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Because of that filthy and cursed condition we are 
    in, before purity is wrought in us.</p></b></font><i> We are a lump of clay and 
    sin mingled together! </i>Sin not only blinds us—but defiles us. It is 
    called filthiness (James 1:21). And to show how befilthying a thing it is, 
    it is compared to a plague of the heart (1 Kings 8:38), to corruption 
    (Deuteronomy 32:5), to vomit (2 Peter 2:22), to infants 'helplessly kicking 
    about in their own blood' (Ezekiel 16:6), and to a 'menstrual cloth' (Isaiah 
    30:22), which (as Jerome says) was the most defiling thing under the law. 
    All the legal warnings which God appointed, were but to put men in mind of 
    their loathsomeness before they were washed in the blood of Christ. If all 
    the evils in the world were put together and their quintessence strained 
    out, they could not make a thing so black and polluted as sin does! <b>A 
    sinner is a devil in a man's shape! </b>When Moses' rod was turned into a 
    serpent, he fled from it. Would God open men's eyes and show them their 
    deformities and damnable spots--they would fly from themselves, as from 
    serpents! This shows what need we have of purity. When grace comes--it 
    washes off this hellish filth. It makes Ethiopians into true Israelites! It 
    turns ravens into swans! It makes those who are as black as hell--to become 
    as white as snow!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Because none but the pure in heart are savingly 
    interested in the covenant of grace. </p></b></font>Covenanted people have 'the 
    sprinkling with clean water' (Ezekiel 36:25). Now, until we are thus 
    sprinkled, we have nothing to do with either the new <i>covenant</i>, or 
    with the new <i>Jerusalem</i>. If a will is made only to such people as are 
    so qualified, none can come in for a share—but such as have those 
    qualifications. Just so, God has made a will and covenant that he will be 
    our God, and will settle eternal glory upon us—but with this clause or 
    proviso in the will--that we be purified people, having the 'clean water 
    sprinkled, upon us. Now until then, we have nothing to do with God or mercy.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Purity is the end of our election.</p></b></font> 'He has 
    chosen us--that we should be holy' (Ephesians 1:4). Not <i>for </i>
    holiness—but <i>to </i>holiness. 'Whom he did foreknow, he also did 
    predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son' (Romans 8:29). God 
    predestinates us to Christ's image, which image consists 'in righteousness 
    and true holiness' (Ephesians 4:24). So that until you are holy, you cannot 
    show any sign of election upon you—but rather the devil's brand-mark!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] Purity is the end of our redemption.</p></b></font> If we 
    could have gone to heaven in our sins, Christ needed not have died. Why did 
    he shed his blood, but to redeem us from an 'empty way of life'? (1 Peter 
    1:18, 19). 'Christ gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and 
    to purify for himself a people that are his very own' (Titus 2:14).<i> 
    Christ shed his blood--to wash off our filth! </i>The cross was both an 
    altar and a laver. Jesus died not only to save us from wrath (1 
    Thessalonians 1:10)—but to save us from sin (Matthew 1:21). Out of his side 
    came water which signifies our cleansing, as well as blood which signifies 
    our justifying (1 John 5:6). The truth is, it would make Christ monstrous, 
    if the head should be pure and not the members.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Why purity must be chiefly in the heart.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Because if the heart is not pure, we differ nothing 
    from a Pharisaic purity.</p></b></font> The Pharisees' holiness consisted 
    chiefly in externals. Theirs was an outside purity. They never minded the 
    inside of the heart. 'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You 
    are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you 
    are filthy—full of greed and self-indulgence! Hypocrites! You are like 
    whitewashed tombs—beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with 
    dead people's bones and all sorts of impurity!' (Matthew 23:25, 27). The 
    Pharisees were good only on the surface. They were whited over, not white. 
    They were like a rotten post overlaid with fine paint. They were like a gold 
    chimney—but within nothing but soot. Of such hypocrites Salvian complains, 
    who had Christ in their <i>mouths</i>--but not in their <i>lives</i>. 
<p align="justify">We must go further. Be 'pure in heart', like the king's 
    daughter 'all glorious <i>within</i>' (Psalm 45:13); else ours is but a 
    Pharisaic purity; and Christ says, 'For I tell you that unless your 
    righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, 
    you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.' (Matthew 5:20).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The heart must especially be kept pure, because the 
    heart is the chief seat or place of God's residence. </p></b></font>God dwells 
    in the heart. He takes up the heart for his own lodging (Isaiah 57:15; 
    Ephesians 3:17), therefore it must be pure and holy. A king's palace must be 
    kept from defilement, and especially his <i>throne</i>. How holy ought that 
    to be! If the <i>body </i>is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 
    6:19), the <i>heart </i>is the holy of holies! Oh take heed of defiling the 
    room where God chiefly dwells! Let that room be washed with holy tears.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The heart must especially be pure, because it is the 
    heart which sanctifies all that we do.</p></b></font> If the heart is holy, all 
    is holy—our affections holy, our duties holy. 'The altar sanctifies the 
    gift' (Matthew 23:19). The heart is the altar that sanctifies the offering. 
    The Romans kept their springs from being poisoned. The heart is the spring 
    of all our actions; let us keep this spring from poison. Be 'pure in heart'.
<p align="justify">See here what that beauty is, which beautifies a soul in 
    God's eye, namely, purity of heart. You are but a spiritual leper--until you 
    are pure in heart. God is in love with the pure heart, for he sees his own 
    picture drawn there. </p>
<p align="justify">Holiness is the angels' glory. They are pure 
    virgin-spirits.<i> Take away purity from an angel--and he is but a devil!
    </i>You who are pure in heart--have the angels' glory shining in you. You 
    have the embroidery and workmanship of the Holy Spirit upon you. </p>
<p align="justify">The pure heart is God's paradise where he delights to 
    walk. It is his lesser heaven. The <i>dove </i>delights in the purest air. 
    The Holy Spirit who descended in the likeness of a dove, delights in the 
    purest soul. God says of the pure in heart, as of Zion, 'This is my rest 
    forever, here will I dwell' (Psalm 132:14). God loves the loveliest 
    complexion. The pure in heart is Christ's bride, decked and bespangled with 
    the jewels of holiness. 'You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes' 
    (Canticles 4:9). Your eyes, that is, your graces; these as a chain of 
    diamonds, have drawn my heart to you. Of all hearts God loves the pure heart 
    best. You who dress yourself by the looking-glass of the Word and adorn 'the 
    hidden person of your heart' (1 Peter 3:4), are most precious in God's eyes, 
    though you may be as bleary-eyed as Leah, or as lame as Barzillai. Yet being 
    'pure in heart, you are the mirror of beauty and may say 'Yet shall I be 
    glorious in the eyes of the Lord' (Isaiah 49:5). How may this raise the 
    esteem of purity! This is a beauty which never fades and which makes God 
    himself fall in love with us.</p>
<p align="justify">If we must be pure in heart--then we must not rest in <i>
    outward </i>purity. Morality is not sufficient. A swine may be washed—yet a 
    swine still. Morality does but wash a man, grace changes him. Morality may 
    shine in the eyes of the world—but it differs as much from purity, as a 
    pebble differs from the diamond. Morality is but strewing flowers on a dead 
    corpse. A man who is but highly moral—is but a tame devil. How many have 
    made 'morality' their Savior! Morality will damn, as well as heinous vice. A 
    boat may be sunk with <i>gold</i>, as well as with <i>dung</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe two things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The moral person, though he will not commit gross 
    sins—yet he is not sensible of heart sins. He does not discern the 'law in 
    his members' (Romans 7:23). He is not troubled for unbelief, hardness of 
    heart, vanity of thoughts. He abhors gaol-sins, not gospel-sins.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The moral person rises against holiness. The <b>snake
    </b>has a fine appearance—but has a deadly sting. The moral man is fair to 
    look to—but has a secret antipathy against the holy ways of God. He hates 
    grace, as much as vice. Zeal is as odious to him as uncleanness. Morality is 
    not to be rested in. The heart must be pure. God would have Aaron wash the 
    inner parts of the sacrifice (Leviticus 9:14). Morality does but wash the 
    outside; the inside must be washed. 'Blessed are the pure in heart'.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Let us put ourselves on TRIAL whether we are pure-hearted 
    or not.</p></b></font> Here I shall show the signs of an <b>impure </b>heart; 
    and then, signs of a <b>pure </b>heart.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Signs of an IMPURE heart</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. An IGNORANT heart is an impure heart. </p></b></font>To be 
    ignorant of sin or Christ, argues impurity of heart. Nahash the Ammonite 
    would enter into covenant with the men of Jabesh-Gilead, so he might thrust 
    out their <i>right </i>eyes (1 Samuel 11:2). Satan leaves men their <i>left
    </i>eye. In worldly knowledge they are quick-sighted enough--but the right 
    eye of spiritual knowledge is quite put out! (2 Corinthians 4:4). Ignorance 
    is Satan's stronghold (Acts 26:18). The devils are bound in chains of 
    darkness (Jude 6). So are all ignorant people. Impossible it is that an 
    ignorant heart should be holy. It is knowledge which makes the heart good. 
    'That the soul is without knowledge is not good' (Proverbs 19:2). For any to 
    say that, though their <i>mind </i>is ignorant--yet their <i>heart </i>is 
    good; they may as well say that, though they are blind--yet their eyes are 
    good. 
<p align="justify">In the law, when the plague of leprosy was in a man's <i>
    head--</i>the priest was to pronounce him unclean. This is the case of an 
    ignorant man. The leprosy is in his head, 'he is unclean'. That heart cannot 
    be very pure, which is a <i>dungeon</i>. <i>Grace </i>cannot reign, where <i>
    ignorance </i>reigns. An ignorant man can have no <i>love </i>to God. 'He 
    cannot love that which he does not know'. He can have no <i>faith</i>. 
    Knowledge must usher in faith (Psalm 9:10). He cannot worship God aright 
    (John 4:22). Though he may worship the true God—yet in a wrong manner. 
    Ignorance is the root of sin. Blindness leads to lasciviousness (Ephesians 
    4:18, 19; Proverbs 7:23). Ignorance is the mother of pride (Revelation 
    3:17). It is the cause of error (2 Timothy 3:7), and, which is worse, a 
    willful ignorance. 'It is one thing to be ignorant; it is another thing to 
    be unwilling to know'. Many are in love with ignorance. They hug their 
    disease (Job 21:14; 2. Peter 3:5). Ignorant minds are impure. <i>There is no 
    going to heaven in the dark!</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A SELF-RIGHTEOUS heart is an impure heart.</p></b></font> 
    It sees no need of purity. 'I am rich and have need of nothing' (Revelation 
    3:17). Not to be sensible of a disease--is worse than the disease! You do 
    not hear a sick man say, 'I am well'. There are some who 'need no 
    repentance' (Luke 15:7). Some sinners are too well to be cured. Heart purity 
    is as great a wonder to the natural man--as the new birth was to Nicodemus 
    (John 3:4). It is sad to think how many go on confidently and are ready to 
    bless themselves, never suspecting their dreadful condition--until it is too 
    late!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. He has an impure heart who regards iniquity in his 
    heart. </p></b></font>'If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear 
    me' (Psalm 66:18). In the original it is 'If I look upon sin', that is, with 
    a lustful look. <i>Sin-regarding </i>is inconsistent with <i>heart-purity</i>.
<p align="justify">What is it to 'regard iniquity'?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] We regard iniquity, when we INDULGE in sin.</p></b></font> 
    When sin not only lives in us—but when we live in sin. Some will leave all 
    their sins but one. Jacob would let all his sons go but Benjamin. Satan can 
    hold a man by one sin. The fowler holds the bird fast enough by one claw. 
    Others HIDE their sins like one who shuts up his shop windows, but follows 
    his trade within doors. Many deal with their sins as Moses' mother dealt 
    with her son. She hid him in the ark of bulrushes, as if she had left 
    him—but her eye was still upon him and in the end, she became his nurse 
    (Exodus 2:9). Just so, many seem to leave their sins—but they only hide them 
    from the eye of others. Their heart still goes after them, and at last they 
    nurse and give breast to their sins.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] To regard iniquity, is to DELIGHT in iniquity.</p></b></font> 
    Though a child of God sins—yet he does not take a delight in sin. 'I do the 
    very thing I hate' (Romans 7:15). But impure souls make a recreation of sin. 
    They 'delight in wickedness' (2 Thessalonians 2:12). Never did one feed with 
    more delight on a meal he loves--than a wicked man does upon the forbidden 
    fruit. This delight in sin--shows that the will is in the sin. And 'the will 
    is the rule and measure of the deed'.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] To regard iniquity is to make PROVISION for sin.</p></b></font> 
    'Make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof' (Romans 
    13:14). The wicked are caterers for their lusts. It is a metaphor taken from 
    such as make provision for a family--to feed them. The Greek word here 
    signifies a projecting and planning in the mind, how to bring a thing about. 
    This is to make provision for the flesh--when one studies to satisfy the 
    flesh and provide fuel for lust. Thus Amnon made provision for the flesh (2 
    Samuel 13:5). He pretends himself to be sick, and his sister, Tamar, must be 
    his nurse. She must cook and serve his food to him. By which means he 
    defiled her virginity. It is sad when men's concern is not to be holy—but to 
    satisfy lust.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] To regard iniquity, is to give it respect and 
    ENTERTAINMENT</p></b></font>, as Lot showed respect to the angels. 'He bowed 
    himself with his face toward the ground and said, Behold now, my lords, turn 
    in, I beg you . . .' (Genesis 19:2). When the Spirit of God comes He is 
    repulsed and grieved—but when temptation comes, the sinner bows to it, sets 
    open the gates, and says 'Turn in here, my lord'. This is to regard 
    iniquity.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] He is said to regard sin, who does not regard the 
    threatenings of God against sin. </p></b></font>We read of 'seven thunders 
    uttering their voices' (Revelation 10:3). How many thunders in Scripture 
    utter their voice against sin! 'Surely God will crush the heads of his 
    enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.' (Psalm 68:21). 
    Here is a thundering scripture—but sinners fear not this thunder. Let a 
    minister come as a <i>Boanerges</i>, clothed with the spirit of Elijah, and 
    denounce all the curses of God against men's sins--they have no regard for 
    it. They can laugh at the shaking of a spear (Job 41:29). This is to regard 
    iniquity, and argues an impure heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. An UNBELIEVING heart is an impure heart.</p></b></font> 
    The Scripture calls it expressly 'an <i>evil </i>heart of unbelief' (Hebrews 
    3:12). An unbelieving heart is evil in the highest degree. It is full of the 
    poison of hell. Unbelief is the foul medley of all sins--the root and 
    receptacle of sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Unbelief is a God-affronting sin. </p></b></font>It puts 
    the lie upon God. It calls in question his power (Psalm 78:19), mercy and 
    truth. 'The one who does not believe God, is actually calling God a liar' (1 
    John 5:10). Can a greater affront be cast upon the God of glory! It makes us 
    trust to second causes, which is setting the creature in the place of God. 'Asa 
    in his disease sought not to the Lord—but to the physicians' (2 Chronicles 
    16:12). He relied more on the physician than upon God. Saul seeks to the 
    witch of Endor. O high affront, to lean upon the <i>reed </i>and neglect the
    <i>Rock </i>of Ages!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Unbelief hardens the heart. </p></b></font>These two sins 
    are linked together. 'He upbraided them with their <i>unbelief </i>and <i>
    hardness of heart</i>' (Mark 16:14). Unbelief breeds the stone of the heart. 
    He who does not believe God's <i>threatenings--</i>will never fear him. He 
    who does not believe God's <i>promises--</i>will never love him. What is 
    said of the Leviathan, is true of the unbeliever. 'Its heart is as hard as 
    rock, as hard as a millstone' (Job 41:24). Unbelief first <i>pollutes </i>
    the heart--and then <i>hardens </i>it!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Unbelief breeds hypocrisy. </p></b></font>Professors do 
    not believe that God is a jealous God, and will call them to account. 
    Therefore it is they put on a mask of religion and are <i>saints in jest</i>, 
    that they may play <i>the devil in earnest </i>(2 Timothy 3:4, 5). They 
    pretend to worship God—but Self is the idol they worship. Like rowers--they 
    look one way and row another. The unbeliever is the greatest hypocrite.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Unbelief causes the fear of men.</p></b></font> 'Fear is 
    proof of a baseborn soul'. Fear is a debasing thing. It unmans a man. It 
    makes him afraid to be godly. The fearful man studies rather <i>compliance,
    </i>than <i>conscience</i>. 'The fear of man brings a snare' (Proverbs 
    29:25). What made <i>Abraham </i>equivocate, <i>David </i>pretend to be mad, 
    and <i>Peter </i>deny Christ? Was it not their fear? And whence does fear 
    spring—but from unbelief? Therefore the Scripture joins them together. 'The
    <i>fearful </i>and <i>unbelieving</i>' (Revelation 21:8).

<p align="justify">[5] Unbelief is the root of apostasy. </p></b></font>'an evil 
    heart of unbelief in departing from the living God' (Hebrews 3:12). What is 
    the reason those who seemed once zealous--now despise God, and leave off 
    prayer in their families? Is it not their unbelief? They believed not that 
    God is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him (Hebrews 
    11:6). Infidelity is the cause of apostasy. In the Greek, 'apistia' 
    (unbelief) leads to 'apostasia' (apostasy). And if unbelief is the breeder 
    and fomenter of so much sin, then the unbelieving heart must needs be an 
    impure heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A COVETOUS heart is an impure heart.</p></b></font> The <i>
    earth </i>is the most impure element. The purity of the heart lies in the 
    spirituality of it, and what is more opposite to spiritualness than 
    earthiness? Covetousness is 'the root of all evil' (1 Timothy 6:10). 'To 
    what cost do you drive mortal hearts--you accursed lust for gold!'
<p align="justify">[1] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    discontent</b></font>. Why do any repine at their condition—but because they 
    think they do not have enough? The Greek word for <i>covetousness </i>
    signifies an immoderate desire of getting. Because the covetous man is never 
    satisfied, his heart frets in discontent and impatience.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    theft</b></font>. Achan's covetous heart made him steal that wedge of 
    gold--which served to cleave asunder his soul from God (Joshua 7:21).</p>
<p align="justify">[3] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    treason</b></font>. It made Judas betray Christ. 'How much will you pay me 
    to betray Jesus to you?' (Matthew 26:15). Absalom's covetousness made him 
    attempt to pluck the crown from his father's head. He who is a <i>Demas, </i>
    will soon prove a <i>Judas</i>. 'Men shall be covetous' (2 Timothy 3:2), and 
    it follows in the next verse, 'traitors'. Where covetousness is in the 
    preface, treason will be in the conclusion.</p>
<p align="justify">[4] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    murder</b></font>. Why did Ahab stone Naboth to death but to possess his 
    vineyard? (1 Kings 21:13). Covetousness has made many swim to the crown in 
    blood. And can the heart be pure, when the 'hands are full of blood'? 
    (Isaiah 1:15).</p>
<p align="justify">[5] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    perjury</b></font>. 'Men shall be covetous, and it follows, 'trucebreakers' 
    (2 Timothy 3:2, 3). For love of money will take a false oath and break a 
    just oath. He who lives a <i>Midas</i>, will die a perjurer.</p>
<p align="justify">[6] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    necromancy</b></font>. Why do people indent with the devil—but for money? 
    They study the black art--for yellow gold. Alexander the Sixth pawned his 
    soul to the devil for a popedom.</p>
<p align="justify">[7] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    fraud </b></font>and <font color="#b07050"><b>theft</b></font>. Such as 
    would be over-rich, will overreach. It is the <i>covetous hand </i>which 
    holds false weights (Amos 8:5).</p>
<p align="justify">[8] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    bribery </b></font>and <font color="#b07050"><b>injustice</b></font>. It 
    makes the courts of law, 'great places of robbery', as Augustine speaks. At 
    Athens, court cases were bought and sold for money.</p>
<p align="justify">[9] Covetousness is the cause of <font color="#b07050">
<b>uncleanness</b></font>. The Scripture mentions 'the <i>hire </i>of a 
    whore' (Deuteronomy 23:18). For money both conscience and chastity are sold.</p>
<p align="justify">[10] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050">
<b>idolatry</b></font>: 'Covetousness which is idolatry' (Colossians 3:5). 
    The covetous person bows down to the image of gold. His money is his god, 
    for he puts his trust in it. Money is his creator. When he has abundance of 
    wealth, then he thinks he is made. Money is his redeemer. If he is in any 
    strait or trouble, he flies to his money and that must redeem him. Money is 
    his comforter. When he is sad he counts over his money and with this golden 
    harp he drives away the evil spirit. When you see a covetous man, you may 
    say, "There goes an idolater!"</p>
<p align="justify">[11] Covetousness is the cause of <font color="#b07050">
<b>unprofitableness </b></font>under the means of grace. In the parable, the
    <i>thorns </i>choked the seed (Matthew 13:7). This is the reason the Word 
    preached does no more good. The seed often falls among thorns. <i>Thousands 
    of sermons lie buried in earthly hearts!</i></p>

<p align="justify">[12] Covetousness is the root of <font color="#b07050">
<b>selfishness </b></font>and <font color="#b07050"><b>stinginess</b></font>. 
    It hinders hospitality. A covetous man has a withered hand. He cannot reach 
    it out to clothe or feed those who are in need. The covetous person is so 
    sordid, that if his estate may flourish he is content to let his name lie 
    dead and buried. What a cursed sin is avarice! And can he be pure in 
    heart--who has such a 'root of bitterness' growing in him? We may as well 
    say that the body is pure which is full of plague-sores.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Those hearts are impure which are 'haters of purity'</p></b></font> 
    (Micah 3:2). They 'hate knowledge' (Proverbs 1:29). Some things in nature 
    have an antipathy; the serpent will not come near the boughs of the wild 
    ash. There is an <i>antipathy </i>in a carnal heart against holiness; and 
    when <i>hatred </i>is boiled up to <i>malice</i>--it is dangerous. Thus 
    Julian maliciously opposed holiness. Receiving a mortal wound when in 
    battle, he threw up a handful of his blood into the air in indignation 
    saying, 'O Galilean, you have overcome me!'
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. He who scoffs at purity, has an impure heart. </p></b>
</font>'There shall come in the last days scoffers' (Luke 16:14; 2. Peter 
    3:3). There are some who make a jeer of religion. It is a sign of an Ishmael 
    spirit to scoff at holiness. Are we not commanded to be perfect as God is 
    perfect? (Matthew 5:48). One would wonder that those who dare open their 
    mouths in derision against holiness--the earth does not open her mouth to 
    swallow them up as it did Korah and Dathan. These are <i>devils </i>covered 
    over with flesh! They have damnation written on their foreheads! Lucian who 
    in the time of the Emperor Trajan had professed religion, afterwards became 
    so profane as to make a mock at the Christians and by his jeers and taunts 
    went about to destroy religion. At last he himself was rent asunder and 
    devoured by dogs. When the scab of the leper appeared, he was to be shut out 
    of the camp (Leviticus 13:8, 46). Those who flout at religion, if God does 
    not give them repentance, are sure to be shut out of the camp of heaven.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. I shall next show you the signs of a PURE heart.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A SINCERE heart is a pure heart.</p></b></font> 'In whose 
    spirit there is no deceit' (Psalm 32:2). There are four characters of a 
    sincere-hearted Christian.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] A sincere heart serves God with the whole heart.</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">First, he serves God with the heart. </p></b>The hypocrite 
    does but make a <i>show </i>of obedience. 'You are always on their <i>lips</i>--but 
    far from their <i>hearts' </i>(Jeremiah 12:2). There may be a fair 
    complexion when the lungs and vitals are diseased. The hypocrite is fair to 
    look on. He has a devout eye--but a hollow heart. But he who is sincere, his
    <i>inside </i>is his <i>best </i>side! In the law God would have 'the inner 
    parts' offered up (Leviticus 4:11). A good Christian gives God 'the inner 
    parts'. When he prays--his heart prays. 'Hannah prayed in her heart' (1 
    Samuel 1:13). In his thanksgiving the heart is the chief instrument of 
    praise (Psalm 111:1). Then is the sweetest music when we 'make melody in our
    <i>hearts </i>to the Lord' (Ephesians 5:19).
<b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, the sincere Christian serves God with the '<i>whole
    </i>heart'</p></b> (Psalm 119:2). Hypocrites have a <i>double </i>heart (Psalm 
    12:2)—a heart for God, and a heart for sin. 'Their heart is divided' (Hosea 
    10:2). God loves a <i>broken </i>heart—but not a <i>divided </i>heart. An 
    upright heart is a whole heart. The full stream and torrent of the 
    affections runs out after God. A sincere heart 'follows God fully' (Numbers 
    14:24).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] A sincere heart is willing to come under a trial. </p></b>
</font>'Search me, O God, and try me' (Psalm 139:23). That metal is to be 
    suspected which men are afraid to bring to the touchstone. A sound heart 
    likes the touchstone of the Word. It is for a searching ministry. Hypocrites 
    fly from the light of truth; they fly from that light which would reveal 
    their sin. They hate that <i>physic of the Word </i>which, meeting with 
    their ill humours, begins to make them sick, and trouble their conscience. A 
    gracious soul loves that preaching best, which makes a<i> heart-anatomy.
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] A man of sincere heart, dares not act in the least 
    against his conscience</p></b>.</font> He is the most magnanimous—yet the most 
    cautious. He is bold in suffering (Proverbs 28:1) but fearful of sin 
    (Genesis 39:9). He dares not get an estate by sinful shifts, or rise upon 
    the ruins of another. Jacob got his father's blessing by fraud—but that is 
    not the way to get God's blessing.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] A sincere heart is a suspicious heart. </p></b></font>The 
    hypocrite suspects <i>others </i>of sin—but has charitable thoughts of <i>
    himself!</i> The sincere Christian has charitable thoughts of others—and 
    suspects himself of sin. He calls himself often to account: "O my soul, have 
    you any evidences for heaven? Is there no flaw in your evidences? You may 
    mistake <i>common </i>grace--for <i>saving </i>grace. Weeds in the 
    cornfields look like flowers. The foolish virgins' lamps looked as if they 
    had oil in them. O my soul, is it not so with you?" The man of sincere soul, 
    being ever jealous, plays the critic upon himself and so traverses things in 
    the court of conscience as if he were presently to be cited to God's bar. 
    This is to be pure in heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A pure heart breathes after PURITY.</p></b></font> If God 
    should stretch out the golden scepter and say to him, 'Ask, and it shall be 
    given you—up to half the kingdom', he would say, "Lord, give me a pure 
    heart! Let my heart have this inscription—<i>Holiness to the Lord.</i> Let 
    my heart be your temple for you to dwell in. Lord, what would I do in heaven 
    with this unholy heart? What converse could I have with You?" A gracious 
    soul is so in love with purity—that he prizes a pure heart above all 
    blessings.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] He prizes a pure heart above RICHES</p></b></font>. He 
    knows that he may be clothed in purple and fine linen—and yet go to hell. He 
    is content to be <i>poor</i>—so long as he may be <i>pure</i>. He knows 
    heart-purity is a special certificate of God's love. 'The pure in heart' 
    shall see God.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] He prizes a pure heart above GIFTS.</p></b></font> Gifts 
    do not at all commend us in God's eye. <i>A pure heart is the jewel! </i>'O 
    woman, great is your faith!' (Matthew 15:28). It was not her rhetorical 
    language Christ was taken with—but her faith. Hypocrites have had rare 
    gifts. Saul had the spirit of prophecy. Judas no doubt could make an elegant 
    oration. Hypocrites have come into God's church loaded with the Egyptian 
    gold of human learning. There may be <i>illumination </i>without <i>
    sanctification</i>. A small <i>diamond </i>is better than a great deal of <i>
    brass</i>. A little grace excels the most flourishing abilities. Now if the 
    out-goings of your soul are after holiness—you desire a pure heart, rather 
    than an eloquent tongue. You have the oil of the Spirit poured on you and 
    you shall be crowned with a glorious sight of God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A pure heart abhors all SIN. </p></b></font>A man may <b>
    forbear </b>and <b>forsake </b>sin—yet not have a pure heart.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] A man may FORBEAR sin—for lack of occasion to sin.</p></b></font> 
    He may forbear sin as one may hold his breath while he dives under water, 
    and then take breath again. The gunpowder makes no noise until the fire is 
    put to it. The clock stands still until the weights are put on. Let a 
    temptation come, which is like the hanging on of the weights, and the heart 
    goes as fast in sin as ever!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] He may forbear sin—for fear of the penalty.</p></b></font> 
    A man forbears a dish he loves—for fear it should bring his disease upon him 
    of the stone or gout. There is conflict in a sinner between the passions of 
    desire—and fear. Desire spurs him on to sin—but fear as a curb and bit 
    checks him. Nor is it the <i>crookedness </i>of the serpent he fears—but the
    <i>sting </i>of the serpent!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] He may forbear sin—out of a design. </p></b></font>He has 
    a plot in hand and his sin might spoil his plot. Some rich heir would fly 
    out in excess—but he behaves properly, to prevent being cut off from the 
    inheritance. How good was Joash while Jehoiada the priest lived! Prudence as 
    well as conscience may restrain from sin.
<p align="justify">Again, a man may FORSAKE sin—yet not have a pure heart. 
    It is a great matter, I confess, to forsake sin. So dear is sin to men, that 
    they will part with the fruit of their body for the sin of their souls. Sin 
    is the Delilah that bewitches, and it is much to see men divorced from it. 
    There may be a forsaking of sin—yet no heart purity. Sin may be forsaken 
    upon wrong principles.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] A man may forsake sin, from MORALITY</p></b></font>. 
    Moral arguments may suppress sin. I have read of a debauched heathen who, 
    hearing Socrates read an ethical lecture on virtue and vice—he went away 
    changed and no more followed his former vices. Cato, Seneca, Aristides, 
    seeing beauty in virtue, led unblamable lives.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] A man may forsake sin, from POLICY. </p></b></font>A man 
    may forsake sin, not out of respect to God's glory—but his own credit. Vice 
    will waste his estate, eclipse the honor of his family, therefore out of 
    policy he will divorce his sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] A man may forsake sin, from NECESSITY.</p></b></font> 
    Perhaps he cannot follow the trade of sin any longer. The adulterer is grown 
    old, the drunkard has become too poor. His heart is toward sin—but either 
    his <i>purse </i>fails him or his <i>strength</i>; as a man who loves 
    hunting—but his prison-fetters will not allow him to follow the sport. This 
    man, who is necessitated to put a stop to sin—does not so much forsake sin, 
    as sin forsakes him.
<p align="justify">But he is pure in God's eye, who abhors sin. 'I hate 
    every false way' (Psalm 119:104). This is excellent indeed, because now the
    <i>love </i>of sin is crucified. A hypocrite may leave sin—yet love it; as 
    the serpent sheds her coat—yet keeps her sting. But when a man can say he 
    abhors sin—now is sin killed in the root. A pure heart abstains from sin—as 
    a man does from a dish that he has an antipathy against. This is a sign of a 
    new nature—when a man hates what he once loved! And because he hates sin, 
    therefore he fights against it with the 'sword of the Spirit'—as a man who 
    hates a serpent seeks the destruction of it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A pure heart avoids the appearance of evil.</p></b></font> 
    'Abstain from all <i>appearance </i>of evil' (1 Thessalonians 5:22). A pure 
    heart avoids that which may be interpreted as evil. He who is loyal to his 
    prince, not only forbears to have his hand in treason—but he takes heed of 
    that which has an <i>appearance</i> of treason. A gracious heart is shy of 
    that which looks like sin. When Joseph's mistress took hold of him and said, 
    'Lie with me!'—he left his garment in her hand and fled from her (Genesis 
    39:12). He avoided the appearance of evil. He would not be seen in her 
    company. Thus a pure heart avoids whatever may have the <i>suspicion of sin</i>:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] A pure heart avoids the suspicion of sin—in regard of 
    HIMSELF</p></b></font>, and that two ways. 
<p align="justify">First, because the <i>appearance </i>of evil is 
    oftentimes an <i>occasion </i>of evil. <i>Dalliance </i>is an appearance of 
    evil, and many times occasions evil. Had Joseph been familiar with his 
    mistress in a wanton sporting manner, he might in time have been drawn to 
    commit immorality with her. Some out of novelty and curiosity have gone to 
    hear mass, and afterwards have lent the idol not only their <i>ear—</i>but 
    their <i>knee</i>! There are many who have gone with itching ears to hear 
    false teachers, and have come home with the plague in their head! When Dinah 
    would be gadding about, she lost her chastity (Genesis 34:2). A pure heart 
    foreseeing the danger avoids the appearance of evil. It is dangerous to go 
    near a hornet's nest. The men who went near the furnace were burned (Daniel 
    3:22). </p>
<p align="justify">Second, because the appearance of evil may eclipse his 
    good name. A good name is a precious ointment. It is better than 'fine gold' 
    (Proverbs 22:1). It commends us to God and angels, which riches cannot do. 
    Now a godly man avoids the appearance of evil—lest he wounds his good name. 
    What comfort can there be of life, when the name lies buried?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] A pure heart avoids the suspicion of sin—out of 
    reverence and respect to the holiness of GOD. </p></b></font>God hates the very 
    appearance of evil. God abhors hypocrites because they have no more than the 
    appearance of <i>good</i>—and he is angry with his children if they have so 
    much as the appearance of <i>evil</i>. A gracious heart knows God is a 
    jealous God and cannot endure that his people should border upon sin. 
    Therefore he keeps aloof from sin, and will not come near the smell of 
    infection.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] A pure heart avoids the very appearance of sin—in 
    regard of the GODLY.</p></b></font> The appearance of evil may scandalize a weak 
    brother. A gracious heart is not only fearful lest he should defile his own 
    conscience—but lest he should offend his brother's conscience. Were it only 
    an <i>indifferent </i>thing—yet if it is an appearance of evil and may 
    grieve another—we are to forbear (1 Corinthians 10:25-28). For 'when we sin 
    against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, we sin against Christ' 
    (1 Corinthians 8:12). The weak Christian is a member of Christ. Therefore 
    the sinning against a member—is a sinning against Christ.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] A pure heart avoids the very appearance of evil—in 
    regard of the WICKED.</p></b></font> The apostle would have us walk wisely 
    towards unbelievers. (1 Thessalonians 4:12). The wicked watch for our 
    halting. How glad would they be of anything to reproach religion! Professors 
    are placed as stars in the highest orb of the church, and if there is but 
    the appearance of any eccentric, or irregular motion, the wicked would 
    presently open their mouths with a fresh cry against piety. Now to a godly 
    heart the fame and honor of the gospel is so dear that he had rather die 
    than incriminate or eclipse it. 
<p align="justify">By this then let us try ourselves whether we are pure in 
    heart—do we avoid the least appearance of sin? Alas, how many run themselves 
    into the occasions of sin! <i>They tempt the devil to tempt them! </i>Some 
    go to plays and comedies—the very fuel and temptation to lust! Others 
    frequent heretical meetings, and truly God often in just judgment leaves 
    them to the acts of sin, who do not avoid the appearance of sin. 'They were 
    mingled among the heathen and learned their works' (Psalm 106:35). Pure 
    hearts flee the occasion of sin! John would not endure the company of the 
    heretic Cerinthus. Polycarp would have no conference with Marcion the 
    heretic—but called him 'the devil's firstborn'. Basil says that the 
    Christians in his time avoided the meetings of heretics as the 'very schools 
    of error'. Oh, avoid the appearance of evil. The apostle bids us to follow 
    those things which are 'of good report' (Philippians 4:8).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A pure heart performs holy duties in a holy manner.</p></b></font> 
    This holy manner, or due order, consists in three things:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Preparing the heart <i>before </i>a duty.</p></b></font> 
    An unholy heart does not care how it rushes upon an ordinance. It comes 
    without preparation and goes away without profit. The pure heart is a 
    prepared heart. It dresses itself, before it comes to a duty—by examination 
    and prayer. When the earth is prepared—then it is fit to receive the seed. 
    When the instrument is prepared and tuned—then it is fit for music.
<p align="justify"></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Watching the heart <i>in </i>a duty. </p></b></font>A 
    holy heart labors to be affected and wrought upon by the Spirit. His heart 
    burns within him. There was no sacrifice without fire. A pure saint labors 
    to have his heart broken in a duty (Psalm 51:17). The incense, when it was 
    broken, cast the sweetest savor. Impure souls care not in what a dead or 
    perfunctory manner they serve God (Ezekiel 33:31). They pray more out of <i>
    fashion, </i>than out of <i>faith</i>. They are no more affected with an 
    ordinance, than the dead in the church graveyard. God complains of offering 
    up the <i>blind </i>(Malachi 1:8). And is it not as bad to offer up the <i>
    dead?</i> O Christian, say to yourself, How can this <i>deadness </i>of 
    heart, stand with <i>pureness </i>of heart? Do not dead things putrefy?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Outward reverence. </p></b></font>Purity of heart will 
    express itself by the reverend posture of the body—the lifting up of the eye 
    and hand, the bending the knee. When God gave the law, 'the mount was on 
    fire and trembled' (Exodus 19:18). The reason was that the people might 
    prostrate themselves more reverently before the Lord. The ark wherein the 
    law was put, was carried upon poles, so that the Levites might not touch 
    it—to show what reverence God would have about holy things (Exodus 25:11, 
    14). We must not only offer up our <i>souls</i>—but our <i>bodies </i>
    (Romans 12:1). The Lord takes notice what posture and gesture we use in his 
    worship. If a man were to deliver a petition to the king, would he deliver 
    it with a foolish jest? The careless irreverence of some would make us think 
    they did not much regard whether God heard them or not. We are run from one 
    extreme to another, from superstition to irreverence. Let Christians think 
    of the dreadful majesty of God who is present. 'How dreadful is this place! 
    This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven!' 
    (Genesis 28:17). The blessed angels 'cover their faces crying, Holy, holy 
    holy' (Isaiah 6:3). A holy heart will have a holy posture.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A pure heart will have a pure LIFE.</p></b></font> 'Let us 
    cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting 
    holiness in the fear of God'. (2 Corinthians 7:1). Where there is a holy 
    heart, there will be a holy life. Some bless God they have good hearts—but 
    their lives are evil. 'There is a generation that are pure in their own 
    eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness' (Proverbs 30:12). If the 
    stream is corrupt—we may suspect the spring-head to be impure. Aaron was 
    called the saint of the Lord (Psalm 106:16). He had not only a holy 
    heart—but there was a golden plate on his forehead on which was written 
    'Holiness to the Lord'. Purity must not only be woven into the heart—but 
    engraved upon the life! Grace is most beautiful when it shines abroad with 
    its golden beams. The clock has not only its motion within—but the hand 
    moves outside upon the dial. Just so, pureness of <i>heart</i>, shows itself 
    upon the dial of the <i>life</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] A pure soul TALKS of God </p></b></font>(Psalm 37:30). 
    His heart is seen in his tongue. He who is pure in heart—his mouth is full 
    of heaven.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] A pure soul WALKS with God</p></b></font> (Genesis 6:9). 
    He is still doing angel's work, praising God, serving God. He lives as 
    Christ did upon earth. Holy duties are the Jacob's ladder by which he is 
    still ascending to heaven. Purity of <i>heart </i>and <i>life</i>, are in 
    Scripture made twins. 'I will put my Spirit within you'—there is purity of
    <i>heart</i>. 'And cause you to walk in my statutes'—there is purity of <i>
    life</i> (Ezekiel 36:27). Shall we account them pure, whose life is not in 
    heaven (Philippians 3:20)—but rather in hell? 'Shall I count them pure—who 
    have wicked balances and a bag of deceitful weights?' (Micah 6:11). How 
    justly may others reproach religion when they see it kicked down with our 
    unholy feet! A pure heart has a golden frontispiece. Grace, like new wine, 
    will have vent; it can be no more concealed than lost. The saints are called 
    'jewels' (Malachi 3:17), because of that shining luster which they cast in 
    the eyes of others!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. A pure heart is so in love with purity that nothing 
    can draw him off from it.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Let others reproach purity, he loves it.</p></b></font> 
    As David, when he danced before the ark, and Michal scoffed. David replied, 
    'if this is to be vile—I will yet be more vile!' (2 Samuel 6:22). So says a 
    pure heart: 'If to follow after holiness is to be vile—I will yet be more 
    vile!' The more others deride holiness, the more a gracious soul burns in 
    love and zeal to it. If a man had an inheritance befallen him, would he be 
    laughed out of it? What is a Christian the worse for another's reproach? A 
    blind man's disparaging a diamond does not make it sparkle the less!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Let others <i>persecute </i>holiness, a pure heart 
    will <i>pursue </i>it. </p></b></font>Holiness is the queen every gracious soul 
    is espoused to—and he will rather die than be divorced. Paul would be holy, 
    'though bonds and persecutions awaited him' (Acts 20:23). The way of 
    religion is often thorny and bloody—but a gracious heart prefers inward 
    purity before outward peace. I have heard of one who, having a jewel he much 
    prized, the king sent for his jewel. 'Tell the king' (says he) 'I honor his 
    Majesty—but I will rather lose my life than part with my jewel.' He who is 
    enriched with the jewel of holiness, will rather die than part with this 
    jewel. When his honor and riches will do him no good—his holiness will end 
    in bliss, 'You have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life'.

<p align="justify">Let me persuade Christians to heart purity. </p></b></font>
    The harlot 'wipes her <i>mouth</i>' (Proverbs 30:20). But that is not 
    enough. 'Wash your <i>heart</i>, O Jerusalem' (Jeremiah 4:14). And here I 
    shall lay down some <b>arguments or motives to persuade to heart purity</b>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The NECESSITY of heart-purity.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Heart-purity is necessary, in respect of OURSELVES.
    </p></b></font>Until the heart is pure, all our <i>holy things </i>(that is, our 
    religious duties) are polluted. They are but <i>splendid sins! </i>
    'Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to 
    those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences 
    are defiled' (Titus 1:15). Their offering is unclean. Under the law, if a 
    man who was unclean by a dead body, and carried a piece of holy meat, the 
    holy meat could not cleanse him—but the dead body polluted that. (Haggai 
    2:12,13). He who had the leprosy, whatever he touched was unclean. If he had 
    touched the altar or sacrifice, the altar would not cleanse him—but he would 
    defiled the altar. <i>A filthy hand defiles the purest water. </i>An impure 
    heart defiles all religious duties—he drops poison upon them all. A pure 
    stream running through muddy ground, is polluted. Just so, the holiest 
    duties, running through an impure heart, are polluted. A sinner's works are 
    called 'dead works' (Hebrews 6:1). And those works which are dead cannot 
    please God. A dead wife cannot please her husband.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Heart purity is necessary, in respect of GOD.</p></b></font> 
    God is holy. Purity is the chief robe with which God adorns himself. 'You 
    are of purer eyes than to behold evil' (Habakkuk 1:13). And will this holy 
    God endure to have an impure heart come near him? Will a man lay a viper in 
    his bosom! The holy God and the unrepentant sinner, cannot dwell together. 
    None can dwell together but friends—but there is no friendship between God 
    and the sinner, both of them being of a contrary judgment and disposition. 
    An impure heart is more odious to God than a serpent! God gave the serpent 
    its venom—but Satan fills the heart with sin. 'Satan has filled your heart!' 
    (Acts 5:3). The Lord abhors a sinner. He will not come near him, having his 
    plague-sores running. 'My soul loathed them!' (Zechariah 11:8).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Heart purity is necessary, in regard of ANGELS.</p></b></font> 
    They are pure creatures. The Cherubim, which typified the angels, were made 
    of <i>fine gold </i>to denote the purity of their essence. No unholy thought 
    enters into the angels, therefore there must be purity of heart that there 
    may be some resemblance between us and them. What would unholy hearts do, 
    among those pure angelic spirits?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Heart purity is necessary, in regard of the GLORIFIED 
    SAINTS.</p></b></font> They are pure, being refined from all the dregs of sin. 
    They are 'spirits of just men made <i>perfect</i>' (Hebrews 12:23). Now what 
    would <i>profane </i>spirits do among 'spirits made perfect'? I tell you, if 
    you who wallow in your sins, could come near God and angels and spirits of 
    men made perfect, and have a sight of their luster—you would soon wish 
    yourselves out of their company. As a man who is dirty and in his rags, if 
    he should stand before the king and his nobles and see them glistening in 
    their cloth of gold and sparkling with their jewels—he would be ashamed of 
    himself, and wish himself out of their presence.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] Heart purity is necessary, in regard of HEAVEN. </p></b>
</font>Heaven is a pure place. It is an 'undefiled inheritance' (1 Peter 
    1:4). <i>No unclean beasts come into the heavenly ark! </i>'Nothing evil 
    will be allowed to enter!' (Revelation 21:27). The Lord will not put the new 
    wine of glory, into a musty impure heart! All these things considered, shows 
    the necessity of heart purity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is the will of God that we should be pure in heart.
    </p></b></font>'This is the will of God—your sanctification' (1 Thessalonians 
    4:3). Are you low in the world? Perhaps it is not the will of God that you 
    should be <i>rich</i>. But it is the will of God that you should be <i>holy</i>. 
    'This is the will of God—your sanctification.' Let God have his will by 
    being <i>holy</i>—and you shall have your will by being <i>happy</i>. God's 
    will must either be fulfilled <i>by </i>us or <i>upon </i>us!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Purity of heart is the characteristic note of God's 
    people. </p></b></font>'God is good to Israel—to those whose hearts are pure' 
    (Psalm 73:1). <i>Heart-purity </i>denominates us, the 'Israel of God'. It is 
    not <i>profession </i>which makes us the Israel of God. 'Not all who are 
    descended from Israel, are Israel' (Romans 9:6). Purity of heart is the 
    jewel which is hung only upon the elect! Chastity distinguishes a virtuous 
    woman from a harlot. Just so, the true Christian is distinguished from the 
    hypocrite--by his heart-purity. This is like the nobleman's star, which is a 
    peculiar ensign of honor, differing him from the vulgar. When the bright 
    star of purity shines in a Christian's heart, it distinguishes him from a 
    formal professor.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Purity of heart makes us like God. </p></b></font>It was 
    Adam's unhappiness once, that he aspired to be like God in omniscience; but 
    we must endeavor to be like God in sanctity. God's image consists in 
    holiness. To those who do not have this image and superscription upon them, 
    he will say 'I never knew you!' God delights in no heart but where he may 
    see his own face and likeness. You cannot see your face in a looking-glass 
    when it is dusty. God's face cannot be seen in a dusty impure soul. A pure 
    heart (like a clean looking-glass) gives forth some idea and representation 
    of God. There is little comfort in being like God in other things besides 
    purity. Are we like God in that we have a <i>being</i>? So have stones. Are 
    we like him in that we have <i>motion</i>? So have stars. Are we like him in 
    that we have <i>life</i>? So have trees and birds. Are we like him in that 
    we have <i>knowledge</i>? So have devils. There is no likeness to God, which 
    will prove comfortable and blissful—but our being like him in purity. God 
    loves the pure in heart. Love is founded upon likeness.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The excellency of the heart, lies in the purity of it.</p></b></font> 
    Purity was the glory of the soul in innocence. The purer a thing is—the 
    better. The purer the <i>air </i>is, and the more free from noxious 
    vapors—the better it is. Pure<i> water</i> is most sweet. The purer the <i>
    gold </i>is, the more valuable. The purer the <i>wine </i>is when it is 
    taken off from the lees and dregs—the more excellent it is. The more the 
    soul is purified by grace and taken off from the lees and dregs of sin—the 
    more precious in God's eyes. The purer the heart is—the more spiritual it 
    is; and the more spiritual it is—the more fit to entertain him who is pure 
    Spirit.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. God is good to the pure in heart. </p></b></font>'God is
    <i>good </i>to Israel—to those whose hearts are pure' (Psalm 73:1). We all 
    desire that God should be good to us. It is the sick man's prayer, 'May the 
    Lord be good to me'. God is good to those whose hearts are pure. But how is 
    God good to them? Two ways—
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] To those who are pure, all things are sanctified. </p></b>
</font>'To the pure—all things are pure' (Titus 1:15). Estate is sanctified, 
    relations are sanctified—just as the temple sanctified the gold and the 
    altar sanctified the offering. To the unclean--nothing is clean. Their <i>
    table </i>is a snare; and their <i>devotions </i>are sin. There is a curse 
    entailed upon a wicked man (Deuteronomy 28:15-20)—but holiness removes the 
    curse and cuts off the punishment. 'To the pure all things are pure'.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The pure-hearted have all things work for their good
    </p></b></font>(Romans 8:28). Mercies and afflictions shall turn to their good. 
    The most poisonous drug shall be <i>medicinal</i>. The most cross providence 
    shall carry on the design of their salvation. Who then would not be pure in 
    heart? 'God is good to those who are pure in heart'.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Heart purity makes way for heaven.</p></b></font> The pure 
    in heart 'shall see God'. Happiness is nothing but the quintessence of 
    holiness. Purity of heart is heaven begun in a man. Holiness is called in 
    Scripture 'the anointing of God' (1 John 2:27). Solomon was first anointed 
    with the holy oil, and then he was made king (1 Kings 1:39). Just so, the 
    people of God are first anointed with the oil of the Spirit and made pure in 
    heart, and then the crown of glory is set upon their head. And is not purity 
    to be highly valued? It lays a path for glory. 'Purity of heart' and 'seeing 
    of God' are linked together.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Note the examples of those who have been eminent for 
    heart-purity.</p></b></font> The Lord Jesus was a pattern of purity. 'Who of you 
    convicts me of sin?' (John 8:46). In this we are to imitate Christ. We are 
    not to imitate him in raising the dead or in working miracles—but in being 
    holy (1 Peter 1:16). 
<p align="justify">Besides this golden pattern of Christ, we are to write 
    after the fair copy of those saints who have been of a dove-like purity. <i>
    David </i>was so pure in heart, that he was a man 'after God's heart'. <i>
    Abraham </i>was so purified by faith that he was one of God's 
    cabinet-counsel (Genesis 18:17). <i>Moses </i>was so holy that God spoke 
    with him face to face. What were the rest of the patriarchs but so many 
    plants of renown, flourishing in holiness? The fathers in the primitive 
    church were exemplary for purity. Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, Augustine, they 
    were so inlaid and adorned with purity, that envy itself could not tax them. 
    We wish we had such saints as were in the primitive times, so just were they 
    in their dealings, so decent in their attire, so true in their promises, so 
    devout in their religion, so unblamable in their lives, that they were <b>
    living sermons, walking Bibles, genuine pictures of Christ</b>, and helped 
    to keep up the credit of godliness in the world.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Heart-purity is the only jewel you can carry out of 
    the world. </p></b></font>Have you a child you delight in, or an estate? You can 
    'carry nothing out of the world' (1 Timothy 6:7). Purity of heart is the 
    only commodity that can be with comfort transported. This is that which will 
    stay longest with you. Usually we love those things which last longest. We 
    prize a diamond or piece of gold above the most beautiful flower, because 
    the flower is fading. Heart-purity has perpetuity! It will go with us beyond 
    the grave!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">But how shall we attain to heart-purity?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Often look into the Word of God.</p></b></font> 'Now you 
    are clean, through the word' (John 15:3). 'Your word is very pure' (Psalm 
    119:140). God's Word is pure, not only for the <i>matter </i>of it—but the
    <i>effect</i> of it, because it makes us pure. 'Sanctify them through your 
    truth; your word is truth' (John 17:17). By looking into this pure 
    crystal—we are changed into the image of it. <b>The Word is both a <i>
    looking-glass </i>to show us the spots of our souls—and a <i>laver </i>to 
    wash them away!</b> The Word breathes nothing but purity; it enlightens the 
    mind; it consecrates the heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Go to the bath.</p></b></font> There are two baths 
    Christians should wash in.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The bath of tears. </p></b></font>Go into this bath. 
    Peter had sullied and defiled himself with sin and he washed himself with 
    penitential tears. Mary Magdalene, who was an impure sinner, 'stood at 
    Jesus' feet weeping' (Luke 7:38). <i>Mary's tears washed her heart--as well 
    as Christ's feet! </i>Oh sinners, let your eyes be a fountain of tears! Weep 
    for those sins which are so many as have passed all arithmetic. This water 
    of contrition is healing and purifying.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The bath of Christ's blood.</p></b></font> This is that 
    'fountain opened for sin and uncleanness' (Zechariah 13:1).<i> A soul 
    steeped in the brinish tears of repentance and bathed in the blood of Christ 
    is made pure.</i> This is that 'spiritual washing'. All the legal washings 
    and purifications were but types and emblems representing Christ's blood. 
    This blood whitens the black soul.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Get faith. </p></b></font>It is a soul-cleansing grace. 
    'Having purified their hearts by faith' (Acts 15:9). The woman in the gospel 
    who but touched the hem of Christ's garment was healed. A touch of faith 
    heals. If I believe Christ and all his merits are mine, how can I sin 
    against him? We do not willingly injure those friends who, we believe, love 
    us. Nothing can have a greater force and efficacy upon the heart to make it 
    pure, than faith. Faith will remove mountains, the mountains of pride, lust, 
    envy. Faith and the love of sin are incompatible.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Breathe after the Spirit. </p></b></font>He is called the
    <i>Holy </i>Spirit (Ephesians 1:13). He purifies the heart as lightning 
    purifies the air. That we may see what a purifying virtue the Spirit has, he 
    is compared to various things:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The Spirit is compared to FIRE </p></b></font>(Acts 2:3). 
    Fire is of a purifying nature. It refines and cleans metals. It separates 
    the dross from the gold. The Spirit of God in the heart refines and 
    sanctifies it. He burns up the dross of sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The Spirit is compared to WIND.</p></b></font> 'There 
    came a sound from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind, and they were all 
    filled with the Holy Spirit' (Acts 2:24). The wind purifies the air. When 
    the air by reason of foggy vapors is unwholesome, the wind is a fan to 
    winnow and purify it. Thus when the vapors of sin arise in the heart—vapors 
    of pride and covetousness, earthly vapors—the Spirit of God arises and blows 
    upon the soul and purges away these impure vapors. The spouse in the 
    Canticles prays for a gale of the Spirit, that she might be made pure 
    (4:16).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The Spirit is compared to WATER.</p></b></font> 'He who 
    believes on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water; but this 
    spoke he of the Spirit' (John 7:38, 39). The Spirit is like water, not only 
    to make the soul <i>fruitful</i>, for it causes the desert to blossom as the 
    rose (Isaiah 32:15; 35:1)—but the Spirit is like water to <i>purify</i>. 
    Whereas, before, the heart of a sinner was unclean and whatever he touched 
    had a tincture of impurity (Numbers 19:22), when once the Spirit comes into 
    the heart, with his continual showers, he washes off the filthiness of it, 
    making it pure and fit for God to dwell in.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Take heed of close converse and fellowship with the 
    wicked.</p></b></font> One vain mind makes another vain. One hard heart makes 
    another. The stone in the <i>body </i>is not infectious—but the stone in the
    <i>heart </i>is. One profane person poisons another. Beware of the society 
    of the wicked.
<p align="justify">Some may object: But what hurt is in this? Did not Jesus 
    converse with sinners? (Luke 5:29).</p>
<p align="justify">[1] There was a necessity for that. If Jesus had not come 
    among sinners, how could any have been saved? He went among sinners—but not 
    to join with them in their sins. He was not a <i>companion </i>of 
    sinners—but a <i>physician </i>of sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] Though Christ did converse with sinners, he could not 
    be polluted with their sin. His divine nature was a sufficient antidote to 
    preserve him from infection. Christ could be no more defiled with their 
    sin—than the sun is defiled by shining on a dunghill. Sin could no more 
    stick on Christ—than a burr on a crystal. The soil of his heart was so 
    pure—that no viper of sin could breed there. But the case is altered with 
    us. We have a storehouse of corruption within, and the least thing will 
    increase this storehouse. Therefore it is dangerous mingling ourselves among 
    the wicked. If we would be pure in heart—let us shun their society. He who 
    would preserve his garment clean, avoids the dirt. The wicked are as the 
    mire (Isaiah 57:20). The <i>fresh </i>waters running among the <i>salt </i>
    waters, taste brackish.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. If you would be pure, walk with those who are pure.
    </p></b></font>As the communion of the saints is in our <i>Creed</i>, so it 
    should be in our <i>company</i>. 'He who walks with the wise, shall be wise' 
    (Proverbs 13:20), and he who walks with the pure, shall be pure. The saints 
    are like a bed of spices. By intermixing ourselves with them we shall 
    partake of their savouriness. <i>Association </i>begets <i>assimilation</i>. 
    Sometimes God blesses godly society, to the conversion of others.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Wait at the posts of wisdom's doors. </p></b></font>
    Reverence the Word preached. The Word of God sucked in by faith (Hebrews 
    4:2) transforms the heart into the likeness of it (Romans 6:17). The Word is 
    a holy seed (James 1:18), which being cast into the heart makes it partake 
    of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Pray for heart purity. </p></b></font>Job propounds the 
    question, 'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?' (Job 14:4; 
    15:14). God can do it. Out of an impure heart—he can produce grace. Pray 
    that prayer of David, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God' (Psalm 51:10). 
    Most men pray more for full purses, than pure hearts. We should pray for 
    heart-purity fervently. It is a matter we are most nearly concerned in. 
    'Without holiness no man shall see the Lord' (Hebrews 12:14). Our prayer 
    must be with sighs and groans (Romans 8:23-26). There must not only be <i>
    elocution </i>but <i>affection</i>. Jacob <i>wrestled </i>in prayer (Genesis 
    32:24). Hannah poured out her soul (1 Samuel 1:15). We often pray so coldly 
    (our petitions even freezing between our lips), as if we would teach God to 
    deny our prayers. We pray as if we did not care whether God heard us or not!
    
<p align="justify">Oh Christian, be <i>earnest </i>with God for a pure 
    heart! Lay your heart before the Lord and say, "Lord, You who have given me 
    a heart, give me a pure heart. My heart is good for nothing as it is. It 
    defiles everything it touches. Lord, I am not fit to live with this 
    heart—for I cannot honor you; nor fit to die with it—for I cannot see you. 
    Oh purge me with hyssop. Let Christ's blood be sprinkled upon me. Let the 
    Holy Spirit descend upon me. 'Create in me a clean heart, O God'. You who

<p align="justify">1. In this life</p></b></font>; that is, spiritually by the
    <i>eye of faith</i>. Faith sees God's glorious attributes in the 
    looking-glass of his Word. Faith beholds him showing forth himself through 
    the lattice of his ordinances. Thus Moses saw him who was invisible (Hebrews 
    11:27). Believers see God's glory as it were—<i>veiled over</i>. They behold 
    his 'back parts' (Exodus 33:23).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. In the life to come</p></b></font>; and this glorious 
    sight is meant in the text, 'They shall see God.' A glorious prospect! This 
    divines call 'the beatific vision'. At that day the <i>veil </i>will be 
    pulled off, and God will show himself in all his glory to the soul, just as 
    a king on a day of coronation, shows himself in all his royalty and 
    magnificence. This sight of God, will be <i>the heaven of heaven</i>. We 
    shall indeed have a sight of angels, and that will be sweet—but the <i>
    quintessence </i>of happiness and the <i>diamond </i>in the ring will be 
    this—'We shall see God!' It would be <i>night </i>in heaven, if the Sun of 
    Righteousness did not shine there. It is the king's presence, which makes 
    the court. Absalom counted himself <i>half-alive</i>, unless he might see 
    the king's face (2 Samuel 14:32). 
<p align="justify">'Blessed are the pure in heart—for they shall see God!' 
    This sight of God in glory is, first, partly <b>mental </b>and intellectual. 
    We shall see him with the eyes of our mind. </p>
<p align="justify">But second, it is partly physical; not that we can with 
    bodily eyes behold the bright essence of God. Indeed, some erroneously held 
    that God had a visible shape and figure. As man was made in God's image, so 
    they thought that God was made in man's image; but God is a Spirit (John 
    4:24), and being a Spirit, he is invisible (1 Timothy 1:17). He cannot be 
    beheld by bodily eyes. 'Whom no man <i>has </i>seen, nor <i>can </i>see' (1 
    Timothy 6:16). A sight of his glory would overwhelm us. This wine is too 
    strong for our weak heads.</p>
<p align="justify">But when I say our seeing of God in heaven is physical, 
    my meaning is that we shall with bodily eyes behold Jesus Christ, through 
    whom the glory of God, his wisdom, holiness, and mercy, shall shine forth to 
    the soul. Put a back of steel to the glass—and you may see a face in it. So 
    the human nature of Christ is as it were a back of steel through which we 
    may see the glory of God (2 Corinthians 4:6). In this sense that scripture 
    is to be understood, 'With these eyes shall I see God' (Job 19:26, 27).</p>
<p align="justify">Now concerning this blessed sight of God, it is so 
    sublime and sweet, that I can only draw a <i>dark shadow </i>of it. We shall 
    better understand it—when we come to heaven. At present I shall lay down 
    these <font color="#0000ff"><b>nine MAXIMS</b></font> <font color="#0000ff">
<b>concerning this beatific vision.</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Our sight of God in heaven shall be a CLEAR sight. </p></b>
</font>Here we see him 'through a glass darkly' (1 Corinthians 13:12). But 
    through Christ we shall behold God in a very illustrious manner. God will 
    unveil himself and show forth his glory—so far as the soul is capable to 
    receive. If Adam had not sinned, it is probable that he would never have had 
    such a clear sight of God—as the saints in glory shall have. 'We shall see 
    him as he is' (1 John 3:2). Now we see him as he is not. There we shall see 
    him 'as he is' in a very <i>clear </i>manner. 'Then shall I know—even as 
    also I am known' (1 Corinthians 13:12), that is, 'clearly'. Does not God 
    know us clearly and fully? Then shall the saints know him (according to 
    their capacity) as they are known. As their <i>love </i>to God, so their <i>
    sight </i>of God—shall be perfect.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. This sight of God will be a TRANSCENDENT sight. </p></b>
</font>It will surpass in glory. Such glittering beams shall sparkle forth 
    from the Lord Jesus, as shall infinitely amaze and delight the eyes of the 
    beholders! Imagine what a blessed sight it will be, to see Christ wearing 
    the robe of our human nature and to see that nature sitting in glory above 
    the angels. If God is so beautiful here in his ordinances, Word, prayer, 
    sacraments; if there is such excellency in him when we see him by the <i>eye 
    of faith </i>through the telescope of a promise, O what will it be when we 
    shall see him 'face to face'! 
<p align="justify">When Christ was transfigured on the mount, he was full of 
    glory (Matthew 17:2). If his <i>transfiguration </i>was so glorious, what 
    will his <i>exaltation </i>be! What a glorious time will it be when (as it 
    was said of Mordecai) we shall see him in the presence of his Father, 
    'arrayed in royal apparel, and with a great crown of gold upon his head' 
    (Esther 8:15). This will be glory beyond hyperbole! If the sun were ten 
    thousand times brighter than it is—it could not so much as shadow out this 
    glory. In the heavenly horizon we behold beauty in its first magnitude and 
    highest elevation. There we shall 'see the king in his glory' (Isaiah 
    33:17). All lights are but <i>eclipses, </i>compared with that glorious 
    vision. Apelles' pencil could but blot it; angels' tongues could but 
    dishonor it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. This sight of God will be a TRANSFORMING sight. </p></b>
</font>'We shall be <i>like </i>him' (1 John 3:2). The saints shall be 
    changed into glory. As when the light springs into a dark room, the room may 
    be said to be changed from what it was; the saints shall so see God—as to be
    <i>changed </i>into his image! (Psalm 17:15). Here on earth, God's people 
    are blackened and sullied with infirmities—but in heaven they shall be as 
    the dove covered with silver wings. They shall have some rays and beams of 
    God's glory shining in them. The crystal, by having the sun shine on it, 
    sparkles and looks like the sun. Just so, the saints by beholding the 
    brightness of God's glory shall have a <i>tincture </i>of that glory upon 
    them. Not that they shall partake of God's very essence, for as the iron in 
    the fire becomes fire—yet remains iron still, so the saints by beholding the 
    luster of God's majesty shall be <i>glorious </i>creatures—but yet <i>
    creatures </i>still.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. This sight of God will be a JOYFUL sight</p></b></font>. 
    'You shall make me glad with the light of your countenance' (Acts 2:28). 
    After a sharp winter, how pleasant will it be to see the Sun of 
    Righteousness displaying himself in all his glory! Does faith breed joy? 
    'Even though you do not see him now, you <i>believe </i>in him and are 
    filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy' (1 Peter 1:8). If the <i>joy 
    of faith </i>is such, what will the <i>joy of vision </i>be! The sight of 
    Christ will amaze the eye with wonder, and ravish the heart with joy. If the 
    face of a friend whom we entirely love so affects us and drives away 
    sorrow—O how cheering will the sight of God be to the saints in heaven! Then 
    indeed it may be said, 'Your heart shall rejoice!' (John 16:22). There are 
    two things which will make the saints' vision of God in heaven joyful.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Through Jesus Christ, the dread and terror of the 
    divine essence shall be taken away.</p></b></font> Majesty shall appear in God 
    to preserve reverence—but however, it will be a majesty clothed with beauty 
    and tempered with sweetness, to excite joy in the saints. We shall see God 
    as a friend, not as guilty Adam did, who was afraid, and hid himself 
    (Genesis 3:10)—but as Queen Esther looked upon King Ahasuerus holding forth 
    the golden scepter (Esther 5:2). Surely this sight of God will <i>not </i>be 
    dreadful, but delightful!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The saints shall not only have vision, but <i>
    fruition</i>.</p></b></font> They shall so see God, as to <i>enjoy </i>him. True 
    blessedness lies partly in the <i>understanding</i>—by seeing the glory of 
    God richly displayed; and partly in the <i>will</i>—by a sweet delicious 
    taste of it and acquiescence of the soul in it. We shall so <i>see </i>
    God—as to <i>love </i>him—and so love him as to be <i>filled </i>with him. 
    The seeing of God implies fruition. '<i>Enter </i>into the joy of your Lord' 
    (Matthew 25:21) not only <i>behold </i>it—but <i>enter </i>into it. 'In your 
    light we shall <i>see </i>light' (Psalm 36:9); there is vision. 'At your 
    right hand there are <i>pleasures </i>for evermore' (Psalm 16:11); there is 
    fruition. So great is the joy which flows from the sight of God—as will make 
    the saints break forth into triumphant praises and hallelujahs.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. This sight of God will be a SATISFYING sight.</p></b></font> 
    Cast <i>three worlds </i>into the heart, and they will not fill it—but the 
    sight of God satisfies! 'I shall be satisfied when I awake with your 
    likeness' (Psalm 17:15). Solomon says 'The eye is <i>never </i>satisfied 
    with seeing' (Ecclesiastes 1:8). But there the eye <i>will </i>be satisfied 
    with seeing. God, and nothing but God, can satisfy. The saints shall have 
    their <i>heads </i>so full of knowledge, and their <i>hearts </i>so full of 
    joy—that they shall have no lack.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. This sight of God will be an UNWEARYING sight.</p></b></font> 
    Let a man see the rarest sight that is—he will soon be cloyed. When he comes 
    into a garden and sees delightful walks, lovely arbours, pleasant flowers, 
    within a little while he grows weary; but it is not so in heaven. There is 
    no cloying there. We shall never be weary of seeing God, for the divine 
    essence being infinite, there shall be every moment new and fresh delights 
    springing forth from God into the glorified soul! The soul shall be full and 
    satisfied—yet still desire more of God. So sweet will God be—that the more 
    the saints behold God—the more they will be ravished with desire and 
    delight!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. This sight of God will be a BENEFICIAL sight. </p></b>
</font>It will tend to the bettering and advantaging of the soul. Some 
    colors, while they delight the eyes, hurt them. But this knowledge and 
    vision of God, shall better the soul and tend to its infinite happiness. 
    Eve's looking upon the tree of knowledge, was harmful to her. But the saints 
    can receive no detriment from the eternal beholding of God's glory. This 
    sight will be beneficial. The soul will never be in its perfection, until it 
    comes to <i>see </i>God. This will be the crowning blessing.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. This sight of God shall be PERPETUAL.</p></b></font> Here 
    we see objects awhile, and then our eyes grow dim and we need eye-glasses. 
    But the saints shall <i>always </i>behold God. As there shall be no cloud 
    upon God's face, so the saints shall have no mote in their eye. Their sight 
    shall never grow dim—but they shall be to all eternity looking on God, that 
    beautiful and delightful object! O what a soul-ravishing sight will this be! 
    God must make us able to bear it. We can no more endure a sight of <i>glory</i>—than 
    a sight of <i>wrath</i>. But the saints in heaven, shall have their 
    capacities enlarged, and they shall be made fit to receive the delightful 
    beams of divine glory!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. This sight of God will be an IMMEDIATE sight. </p></b>
</font>There are some who deny that the soul is immediately after death 
    admitted to the sight of God—but I assert that the saints shall have an 
    immediate transition and passage from <i>death </i>to <i>glory</i>. As soon 
    as death has closed their eyes—they shall see God. If the soul is not 
    immediately after death translated to the beatific vision—then what becomes 
    of the soul in that period of time, until the resurrection?
<p align="justify">Does the soul go into <i>torment</i>? That cannot be, for 
    the soul of a believer is a member of Christ's mystical body, and if this 
    soul should go to hell—a member of Christ might be for a time damned. But 
    that is impossible.</p>
<p align="justify">Does the soul <i>sleep </i>in the body as some drowsily 
    imagine? How then shall we make good sense of that scripture 'We are willing 
    rather to be absent from the body—and to be <i>present with the Lord'</i>?<i>
</i>(2 Corinthians 5:8) If the soul at death is absent from the body, then 
    it cannot sleep in the body.</p>
<p align="justify">Does the soul <i>die? </i>It appears that the soul of a 
    believer after death, goes immediately to God. '<i>This day </i>shall you be
    <i>with me </i>in paradise' (Luke 23:43). That word 'with me' shows clearly 
    that the thief on the cross was translated to heaven. For there Christ was 
    (Ephesians 4:10). And the word 'this day' shows that the thief on the cross 
    had an immediate passage from the cross to paradise. Therefore, the souls of 
    believers have an immediate vision of God after death. It is but <i>winking</i>—and 
    they shall see God!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">See the misery of an impure sinner.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">He shall never be admitted to the <i>blessed </i>sight of 
    God. Only the pure in heart shall see God. Such as live in sin, whose souls 
    are dyed black with the filth of hell—they shall never come where God is. 
    They shall have an <i>affrighting </i>vision of God—but not a <i>beatific
    </i>vision. They shall see the flaming sword and the burning lake—but not 
    the mercy-seat! God in Scripture is sometimes called a 'consuming fire', 
    sometimes the 'Father of lights'. The wicked shall feel the fire—but not see 
    the light. Impure souls shall be covered with shame and darkness as with a 
    mantle, and shall never see the king's face. Those who would not see God in 
    his Word and ordinances—shall not see him in his glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Is there such a blessed privilege after this life? Then 
    let me persuade all who hear me this day:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. To get into Christ.</p></b></font> We can come to God—only 
    by Christ. Moses when he was in the <i>rock </i>saw God (Exodus 33:32). Only 
    in this blessed rock, <i>Christ</i>—shall we see God.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. To be purified people.</p></b></font> It is only the pure 
    in heart, who shall see God. It is only a clear eye, which can behold a 
    bright transparent object. Only those who have their hearts cleansed from 
    sin, can have this blessed sight of God. Sin is such a <i>cloud </i>as, if 
    it is not removed, will forever hinder us from seeing the <i>Sun </i>of 
    Righteousness. Christian, have you upon your heart <i>'holiness to the Lord'</i>? 
    Then you shall see God. 'There are many,' says Augustine, 'who want to go to 
    heaven—but they will not take the holy way which alone leads there!'
<p align="justify">There are several sorts of eyes which shall never see 
    God—the <i>ignorant </i>eye, the <i>unchaste </i>eye, the <i>scornful </i>
    eye, the <i>malicious </i>eye, the <i>covetous </i>eye. If you would see God 
    when you die, you must be purified people while you live! 'We know that when 
    He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him as He is. And 
    everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself just as He is pure.' (1 
    John 3:2, 3).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Let me turn myself to the pure in heart.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Stand <i>amazed </i>at this privilege</p></b></font>—that 
    you who are worms crept out of the dust—should be admitted to the blessed 
    sight of God, for all eternity! It was Moses' prayer, 'I beseech you, show 
    me your glory' (Exodus 33:18). The saints <i>shall </i>behold God's glory! 
    The pure in heart shall have the same blessedness that God himself has. For 
    what is the blessedness of God—but the contemplating his own infinite glory 
    and beauty!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Begin your sight of God here on earth. </p></b></font>Let 
    the <i>eye of your faith </i>be ever upon God. Moses by faith 'saw him who 
    is invisible' (Hebrews 11:27). Often look upon him with <i>believing </i>
    eyes—whom you hope to see with <i>glorified </i>eyes. 'My eyes are ever 
    towards the Lord' (Psalm 25:15). While <b>others </b>are looking towards the
    <i>earth </i>as if they would fetch all their comforts thence—let <b>us </b>
    look up to <i>heaven!</i> There is the best sight. The sight of God by faith 
    would let in much joy to the soul. 'You love Him, though you have not seen 
    Him. And though not seeing Him now, you believe in Him and rejoice with 
    inexpressible and glorious joy!' (1 Peter 1:8).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Let this be a cordial, to revive the pure in heart.</p></b></font> 
    Be comforted with this—<i>you</i> <i>shall shortly see God! </i>The godly 
    have many sights here on earth, which they do not desire to see. They see a 
    body of death; they see evil and sin; they see unholy people wearing the 
    mask of religion; they see the white devil. These sights occasion sorrow. 
    But there is a blessed sight a-coming! 'They shall see <b>God</b>!' And in 
    him, are all sparkling beauties and ravishing joys to be found!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Do not be discouraged at sufferings.</p></b></font> All 
    the hurt that affliction and death can do—is to give you a sight of God. As 
    one said to his fellow-martyr, 'One half-hour in glory, will make us forget 
    all our pain!' When the sun rises—all the dark shadows of the night flee 
    away. When the pleasant beams of God's countenance begin to shine upon the 
    soul in heaven—then sorrows and sufferings shall be no more! The dark 
    shadows of the <i>night</i>, shall fly away. The thoughts of this coming 
    beatific vision, should carry a Christian full sail with joy through the <i>
    waters of affliction!</i> This made Job so willing to embrace death: 'But as 
    for me, I know that my Redeemer lives! And after my body has decayed, yet in 
    my body I will see God! I will see him for myself. Yes, I will see him with 
    my own eyes! I am overwhelmed at the thought!' (Job 19:25-27).
