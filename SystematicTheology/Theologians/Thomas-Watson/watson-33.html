<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Christ All in All</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="center"><i>"Christ is all in all." </i>Colossians 3:11</p>
<p align="justify">The philosopher says every science takes its dignity from 
    the object; the more <i>noble </i>the object—the more <i>rare </i>the 
    knowledge. Hence it is that Jesus Christ, being the most sublime and 
    glorious object, that knowledge which leads us to Christ must be most 
    excellent. It is called "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ," 
    Philippians 3:8. So sweet is this knowledge, that Paul determined to know 
    nothing but Christ, 1 Corinthians 2:2. And, indeed, what more did he need to 
    know—for "Christ is all in all". In the text the apostle gives us a 
    negative, and something positively.</p>
<p align="justify">First, <b>NEGATIVELY</b>. Paul tells the Colossians what 
    will <i>not </i>avail them, "neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision 
    avails." Circumcision was a great privilege; it was a badge to distinguish 
    the people of God from those who were foreign. It was a wall between the 
    enclosed garden and the common field. The people of circumcision were a 
    people who were under God's <i>eye </i>and His <i>wing</i>. They were His 
    household family. Rather than they should lack, God would make the heavens a 
    granary, and rain down manna upon them. He would pierce the rock, and make 
    it a lively spring. </p>
<p align="justify">How glorious was the privilege of circumcision! Romans 
    9:4-5. What rich jewels hung upon Israel's crown! But, in matters of 
    salvation, all this was nothing, "neither circumcision nor uncircumcision." 
    From whence we may observe that <i>external religious privileges commend no 
    man to God</i>; whether wise, rich, or noble—none of this sets us off in 
    God's eye, 1 Corinthians 1:26. God does not see as man sees. We are taken 
    with <i>beauty </i>and <i>abilities</i>—but these things avail nothing with 
    God. God lays His <i>left </i>hand upon these—as Jacob did upon Manasseh, 
    Genesis 48:14. God often passes by those who cast a greater splendor and 
    luster in the world—and looks upon them as an inferior alloy. The reason is 
    "that no flesh should glory in His presence!" 1 Corinthians 1:29. If God 
    should graft His grace only upon <i>wisdom </i>and <i>abilities</i>, some 
    would be ready to say, "My wisdom, or my eloquence, or my nobility has saved 
    me." Therefore, "not many wise. . . not many noble are called." God will 
    have no <i>pride </i>or <i>boasting </i>in the creature.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Do not rest in outward privileges or 
    excellencies—these are no stocks to graft the hopes of salvation upon!</p></b>
</font><i>Many of Christ's kindred went to hell. </i>Paul is called "the <i>
    servant </i>of the Lord," Romans 1:1. And James is called "the <i>brother
    </i>of the Lord," Galatians 1:19. It is better to be the <i>servant </i>of 
    the Lord than the <i>brother </i>of the Lord. The virgin Mary was saved not 
    because she was the mother of Christ—but because she was the daughter of 
    faith. It is <i>grace</i>, not <i>blood</i>—which gives acceptance with God. 
    A heart which has Christ formed in it—is God's delight.
<p align="justify">Second, the apostle sets down something <b>POSITIVELY</b>; 
    but "Christ is all in all." Note the sentence structure:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The subject</p></b>—"Christ". His name is sweet—it is "as 
    ointment poured forth," Song of Solomon 1:3. It was Job's wish, "O that my 
    words were now written! that they were engraved with an iron pen and lead in 
    the rock forever!" Job 19:23-24. And it is my wish that this name, this 
    sweet name of Christ, were not written, that it were engraved with the pen 
    of the Holy Spirit in our hearts forever. "The name of Christ has in it," 
    said Chrysostom, "a thousand treasuries of joy."
<b>
<p align="justify">The predicate</p></b>—"all in all". Christ is all fullness, 
    all sweetness. He is all that is imaginable, all that is desirable. He who 
    has Christ can have no more—for Christ is all. The proposition out of the 
    words is that Jesus Christ is the quintessence of all good things; He is 
    all.
<p align="justify">Sometimes <i>faith </i>is said to be all, Galatians 5:6. 
    Nothing avails but faith. Faith is all as it is the instrument to lay hold 
    on Christ, whereby we are saved—as a man is saved by catching hold on a 
    bough.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes the <i>new creature </i>is said to be all, 
    Galatians 6:15. Nothing avails but a new creature. The new creature is 
    all—as it qualifies and fits for glory. "Without holiness no man shall see 
    the Lord," Hebrews 12:14. It is a saying of Chrysostom that, at the day of 
    judgment, God will ask that question, as our Savior did, Matthew 22:20, 
    "Whose image and superscription is this?" So will God say, "Whose image is 
    this?" If you cannot show Him His image consisting in holiness, He will 
    reject you. Thus the new creature is all.</p>
<p align="justify">Here in the text <i>Christ </i>is said to be all—but in 
    what sense is Christ all?</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is all by way of <b>eminency</b>. All good things 
    are eminently to be found in Him—as the sun virtually contains in it the 
    light of the lesser stars.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is all by way of <b>derivation</b>. All good 
    things are transmitted and conveyed to us through Christ. As our rich 
    commodities, such as jewels and spices—come to us by sea—so all heavenly 
    blessings sail to us through the red sea of Christ's blood! Romans 11:36, 
    "For everything comes from Him; everything exists by His power and is 
    intended for His glory. To Him be glory evermore! Amen." Christ is that <i>
    spiritual pipe </i>through which the <i>golden oil of mercy </i>empties 
    itself into the soul! </p>
<p align="justify">Christ must be all, for "in Him dwells all the fullness 
    of the Godhead," Colossians 2:9. He has a partnership with God the Father. 
    John 16:15, "All things that the Father has, are Mine." So there is enough 
    in Him to scatter all our fears, to remove all our burdens, to supply all 
    our needs. There can be no defect in that which is infinite.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Information. It shows us the glorious fullness of 
    Jesus Christ.</p></b></font> He is all in all. Christ is a treasury and 
    storehouse of all spiritual riches. You may go with the bee from flower to 
    flower, and suck here and there a little sweetness—but you will never have 
    enough until you come to Christ, for He is all in all. Now, in particular,<i> 
    Christ is all </i>in six respects:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ is all—in regard of RIGHTEOUSNESS.</p></b></font> 1 
    Corinthians 1:30, "He is made to us, <i>righteousness</i>." The robe of our 
    innocence, like the veil of the Temple, is rent asunder. Ours is a <i>ragged
    </i>righteousness. Isaiah 64:6, "Our righteousness is as <i>filthy rags</i>." 
    As under rags, the naked body is seen—so under the rags of our righteousness 
    the body of death is seen. We can <i>defile </i>our duties—but they cannot
    <i>justify </i>us; but Christ is all in regard of righteousness. Romans 
    10:4, "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness, to everyone who 
    believes." That is, through Christ, we are as righteous as if we had fully 
    satisfied the law in our own persons. Jacob got the blessing in the <i>
    garment </i>of his elder brother. So, in the garment of Christ, our older 
    brother, we obtain the blessing. Christ's righteousness is a coat woven 
    without seam. "We are made the righteousness of God in Him," 2 Corinthians 
    5:21.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ is all—in regard of SANCTIFICATION.</p></b></font> 
    1 Corinthians 1:30, "He is made to us, <i>sanctification</i>." 
    Sanctification is the spiritual enamel and embroidery of the soul; it is 
    nothing else but God's putting upon us the <i>jewels of holiness</i>. The 
    angels glory in it. We are made as the king's daughter, "all glorious 
    within," Psalm 45:13. This tunes and prepares the soul for heaven. It turns
    <i>iron </i>into <i>gold</i>; it makes the heart, which was Satan's 
    picture—into Christ's living epistle. The virgins in Esther 2:12 had their 
    "days of purification." They were first to he perfumed and anointed—and then 
    they were to stand before the king. So we must have the anointing of God, 1 
    John 2:27, and be perfumed with the graces of the Spirit, those sweet 
    fragrances—and then we shall stand before the King of heaven! There must be 
    first our days of <i>purification, </i>before our days of <i>glorification</i>. 
    What a blessed work is this!
<p align="justify">A soul beautified and adorned with grace is like the sky, 
    bespangled with glittering stars. Oh, what a metamorphosis is there! I may 
    allude to that passage in Song of Solomon 3:6. "Who is this that comes out 
    of the <i>wilderness of sin</i>, perfumed with all the <i>graces of the 
    Spirit</i>?" Holiness is the signature and engraving of God upon the soul. 
    But where does this come from? From Christ—who is all in all. He is made to 
    us sanctification. It is He who sends His Spirit into our hearts to be a 
    refiner's fire, to burn up our dross and make our graces sparkle like gold 
    in the furnace! Christ arises upon the soul "with healing in His wings," 
    Malachi 4:2. He heals the understanding and says, "Let there be light." He 
    heals the <i>heart</i>—by dissolving the stone in His blood. He heals the <i>
    will—</i>by filing off its rebellion. Thus He is all in regard of 
    sanctification.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is all—in regard of ACCEPTANCE with God.</p></b></font> 
    Ephesians 1:6. "He has made us <i>favorites</i>," as some render it. Through 
    Christ, God is propitious to us and takes all we do in good part. A wicked 
    man, being out of Christ, is out of God's favor. Even his <i>plowing </i>is 
    sin, Proverbs 21:4. God will not come near him; his breath is infectious. 
    God will hear his <i>sins—</i>and not his <i>prayers</i>. But now, in 
    Christ, God accepts us. As <i>Joseph </i>presented his brethren before 
    Pharaoh and brought them into favor with the king, Genesis 47:2; so the Lord
    <i>Jesus </i>carries the names of the saints upon His breast and presents 
    them before His Father, thus bringing them into repute and honor. Through 
    Christ, God will treat and parley with us. Through the red glass—everything 
    appears a red color; through the blood of Christ—we look of a sanguine 
    complexion, ruddy and beautiful in God's eyes.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Christ is all—in regard of divine ASSISTANCE.</p></b></font> 
    A Christian's strength lies in Christ, "I can do everything through Him who 
    gives me strength."Philippians 4:13. How is a Christian able to do duty, to 
    resist temptation—but through Christ's strengthening? How is it that a <i>
    spark of grace </i>lives in a sea of corruption, the storms of persecution 
    blowing—but that Christ holds this spark in the hollow of His hand? How is 
    it that the roaring lion of hell has not devoured the saints? Because the 
    Lion of the tribe of Judah has defended them! Christ not only gives us our
    <i>crown</i>—but our <i>shield</i>. He not only gives us our garland when we 
    overcome—but our strength whereby we overcome. Revelation 12:11, "They 
    overcame him—that is, the accuser of the brethren—by the blood of the Lamb." 
    Christ keeps the <i>royal fort of grace—</i>so that it is not blown up. 
    Peter's shield was <i>bruised</i>—but Christ ensured that it was not <i>
    broken</i>. "I have prayed for you—that your faith fail not," Luke 22:32, 
    that it be not a total falling away. The crown of all the saints' victories 
    must he set upon the head of Christ!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Christ is all—in regard of PEACE with God.</p></b></font> 
    When conscience is in agony, and burns as hell in the sense of God's 
    wrath—now Christ is all. He pours the balm of His blood into these wounds, 
    He makes the storm calm. Christ not only makes peace in the court of <i>
    heaven</i>—but in the court of <i>conscience</i>. He not only makes peace 
    above us but within us, John 16. Said Cyprian, "All our golden streams of 
    peace flow from this fountain!" John 15:27, "Peace I leave with you, my 
    peace I give unto you." Jesus Christ not only <i>purchased </i>peace for 
    us—but <i>speaks </i>peace to us. He is called the Prince of peace, Isaiah 
    9:6. Thus Christ is all in regard of peace. He makes peace for us and in us; 
    this honey and oil flow out of the rock—Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Christ is all—in regard of REMUNERATION. </p></b></font>It 
    is He who crowns us after all our labors and sufferings. He died to advance 
    us. His lying in the wine-press, was to bring us into the banqueting house! 
    He is gone before to take possession of heaven in the name of all believers. 
    Hebrews 6:20, "Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus." Christ 
    has gone to prepare a place for the saints, John 14:2. He makes <i>heaven
    </i>ready for them—and makes <i>them </i>ready for heaven. Thus Christ is 
    all in regard of remuneration. Revelation 22:12, "Behold, I come quickly—and 
    My <i>reward </i>is with Me."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. If Christ is all, it shows what a vast 
    disproportion there is between Christ and the creature.</p></b></font> There is 
    as much difference as between <i>something </i>and <i>nothing</i>. Christ is
    <i>all </i>in all—and the creature is <i>nothing </i>at all. Proverbs 23:5, 
    "Will you set your eyes on that which is not?" The creature is a nonentity. 
    Though it has a physical existence, yet, considered theologically, it is 
    nothing. It is but a gilded shadow, a pleasant dream. When Solomon had 
    sifted up the finest flour and distilled the spirit of all created 
    excellency, here is the result, "All was vanity," Ecclesiastes 2:11. We read 
    that the earth in creation was <i>void</i>, Genesis 1:2. So are all earthly 
    comforts void. They are void of that which we think is in them. They are 
    void of satisfaction; therefore, they are compared to wind, Hosea 12:1. A 
    man can no more fill his heart with the world than he can fill his belly 
    with the air he draws in. Now the creature is said to be nothing, in a 
    threefold sense:
<p align="justify">1. It is nothing to a man in <i>trouble </i>of spirit. If 
    the spirit is wounded, outward things will no more give ease—than a crown of 
    gold will cure the headache.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The creature is nothing to a man who has <i>heaven </i>
    in his eye. When Paul had seen that light shining from heaven, surpassing 
    the glory of the sun, Acts 26:13, though his eyes were open, "he saw no 
    man," Acts 9:8. So he who has the glory of heaven in his eye, is blind to 
    the world. He sees nothing in it to allure him or make him willing to stay 
    here.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The creature is nothing to one who is <i>dying</i>. A 
    man at the hour of death is most serious, and is able to give the truest 
    verdict of things. Now at such a time the world is nothing. It is in an 
    eclipse. The <i>sorrow </i>of the world is real—but the <i>joy </i>of the 
    world imaginary. Oh, then, what a vast difference is there between Christ 
    and the creature! Christ is all in all, and the creature nothing at all; yet 
    how many damn their souls for nothing?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. It shows where the soul is to go in the lack of 
    all. Go to Christ who is all in all. </p></b></font>Do you lack grace? Go to 
    Christ. Colossians 2:3, "In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and 
    knowledge." Christ is the great Lord treasurer; go then to Christ. Say, 
    "Lord, I am <i>indigent </i>of grace—but in You are all my fresh springs. 
    Fill my cistern from Your spring. Lord, I am <i>blind</i>, You have 
    eye-salve to anoint me. I am <i>defiled</i>, You have water to cleanse me. 
    My heart is <i>hard</i>, You have blood to soften me. I am <i>empty </i>of 
    grace, bring Your fullness to my emptiness." In all our spiritual needs, we 
    should resort to Christ—as Jacob's sons did to their brother Joseph. "He 
    opened all the storehouses," Genesis 42:25. Thus, the Lord has made Christ 
    our Joseph. Colossians 2:3, "In whom are hidden all treasures." Oh, then, 
    sinners, make out to Christ! He is all in all; and, to encourage you to go 
    to Him, remember there is in Him not only <i>fullness</i>, but <i>freeness</i>. 
    "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters!" Christ is not only full as 
    the honeycomb—but He drops as the honeycomb.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 5. If Christ is all, see here the Christian's 
    richness.</p></b></font> How rich is he, who has Christ! He has all that may 
    make him completely happy. The wife of Phocion, being asked where her jewels 
    were, answered, "My husband and his triumphs are my jewels!" So, if a 
    Christian is asked where his riches are, he will say, "Christ is my riches!" 
    A true saint cannot be poor. If you look into his house, perhaps he has 
    scarcely a bed to lie on. 1 Corinthians 4:11, "Even to this present hour, we 
    both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and have no certain dwelling-place." 
    Come to many a child of God and bid him make his will, and he will say as 
    Peter, Acts 3:6, "Silver and gold have I none." Yet he can at the same time 
    make his triumph with the apostle, 2 Corinthians 6:10, "As having <i>nothing</i>—yet 
    possessing <i>all</i>." He has Christ, who is in all. When a believer can 
    call nothing his, he can say all is his.
<p align="justify">The Tabernacle was covered with badgers' skins, Exodus 
    25:5, yet most of it was of gold; so a saint may have a poor covering, such 
    as ragged clothes—but he is inlaid with gold. Christ is formed in his 
    heart—and so he is all glorious within.</p>
<p align="justify">How a Christian should sit down satisfied with Christ! <i>
    "Christ is all." </i>What? Though he lacks other things—is not Christ 
    enough? If a man has sunshine, he does not complain that he lacks the light 
    of a candle. Has he not enough, who has "the unsearchable riches of Christ?" 
    I have read of a godly man who, being blind, was asked by his friend if he 
    was not troubled for the lack of his sight. He confessed he was. "Why," said 
    his friend, "are you troubled because you lack that which flies have—when 
    you have that which angels have?" So I say to a Christian, "Why are you 
    troubled for lacking that which a reprobate has—when you have that which the 
    glorified saints have? You have Christ with all His benefit and royalties!"</p>
<p align="justify">Suppose a father should deny his son furniture for his 
    house—but should <i>will </i>all his land to him. Has he any cause to 
    complain? If God denies you a little furniture in the world—but in the 
    meantime wills His land to you; if He gives you the field wherein the pearl 
    of price is hidden, have you any cause to repine? A Christian who lacks 
    necessities, yet has Christ, has the one thing needful. Colossians 2:10, 
    "You are complete in Him." What! <i>complete </i>in Christ and not <i>
    content </i>with Christ? Luther said, "The sea of God's mercy should swallow 
    up our particular afflictions." Surely this sea of God's love in giving us 
    Christ, should drown all our complaints and grievances. Let the Christian 
    take the harp and the violin and bless God.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 6. If Christ is all, see the deplorable condition of 
    a Christless person.</p></b></font> He is poor; he is worth nothing. Revelation 
    3:17, "You are wretched, miserable and poor." The sadness of a man who lacks 
    Christ, will appear in these seven particulars:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He who lacks Christ, lacks justification.</p></b></font> 
    What a glorious thing it is, when a poor sinner is absolved from guilt and 
    is declared to be acquitted of all charges of sin! But this privilege flows 
    from Christ; all pardons are sealed in His blood. Acts 13:39, "By Him all 
    who believe are justified;" so that he who is out of Christ is unjustified. 
    The guilt of sin cleaves to him. He must be responsible to justice in his 
    own person, and the curse stands in full force against the sinner.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. He who lacks Christ, lacks the beauty of holiness.</p></b></font> 
    Jesus Christ is a living spring of grace. John 1:14, "Full of grace and 
    truth." Now a Christless person, is a graceless person; he does not have one 
    shred of holiness. The sapling must first be engrafted into the stock before 
    it can receive sap and influence from the root. We must first be engrafted 
    into Christ before we can of His fullness receive grace for grace, John 
    1:16. A man out of Christ, is <i>red with guilt </i>and <i>black with filth</i>. 
    He is an unhallowed person and, dying in that condition, is rendered 
    incapable of seeing God, Hebrews 12:14.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. He who lacks Christ, has no true nobility.</p></b></font> 
    It is through Christ that we are akin to God—and of the royal blood of 
    heaven. It is through Christ that "God is not ashamed to be called our God," 
    Hebrews 11:16. But out of Christ, we are looked upon as ignoble people. The 
    traitors' blood runs in our veins. A man out of Christ is base born. Whoever 
    is his <i>natural </i>father—the devil is his <i>spiritual </i>father, John 
    4:48.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. He who lacks Christ, lacks his freedom. </p></b></font>
    John 8:36, "If the Son sets you free—you shall be free indeed." A man out of 
    Christ is a slave, even when he sins most freely.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. He who lacks Christ, has no ability for service.</p></b></font> 
    When Samson's locks were cut, his strength was gone from him. He lacks a 
    vital principle; he cannot walk with God. He is like a dead member in the 
    body, which has neither strength nor motion. John 15:5, "Without Me you can 
    do nothing." The flute will make no sound, unless you blow in it. So, unless 
    Christ by His Spirit breathes in the soul—it cannot make any harmony or put 
    forth strength to any holy action.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. He who lacks Christ, has no consolation.</p></b></font> 
    Christ is called "the consolation of Israel," Luke 2:25. A Christless soul 
    is a comfortless soul. How can such a one have comfort, when he comes to 
    die? He is in debt—and has no surety. His wounds bleed—and he has no 
    physician. He sees the fire of God's wrath approaching—and has no screen to 
    keep it off. He is like a ship in a tempest. Sickness begins to make a 
    tempest in his body, sin begins to make a tempest in his conscience—and he 
    has nowhere to put in for harbor. Oh, the terror and anguish of such a man 
    at the hour of death! Isaiah 13:8, "Their face shall he as flames" is an 
    appropriate expression. The meaning is, such fear and horror shall seize 
    upon sinners in the evil day, that their countenances shall change and be as 
    pale as a flame.
<p align="justify">What are all the comforts of the world to a dying sinner? 
    He looks upon his friends—but they cannot comfort him. Bring him bags of 
    gold and silver—and they are as smoke to sore eyes. It grieves him to part 
    with them. Bring him music? What comfort is the harp and violin to a 
    condemned man? There are in Spain tarantulas, venomous spiders; and those 
    who are stung with them are almost dead—but are cured with music. But those 
    who die without Christ, who is the consolation of Israel, are in such 
    hellish pangs and agonies—that no music is able to cure them!</p>

<p align="justify">7. He who lacks Christ, has no salvation. </p></b></font>
    Ephesians 5:23, "He is the Savior of the body." He saves none but those who 
    are members of His body mystical, a strong Scripture against the doctrine of 
    universal redemption. Christ leaped into the sea of His Father's wrath—only 
    to save <i>His spouse </i>from drowning! He is the Savior of the body, so 
    that those who die out of Christ, are cut off from all hopes of salvation.

    things—and neglect of Christ. </p></b></font>Isaiah 55:2, "Why do you spend 
    money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which satisfies 
    not?" If you get all the world, you are but <i>golden beggars, </i>without 
    Christ. The physician finds out deadly bodily diseases—but is ignorant of 
    soul diseases. While he gets remedies to cure others—he neglects the remedy 
    of Christ's blood, to cure himself. The lawyer, while he clears other men's 
    titles to their land, he himself lacks a title to Christ. The tradesman is 
    busied in buying and selling—but neglects to trade for the pearl of great 
    price. He is like Israel, who went up and down to gather <i>straw</i>, or 
    like the loadstone who draws <i>iron </i>to it but refuses gold. Those who 
    mind the world so as to neglect Christ—their work is but spider-webs. "They 
    work so hard—but all in vain!" Habakkuk 2:13

    not prize that? Such a jewel is Christ. So precious is Christ, that Paul 
    counted all things dung that he might win Christ, Philippians 3:8. Oh, that 
    I could raise your appreciation of Jesus Christ! Prize Christ above your 
    estates, and above your relations. That man does not deserve Christ at all, 
    who does not prize Christ above all. Jesus Christ is an <i>incomprehensible
    </i>blessing. Whatever God can require for satisfaction, or can desire for 
    salvation—is to be found in Christ. Oh, then, let Him be the highest in our 
    esteem! "No writing shall please me," said Bernard, "if I do not read the

    not your souls be quiet until this <i>bundle of myrrh </i>lies between your 
    breasts! Song of Solomon 1:13. In other things we strive for property: "this 
    house is mine, these jewels are mine." Why not, "this Christ mine!" There 
    are only two words which will satisfy the soul: <i>Deity </i>and <i>property</i>.

<p align="justify">"The unsearchable riches of Christ." Ephesians 3:8. That

    what an enriching blessing Christ is:</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ is the most SUPREME good.</p></b></font> Put what 
    you will in the balance with Christ—He infinitely outweighs it. Is life 
    sweet? Christ is better. He is the life of the soul, Colossians 3:4. "His 
    loving-kindness is better than life," Psalm 63:3. Are relations sweet? 
    Christ is better. He is the friend who "sticks <i>closer </i>than a 
    brother."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ is the most sufficient good. </p></b></font>He who 
    has Christ needs no more. He who has the <i>ocean</i>—needs not the <i>
    cistern</i>. If one had a manuscript which contained all knowledge in it, 
    having all the arts and sciences—he need look in no other book. So he who 
    has Christ needs look no further. Christ gives both <i>grace </i>and <i>
    glory</i>, Psalm 84:11; grace to <i>cleanse </i>us—and glory to <i>crown </i>
    us. As Jacob said, "It is enough, Joseph my son is yet alive," Genesis 
    14:28. So he who has Christ may say, "It is enough, Jesus is yet alive!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is the most SUITABLE good. </p></b></font>In Him 
    dwells all fullness, Colossians 1:19. Christ is whatever the soul can 
    desire. Christ is beauty to <i>adorn</i>, gold to <i>enrich</i>, balm to <i>
    heal</i>, bread to <i>strengthen</i>, wine to <i>comfort</i>, and salvation 
    to <i>crown</i>. If we are in danger, Christ is a shield; if we are 
    disconsolate, He is a sun. He has enough in His wardrobe, to abundantly 
    furnish the soul.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Christ is the most SANCTIFYING good.</p></b></font> He 
    makes every condition happy to us; He sweetens all our comforts—and 
    sanctifies all our crosses.
<p align="justify">Christ sweetens all our <b>comforts</b>. He turns them 
    into blessings. Health is blessed; estate is blessed; relations are blessed. 
    Christ's love is like pouring sweet water on flowers, which makes them give 
    a more fragrant perfume. A wicked man cannot have that comfort in outward 
    things which a godly man has. He may possess more—but he enjoys less. He who 
    has Christ may say, "This mercy is given to me by the hand of my Savior; 
    this is a love-token from Him, a pledge of glory!"</p>
<p align="justify">Christ sanctifies all our <b>crosses</b>. They shall be 
    medicinal to the soul; they shall work sin out—and work grace in. God's 
    stretching the strings of His violin—is to tune it and make the music 
    better. Christ sees to it that His people lose nothing in the furnace, but 
    their drossy impurities.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Christ is the most RARE blessing</p></b></font>; there are 
    but few who have Him. The best things, when they grow common, begin to he 
    slighted. When silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, 1 Kings 10:27, it 
    was apt to be trod upon. Christ is a jewel that few are enriched with, which 
    may both raise our esteem of Him and quicken our pursuit after Him. Those to 
    whom God has given both the Indies, He has not given them Christ. They have 
    the fat of the earth—but not the dew of heaven. And, among us Protestants, 
    many <i>hear </i>of Christ but few <i>have </i>Him. Read Luke 4:25. There 
    are many in this city who have Christ sounded in their ears—but few who have 
    Christ formed in their hearts. Oh, how should we labor to be of this few! 
    They who are Christians should be restless.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Christ is the most choice good. </p></b></font>God shows 
    more love in giving us Christ—than in giving us crowns and kingdoms. God may 
    give a man many worldly things—and hate him; but in giving Christ to a man 
    He gives him the blessings of the throne. What if others have a crutch to 
    lean on—if you have a Christ to lean on? Abraham sent away the sons of the 
    concubines with gifts but "he gave all he had to Isaac," Genesis 25. God may 
    send away others with a little gold and silver—but if He gives you Christ, 
    He gives you all that ever He had, for "Christ is all, and in all."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Without Christ, nothing else is good.</p></b></font> 
    Without Christ, health is not good; it is fuel for lust. Riches are not 
    good; they are golden snares. Ordinances are not good; though they are good 
    in themselves, yet not good to us. They do not profit. They are as breasts 
    without milk, as bottles without wine. Nay, they are not only a dead 
    letter—but a savor of death. Without Christ, they will damn us. For lack of 
    Christ, millions go loaded to hell with ordinances.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Christ is the most ENDURING good. </p></b></font>Other 
    things are like the lamp which, while it shines, it spends itself. The 
    heavens "shall wax old like a garment," Psalm 102:26. But Jesus Christ is a 
    permanent good; with Him are durable riches, Proverbs 8:18. They last as 
    long as eternity itself lasts.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Christ is a DIFFUSIVE, communicative good.</p></b></font> 
    He is full not only as a <i>vessel—</i>but as a <i>spring</i>. He is willing 
    to give Himself to us. Now, then, if there is all this excellency in Jesus 
    Christ, it may make us ambitiously desirous of an interest in Him.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 1</p></b>.</font><i> But how shall I get a part in 
    Christ?
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. </p></b></font>See your need of Christ. Know that 
    you are undone without Him. How obnoxious are you to God's eye! How odious 
    to His pure and holy nature! How obnoxious to His justice! Oh, sinner, how 
    near is the sergeant to arrest you! The furnace of hell is being heated for 
    you—and what will you do without Christ? It is only the Lord Jesus—who can 
    stand as a screen to keep the fire of God's wrath from burning you! Tell me, 
    then, is there no need of Christ?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2.</p></b></font> Be importunate after Christ. "Lord, 
    give me Christ—or I die!" As Achsah said to her father Caleb, Joshua 15:19, 
    "You have given me a south land—give me also springs of water"; so should a 
    poor soul say, "Lord, You have given me an estate in the world—but this 
    south land will now quench my thirst. Give me also springs of water; give me 
    those living springs which run in the Savior's blood! You have said,<i> 
    'Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free 
    gift of the water of life!' </i>Lord, I thirst after Jesus Christ; nothing 
    but Christ will satisfy me. I am dead. I am damned without Him. Oh, give me 
    this water of life!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 3.</p></b></font> Be content to have Christ, as Christ 
    is offered—as both a <i>Prince </i>and a <i>Savior</i>, Acts 5:31. Be sure 
    you do not barter with Christ. Some would have <i>Christ—</i>and their <i>
    sins </i>too. Is Christ all, and will you not part with something for this 
    all? Christ would have you part with nothing, but what will damn you—namely, 
    your sins. There are some who bid fair for Christ; they will part with <i>
    some </i>sins but keep a secret reserve of <i>darling sins</i>. Does that 
    man think he shall have Christ's love—who feeds sin in secret? Oh, part with 
    all—for Him who is all! Part with your lusts, nay, your life—if Christ calls 
    you to that! This exhorts us not only to get Christ, but to labor to <i>know
    </i>that we have Christ. 1 John 2:3, "This is how we are sure that we have 
    come to know Him."
<p align="justify">Now, concerning this knowledge that Christ is ours, which 
    is the same as assurance, I shall lay down these corollaries or conclusions:</p>
<p align="justify">First, realize that this knowledge is <b>attainable</b>—it 
    may be gotten. 1 John 5:13, "I have written these things to you who believe 
    in the name of the Son of God, so that you may <i>know </i>that you have 
    eternal life." Why else does God bid us make our calling and election sure, 
    2 Peter 1:10, if assurance may not be had? And why does God bid us make to 
    prove ourselves, whether we are in the faith, 2 Corinthians 13:5, if we 
    cannot come to this knowledge that Christ is ours?</p>
<p align="justify">What are all the <i>signs </i>which the Scripture gives 
    of a man in Christ—but so many ciphers—if the knowledge of this interest may 
    not be had? 1 John 3:14 and 1 John 4:13.</p>
<p align="justify">There are some duties enjoined in Scripture which are 
    utterly impossible to perform if the knowledge of an interest in Christ is 
    not attainable. We are bid to rejoice in God, Philippians 4:4, and to 
    rejoice in tribulation, 1 Peter 4:13. How can he rejoice in suffering—who 
    does not know whether Christ is his or not?</p>
<p align="justify">Why has Christ promised to send the Comforter, John 
    14:16, whose very work it is to bring the heart to this assurance, if 
    assurance that Christ is ours, may not be had?</p>
<p align="justify">Some of the saints have arrived at this certainty of 
    knowledge; therefore, it may be had. Job knew that his Redeemer lived, Job 
    19:25. And Paul had this assurance, 2 Timothy 1:12 and Galatians 2:20. Yes, 
    some might say that Paul was an eminent believer, a Christian of the first 
    magnitude; so it is no wonder he had this jewel of assurance! Nay—but the 
    apostle speaks of it as a case incident to other believers, Romans 8:35, 
    "Who shall separate <i>us </i>from the love of Christ?" Not <i>me</i>—but <i>
    us! </i>So that by all it appears that a believer may come to spell out his 
    interest.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Caution 1.</p></b></font> Not that saints have always the 
    same certainty, or that they have such an assurance as excludes all 
    doubtings and conflicts. There will be flowings and ebbings in their <i>
    comforts</i>—as well as in their <i>graces</i>. Was it not so in David? 
    Sometimes we hear him say that God's loving-kindness was before his eyes, 
    Psalm 26:3. But at another time, "Where are Your former loving-kindnesses?" 
    Psalm 89:49. These <i>doubtings </i>and <i>convulsions </i>God allows in His 
    children, sometimes, that they may long the more for heaven where they shall 
    have a constant springtime of joy.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Caution 2.</p></b></font> Not that all believers have the <i>
    same </i>assurance. Assurance is rather the <i>fruit </i>of faith—than faith 
    itself. Now, as the root of the rose or tulip may be alive, where the flower 
    is not visible—so faith may live in the heart where the <i>flower of 
    assurance </i>does not appear.
<p align="justify">Assurance is <i>difficult </i>to be obtained. It is a <i>
    rare jewel</i>, hard to come by. Not many Christians have this jewel. God 
    sees it good, sometimes, to withdraw assurance from His people—that they may 
    walk humbly. Satan does what he can to waylay and obstruct our assurance; he 
    is called the <i>red dragon</i>, Revelation 12:3. If he cannot <i>blot </i>a 
    Christian's evidence, yet sometimes lie casts such a mist before his eyes, 
    that he cannot <i>read </i>his evidence. The devil envies that God should 
    have any glory—or the soul any comfort.</p>
<p align="justify">That we lack assurance is, for the most part, our own 
    fault. We walk carelessly, neglect our spiritual watch, let go our hold of 
    promises, and comply with temptations. No wonder, then, if we walk in 
    darkness, and are at such a loss that we cannot tell whether Christ is ours 
    or not. Assurance is very <i>sweet</i>; this wine of paradise cheers the 
    heart.</p>
<p align="justify">Assurance is very <i>useful</i>, it will put us upon 
    service for Christ. It will put us upon active obedience. Assurance will 
    not, as the Papists say, breed carnal <i>security </i>in the soul—but <i>
    agility</i>. It will make us mount up with wings as eagles in holy duties. 
    Faith makes us living; assurance makes us lively. If we know that Christ is 
    ours—we shall never think we can love Him enough or serve Him enough. 2 
    Corinthians 5:14, "The love of Christ constrains us!" Assurance will put us 
    upon patient suffering for Christ. Romans 5:3-5, "We glory in tribulation, 
    because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts." Mr. Foxe, in his Book 
    of Martyrs, speaks of a woman in Queen Mary's days who, when the adversaries 
    threatened to take her <i>husband </i>from her, answered, "Christ is my 
    husband!" When they threatened to take away her <i>children </i>she 
    answered, "Christ is better to me than ten sons!" When they threatened to 
    take away <i>all </i>from her, said she, "Christ is mine, and you cannot 
    take Him away from me!" No wonder Paul was willing to be bound and die for 
    Christ, Acts 21:13, when he knew that Christ loved him and had given Himself 
    for him, Galatians 2:20. Though I will not say Paul was <i>proud </i>of his 
    chain, yet he was <i>glad </i>for it; he wore it as a chain of diamonds!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 2. </p></b></font>But how shall I get this <i>jewel
    </i>of assurance?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. </p></b></font>Seek Christ diligently. When the 
    spouse sought Christ <i>diligently</i>, she found Him <i>joyfully</i>, Song 
    of Solomon 3:4.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2.</p></b></font> Preserve the virginity of 
    conscience. When the glass is full you will not pour wine into it, only when 
    it is empty. Just so, when the soul is cleansed from the love of every sin, 
    then God will pour in the sweet wine of assurance. Hebrews 10:22, "Let us 
    draw near in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an 
    evil conscience."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. </p></b></font>Be much in the actings of faith. The 
    more active the child is in obedience, the sooner he has his father's smile. 
    If faith is ready to die, Revelation 3:2, if it is like armor hung up, or 
    like a sleepy habit in the soul, never think that you can have assurance in 
    such a state.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 4.</p></b></font> If Christ is all, then make Him so 
    to you.
<p align="justify">Make Christ all—in your <font color="#b07050"><b>
    understanding</b></font>. Be ambitious to know nothing but Christ, 1 
    Corinthians 2:2. What is it to have knowledge in <i>medicine</i>? To be 
    able, with Galen, to discourse of the causes and symptoms of a disease and 
    what is proper to apply—and, in the meantime, to be ignorant of the healing 
    under Christ's wings? What is it to have knowledge in <i>astronomy</i>, to 
    discourse of the stars and planets—and to be ignorant of Christ, that bright 
    morning-star which leads to heaven? What is it to have skill in a <i>shop—</i>and 
    be ignorant of that commodity which both enriches and crowns? What is it to 
    he versed in <i>music—</i>and to be ignorant of Christ, whose blood makes 
    atonement in heaven, and music in the conscience? What is it to know all the 
    stratagems of <i>war—</i>and to be ignorant of "the Prince of Peace"? </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, make Christ all! Be willing to know nothing but 
    Christ. Though you may know other things in their due place—yet know Christ 
    in the <i>first </i>place. Let the knowledge of Jesus Christ have the 
    pre-eminence, as the sun among the lesser planets. This is the crowning 
    knowledge. Proverbs 14:18, "The prudent are crowned with knowledge." We 
    cannot know ourselves, unless we know Christ. It is He who takes us into our 
    hearts and shows us the <i>spots of our souls, </i>whereby we abhor 
    ourselves in dust and ashes. Christ shows us our own emptiness and poverty. 
    Until we see our own emptiness, we are not fit to be filled with the golden 
    oil of mercy. We cannot know God—but through Christ, 2 Corinthians 4:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Make Christ all—in your <font color="#b07050"><b>
    affections</b></font>. <i>Desire </i>nothing but Christ. He is the 
    aggregation of all good things. "You are complete in Him," Colossians 2:10. 
    Christ is the Christian's perfection. Why should the soul desire less? How 
    can it desire more? Love nothing but Christ. Love is the choicest affection; 
    it is the richest jewel the creature has to bestow. Oh, if Christ is all, 
    love Him better than all! </p>
<p align="justify">Consider, first, if you love other things, when they die 
    your love is lost; but Christ lives forever to requite your love. </p>
<p align="justify">Consider, second, you may love other things in excess—but 
    you cannot love Christ in excess. </p>
<p align="justify">Consider, third, when you love other things, you love 
    that which is worse than yourselves. If you love a fair house, a pleasant 
    garden, a skillfully drawn picture, these things are worse than yourselves. 
    If I would love anything more intensely and ardently, it should be something 
    which is better than myself, and that is Jesus Christ. He who is all, let 
    Him have all. Give Him your love—who desires it most, and deserves it best.</p>
<p align="justify">Make Christ all—in your <font color="#b07050"><b>
    abilities</b></font>; do all in His strength. Ephesians 6:10, "Be strong in 
    the Lord, and in the power of <i>His </i>might." When you are to resist a 
    temptation, or to mortify a corruption—do not go out in your own strength, 
    but in the strength of Christ. Be strong in the Lord. Some go out to duty in 
    the strength of their abilities, and go out against sin in the strength of 
    their resolutions—and they both come home foiled. Alas! What are our 
    resolutions but like the green cords which bound Samson! A sinful heart will 
    soon break these. Do as David when he was to go up against Goliath. He said, 
    "I come to you in the name of the Lord." So say to your Goliath lust, "I 
    come to you in the name of Christ." Then we conquer, when the Lion of the 
    tribe of Judah marches before us.</p>
<p align="justify">Make Christ all—in your <font color="#b07050"><b>aims</b></font>; 
    do all to His glory, 1 Peter 4:11.</p>
<p align="justify">Make Christ all in your <b><font color="#B07050">trust</font></b>. 
    Trust none but Christ for salvation. The Papists make Christ <i>something</i>, 
    but not <i>all</i>. And is there not naturally a <i>spice of popery </i>in 
    our hearts? We would be grafting happiness upon the stock of our own 
    righteousness. "Every man," said Luther, "is born with a <i>pope </i>in his 
    heart!" Oh, make Christ all in regard of reliance! Let Him be your city of 
    refuge to flee to, your ark of salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">Make Christ all in your <font color="#b07050"><b>joy</b></font>. 
    Galatians 6:14, "God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our 
    Lord Jesus Christ." Oh, Christian, have you seen the Lord Jesus? Has this 
    morning-star shone into your heart with its enlightening, quickening beams? 
    Then rejoice and be exceeding glad! Shall others rejoice in the <i>world</i>—and 
    will not you rejoice in <i>Christ! </i>How much better is He than all other 
    things! It reflects disparagement upon Christ—when His saints are sad and 
    drooping. Is not Christ yours? What more would you have!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Objection. </p></b></font>But, says one, "I am low in the 
    world, and that takes off the chariot wheels of my joy, and makes me drive 
    heavily."
<p align="justify">Answer. But have you not Christ? And is Christ all? Psalm 
    16:5-6.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Objection.</p></b></font> If indeed I knew Christ were mine, 
    then I could rejoice; but how shall I know that?
<p align="justify">Answer 1. Is your soul filled with pantings after Christ? 
    Do you desire water out of Christ's side to <i>cleanse </i>you—as well as 
    blood out of His side to <i>save </i>you? These sighs and groans are stirred 
    up by the</p>
<p align="justify">Spirit of God. By the beating of this pulse, judge of the 
    life of faith in you.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. Have you given up yourself by an universal 
    subjection to Christ? This is a good sign that Christ is yours.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. Be thankful for Christ. God has done more for 
    you in giving you Christ—than if He had set you with the princes of the 
    earth, Psalm 118:8, or had made you angels, or had given you the whole 
    world. In short, God cannot give a greater gift than Christ, for, in giving 
    Christ, He gives Himself to us, and all this calls aloud for thankfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is a breast of comfort to every man who has Christ: 
    Christ is all. It is good lying at this fountainhead. When a Christian sees 
    a deficiency in himself, he may see an all-sufficiency in his Savior! "Happy 
    is that people whose God is the Lord!" Psalm 144:15. That servant has no 
    lack—who has his master's full purse at command. He who has Christ, has no 
    lack—for "Christ is all and in all." What if the fig-tree does not 
    flourish—if you have Christ, the Tree of Life, and all fruit growing there? 
    In the hour of death, a believer may rejoice; when he leaves all, he is 
    possessed of all. As Ambrose said to his friend, "I fear not death because I 
    have a good Lord", so may a godly man say, "I fear not death, because I have 
    a Christ to go to! Death will but carry me to that <i>torrent of divine 
    pleasure </i>which runs at His right hand forevermore." </p>
<p align="justify">I will end with 1 Thessalonians 4:18, "Comfort one 
    another with these words."</p>
