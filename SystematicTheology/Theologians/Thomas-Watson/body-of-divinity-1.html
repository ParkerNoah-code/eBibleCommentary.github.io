<p align="center">1. The Being of God</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 3. What do the scriptures principally teach?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: The Scriptures principally teach what man is to 
believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of man.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Question 4. What is God?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, 
in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is, </p>
<p align="justify">1. Something <b>implied</b>. That there is a God. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Something <b>expressed</b>. That he is a Spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">3. What kind of Spirit?</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Something IMPLIED. That there is a God.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">The question, "What is God?" takes for granted that there is 
a God. The belief of God's existence, is the foundation of all religious 
worship. "He who comes to God must believe that he is." There must be a first 
cause, which gives being to all things besides.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] We know that there is a God by the book of NATURE.</p></b></font> 
The notion of a Deity is engraved on man's heart; it is demonstrable by the 
light of nature. It hard for a man to be a natural atheist; he may <i>wish </i>
there were no God, he may <i>dispute </i>against a Deity—but he cannot in his 
judgment believe there is no God, unless by accumulated sin his conscience be 
seared, and he has such a lethargy upon him, that he has sinned away his very 
sense and reason!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] We know that there is a God by his WORKS</p></b></font>, and 
this is so evident a demonstration of a Godhead, that the most atheistic 
spirits, when they have considered these works, have been forced to acknowledge 
some wise and supreme maker of these things. We will begin with the <b>creation
</b>of the glorious fabric of heaven and earth. Surely, there must be some 
architect or first cause. The world could not make itself. Who could hang the 
earth on nothing, but the great God? Who could provide such rich furniture for 
the heavens, the glorious constellations, the skies bespangled with such 
glittering lights? We see God's glory blazing in the sun, twinkling in the 
stars. Who could give the earth its clothing, cover it with grass and corn, 
adorn it with flowers, enrich it with gold? God alone. Job 38:8. Who but God 
could make the sweet music in the heavens, cause the angels to join in concert, 
and sound forth the praises of their Maker? "The morning stars sang together, 
and all the sons of God shouted for joy." 
<p align="justify">If a man should go into a far country, and see stately 
edifices there, he would never imagine that these built themselves—but that some 
greater power had built them. To imagine that the work of the creation was not 
framed by God, is as if we should conceive an intricate landscape to be drawn by 
a pencil, without the hand of an artist. "God who <i>made </i>the world, and all 
things therein." To <i>create </i>is proper to the Deity. </p>
<p align="justify">The wise <b>government </b>of all things evinces there is a 
God. God is the great superintendent of the world, he holds the golden reins of 
government in his hand, guiding all things most regularly and harmoniously to 
their proper end. Who that eyes Providence, but must be forced to acknowledge 
there is a God? Providence is the queen and governess of the world, it is the 
hand which turns the wheel of the whole creation; it sets the sun its race, the 
sea its bounds. If God did not guide the world, things would run into disorder 
and confusion. When one looks on a clock, and sees the motion of the wheels, the 
striking of the hammer, the hanging of the plummets—he would conclude that some 
artificer made it. Just so, when we see the excellent order and harmony in the 
universe, the sun, that great luminary, dispensing its light and heat to the 
world, without which the world were but a grave or a prison; the rivers sending 
forth their silver streams to refresh the bodies of men, and prevent a drought; 
and every creature acting within its sphere, and keeping its due bounds—we must 
needs acknowledge there is a God, who wisely orders and governs all these 
things. </p>
<p align="justify">Who could set this great multitude of the creatures in their 
several ranks and squadrons, and keep them in their constant march—but HE, whose 
name is the Lord Almighty? And as God does wisely <b>dispose </b>all things in 
the whole regiment of the creatures, so, by his power, he <b>supports </b>them. 
Did God suspend and withdraw his influence ever so little, the wheels of the 
creation would unpin, and the axle break asunder! All motion, the philosophers 
say, is from something that is unmoveable. As for example, the elements are 
moved by the influence and motion of the heavenly bodies; the sun and moon, and 
these planets, are moved by the highest orb, called Primum Mobile; now, if one 
should ask, Who moves that highest orb, or is the first mover of the planets? It 
can be no other than God himself!</p>
<p align="justify">Man is a microcosm or lesser world. The excellent context and 
frame of his body is wrought as meticulously as needlework. "You made all the 
delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb." This 
body is endowed with a noble <b>soul</b>. Who but God could make such a union of 
different substances as flesh and spirit? In him we live, and move, and have our 
being. The living motion of every part of the body shows there is a God. We may 
see something of him in the sparkling of the eye; and if the cabinet of the <i>
body </i>be so curiously wrought, what is the jewel—the <i>soul</i>? The soul 
has a celestial brightness in it; as one says, "It is a diamond set in a ring of 
clay." What noble faculties is the soul endowed with! Understanding, Will, 
Affections—are a mirror of the Trinity, as Plato speaks. The matter of the soul 
is spiritual, it is a divine spark lighted from heaven; and being spiritual, is 
immortal, as Scaliger notes; "the soul does not wax old," it lives forever. Who 
could create a soul ennobled with such rare angelic properties, but God? We must 
needs say as the Psalmist, "It is he who has made us, and not we ourselves."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] We may prove a Deity by our CONSCIENCE. </p></b></font>
Conscience is God's deputy or viceregent. Conscience is a witness of a Deity. If 
there were no Bible to tell us there is a God—yet conscience would. Conscience, 
as the apostle says, either "accuses" or "excuses." Rom 2:15. It acts in order 
to a higher judicatory. Natural conscience, being kept free from gross sin, 
excuses. When a man does virtuous actions, lives soberly and righteously, 
observes the golden maxim—doing to others as he would have them do to him—then 
conscience approves, and says, "Well done!" Like a bee it gives honey. Natural 
conscience in the wicked accuses. When men go against its light they feel the 
worm of conscience. "Alas! What scorpion lurks within?" -Seneca. Conscience, 
being sinned against, spits fire in men's faces, and fills them with shame and 
horror. When the sinner sees a handwriting on the wall of conscience, his 
countenance is changed!
<p align="justify">Many have hanged themselves to quiet their conscience. 
Tiberius the emperor, a bloody man, felt the lashes of his conscience; he was so 
haunted with that fury, that he told the senate, he suffered death daily. What 
could put a man's conscience into such an agony, but the impression of a Deity, 
and the thoughts of coming before his just tribunal? Those who are above human 
laws, are subject to the checks of their own conscience. And it is observable, 
the nearer the wicked approach to death, the more they are terrified. Whence is 
this but from the apprehension of approaching judgement? The soul, being 
sensible of its immortal nature, trembles at him who never ceases to live, and 
therefore will never cease to punish!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] That there is a God, appears by the consent and universal 
suffrage of all men.</p></b></font> "There is no nation so barbarous," says Tully, 
"as not to believe there is a God." Though the heathen did not worship the <i>
true </i>God—yet they worshiped <i>a god</i>. They set up an altar, "To the 
unknown God." Acts 17:23. They knew a God should be worshiped, though they knew 
not the God whom they ought to worship. Some worshiped Jupiter, some Neptune, 
some Mars. Rather than not worship something, they would worship anything.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] That there is a God, appears his prediction of future 
things—that is, by fulfilled prophecy.</p></b></font> He who can foretell things 
which shall surely come to pass, is the true God. God foretold, that a virgin 
should conceive; he prefixed the time when the Messiah should be cut off. He 
foretold the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and who would be their deliverer. 
God himself uses this argument to prove he is the true God, and that all the 
gods of the heathens are fictions and nullities. To foretell things contingent, 
which depend upon no natural causes, is peculiar to Deity.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] That there is a God, appears by his unlimited POWER and 
SOVEREIGNTY.</p></b></font> He who can work, and none can hinder—is the true God. 
Only God can do so. "I will work—and who shall hinder it?" Nothing can hinder 
action but some superior power; but there is no power above God! All power that 
is, is by him, therefore all power is under him. He has a "mighty arm." He sees 
the designs which men drive at against him, and plucks off their chariot wheels; 
he makes the diviners mad. He cuts off the spirit of princes; he bridles the 
sea, gives check to the leviathan, and binds the devil in chains. He acts 
according to his pleasure, he does what he will. "I will work, and who shall 
hinder it?"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] There are devils, therefore there is a God.</p></b></font> 
Atheists cannot deny but there are devils, and then they must grant there is a 
God. We read of many possessed of the devil. The devils are called in Scripture 
"hairy ones", because they often appeared in the form of goats or satyrs. Now, 
if there is a devil, there is a God. Socrates, a heathen, when accused at his 
death, confessed, that, as he thought there was an evil spirit, so he thought 
there was a good spirit.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Seeing there is a God—it reproves such atheistic 
fools as deny it.</p></b></font> Epicurus denied there was a Providence, saying that 
all things happened by chance. He who says there is no God is the wickedest 
creature that is—he is worse than a thief. The thief takes away <i>our </i>
goods—but the atheist would take away our <i>God </i>from us! "They have taken 
away my Lord." So we may say of atheists, they would take away our God from us, 
in whom all our hope and comfort is laid up. "The fool has said in his <i>heart</i>, 
There is no God." He dared not speak it with his tongue—but says it in his 
heart—he wishes it. Surely, none can be <i>speculative </i>atheists. "The devils 
believe and tremble."
<p align="justify">I have read of one Arthur—a professed atheist—who, when he 
came to die, cried out that he was damned. Though there are few found who <i>say</i>, 
"There is no God!" yet many deny him in their <i>practices</i>. "In works they 
deny him." The world is full of <i>practical </i>atheism; most people live as if 
they did not believe there was a God. Would the dare they lie, defraud, be 
immoral—if they believed there were a God who would call them to account? If a 
heathen who never heard of a God should come among us, and have no other means 
to convince him of a Deity—but the lives of men in our age, surely he would 
question whether there were a God!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Seeing there is a God—he will deal righteously, and 
give just rewards to men.</p></b></font> Things seem to be carried on in the world, 
very unequally; the wicked flourish. Those who tempt God are delivered. The ripe 
cluster of grapes is squeezed into their cup. In the meanwhile, the godly, who 
wept for sin, and served God—are afflicted. "I have eaten ashes like bread, and 
mingled my drink with weeping." Evil men enjoy all the good—and godly men endure 
all the evil. But seeing there is a God—he will deal righteously with men. 
"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" Offenders must come to 
punishment. The sinner's death-day, and dooms-day is coming. "The Lord sees that 
his day is coming." While there is a hell, the wicked shall be scourged enough; 
and while there is eternity, they shall lie there long enough! And God will 
abundantly compensate the faithful service of his people. They shall have their 
white robes and crowns. "Truly there is a reward for the righteous: truly he is 
a God who judges in the earth." Because God is God, he will give glorious 
rewards to his people.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Seeing there is a God, woe to all such as have 
this God against them. He lives forever to be avenged upon them.</p></b></font> "Can 
your heart endure, or can your hands be strong in the day that I shall deal with 
you?" Such as oppose his saints, trampling these jewels in the dust, and such as 
live in contradiction to God's Word—engage the Infinite Majesty of heaven 
against them! How dismal will their case be! "As surely as I live, when I 
sharpen my flashing sword and begin to carry out justice, I will bring vengeance 
on my enemies and repay those who hate me!" if it be so terrible to hear the 
lion <i>roar</i>, what must it be when he begins to <i>tear </i>his prey? 
"Consider this, you that forget God, <i>lest I tear you in pieces!" </i>Oh that 
men would think of this, who go on in sin! Shall we engage the great God against 
us? <b>God strikes slow—but heavy! </b>"Have you an arm like God?" Can you 
strike such a blow? <b>God is the best friend—but the worst enemy! </b>If he can
<i>look </i>men into their grave, how far can he throw them? "Who knows the 
power of his wrath?" What fools are they, who, for a drop of pleasure—drink a 
sea of wrath! Paracelsus speaks of a craze some have, which will make them die 
dancing; so sinners go dancing to hell.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Seeing there is a God, let us firmly believe this 
great article of our Creed. </p></b></font>What true religion can there be in men, 
if they do not believe a Deity? "He who comes to God must believe that he is." 
To worship God, and pray to him, and <i>not believe</i> there is a God—is to put 
a high scorn and contempt upon him. Believe that God is the only true God—such a 
God as he has revealed himself in his Word, "A lover of righteousness, and hater 
of wickedness." The real belief of a Deity gives life to all pious worship; the 
more we believe the truth and infiniteness of God—the more holy and angelic we 
are in our lives. Whether we are alone, or in company—God sees us! He is the 
heart-searcher! The belief of this would make us live always under God's eye. "I 
have set the Lord always before me." 
<p align="justify">The belief of a Deity would be a <i>bridle to sin</i>—and a
<i>spur to duty</i>. It would add wings to prayer, and oil to the lamp of our 
devotion. The belief of a Deity would cause dependence upon God in all our 
straits and exigencies. "I am God all-sufficient!" I am a God who can supply all 
your needs, scatter all your fears, resolve all your doubts, conquer all your 
temptations! The <i>arm of God's power</i> can never be shrunk! He can create 
mercy for us, and therefore can help, and not be beholden to the creature. Did 
we believe there is a God, we would so depend on his providence as not to use 
any indirect means; we should not run ourselves into sin, to rid ourselves out 
of trouble. "Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to 
inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?" When men run to sinful shifts—it is 
because they either do not believe there is a God—or that he is all-sufficient!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Seeing there is a God, let us labor to get a saving 
interest in him.</p></b></font> "This God is <i>our </i>God." Since the fall we have 
lost likeness to God, and communion with God; let us labor to recover this lost 
interest, and pronounce this Shibboleth, "<i>My </i>God." It is little comfort 
to know there is a God—unless he be ours! God offers himself to be our God. "I 
will be their God." Faith catches hold of the offer, it appropriates God, and 
makes all that is in him—over to us to be ours! His wisdom to be ours—to teach 
us; his holiness ours—to sanctify us; his Spirit ours—to comfort us; his mercy 
ours—to save us. <b>To be able to say, "God is mine!" is more than to have all 
the mines of gold and silver!
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Use six: Seeing there is a God, let us serve and WORSHIP him 
as God.</p></font></b><font color="#008000"> </font>It was an indictment brought 
against some, "They glorified him not as God." 
<p align="justify">Let us <b>pray </b>to him as to God. Pray with fervency. "An 
effectual fervent prayer avails much." <i>Fervency </i>is both the <i>fire </i>
and the <i>incense</i>; without fervency it is no prayer. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us <b>love </b>him as God. "You shall love the Lord your 
God with all your heart." To love him with all the heart, is to give him 
precedence in our love, to let him have the cream of our affections; to love him 
not only appreciatively, but intensively, as much as we can. As the sunbeams 
united in a <i>magnifying glass </i>burn the hotter—so all our affections should 
be united, that our love to God may be more ardent. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us <b>obey </b>him as God. All other creatures obey him! 
The <i>stars </i>fight his battles; the <i>wind </i>and <i>sea </i>obey him. How 
much more should man obey God, whom he has endued with a principle of reason. He 
is God, and has a sovereignty over us; therefore, as we received <i>life </i>
from him, so we must receive a <i>law </i>from him, and submit to his will in 
all things. This is to kiss him with a kiss of loyalty, and it is to glorify him 
as God.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
II. Something EXPRESSED.</p></b></font> John 4:24. "God is a <b>
Spirit</b>." "God is essentially, spirit." Zanchius.
<b>
<p align="justify">What do you mean when you say, God is a Spirit?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">By a spirit I mean, God is an immaterial substance, of a 
pure, unmixed essence, not compounded of body and soul, without all extension of 
parts. The body is a dreggish thing. The more spiritual God's essence, the more 
noble and excellent it is. The spirits are the more refined part of the wine.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Wherein does God differ from <i>other </i>spirits?</p>
<p align="justify">[1] The ANGELS are spirits. </p></b>We must distinguish spirits. 
The angels are created; God is an <i>uncreated </i>Spirit. The angels are 
finite, and capable of being annihilated; the same power which made them is able 
to reduce them to their first nothing; but God is an <i>infinite </i>Spirit. The 
angels are confined spirits, they are confined to a place; but God is an <i>
immense </i>Spirit, and in all places at once. The angels, though spirits, are 
but ministering spirits. Though they are spirits, they are servants. God is a 
super-excellent Spirit, the Father of spirits.
<b>
<p align="justify">[2] The SOUL is a spirit.</p></b> "The spirit shall return to God 
who gave it."
<b>
<p align="justify">How does God, being a Spirit, differ from the soul?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Servetus and Osiander thought, that the soul being infused, 
conveyed into man the very spirit and substance of God. This is an absurd 
opinion, for the essence of God is incommunicable.</p>
<p align="justify">When it is said the soul is a spirit, it means that God has 
made it intelligible, and stamped upon it his <i>likeness</i>, not his <i>
essence</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But is it not said, that we are made partakers of the divine 
nature?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">By divine nature there, is meant divine qualities. 2 Pet 1:1. 
We are made partakers of the divine nature, not by identity or union with the 
divine <i>essence</i>—but by a transformation into the divine <i>likeness</i>. 
Thus you see how God differs from other spirits—angels and souls of men. He is a 
Spirit of transcendent excellence, the "<i>Father </i>of spirits."</p>
<p align="justify">Against this Vorstius and the <i>Anthropomorphites </i>
object, that, in Scripture, a human shape and figure is given to God; he is said 
to have eyes and hands.</p>
<p align="justify">It is contrary to the nature of a spirit to have a corporeal 
substance. "Handle me, and see me: for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you 
see me have." <i>Bodily </i>members are ascribed to God, not properly—but <i>
metaphorically</i>, and in a borrowed sense. By the <i>right hand </i>of the 
Lord is meant his power; by the <i>eyes </i>of the Lord is meant his wisdom. Now 
that God is a Spirit, and is not capable of bodily shape or substance, is clear, 
for a body is visible—but God is invisible; therefore he is a Spirit. "Whom no 
man has seen, nor can see;" not by an eye of sense. A body is local, can be but 
in one place at once—but God is everywhere, in all places at once; therefore he 
is a Spirit. Psalm 139:9, 8. God's center is everywhere, and his circumference 
is nowhere. A body being compounded of integral parts may be dissolved; but the 
Godhead is not capable of dissolution. He can have no end—from whom all things 
have their beginning. So that it clearly appears that God is a Spirit, which 
adds to the perfection of his nature.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: If God is a Spirit, then he is <i>impenetrable</i>;</p></b></font> 
he is not capable of being hurt. Wicked men set up their banners, and bend their 
forces against God; they are said to <i>fight against God</i>. But what will 
this fighting avail? What hurt can they do to the Deity? God is a Spirit, and 
therefore cannot receive any hurtful impression. Wicked men may <i>imagine evil</i> 
against the Lord. "What do you imagine against the Lord?" But God being a Spirit 
is impenetrable. The wicked may eclipse his <i>glory</i>—but cannot touch his <i>
essence</i>. God can hurt his enemies—but they cannot hurt him. Julian might 
throw up his dagger into the air against Heaven—but could not touch the Deity.

<p align="justify">God is a Spirit, <i>invisible</i>. How can the wicked with 
all their forces hurt him, when they cannot see him? Hence all the attempts of 
the wicked against God are foolish, and prove abortive. "The kings of the earth 
set themselves against the Lord and against his anointed. He who sits in the 
heavens shall laugh." God is a Spirit, he can wound them—but they cannot touch 
him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If God is a Spirit, it shows the folly of the 
Papists, who worship him by pictures and images.</p></b></font> As a spirit, we 
cannot make any image to represent him. Deut 4:12, "The Lord spoke to you out of 
the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice."
<p align="justify">God being a Spirit is imperceptible, cannot be discerned; how 
then can there be any picture made of him? Isa 40:18, "To whom, then, can we 
compare God? What image might we find to resemble him?" How can you paint the 
Deity? Can we make an image of that which we never saw? You saw no image. God is 
a Spirit. It were folly to endeavor to make a picture of the soul, because it is 
a thing spiritual, or to paint the angels, because they are spirits.</p>
<p align="justify">God is also an <i>omnipresent </i>Spirit; he is present in 
all places "Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the Lord." Therefore, being 
everywhere present, it is absurd to worship him by an image. Were it not a 
foolish thing to bow down to the king's picture, when the king is present? So it 
is to worship God's image, when God himself is present.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">How then shall we conceive of God as a Spirit, if we may make 
no image or resemblance of him?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">We must conceive of him <i>spiritually</i>. In his <i>
attributes</i>; his holiness, justice, and goodness, which are the beams by 
which his divine nature shines forth. We must conceive of him as he is in 
Christ. "Christ is the image of the invisible God." Set the eyes of your faith 
on Christ as God-man. In Christ we see some sparklings of the divine glory; in 
him there is the exact resemblance of all his Father's excellencies. The wisdom, 
love, and holiness of God the Father, shine forth in Christ. "He who has seen 
me, has seen the Father."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: If God is a Spirit, it shows us that the more 
spiritual we grow, the more we grow like to God.</p></b></font> How do earth and 
spirit agree? Phil 3:19. Earthly ones may give for their insignia, the <i>mole
</i>or <i>rat,</i> which live in the earth. What resemblance is there between an 
earthly heart, and him who is a Spirit? The more spiritual anyone is, the more 
like God.
<b>
<p align="justify">What is it to be spiritual?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">To be refined and holy, to have the heart still in heaven, to 
be thinking of God and glory, and to be carried up in a fiery chariot of love to 
God. Psalm 73:35. "Whom have I in heaven but you?" which Beza paraphrases thus, 
"Begone earth! Oh that I were in heaven with you!" A Christian, who is taken off 
from these earthly things, has a noble spiritual soul, and most resembles him 
who is a Spirit.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: It shows that the worship which God requires of us, 
and is most acceptable to him, is spiritual worship.</p></b></font> "True worshipers 
will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers 
the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and 
in truth." John 4:23-24. Spiritual worship is pure worship. Though God will have 
the service of our bodies, our eyes and hands lifted up, to testify to others 
that reverence we have of his glory and majesty—yet he will chiefly have the 
worship of the soul. "Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit." God prizes 
spirit-worship, because it comes near to his own nature, which is a Spirit.
<b>
<p align="justify">What is it to worship God in spirit?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) To worship him without ceremonies. The ceremonies of the 
law, which God himself ordained, are now abrogated, and out of date. Christ the
<i>substance </i>being come, the <i>shadows </i>fly away; and therefore the 
apostle calls the legal ceremonies, carnal rites. If we may not use those Jewish 
ceremonies which God once appointed, then we may not use those which he never 
appointed.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To worship God in spirit, is to worship him with faith 
in the blood of the Messiah. Heb 10:19. It is to worship him with the utmost 
zeal and intenseness of soul. This is to worship God in spirit. The more 
spiritual any service is, the nearer it comes to God, who is a Spirit, and the 
more excellent it is. The <i>spiritual </i>part of duty is the <i>fat </i>of the 
sacrifice: it is the soul and quintessence of true religion. The richest 
cordials are made of spirits, and the best duties are such as are of a spiritual 
nature. God is a Spirit, and will be worshiped in spirit; it is not <i>pomp </i>
of worship—but <i>purity</i>, which God accepts. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Repentance </p></i>is not in the outward severities used to the 
body—such as penance, fasting, and chastising the body—but it consists in the 
sacrifice of a broken heart. <i>Thanksgiving </i>does not stand in church-music, 
the melody of an organ—but rather in making melody in the heart to the Lord. Eph 
5:19. <i>Prayer </i>is not the tuning the voice into a heartless confession, or 
counting over a few prayer beads—but it consists in sighs and groans, Rom 8:26. 
When the <i>fire of fervency </i>is put to the incense of prayer—then it ascends 
as a sweet fragrance to God. The true <i>holy water</i> is not that which the 
pope sprinkles—but is distilled from the penitent eye. Spirit-worship best 
pleases that God who is a Spirit. John 4:23, "True worshipers will worship the 
Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father 
seeks." See the great acceptance of such, and how God is delighted with 
spiritual worship. This is the savory meat which God loves. How few mind this! 
They give him more dregs than souls; they think it enough to bring their 
duties—but not their hearts; which makes God disclaim the very services he 
himself appointed. Isa 1:12. Ezek 33:31. Let us then give God spirit-worship, 
which best suits his nature.
<p align="justify">A sovereign elixir full of virtue may be given in a few 
drops. So a <i>little </i>prayer, if it be with the heart and spirit, may have 
much virtue and efficacy in it. The publican made but a short prayer, "God be 
merciful to me a sinner," but it was full of life and spirit; it came from the 
heart, therefore it was accepted by God.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Let us pray to God, that as he is a Spirit, so he 
will give us of his Spirit. </p></b></font>The essence of God is incommunicable; but 
not the motions, the presence and influences of his Spirit. When the <i>sun </i>
shines in a room, not the body of the sun is there—but the light, heat, and 
influence of the sun. God has made a promise of his Spirit. "I will put my 
Spirit within you." Turn <i>promises </i>into prayers. "O Lord, you who are a 
Spirit, give me of your Spirit; I beg your Spirit, your enlightening, 
sanctifying, quickening, Spirit." Melanchthon prayed, "Lord, inflame my soul 
with your Holy Spirit." How needful is his Spirit! We cannot do any duty without 
it, in a lively manner. When this <i>wind </i>blows upon our sails—we move 
swiftly towards heaven. Let us pray, therefore, that God would give us of the 
influence of his Spirit, that we may move more vigorously in the sphere of true 
religion.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use six: As God is a Spirit, so the REWARDS that he gives are 
spiritual. </p></b></font>As the chief blessings he gives us in this life are 
spiritual blessings, Eph 1:1, not gold and silver; as he gives Christ, his love; 
he fills us with grace; so the main rewards he gives us after this life are 
spiritual, "a crown of glory which does not fade away." Earthly crowns fade—but 
the believer's crown being spiritual, is immortal, a never-fading crown. "It is 
impossible," says one, "for that which is spiritual, to be subject to change or 
corruption." This may comfort a Christian in all his labors and sufferings; he 
lays out himself for God, and has little or no reward here; but remember, God, 
who is a Spirit, will give <i>spiritual </i>rewards—a sight of his face in 
heaven, white robes, an eternal weight of glory! Be not then weary of God's 
service; think of the spiritual reward, the crown of glory which does not fade 
away.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">III. What kind of Spirit is God?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer: God is <b>infinite</b>. All created beings are 
finite. Though infinity may be applied to all God's attributes—he is infinitely 
merciful, infinitely wise, infinitely holy—yet, if we take infinity it implies 
God's <b>omnipresence</b>.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">1. The OMNIPRESENCE of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The Greek word for "infinite" signifies "without bounds or 
limits." <i>God is not confined to any <b>place</b></i>. He is infinite, and so 
is present in all places at once. His center is everywhere. "In no place is 
God's Being either confined or excluded," Augustine. "Behold, the heaven and 
heaven of heavens cannot contain you." The Turks build their temples open at the 
top, to show that God cannot be confined to them—but is in all places by his 
presence. God's essence is not limited either to the regions above, or to the 
terrestrial globe—but is everywhere. As philosophers say of the soul, "the soul 
is in every part of the body," in the eye, heart, foot; so we may say of God, 
his essence is everywhere; his circuit is in heaven, and in earth, and sea, and 
he is in all places of his circuit at once. "This is to be infinite." God, who 
bounds everything else, is himself without bounds. He sets bounds to the sea, 
"Hitherto shall you come, and no further!" He sets bounds to the angels; they, 
like the cherubim, move and stand at his appointment, but he is infinite, 
without bounds. He who can span the heavens, and weigh the earth in scales, must 
needs be infinite!</p>
<p align="justify">Vorstius maintains that God is in all places at once—but not 
in regard of his essence; but by his virtue and influence: as the body of the 
sun is in heaven, it only sends forth its beams and influences to the earth; or 
as a king, who is in all places of his kingdom <i>authoritatively</i>, by his 
power and authority—but he is personally on his throne.</p>
<p align="justify">God, who is infinite, is in all places at once, not only by 
his <i>influence</i>—but by his <i>essence</i>; for, if his essence fills all 
places, then he must needs be there in person. Jer 23:34. "Do not I fill heaven 
and earth?"</p>
<p align="justify">But does not God say that heaven is his throne? Isa 66:6.</p>
<p align="justify">It is also said, that a humble heart is his throne. The 
humble heart is his throne, in regard to his <i>gracious </i>presence; and 
heaven is his throne, in regard to his <i>glorious </i>presence; and yet neither 
of these thrones will hold him, for the heaven of heavens cannot contain him.</p>
<p align="justify">But if God is infinite in all places—he is in <i>impure </i>
places, and mingles with impurity.</p>
<p align="justify">Though God is in all places, in the <i>heart of a sinner </i>
by his inspection, and in <i>hell </i>by his justice—yet he does not mingle with 
the impurity, or receive the least tincture of evil. "The divine nature does not 
intermix with created matter, nor is contaminated by its impurities," Augustine. 
No more than the sun shining on a dunghill is defiled, or its beauty spotted; or 
than Christ going among sinners was defiled, whose Godhead was a sufficient 
antidote against infection.</p>
<p align="justify">God must needs be infinite in all places at once, not only in 
regard to the simplicity and purity of his nature—but in regard to his power, 
which being so glorious, who can set bounds to him, or prescribe him a circuit 
to walk in? It is as if the drop should limit the ocean, or a candle set bounds 
to the sun.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: If God is infinite, present in all places at once, 
then it is certain he governs all things in his own person</p></b></font>, and needs 
no proxies or deputies to help him to carry on his government. He is in all 
places in an instant, and manages all affairs both in the earth and heaven. A 
king cannot be in all places of his kingdom in his own person, therefore he is 
forced to govern by deputies and viceregents, and they often pervert justice. 
But God, being infinite, needs no deputies, he is present in all places, he sees 
all with his own eyes, and hears all with his own ears; he is everywhere in his 
own person, therefore is fit to be the judge of the world; he will do everyone 
right.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If God is infinite by his omnipresence, then see the 
greatness and immenseness of the divine majesty! </p></b></font>What a great God do 
we serve! "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, and the glory, and the majesty, and 
you are exalted as head above all." Well may the Scripture display the greatness 
of his glory, who is infinite in all places. He transcends our weak conceptions; 
how can our finite understanding comprehend him who is infinite? He is 
infinitely above all our praises. "Blessed be your glorious name, which is 
exalted above all blessing and praise." Oh what a poor nothing is man, when we 
think of God's infiniteness! As the stars disappear at the rising of the sun, 
oh, how does a man shrink into nothing, when infinite majesty shines forth in 
its glory! "The <i>nations </i>are as a drop in the bucket, or the small dust of 
the balance!" Oh, what a little of that drop are we individuals! The heathen 
thought they had sufficiently praised Jupiter when they called him <i>great 
Jupiter</i>. Of what immense majesty is God, who fills all places at once!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: If God is infinite, filling heaven and earth, see 
what a full portion the saints have. They have him who is infinite for their 
portion! </p></b></font>His fullness is an infinite fullness; and he is infinitely 
sweet, as well as infinitely full. If a cup is filled with wine, there is a 
sweet fullness—but still it is finite; but God is a sweet fullness, and it is 
infinite. He is infinitely full of beauty and of love. His riches are called <i>
unsearchable</i>, because they are infinite, Eph 3:8. Stretch your thoughts as 
much as you can, there is that in God which exceeds; it is an infinite fullness. 
He is said to do abundantly for us, above all that we can ask. "Now to him who 
is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his 
power that is at work within us," Ephesians 3:20. What can an ambitious person 
ask? He can ask crowns and kingdoms, millions of worlds; but God can give more 
than we can <i>ask</i>, nay, more than we can <i>imagine</i>, because he is 
infinite!
<p align="justify">We can imagine—what if all the dust were turned to 
silver—what if every flower were a ruby—what if every sand in the sea a diamond; 
yet God can give more than we can imagine, because he is infinite.<b> Oh how 
rich are they who have the infinite God for their portion!</b> Well might David 
say, "Surely I have a delightful inheritance!" Psalm 16:6. </p>
<p align="justify">We may go with the bee from flower to flower—but we shall 
never have full satisfaction until we come to the infinite God! Jacob said: "I 
have enough!" In the Hebrew it is, "I have all!" because he had the infinite God 
for his portion! Gen 33:11. God being an infinite fullness, there is no fear of 
lack for any of the heirs of heaven. Though there are millions of saints and 
angels, who have a share in God's riches—yet he has enough for them all, because 
he is infinite! Though a thousand men behold the sun—there is light enough for 
them all. Put ever so many buckets into the sea—there is water enough to fill 
them. Though an innumerable company of saints and angels are to be filled out of 
God's fullness—yet God, being infinite, has enough to satisfy them. God has land 
enough to give to all his heirs. There can be no lack, in that which is 
infinite.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: If God is infinite, he fills all places, and is 
everywhere present. </p></b></font>This is dreadful to the wicked. God is their 
enemy, and they cannot escape him, nor flee from him, for he is everywhere 
present! They are never out of his eye, nor out of his reach. "Your hand shall 
find out all your enemies." What caves or thickets can men hide in—that God 
cannot find them? Go where they will, he is present. "Where shall I flee from 
your presence?" If a man owes a debt to another he may make his escape, and flee 
into another land, where the creditor cannot find him. "But where shall I flee 
from <i>your </i>presence?" God is infinite, he is in all places; so that he 
will find out his enemies and punish them!
<p align="justify">But is it not said that "Cain went out from the presence of 
the Lord?" Gen 4:16.</p>
<p align="justify">The meaning is, he went out from the church of God, where the 
visible signs of God's presence were, and where God in a special manner 
manifested his sweet presence to his people; but Cain could not go out of God's 
sight; for God being infinite is everywhere present. Sinners can escape from 
neither an accusing conscience, nor from a revenging God!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: If God is everywhere present, then for a Christian 
to walk with God is not impossible. </p></b></font>God is not only in heaven—but he 
is in earth too. Heaven is his throne, there he sits; the earth is his 
footstool, there he stands. He is everywhere present, therefore we may come to 
walk with God. "Enoch walked with God." If God was confined to heaven, a 
trembling soul might think, "How can I converse with God, how can I walk with 
him who lives above the upper region?" But God is not confined to heaven; he is 
omnipresent; he is <i>above </i>us—yet he is <i>about </i>us, he is <i>near </i>
to us. "He is not far from each one of us." Acts 17:27. He is not far from the 
assembly of the saints, "God has taken His place in the divine assembly," Psalm 
82:1. He is present with us, God is in everyone of us; so that here on earth we 
may walk with God. 
<p align="justify">In heaven the saints <i>rest </i>with him, on earth they <i>
walk </i>with him. To walk with God is to walk by faith. We are said to "draw 
near to God," Heb 10:22, and to see him, Heb 11:27, "As seeing him who is 
invisible," and to have fellowship with him. 1 John 1:3, "Our fellowship is with 
the Father." Thus we may take a turn with him every day by faith. It is 
slighting God not to walk with him. If a king was in our presence, it would be 
slighting him to neglect him, and play with the pet. There is no walk in the 
world so sweet as to walk with God. "They shall walk in the light of your 
countenance." "Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord." It is like walking 
among beds of spices, which send forth a fragrant perfume.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use six: If God is infinite in his glorious essence, learn to 
admire—where you cannot fathom. </p></b></font>The angels wear a veil, they cover 
their faces, as adoring this infinite majesty. Isa 6:6. Elijah wrapped himself 
in a mantle when God's glory passed by. Admire—where you cannot fathom. "Can you 
by searching find out God?" Here on earth, we see some beams of his glory, we 
see him in the looking-glass of the creation; we see him in his picture—his 
image shines in the saints. But who can search out all his essential glory? What 
angel can measure these pyramids? "Can you by searching find out God?" He is 
infinite. We can no more search out his infinite perfections, than a man upon 
the top of the highest mountain can take a star in his hand! Oh, have 
God-admiring thoughts! Adore where you cannot fathom!
<p align="justify">There are many mysteries in nature which we cannot fathom; 
why the sea should be higher than the earth—yet not drown it; why the Nile 
should overflow in summer, when, by the course of nature, the waters are lowest. 
"As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a 
mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all 
things." Ecclesiastes 11:5. If these things perplex us, how may the infinite 
mystery of the Deity transcend our most raised intellectuals! Ask the 
geometrician, if he can, with a ruler, measure the heavens. Just so—we are 
unable to measure the infinite perfections of God. In heaven we shall see God <i>
clearly</i>—but not <i>fully</i>, for he is infinite. He will communicate 
himself to us, according to the capacity of our vessel—but not the immenseness 
of his nature. Adore then where you cannot fathom!</p>
<p align="justify">If God is infinite in all places, let us not limit him. "They 
limited the Holy One of Israel." <i>It is limiting God to confine him within the 
narrow compass of our reason. </i>Reason thinks God must go such a way to work, 
or the business will never be effected. This is to limit God to our reason; 
whereas he is infinite, and his ways are past finding out. In the deliverance of 
the church, it is limiting God, either to set him a time, or prescribe him a 
method for deliverance. God will deliver Zion—but he will be left to his own 
liberty; he will not be tied to a place, to a time, or to an instrument, which 
were to limit him, and then he would not be infinite. God will go his own way, 
he will confound human reason, he will work by improbabilities, he will save in 
such a way, as we think would destroy. Now he acts like himself, like an 
infinite wonder-working God. "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and 
knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing 
out!" Romans 11:33. <br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">2. The OMNISCIENCE of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. 
Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must 
give account." Hebrews 4:13. "The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions 
are weighed." Glorious things are spoken of God; he transcends our thoughts, and 
the praises of angels. <i>God's glory lies chiefly in his <b>attributes</b>, 
which are the several beams by which the divine nature shines forth. </i>Among 
other of his orient excellencies, this is not the least—"the Lord is a God of 
knowledge;" or as the Hebrew word is, "A God of knowledges." He has a full idea 
and cognisance of all things; the world is to him a transparent body. He makes a 
heart-anatomy. "I am he who searches the thoughts and the heart." The clouds are 
no canopy, the night is no curtain—to draw between us and his sight. "Even in 
darkness I cannot hide from you. To you the night shines as bright as day. 
Darkness and light are both alike to you." </p>
<p align="justify">There is not a <b>word </b>we whisper but God hears it. 
"There is not a word in my tongue—but lo, O Lord, you know it altogether." There 
is not the most subtle <b>thought </b>that comes into our mind—but God perceives 
it. "I know their thoughts." Thoughts speak as loud in God's ears—as words do in 
ours. All our <b>actions</b>, though ever so subtly contrived, and secretly 
conducted, are visible to the eye of Omniscience. "I know their works." Achan 
hid the Babylonish garment in the earth—but God brought it to light. Minerva was 
drawn in such curious colors, and so lively pencilled, that whichever way one 
turned, Minerva's eyes were upon him. Just so, whichever way we turn ourselves, 
God's eye is upon us! </p>
<p align="justify">"<i>Him who is perfect in knowledge</i>." God knows whatever 
is knowable; he knows future contingencies. He foretold Israel's coming out of 
Babylon, and the virgin's conceiving. By this the Lord proves the truth of his 
Godhead, against idol gods. "Tell us the coming events, then we will know that 
you are gods." The perfection of God's knowledge is primary. He is the original, 
the pattern, and prototype of all knowledge; others borrow their knowledge of 
him; the angels light their lamps at this glorious sun. </p>
<p align="justify">God's knowledge is <b>pure</b>. It is not contaminated with 
the object. Though God knows sin—yet it is to hate and punish it. No evil can 
mix or incorporate with his knowledge, any more than the sun can be defiled with 
the vapors which arise from the earth. God's knowledge is facile; it is without 
any difficulty. We study and search for knowledge. Prov 2:2. "If you <i>seek </i>
for her as for silver." The lamp of God's knowledge is so infinitely bright, 
that all things are intelligible to him.</p>
<p align="justify">God's knowledge is <b>infallible</b>; there is no mistake in 
His knowledge. Human knowledge is subject to error. A physician may mistake the 
treatment of a disease; but God's knowledge is unerring. He can neither deceive, 
nor be deceived. He cannot deceive--because he is truth; nor be deceived—because 
He has infinite wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify">God's knowledge is <b>instantaneous</b>. Our knowledge is 
successive, one thing after another. We argue from the effect to the cause. God 
knows things past, present, and to come—at once; they are all before him in one 
entire prospect.</p>
<p align="justify">God's knowledge is <b>retentive</b>; he never loses any of 
his knowledge; he <i>remembers </i>as well as <i>understands</i>. Many things 
elapse out of our minds—but God's knowledge is eternalized. Things transacted a 
thousand years ago, are as fresh to him as if they were done but the last 
minute. Thus he is perfect in knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify">But is it not said, "I will go down and see if what they have 
done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. Then I will know."</p>
<p align="justify">It could not be that God was ignorant; because there is 
mention made of a cry; but the Lord speaks there <i>after the manner of a judge</i>, 
who will first examine the cause before he passes the sentence. When he is upon 
a work of justice he is not in a hurry, as if he did not care where he hits; but 
he goes straight against offenders. "He lays judgement to the line, and 
righteousness to the plummet."</p>
<p align="justify">Hos 13:12, "The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up, his sin is 
hid." ("The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record." <i>NIV 
translation</i>.)</p>
<p align="justify">Not that his sin is hid from God—but his sin is hid; that is<i>—the 
sins of Ephraim have been collected and stored away for punishment. </i>That 
this is the meaning, is clear by the foregoing words, his iniquity is <i>
collected</i>. As the clerk of the court binds up the indictments of malefactors 
in a bundle, and at the trial brings out the indictments and reads them in 
court; so God binds up men's sins in a bundle, and, at the day of judgment, 
this bundle shall be opened, and all their sins brought to light before men and 
angels!</p>
<p align="justify">God is <b>infinite </b>in knowledge. He cannot but be so; for 
he who gives being to things, must needs have a clear inspection of them. "He 
who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not 
see?" He who makes a watch or engine, knows all the workmanship in it. God, who 
made the heart, knows all its movements. He is full of eyes, like Ezekiel's 
wheels, and, as Austin says, <i>Totus oculus</i>, "All eye." It ought to be so; 
for he is the "Judge of all the world." There are so many causes to be brought 
before him, and so many people to be tried, that he must have a perfect 
knowledge, or he could not do justice. A human judge cannot proceed without a 
jury, the jury must search the cause, and give in the verdict; but God can judge 
without a jury. He knows all things in and of himself, and needs no witnesses to 
inform him. A human judge judges only matters of <i>fact</i>—but God judges the
<i>heart</i>. He not only judges wicked <i>actions</i>—but wicked <i>designs</i>. 
He sees the treason of the heart, and punishes it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: </p></b></font>Is God infinite in knowledge? Is he 
light, and in him is there no darkness? <font color="#008000"><b>Then how unlike

seek the first principles of the oracles of God. It is sad, that after the <i>
sun of the gospel </i>has shined so long in our horizon, that the veil should 
still be upon their heart. Such as are enveloped in ignorance cannot give God a 
reasonable service. Rom 12:2. <b>Ignorance is the nurse of impiety. </b>The 
schoolmen say, "Every sin is founded upon ignorance". Jer 9:3, "They proceed 
from one evil to another, and they do not take Me into account." Where ignorance 
reigns in the understanding, lust rages in the affections. Prov 19:2, "That the 
mind be without knowledge, it is not good." Such have neither faith nor fear: no 
faith; for knowledge carries the torch before faith. "Those who know your name 
shall put their trust in you." A man can no more believe without knowledge, than 
the eye can see without light. He can have no fear of God; for how can they fear 
him whom they do not know? The covering of Haman's face was a sad presage of 
death. When people's minds are covered with ignorance, it is a covering of the 
face, which is a fatal forerunner of destruction. "The ox knows its owner, and 
the donkey its master’s feeding-trough, but Israel does not know; My people do 
not understand." Isaiah 1:3

<p align="justify">Use two: If God is a God of infinite knowledge, then see the 
folly of hypocrisy.</p></b></font> "Hypocrites do not actually <i>do </i>good, they 
merely make a <i>show </i>of it," Melanchthon. They carry it fair with men—but 
care not how bad their hearts are; they live in secret sin. "They say—How can 
God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?" Psalm 73:11. "What does God know? 
Can He judge through thick darkness?" Job 22:13 "God has forgotten, he hides his 
face, he will never see it." But, "His understanding is infinite!" He has a 
window to look into men's hearts! He has a key to open up the heart; he beholds 
all the sinful workings of men's spirits, as in a glass bee-hive we can see the 
bees working in their combs. Matt 6:6, "Your Father who sees in secret." God 
sees in secret. As a merchant enters debts in his book, so God has his 
debt-book, in which he enters every sin. Jeroboam's wife disguised herself, so 
that the prophet would not know her; but he discerned her. "When Ahijah heard 
her footsteps at the door, he called out—Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you 
pretending to be someone else? I have bad news for you!" 1 Kings 14:6. The 
hypocrite thinks to disguise and juggle with God—but God will unmask him. "God 
shall bring every work into judgement, with every secret thing." "For they have 
done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their 
neighbors' wives and in my name have spoken lies, which I did not tell them to 
do. <b>I know it and am a witness to it</b>—declares the Lord." Jeremiah 29:23
<p align="justify">Ay—but the hypocrite hopes he shall color over his sin, and 
make it look very good. Absalom masks over his treason with the pretense of a 
religious vow. Judas cloaks his envy at Christ, and his covetousness, with the 
pretense of "charity to the poor." Jehu makes religion a cloak for his selfish 
design. But God sees through these fig-leaves! You may see a jade under his gilt 
trappings. "My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is 
their sin concealed from my eyes. Jeremiah 16:17. <b>He who has an <i>eye </i>to 
see—will find a <i>hand </i>to punish!</b></p>
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Use three: Is God so infinite in knowledge? Then we should 
always feel as under his omniscient eye. </p></font>"We ought to live as if 
always in full view of God," Seneca. Let us place David's prospect before our 
eye, "I have set the Lord always before me." Seneca counseled Lucilius, that 
whatever he was doing, he should imagine some of the Roman nobles stood before 
him, and then he would do nothing dishonorable. The consideration of God's 
omniscience would be preventive of much sin. The eye of <i>man </i>will restrain 
from sin; and will not <i>God's eyes </i>much more? "Will he even assault the 
queen right here in the palace, <i>before my very eyes? </i>the king roared." 
Esther 7:8. Will we sin when our Judge looks on? Would men speak so vainly, if 
they considered God overheard them? 
<p align="justify">Latimer took heed to every word in his examination, when he 
heard the pen write behind the curtains. Just so, what care would people have of 
their words, if they remembered that God heard, and his pen was writing 
everything down in heaven? Would people commit immorality, if they believed God 
was a spectator of their wickedness, and would make them do penance in hell for 
it? Would they defraud in their dealings, and use false weights, if they knew 
God saw them, and for making their weights lighter would make their damnation 
heavier?</p>
<p align="justify">Viewing ourselves as under the eye of God's omniscience, 
would cause reverence in the worship of God. God sees the frame and demeanor of 
our hearts, when we come before him. How would this call in our straggling 
thoughts? How would it animate and invigorate duty? It would make us put <i>fire
</i>to the incense. We must worship God with the utmost zeal and intenseness of 
spirit. To think that <i>God is in this place </i>would add <i>wings </i>to 
prayer, and <i>oil </i>to the flame of our devotion!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Is God's knowledge infinite? Study sincerity, be 
what you seem.</p></b></font> "The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. 
Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart." 1 Samuel 
16:7. <b>Men judge the heart by the actions. God judges the actions by the 
heart. </b>If the heart is sincere, God will see the <i>faith </i>and bear with 
the <i>failing</i>. Asa had his blemishes—but his heart was right with God. God 
saw his <i>sincerity</i>, and pardoned his <i>infirmity</i>. Sincerity in a 
Christian is like chastity in a wife, which excuses many failings. Sincerity 
makes our duties acceptable, like musk among linen, which perfumes it. As Jehu 
said to Jehonadab, "Is your heart right with me? And he said, It is. If it 
is—give me your hand; and he took him up into the chariot." Just so, if God sees 
that our heart is right, that we love him, and aim at his glory—he says, "Give 
me your prayers and tears; now you shall come up with me into the chariot of 
glory!" Sincerity makes our services to be golden, and God will not cast away 
the gold, though it may lack some weight. Is God omniscient, and his eye chiefly 
upon the heart? Wear the <i>belt of truth</i> about you, and never leave it off.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Is God a God of infinite knowledge? Then there is 
comfort</p></b></font>, (1.) To the saints in particular. (2.) To the church in 
general.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Comfort to SAINTS in particular. </p></b>In case of private 
devotion. Christian, you set hours apart for God, your thoughts run upon him as 
your treasure; God takes notice of every good thought. "He had a book of 
remembrance written for those who thought upon his name." You enter into your 
closet, and pray to your Father in secret; he hears every sigh and groan! "My 
groaning is not hidden from you." You water the seed of your prayer with 
tears—God bottles every tear! "You keep track of all my sorrows. You have 
collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book!" 
Psalm 56:8. When the secrets of all hearts shall be opened, God will make an 
honorable mention of the zeal and devotion of his people, and he himself will be 
the herald of their praises. "Then shall every man have praise of God."
<p align="justify">The infiniteness of God's knowledge is a comfort, in the case 
of saints who have not a clear knowledge of themselves. They find so much 
corruption, that they judge they have no grace. "If it is so--why am I thus? If 
I have grace, why is my heart in so dead and earthly a frame?" Oh remember, God 
is of infinite knowledge—he can spy grace where you cannot; he can see grace 
hidden under corruption, as the stars may be hidden behind a cloud. God can see 
that holiness in you, which you can not discern in yourself. He can spy <i>the 
flower of grace </i>in you, though overtopped with weeds. "Because there is some 
good thing in him." God sees some good thing in His people--when they can see no 
good in themselves; and though they judge themselves harshly, He will forgive 
their sins and infirmities!</p>
<p align="justify">It is comfort in respect of personal injuries. It is the 
saints' lot to suffer. The <i>head </i>being crowned with thorns, the <i>feet
</i>must not tread upon roses. If saints find a real purgatory, it is in this 
life; but this is their comfort—that God sees the wrong which is done to them; 
the pupil of his eye is touched, and is he not sensible of it? Paul was scourged 
by cruel hands. "Thrice was I beaten with rods;" as if you should see a slave 
whip the king's son! God beholds it. "I know their sorrows." The wicked make 
wounds in the backs of the saints, and then pour in vinegar; but God writes down 
their cruelty. Believers are a part of Christ's mystical body; and for every 
drop of a saint's blood spilt—God puts a drop of wrath in his vial!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Comfort to the CHURCH of God in general. </p></b>If God is a 
God of knowledge, he sees all the plots of the enemies against Zion, and can 
make them abortive. The wicked are treacherous, having borrowed their skill from 
the old serpent! They dig deep, to hide their counsels from God—but he sees 
them, and can easily counterwork them. The dragon is described with <i>seven 
heads</i>—to show how he plots against the church; but God is described with <i>
seven eyes—</i>to show that he sees all the plots and stratagems of the enemies; 
and when they deal treacherously, he can easily confound them. "Come," says 
Pharaoh, "let us deal wisely." But he never more played the fool, than when he 
thought to deal wisely. "During the last watch of the night the Lord <i>looked
</i>down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army, and threw it 
into confusion." Exodus 14:24. How may this, like sap in the vine, comfort the 
church of God in her earthly state! The Lord has an eye in all the councils and 
machinations of the enemy; he sees them in their efforts, and can blow them up 
in their own mine!
