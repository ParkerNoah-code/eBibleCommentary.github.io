    "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of our great God 
    and Savior, Jesus Christ." Titus 2:13</p>
<p align="justify">A Christian's chief happiness is in in the future. A 
    saint in this life, is an expectant of heaven; he has little in <i>hand</i>—but 
    much in <i>hope</i>. So says the text, "looking for that blessed hope." 
    There is enough to make us breathe after that hope, if we look either 
    internally or externally.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Internally</p></i>, if we turn our eyes inward and behold our 
    sins. This made Paul himself cry out, "O wretched man that I am!" Romans 
    7:24. A Christian has two men within him—flesh and spirit. This may make him 
    look for that blessed hope—when he shall be disentangled of his sins, and 
    shall be as the angels of God.
<p align="justify">If we look <i>externally</i>, if we cast our eyes abroad, 
    the world is but our sojourning-house. It is a stage whereon vanity and 
    vexation act their part, and the scene seldom alters. "Arise and depart; for 
    this is not your rest: because it is polluted!" Micah 2:10. All which 
    considered, may make us look for "that blessed hope, and the glorious 
    appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">In which words there is the <i>act</i>, "looking," and 
    the <i>object</i>, which is set down emphatically, "that blessed hope" and, 
    specifically, "the glorious appearing of the great God."</p>
<p align="justify">I begin with the first, <font color="#0000ff"><b>the act</b></font>, 
    "looking." There is a threefold looking:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There is a looking with DESIRE</p></b></font>—as the 
    servant looked for the year of jubilee and release, Leviticus 25:40, or as 
    the bride looks for the marriage day. Now is a time of absence from our 
    husband Christ; therefore, we are dressed in mourning and hang our harps 
    upon the willows. But how the spouse desires the marriage day when the 
    nuptials shall be solemnized! At that wedding, "the water shall be turned 
    into wine." How the pious soul cries out in a holy pang of desire, "How long 
    Lord! Why is Your chariot so long a-coming? Why o do the wheels of Your 
    chariot tarry?" It is the desire of the whole church, "Come Lord Jesus, come 
    quickly." Revelation 22:17.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There is a looking with JOY. </p></b></font>Romans 5:2, 
    "We <i>rejoice </i>in hope of the glory of God." There is terror in a 
    sinner's looking; it is called a <i>fearful </i>looking for of judgment, 
    Hebrews 10:27. A man in debt looks every hour when the sergeant shall arrest 
    him—but the saint's looking is a joyful looking, as a man looks for a 
    friend, or for one that is to pay him a great sum of money. So Moses looked 
    with joy "to the recompense of reward," Hebrews 11:26.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. There is a looking with PATIENCE</p></b></font>—as a man 
    casts his seed into the earth, and looks with patience until the crop 
    springs up. James 5:7, "Consider the farmers who eagerly look for the rains 
    in the fall and in the spring. They patiently wait for the precious harvest 
    to ripen. You, too, must be patient. And take courage, for the coming of the 
    Lord is near." So much for the act, looking.
<p align="justify">The second is <font color="#0000ff"><b>the object</b></font>, 
    "that blessed hope", where we are to consider <i>what hope is</i>—and <i>
    what a Christian hopes for</i>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">What is hope? </p></b></font>I answer, hope is a supernatural 
    grace planted in the heart by the Spirit of God, whereby a Christian is 
    quickened to the expectation of those things which are held forth in the 
    promise. Romans 8:25, "If we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait 
    for it with patience." Aquinas describes hope thus, "Hope is concerned with 
    a good that is hard to reach, located in the future, and open to be gained."
<p align="justify">Hope is concerned with a good. It looks at some good, so 
    it differs from fear. Fear looks at evil, hope at good.</p>
<p align="justify">Hope is concerned with a future good. It looks at some 
    good to come; so it differs from joy. Joy is exercised about something 
    present, hope about something future.</p>
<p align="justify">Hope is concerned with a good that is hard to reach. It 
    looks at some good which is difficult to attain; so hope differs from 
    desire. Desire is weak and transient; it is soon over. Hope is resolute and 
    fixed, it wrestles with difficulties and will not give up, until it has the 
    thing hoped for.</p>
<p align="justify">Hope is concerned with a good that is open to be gained. 
    It looks at some good which is feasible, and which there is possibility of 
    obtaining; so hope differs from despair. Despair looks on things with black 
    spectacles and gives all up as lost. Hope is like cork to the net, which 
    keeps the heart from sinking in despair. Thus you have seen what hope is.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <b>How does hope differ from faith?</b></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. These two graces, faith and hope, are so alike 
    that they have been taken one for the other. There is such a near affinity 
    between them that, as Luther said, it is hard to find a difference. But, 
    though they are placed near together like the two wings of the cherubim on 
    the mercy-seat, they are not the same. Indeed, in some things faith and hope 
    do agree. Both feed upon the promise; both help to support the soul in 
    trouble. Faith and hope are like two buoys put under a Christian which keep 
    him from sinking in the waters of affliction. Both of these graces, like 
    medicinal water, comfort the fainting soul. There is joy in believing, 
    Romans 15:13; and rejoicing in hope, Romans 5:2. Faith and hope, like those 
    two golden pipes, Zachariah 4:12, empty their golden oil of joy into a 
    Christian; but, though in some things these two graces agree and are 
    alike—yet in some things they differ.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith and hope differ in order and priority. Faith 
    precedes and goes before hope. Faith is the mother grace. Faith is the 
    ground of things hoped for, Hebrews 11:1. The promises are precious. They 
    are like the ark which had manna laid up in it; but we must first believe 
    the things contained in the promise, before we hope for them. Therefore, 
    Jerome said well, "Faith lights the <i>lamp of hope </i>as the fire of the 
    altar lit the lamps of the sanctuary." Thus these graces differ in priority; 
    hope is the daughter of faith.</p>
<p align="justify">They differ in their nature, and that two ways:</p>
<p align="justify">Hope only looks forward at things to come; faith looks 
    backward as well as forward. It looks at things past as well as future. 
    Faith believes Christ's death and resurrection, as well as His coming to 
    glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Hope looks at the <i>excellency </i>of the promise; faith 
    looks at the <i>certainty</i> of the promise. Hope reads over the writing of 
    the promise; faith looks at the seal of the promise. Titus 1:2, "In hope of 
    eternal life, which God that cannot lie has promised." That which hope looks 
    at, is eternal life; that which faith looks at is the infallibility of the 
    promise: God who cannot lie has promised. In a word, faith believes, hope 
    waits. Faith shows a Christian the land of promise; hope sails there with 
    patience. Thus you see how faith and hope differ—but these twins must not be 
    parted. Faith strengthens hope and hope comforts faith, as an elm supports 
    the vine, and the vine loads the elm with its fruit. Faith is the cable—and 
    hope the anchor, and both these help to keep the soul steady so that it does 
    not dash upon rocks or sink in the quicksands. This much for the first, what 
    hope is.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">What a Christian hopes for</p></b></font>. Emphatically, he 
    looks for "that blessed hope." Hope here is used as a figure for the things 
    hoped for. That blessed hope, is the hope of blessedness. A Christian's hope 
    is not in this life; then he would have forlorn hope. There is nothing here 
    to be hoped for but vicissitudes. All the world rings <i>changes</i>—but we 
    are looking for that <i>blessed </i>hope. This is the difference between the 
    seaman's anchor and the believer's anchor. The seaman casts his anchor 
    downwards; the believer casts his anchor upwards in heaven, looking for that 
    blessed hope. The believer is a rich heir, Hebrews 6:17, and he waits until 
    the royal crown shall be set upon his head.
<p align="justify">According to our common law, there are two sorts of 
    free-holds. There is a free-hold in deed and a free-hold in law. A free-hold 
    in <b>deed</b>,<b> </b>is when a man has made an entrance upon lands and 
    tenements, and has actually seized them. A free-hold in <b>law</b>,<b> </b>
    is when a man has right to lands—but has not yet made actual entrance upon 
    them. Heaven is a believers free-hold in law; he has a right to it. It is 
    promised by the Father; it is purchased by the Son; it is assured him by the 
    Holy Spirit. He does not have the free-hold in deed—but waits God's leisure, 
    and looks for that blessed hope until the time comes that he shall actually 
    enter upon possession of the inheritance.</p>
<p align="justify">The object of a Christian hope is set down 
    specifically—"the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus 
    Christ." Here, by the way, the Deity and Godhead of Christ is strongly 
    proved from hence against the Arians. The Apostle shows who this great God 
    is. It is, he says, "our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ". To speak, 
    then, of the object of a Christian's hope set down here specifically, the 
    glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">There is a threefold appearing of Christ.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There is an appearing of Christ TO us</p></b></font>; as 
    when He was incarnate. Isaiah 9:6, To us a child is born. This was a happy 
    appearing when this morning star appeared. Salvation appeared to mankind 
    when Christ took flesh, He married our human nature to the divine nature. 
    The virgin's womb was the place consecrated for tying that knot. Great is 
    the mystery—God manifest in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3:16. It is such an enigma, 
    as the angels adore, 1 Peter 1:12. God said, "the man has become as one of 
    us," Genesis 3:22—but now we may say, "God Himself has become as one of us, 
    in the likeness of men," Philippians 2:7. This was Christ's first appearing.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There is an appearing of Christ IN us</p></b></font>, that 
    is, when He appears in our hearts, which is called <i>forming Christ in us</i>, 
    Galatians 4:19. Christ is said to appear in us when, by the operation of His 
    grace, He transforms us into His own image. In the <i>incarnation</i>, 
    Christ made Himself like us. By <i>sanctification</i>, He makes us like 
    Him—holy as He is holy. What are we the better for Christ's appearing in our 
    flesh—unless He appears in our hearts? What are we the better for a Christ 
    outside us—unless we have a Christ within us? Colossians 1:27, "Christ in 
    you, the hope of glory."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. There is an appearing of Christ FOR us</p></b></font>, and 
    that two ways:
<p align="justify">First, Christ appears for us as an ADVOCATE. Hebrews 
    9:24, "He is entered into heaven, there to appear in the presence of God for 
    us." It is a metaphor borrowed from our law courts where the attorney pleads 
    for the client. So Christ pleads as an advocate for the saints. Satan is the 
    accuser—but Christ is the advocate. He answers all charges brought in, and 
    He appears, says the Apostle, in the presence of God for us. The high 
    priest, under the law, appeared before the ark and the mercy-seat, which was 
    but a type of God's presence; but Christ appears in the very presence of God 
    for us—in the face of God. He spreads His merits before His Father and, in 
    the virtue of His bloody sufferings, pleads for mercy for us. And if Christ 
    appears for us in heaven, shall not we appear for Him upon earth?</p>
<p align="justify">Second, Christ appears for the saints as a JUDGE, and 
    this appearing is meant in the text, "looking for the glorious appearing of 
    our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ." Christ's first appearing in the 
    flesh was <i>dark </i>and <i>obscure</i>. His beauty was veiled over, Isaiah 
    53:2. All who saw the <i>man</i>—did not see the <i>Messiah</i>. But His 
    second appearing as our judge will be a <i>glorious </i>appearing, like the 
    sun breaking out of a cloud. It will be a glorious appearing both in respect 
    of Christ and the saints.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, it will be a glorious appearing in respect of 
    CHRIST Himself</p></b></font>, and that three ways:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. His PERSON will be glorious. </p></b></font>That light 
    which shone upon Paul, surpassing the glory of the sun, Acts 26:13, was but 
    a glimpse of Christ's beauty, like a spark of the sun of righteousness. What 
    will it be, when He shall appear in all His spiritual embroidery?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. His THRONE will be glorious.</p></b></font> He shall sit 
    upon the throne of His glory! Matthew 25. He shall have His chair of state 
    set Him more rich than ivory or pearl, a throne more brilliant and 
    magnificent.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. His ATTENDANTS shall be glorious.</p></b></font> Matthew 
    25:31, "When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the <i>holy 
    angels </i>with Him." The angels are the courtiers of heaven. They are 
    compared to lightning, Matthew 28:3, in regard of their sparkling luster, 
    and these glorious spirits shall be Christ's attendants, part of Christ's 
    retinue, accompanying Him to His throne. Thus it will be a glorious 
    appearing in regard of Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, it will be a glorious appearing in regard of the 
    SAINTS. </p></b></font>Christ will appear to do three things:
<p align="justify">1. Christ as a judge will appear to <b>acquit </b>His 
    people, and that is by pronouncing the sentence, "Come you who are blessed 
    of My Father." The debt-book shall be crossed in the blood of the Lamb!</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ as a judge will appear to <b>vindicate </b>His 
    people. The names of the godly, many times, lie buried in reproach; but at 
    that day, they shall, as Bernard said, "Be fragrant with the finest 
    perfumes." Christ will give them a new name. He will call them His <i>
    friends</i>, His <i>spouse</i>, the <i>apple of His eye</i>. Their names 
    shall flourish with honor and give forth their perfume as the wine of 
    Lebanon.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Christ as a Judge will appear to <b>crown </b>His 
    people when body and soul shall be reunited and perfected in glory. Christ 
    will take His people into His sweet and everlasting embraces. He will lay 
    them in His bosom; He will set them upon His throne; He will fill them with 
    the inebriating wine of His love to all eternity! </p>
<p align="justify">And thus you see what is the saint's hope, namely the 
    glorious appearing of Christ, when He shall appear as a Judge to acquit, 
    vindicate, and crown them!</p>
<p align="justify">See here the misery of a wicked man who has all his hope 
    in this life. He makes the <i>wedge of gold </i>his hope; he casts his 
    anchor downwards. He can have no hope of Christ's appearing; he <i>fears </i>
    Christ's appearing. He does not <i>hope </i>for it; he is like a prisoner 
    who fears the judge's coming to the bench. Christ's appearing will be a 
    dismal appearing to him. When Christ shall appear, "what will become of the 
    ungodly and the sinner?" 1 Peter 4:18.</p>
<p align="justify">A wicked man is like a mariner at sea, who has no anchor; 
    like a man in a storm, who has no shelter. Where is his hope when he shall 
    come to die? It is with a sinner as it was with the old world when the flood 
    came. The water rose higher and higher by degrees. First, the waters came to 
    the valleys—but they fled to the hills; then the waters came to the 
    mountains. Yes—but there might be some trees upon the hills, and they would 
    climb up to them. Then the waters prevailed and rose to the top of the 
    trees. Now they had nothing to trust in; all hopes of being saved were gone.</p>
<p align="justify">So it is with a sinner. If one comfort is taken away, he 
    has another left. If a relation is gone, he has an estate left; if one 
    crutch is broken—yet he has another to lean upon. Yes—but sickness comes, 
    and he sees he must die and appear before his Judge. Now he has no hope. He 
    dies despairing; he must lie forever in the boiling furnace of God's wrath!</p>
<p align="justify">Put yourselves upon the trial: Do you have this blessed 
    hope of Christ's appearing, and of your appearing with Him in glory? Come 
    almost to any man, and you shall hear him say that he hopes to be saved. 
    Well, then, let every soul put itself upon the TRIAL.</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">1. True hope is QUICKENING.</p></font> </b>It sets a man to
    <i>working </i>for heaven. It is called a <i>living </i>hope, 1 Peter 1:3. 
    It puts life into a man. Hope is a spur to duty, a whetstone to industry. 
    Hope of victory makes the soldier fight; hope of gain makes the merchant 
    industrious. Divine hope is as wind to the sails, as wheels to the chariot; 
    it makes a Christian active in piety. He runs the ways of God's 
    commandments. Hope cuts away through rock; it wrestles with difficulties; it 
    despises dangers; it marches in the face of death! True hope never gives 
    over until it has the thing hoped for. He who has divine hope will have 
    Christ, though it is in a furnace. He will profess the truth, though the 
    next word is "Christians, to the lions."
<p align="justify">The Romans, as Tertullian observes, would endure all kind 
    of hardships. They would fight with cold and hunger, and run hazard for hope 
    at last to be <i>consul</i>, which was an honor but for a year. Oh, then, 
    what pains will he take who has hopes of heaven, where he shall be crowned 
    with a garland of glory forever! Does that man say his hope is in God who 
    stands all the day idle? Proverbs 19:24. There is a faint desire in 
    hypocrites. They would like to be saved—but sit still and do nothing. Their 
    hope is not a <i>living </i>hope—but a <i>dead </i>hope. True hope is in the 
    soul like fire, which is an active element: it is ever sparkling or flaming.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. True hope is PURIFYING.</p></b></font> 1 John 3:3, "He who 
    has this hope in Him, purifies himself." Hope is in the soul as lightning is 
    in the air; it clears the air. He who has hope in Christ, sets himself 
    against all sin, both in purpose and practice. He is a consecrated person. 
    There is engraved upon his heart, <i>"Holiness to the Lord!" </i>Hope is a 
    virgin grace; it lives in a soul. Benard compares holiness to the root—and 
    hope to the branch. True hope flourishes upon the root of holiness.
<p align="justify">Now, then, try your hope by this Scripture touchstone. 
    The hypocrite says he has hope—but is he a purified person? What! an unclean 
    person—and he hopes to go to heaven? Nothing enters there which defiles, 
    Revelation 21:27. What! a drunkard and he hopes to be saved? Do you think to 
    go reeling to heaven? What! an apostate and yet hope to be saved? As if 
    there were any going to heaven backward. The wicked man is not <i>sure </i>
    of happiness—yet remains carnally secure.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A true hope is a GOOD hope.</p></b></font> 2 Thessalonians 
    2:16, "Who has given us <i>good </i>hope through grace." A wicked man's hope 
    is as far from being good, as his heart. The Hebrew word for hope signifies 
    both confidence and folly; it is fitly applied to a wicked man's hope. His 
    confidence is folly. The hope of a godly man is compared to an <i>anchor</i>, 
    Hebrews 6:19; the hope of a wicked man is compared to a <i>spider's web</i>, 
    Job 8:14.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">The sinner's hope</p></b></font>, on the other hand, is fitly 
    compared to a spiders web three ways:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The spider's web has no foundation.</p></b></font> Such is 
    the hope of the wicked; it is a pleasing thing—but it has nothing solid to 
    rest upon. A godly man's hope is built upon a double basis.
<p align="justify">The hope of a godly man is built upon the <b>Word of God</b>. 
    Psalm 130:5, "In His word do I hope." The Word says, "Let the sinner forsake 
    his ways," and the Lord will "abundantly pardon." The Word says, "And this 
    is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us." 1 
    John 3:8. Now a child of God, finding these qualifications wrought in him, 
    builds his hope for heaven upon them. In His Word do I hope.</p>
<p align="justify">The hope of a godly man is built upon <b>biblical 
    experience</b>. Romans 5:4, "Experience works hope." A believer can bring a 
    catalogue of experiences; Psalm 119:65, "You have dealt well with your 
    servant." So can a believer say, "God has dealt well with me." In several 
    cases, he has had experiences of God. When his sins and temptations have 
    been strong, God has come in with auxiliary forces, and His grace has been 
    sufficient. When his heart has been sinking under fears, God has buoyed him 
    up out of quicksands and lifted up his head out of deep waters. Psalm 3:3, 
    "You are a shield around me, O Lord; you bestow glory on me and lift up my 
    head." When his heart has been dead in duty, the Spirit of God has been 
    sweetly tuning his soul, and now he makes melody in his heart to the Lord, 
    Ephesians 5:19.</p>
<p align="justify">A godly man has many signal experiences of God's favor to 
    him, and experience breeds hope. So that a godly man's hope has a 
    foundation; it is a well-built hope. That hope must stand strong which 
    stands with one foot upon a promise—and with the other foot upon an 
    experience. But a wicked man's hope is a spiders web. He has nothing to 
    ground his hope upon; his hope is an imposture, a golden dream. Isaiah 29:8, 
    "A hungry person dreams of eating but is still hungry. A thirsty person 
    dreams of drinking but is still faint from thirst when morning comes." </p>
<p align="justify">The hope of a sinner is like a dying man's will that has 
    neither seal set to it nor witnesses. In the will, he promises to bequeath 
    such a manner and lordship, so many thousands to such a one; but the will, 
    being without seal and witnesses, is null and void in law. Just such is the 
    hope of a wicked man. His hope promises him great matters—that Christ is 
    his, and all the privileges of heaven are his; but, alas, it is a mere 
    delusion of his false heart! When things come to be examined, he lacks both 
    seal and witnesses; he lacks the seal of the Word to confirm his title, and 
    the witness of the Spirit.<i> This is a sad thing—for a man to go to hell 
    with the hope of heaven!</i></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The spider spins the web out of her own bowels; she 
    fetches all from herself. </p></b></font>The bee fetches all from outside 
    herself; she sucks honey from the flower. The spider fetches all from within 
    herself. A true Christian, like the bee, fetches all from outside himself. 
    He sucks from the sweet flower of Christ's righteousness. Isaiah 45:24, "In 
    the Lord, I have righteousness and strength." But a wicked man, like the 
    spider, fetches all his hope from within. He spins the thread of his hope 
    out of himself—from his duties and moralities; thus his hope is like the 
    spiders web.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The spider's web is but weak</p></b></font>; the least 
    blast shakes it; the least touch breaks it. Such is the sinner's hope: the 
    least terror of conscience shakes it. Job 8:14, "whose hope shall be cut 
    off." Commonly, before a wicked man's life is cut off, his hope is cut off. 
    The godly man's hope is a good hope. It is solid and Scriptural; the other 
    is a spider's web.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A true hope is a PERSEVERING hope.</p></b></font> Hebrews 
    3:6, "Whose house are we—if we hold fast the confidence of hope firm unto 
    the end." Hope makes us endure: therefore, it is compared to an anchor which 
    holds the ship in a storm, and to a helmet, 1 Thessalonians 5:8. The helmet 
    keeps off the blow of the sword or arrow from entering. So hope is a helmet 
    keeps off the stroke from a Christian so that it shall not hurt or dismay 
    him. In time of public calamities, hope keeps the soul from sinking. Joel 
    3:16, "The Lord's voice will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem, and 
    the earth and heavens will begin to shake. But to his people, the Lord will 
    be a welcoming refuge and a strong fortress." Though heaven and earth are 
    ready to come together—yet a believer's hope abides. 
<p align="justify">A believer never casts away his anchor. The Jews were 
    prisoners in Babylon—yet <i>prisoners of hope</i>, Zachariah 9:10, "Turn to 
    your stronghold, you prisoners of hope." When a Christian is on his 
    deathbed, and all hope of life is taken away—yet his hope in God is not 
    taken away.</p>
<p align="justify">What unspeakable comfort is this to a child of God, who, 
    upon a serious trial, finds he has a well-built hope. When Christ shall 
    appear, it will be a <i>glorious </i>appearing to a believer. A Christian is 
    like a rich heir who has great lands in reversion; he has much in hope. </p>
<p align="justify">Alexander, having given away almost all he had in Greece, 
    and being asked what he had left for himself answered, "Hope." His meaning 
    was, that he hoped to conquer more kingdoms, as afterwards he did. So, if a 
    Christian's outward comforts were taken away, and one should ask him what he 
    had left, he might say, "the anchor of hope." He has a confident hope of 
    those eternal mansions which</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ has gone to prepare for him, John 14:2. When 
    Christ, who is his life, shall appear, then shall he also appear with Him in 
    glory, Colossians 3:4. Oh, what comfort is this; how may this lighten and 
    sweeten the cross! After the <i>bitter waters of Marah, </i>comes the wine 
    of paradise! After a wet spring comes a joyful harvest!</p>
<p align="justify">Be exhorted to cheerfulness. Romans 5:2, "We <i>rejoice
    </i>in hope of the glory of God." Fear begets sorrow; hope begets joy. 
    Divine hope, said Augustine, cannot be without some mixture of joy. Does a 
    Christian have hopes of heaven—and will he not rejoice? Proverbs 10:28, "The 
    hope of the righteous shall be gladness."</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But may some say, "It is <b>long </b>before we 
    shall enter upon possession of heaven, and hope deferred makes the heart 
    sick." Proverbs 13:12.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is not long. Revelation 22:12, "Behold I come 
    quickly, and my reward is with Me." This glorious reward we hope for, is 
    quickly in faith's account; <i>faith makes future things present. </i>
    Christ's coming is at hand; the bright morning star begins to appear. As a 
    telescope makes those things which are far away off seem near to the eye, so 
    faith makes Christ, heaven, and the day of recompense seem to be near. It 
    gives a kind of possession of them in this life. Oh, then, Christians, 
    rejoice! Turn your lamentations into "Hallelujahs." It is but a little 
    while—and you shall be made partakers of those blessed things you hope for. 
    Think of the <i>certainty </i>of Christ's appearing, "Behold I come"; and 
    think of the <i>speediness</i>, "I come quickly."</p>
<p align="justify">Maintain your hopes against all discouragements either of 
    fear or temptation. Christians, do not let the devil dispute you out of your 
    hopes. A soldier who has the higher ground and has gotten upon a hill, will 
    not let the enemy beat him off his ground—but will keep it to the last 
    breath. Has God set you on the higher ground? Has He raised your hopes as 
    high as heaven? Do not be beaten off your ground; maintain your hopes to the 
    last. Pray to God that He would further clear your title to heaven, that you 
    may be as Mount Zion which cannot he moved.</p>
<p align="justify">How this should make us abound in the work of the Lord! 
    He who has a well-grounded hope of heaven, how <i>fervent </i>should he be 
    in duty, how <i>zealous </i>in the cause of God! The hope of glory should 
    give spirit and animation to a Christian. If there could be grief in heaven, 
    surely it would be that we have done God no more service. What an infinite 
    disproportion there is—between our <i>work </i>and <i>reward!</i> Let divine 
    hope be as <i>oil </i>to the lamp, as <i>wind </i>to the sails—to excite and 
    to blow us forward in holy activity for God! We sow in hope. Galatians 6:9, 
    "Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we 
    faint not."</p>
<p align="justify">Let us live suitably to our hopes—in a holy, angelic 
    walking. Those who have heaven in their hopes—should have heaven in their 
    lives. Let us walk after that golden pattern which Christ has left us, "the 
    one who says he abides in Him should walk just as He walked." 1 John 2:6. As 
    we hope to have Christ's death for our <i>justification</i>, we must have 
    His life for our <i>imitation</i>. I will conclude with Philippians 1:27, 
    "Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ."</p>
