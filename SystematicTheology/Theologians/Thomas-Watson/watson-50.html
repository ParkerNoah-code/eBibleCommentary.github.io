<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>The Day of Judgment 
    Asserted</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">"Because He has appointed a day, in the which He will 
    judge the world in righteousness by that man whom He has ordained; whereof 
    he has given assurance unto all men, in that He has raised Him from the 
    dead." Acts 17:31</p>
<p align="justify">When Paul perceived the <i>idolatry </i>at Athens, "his 
    spirit was stirred in him," verse 16. His spirit was soured and embittered 
    in him. Paul was a bitter man against sin; (that anger is <i>without </i>
    sin—which is <i>against </i>sin). Or, the word may signify, he was in a 
    paroxysm, or burning fit of zeal. And zeal is such a passion as cannot be 
    either dissembled or pent up; with this fire he discharged against their 
    idolatry. "You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too 
    superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an 
    altar with this description—To the Unknown God," verses 22-23. Nor does the 
    Apostle only declaim against the false God—but declare to them the true God. 
    And he does it from the effect, "That God who made the world and all things 
    therein . . . is Lord of heaven and earth," verse 24. To create is the best 
    demonstration of a Deity. And this God, being everywhere, cannot be locally 
    confined. Acts 17:24, "He dwells not in temples made with hands." And though 
    in former times, when the veil of ignorance was drawn over the face of the 
    world, God seemed less severe—"The times of this ignorance God winked 
    at"—though He did, as it were, "overlook" them, not taking the extremity of 
    the law—yet "now He commands all men everywhere to repent," verse 30. And if 
    it is asked, "Why now repent? Why may we not take our full sleep?" the 
    reason is because now is the broad daylight of the gospel, which, as it 
    reveals sin more clearly, so it more clearly reveals judgment upon sinners, 
    "He has appointed a day in which He will judge the world."</p>
<p align="justify">These words are God's alarm to the world to awaken it out 
    of security. This is a sweet yet dreadful point. When Paul discoursed of 
    judgment to come, Felix trembled, Acts 24:25. He who is not affected with 
    this truth, has a heart of stone.</p>
<p align="justify">For the illustration of this, there are six things I 
    shall discuss:</p>
<p align="justify">1. There SHALL be a day of judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">2. WHY there must be a day of judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">3. WHEN the day of judgment shall be.</p>
<p align="justify">4. WHO shall be the Judge.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The order and the METHOD of the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The effect or CONSEQUENCE of it.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There SHALL be a day of judgment. </p></b></font>There is 
    a twofold day of judgment:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) A PARTICULAR judgment. </p></b></font>At the day of 
    death, immediately upon the soul's dissolution from the body, it has a 
    judgment passed upon it, Hebrews 9:27. "Then shall the dust return to the 
    earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God that gave it," 
    Ecclesiastes 12:7. As soon as the breath expires, the soul receives its 
    particular sentence and knows how it shall be with it to all eternity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) There is a GENERAL day of judgment</p></b></font>, which 
    is the great judgment, when the world shall be gathered together. And of 
    this the text is to be understood, "He has appointed a day in the which He 
    will judge the world." I might give you a whole jury of Scriptures giving 
    their verdict to this—but in the mouth of two or three witnesses the truth 
    will be confirmed. "God shall bring every work into judgment, with every 
    secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil," Ecclesiastes 
    12:14. "Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account 
    thereof in the day of judgment," Matthew 12:36. Now is the day of acting; 
    then will be the day of account. "For He comes, for He comes to judge the 
    earth," Psalm 96:13. The repetition denotes the certainty and infallibility 
    of His coming.
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">2. WHY there must be a day of judgment.</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1) That God may execute justice on the wicked. </p></font>
</b>Things seem to be carried on in the world, with an unequal balance. The 
    "candle of God shines upon" the wicked, Job 29:3. "Those who tempt God are 
    delivered," Malachi 3:15. Diogenes, seeing Harpalus, a thief, go on 
    prosperously, said that surely God had cast off the government of the world, 
    and did not mind how things went here below. "There shall come in the last 
    days scoffers, saying, Where is the promise of His coming?" 2 Peter 3:3-4. 
    Therefore, God will have a day of judgment to vindicate His justice. He will 
    let sinners know that long <i>forbearance, </i>is no <i>forgiveness</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) That God may exercise mercy to the godly. </p></b></font>
    Here piety is the <i>bulls-eye </i>which is shot at. Those who prayed and 
    wept had the hardest measure. Those Christians whose zeal flamed most, met 
    with the fiery trial. "For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are 
    accounted as sheep for the slaughter," Romans 8:36. "The saints," said 
    Cyprian, "are put in the winepress, and oft the blood of these grapes is 
    pressed out." God will therefore have a day of judgment that He may reward 
    all the tears and sufferings of His people. They shall have their crown and 
    throne and white robes, Revelation 7:9; though they may be losers for Him, 
    they shall lose nothing by Him.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. WHEN the day of judgment shall be.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">It is <i>certain </i>there shall be a judgment; but it is
    <i>uncertain </i>when that day shall be. The angels do not know the day, nor 
    does Christ either as He was man (Matthew 24:36; Mark 13:32). And the reason 
    why the time is not known is:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) That we may not be curious.</p></b></font> There are some 
    things which God would have us be ignorant of. "It is not for you to know 
    the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority," Acts 1:7. We 
    must not pry into God's ark, or meddle with his secrets of government. As 
    Salvian said, "It is a kind of sacrilege for any man to break into the Holy 
    of Holies and enter into God's secrets."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) God has concealed the time of judgment that we may 
    not be careless. </p></b></font>We are always to keep sentinel, having our loins 
    girded and our lamps burning, not knowing how soon that day may come upon 
    us. Augustine said, "God would have us live every day as if the last day 
    were approaching."
<p align="justify">This is the genuine use which our Savior makes of it. 
    Mark 13:32-33, "Of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels which 
    are in heaven. Take heed, watch and pray, for you know not when the time 
    is."</p>
<p align="justify">But though we cannot know <i>precisely </i>when this day 
    of the Lord shall be—yet in probability the time cannot be far off. Hebrews 
    10:37, "He who shall come will come, and will not tarry." Chrysostom had a 
    simile, "When we see an old man going on crutches, his joints weak, his 
    vital moisture dried up; though we do not know the just time when he will 
    die—yet it is sure he cannot live long because nature's stock is spent. Just 
    so, the world is decrepit and goes, as it were, upon crutches. Therefore it 
    cannot be long before the world's funeral, and the birthday of judgment."</p>
<p align="justify">The age which John wrote in was "the last <i>hour</i>," 1 
    John 2:18. Then surely the time we now live in may be called "the last <i>
    minute</i>." Psalm 96:13, "For He is coming to judge the earth." It is not 
    "He <i>shall </i>come," but "He is coming," to show how near the time is. It 
    is almost daybreak and the court is ready to sit. James 5:9, "The Judge 
    stands at the door."</p>
<p align="justify">Truly, if security, apostasy, decay of love, inundation 
    of sin, and revelation of Antichrist are made in Scripture the signs and 
    prognostications of the last day, we, having these gray hairs among us, know 
    that the day of judgment cannot be far off.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. WHO shall be the Judge?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">I answer, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus it is in the text, 
    "He will judge the world by that man whom He has ordained," that man who is 
    God-man. We must take heed of judging others; this is Christ's work. John 
    5:22, "The Father has committed all judgment unto the Son." He who once had 
    a reed put into His hand, His Father will now put a scepter into His hand. 
    He who had a purple robe put upon Him in derision shall come in His Judge's 
    robes. He who hung upon the <i>cross, </i>shall sit upon the <i>bench</i>. 
    There are two things in Christ which eminently qualify Him to be a Judge:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) Wisdom and KNOWLEDGE to understand all causes that 
    are brought before Him. </p></b></font>He is described with seven eyes in 
    Zechariah 3:9, to note His omniscience. He is like Ezekiel's wheels, full of 
    eyes, Ezekiel 10:12. Christ is a heart-searcher. He not only judges the <i>
    fact </i>but the <i>heart</i>, which no angel can do.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) STRENGTH whereby He is able to be avenged upon His 
    enemies.</p></b></font> Christ is armed with sovereignty; therefore the seven 
    stones are said to be upon one stone, Zechariah 3:9, to denote the infinite 
    strength of Christ. And He is described with seven horns, Revelation 5:6. As 
    Christ has an <i>eye </i>to see—so He has a <i>horn </i>to push; as He has 
    His <i>balance</i>—so He has His <i>sword</i>; as He has His <i>fan </i>and 
    His <i>sieve</i>—so He has His <i>lake of fire</i>, Revelation 20:10.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The order and METHOD of the trial.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Observe, (1) the summons; (2) the Judge's coming to the 
    bench; and (3) the process and trial itself.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) The summons to the court</p></b></font>, and that is by 
    the sounding of the trumpet. 1 Thessalonians 4:16, "The Lord Himself shall 
    descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with 
    the trumpet of God." Jerome said that whatever he was doing he thought he 
    heard the noise of the trumpet sounding in his ears. "Arise, you dead, and 
    come to judgment!" Note:
<p align="justify">The <b>shrillness </b>of the trumpet. It shall sound so 
    loud that the dead shall hear it!</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>efficacy </b>of the trumpet. It shall not only 
    startle the dead—but raise them out of their graves! Matthew 24:31. They who 
    will not hear the trumpet of the ministry sounding but lie dead in sin—shall 
    be sure to hear the trumpet of the archangel sounding.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) The manner of the Judge's coming to the bench. </p></b>
</font>Christ's coming to judgment will be glorious, yet dreadful.
<p align="justify">It will be <font color="#b07050"><b>glorious </b></font>
    to the godly. The Apostle calls it, Titus 2:13, "the glorious appearing of 
    the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">Christ's person shall be glorious. At His first coming in 
    the flesh His glory was veiled over, Isaiah 53:2-3; all who saw the <i>man,
    </i>did not see the <i>Messiah</i>. But His second coming will be very 
    illustrious and resplendent. He shall "come in the glory of His Father," 
    Mark 8:38. That is, He shall wear the same embroidered robes of majesty as 
    His Father.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ's attendants shall be glorious. He "shall come 
    with all His holy angels," Matthew 25:31. These sublime, seraphic spirits, 
    who for their luster are compared to lightning, Matthew 28:3, are Christ's 
    retinue. He who was led to the cross with a band of wicked soldiers, shall 
    be attended to the bench with a guard of holy angels.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ's coming to judgment will be <font color="#b07050">
<b>dreadful </b></font>to the wicked. At the coming of this Judge, there 
    will be flaming fire burning round about Him. "The Lord Jesus is revealed 
    from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. He will punish those 
    who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus," 2 
    Thessalonians 1:7-8. When God gave His law upon the mount, "there were 
    thunders and lightnings; and Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because 
    the Lord descended upon it in fire," Exodus 19:16-18. "If God was so 
    dreadful at the giving of the law, O how dreadful will He be, when He shall 
    come to require His law?" said Augustine.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) The process or the trial itself</p></b></font>, where 
    observe the universality, the formality, and the circumstances of the trial.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The UNIVERSALITY of the trial. </p></b></font>It will be a 
    very great assize; never was the like seen. "For we must <b>all </b>appear 
    before the judgment seat of Christ," 2 Corinthians 5:10. Kings and nobles, 
    councils and armies. Those who were above all trial here, will have no 
    charter of exemption granted them. They must all appear before Christ's 
    tribunal and be tried for their lives. Neither power nor policy can be a 
    subterfuge. They who refused to come to the <i>throne of grace </i>shall be 
    forced to come to the <i>throne of justice</i>. And the <i>dead </i>as well 
    as the <i>living </i>must make their appearance. Revelation 20:12, "I saw 
    the dead, both small and great, stand before God." We do not usually cite 
    men in our courts when they are dead—but at that day the dead are called to 
    the bar; and not only men but angels. Jude 6, "The angels which kept not 
    their first estate—but left their own habitation, He has reserved in 
    everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The FORMALITY of the trial</p></b></font>, which consists in 
    the opening of the books. Daniel 7:10 and Revelation 20:12, "The judgment 
    was set, and the books were opened." There are two books which shall be 
    opened:
<p align="justify">First, the book of <b>God's omniscience</b>. God not only 
    observes—but registers all our actions. Job 14:16, "You number my steps." 
    The word there "to number" signifies to write a thing into a book. It is as 
    if Job had said, "Lord, You keep Your daybook and enter down all my actions 
    into the book." We read of God's book of remembrance, Malachi 3:16. This 
    book will be produced at the last day.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, the book of <b>conscience</b>. Let there ever be 
    so much written in a book—yet, if it is clasped, it is not seen. Men have 
    their sins written in their conscience—but the book is clasped (the searing 
    of the conscience is the clasping of the book); but when this book of 
    conscience shall be unclasped at the great day, then all their hypocrisy, 
    treason, and atheism shall appear to the view of men and angels! Luke 12:3. 
    The sins of men shall be written upon their forehead, as with a pen of iron!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The CIRCUMSTANCES of the trial. </p></b></font>Where consider 
    four things, the impartiality, the exactness, the perspicuity, and the 
    supremacy.
<p align="justify">The IMPARTIALITY of the trial.<b> </b>Jesus Christ will 
    do every man justice. He will, as the text says, "judge the world in <i>
    righteousness</i>." It will be a day of equitable judgment; justice holds 
    the scales. The Thebans pictured their judges as being blind, and without 
    hands. <i>Blind</i>, that they might not respect people; and <i>without 
    hands</i>, that they might take no bribes. Christ's scepter is a scepter of 
    righteousness, Hebrews 1:8. He is no respecter of people, Acts 10:34. It is 
    not nearness of blood which prevails; many of Christ's kindred shall be 
    condemned. It is not gloriousness of profession; many shall go to hell with 
    Christ in their mouths. Matthew 7:22, "Many will say to Me in that day, 
    Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name? And in Your name cast out 
    devils? And in Your name done many wonderful works?" Yet, though they cast 
    out devils—they are cast out to the devil. It is not the <i>varnish </i>of a 
    picture that a judicious eye is taken with—but the quality of the work. It 
    is not the most shining <i>profession </i>which Christ is taken with, unless 
    he sees the special workmanship of grace in the heart drawn by the pencil of 
    the Holy Spirit. Things are not done there by politics—but in a most just 
    balance.<i> Christ has true weights for false hearts. </i>There are no 
    bribes taken in that court. The judge will not be bribed with a <i>
    hypocritical tear </i>or a <i>Judas kiss.</i></p>

<p align="justify">The EXACTNESS of the trial. It will be very critical. 
    Then will Christ <i>thoroughly </i>purge His floor, Matthew 3:12. Not a <i>
    grace </i>or a <i>sin—</i>but His winnowing fan will discover. Christ will, 
    at the day of judgment, make a heart anatomy, as the surgeon makes a 
    dissection in the body and evaluates several body parts, or as the goldsmith 
    brings his gold to the balance and touchstone to see if it is right and 
    genuine, and whether there is not a baser metal within. Thus the Lord Jesus, 
    whose eyes are as a flame of fire, Revelation 1:14, will pierce through the 
    hearts of men and see if there is the right metal within, having the image 
    and superscription of God upon it. Paint falls off in the fire. The 
    hypocrite's paint will fall off at the fiery trial. Nothing then will stand 
    us in good stead, but sincerity.</p>
<p align="justify">The CLEARNESS of the trial. Sinners shall be so clearly 
    convicted, that they shall hold up their hand at the bar and cry, "Guilty!" 
    Those words of David may be fitly applied here, "That You might be clear 
    when You judge," Psalm 51:4. The sinner himself shall clear God of 
    injustice. The Greek word for vengeance signifies "justice." God's taking <i>
    vengeance, </i>is <i>doing justice</i>. Sin makes God <i>angry</i>—but it 
    cannot make Him <i>unrighteous</i>. The wicked shall drink a sea of 
    wrath—but not sip one drop of injustice! Christ will say, "Sinner, what 
    defense can you make for yourself? Are not your sins written in the book of 
    conscience? Did you not have that book in your own keeping? Who could have 
    inserted anything into it?" Now the sinner, being self-condemned, shall 
    clear his Judge, "Lord, though I am damned—yet I have no wrong done to me. 
    You are clear when You judge."</p>
<p align="justify">The SUPREMACY of the court.<b> </b>This is the highest 
    court of judicature, from whence is no appeal. On earth, men can move their 
    cases from one place to another, from the Common Law to the Court of 
    Chancery—but from Christ's court there is no appeal. He who is once doomed 
    here—finds his condition <i>irreversible!</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The sixth and last particular, is the effect or 
    CONSEQUENCE of the trial</p></b></font>, which consists in three things:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) Separation. </p></b></font>Christ will separate the godly 
    and the wicked. Matthew 25:32, "He shall <i>separate </i>them from one 
    another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats." Then will be the 
    great day of separation. It is a great grief to the godly in this life—that 
    they live among the wicked. Psalm 120:5, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in 
    Meshech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!"
<p align="justify">Wicked men blaspheme God, Psalm 74:18, and persecute the 
    saints, 2 Timothy 3:12. They are compared to dogs, Psalm 22:16; to bulls, 
    Psalm 68:30; and to lions, Psalm 57:4. They roar upon the godly and tear 
    them as their prey. Cain kills; Ishmael mocks; Shimei rails. The godly and 
    the wicked are now mingled together, Matthew 13:30, and this is as offensive 
    as tying a dead man to a living man. But Christ will before long make a 
    separation, as the fan separates the wheat from the chaff, as a furnace 
    separates the gold from the dross, or as a fine sieve strains the wine from 
    the dregs. Christ will put the sheep by themselves who have the earmark of 
    election upon them—and the goats by themselves. After which separation there 
    follows:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) The sentence</p></b></font>, which is twofold:
<p align="justify">First, the sentence of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    absolution </b></font>pronounced upon the godly. "Come, you who are blessed 
    of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of 
    the world!" Matthew 25:34. After the pronouncing of this blessed sentence, 
    the godly shall go from the bar—and sit on the bench with Christ. 1 
    Corinthians 6:2, "the saints shall judge the world." The saints shall be 
    with Christ's assessors; they shall sit with Him in judicature as the 
    justices of peace sit with the judge. They shall vote with Christ and 
    applaud Him in all His judicial proceedings. Here the world judges the 
    saints—but there the saints shall judge the world.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, the sentence of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    condemnation </b></font>pronounced upon the wicked. "Depart from Me, you 
    cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels," 
    Matthew 25:41. I may allude to James 3:10, "Out of the same mouth proceeds 
    blessing and cursing." Out of the same mouth of Christ proceeds blessing to 
    the godly—and cursing to the wicked." The same wind which brings one ship to 
    the haven, blows another ship upon the rock.</p>
<p align="justify">"Depart from Me." The wicked once said to God, "Depart 
    from us!" Job 21:14. And now God will say to them, "Depart from Me!" This 
    will be a heart-rending word. Chrysostom said, "This word 'depart!' is worse 
    than the fire." Psalm 16:11, "Depart from Me—in whose presence is fullness 
    of joy."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) The execution.</p></b></font> After this sentence, 
    follows the execution. Matthew 13:30, "Bind the tares in bundles to burn 
    them." Christ will say, "Bundle up these sinners. Here are a bundle of 
    hypocrites, there a bundle of apostates, there a bundle of profane people. 
    Bind them up and throw them in the fire." And no cries or entreaties will 
    prevail with the Judge. The sinner and the fire must keep one another 
    company. He who would not <i>weep </i>for his sins—must <i>burn </i>for 
    them!
<p align="justify">It is "everlasting fire." The three Hebrew children were 
    thrown into the fire—but they did not stay in long. Daniel 3:26, "Then 
    Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming furnace 
    and shouted: "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High 
    God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of 
    the fire." But the fire of the damned, is <i>everlasting </i>fire. This word 
    "forever" breaks the heart! Length of time cannot terminate it! A sea of 
    tears cannot quench it! The wrath of God is the fire, and the breath of God 
    the bellows to blow it up to all eternity! Oh, how dreadfully tormenting

<p align="justify">Let me persuade all Christians to believe this truth—that 
    there shall be a day of judgment. "Rejoice, young man, while you are young, 
    and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth. And walk in the ways 
    of your heart and in the sights of your eyes; but know that for all of these 
    things God will bring you to judgment!" Ecclesiastes 11:9. This is a great 
    article of our faith—that Christ shall come to judge the living and the 
    dead. Yet how many live—as if this article were blotted out of their creed! 
    We have too many epicures and atheists who drown themselves in sensual 
    delights and live as if they did not believe either in God—or the day of 
    judgment! The Lucianists and Platonists deny the immortality of the soul; 
    the Photinians hold there is no hell. I have read of the Duke of Silesia who 
    was so deluded, that he did not believe either God or the devil. I wish 
    there were not too many of this duke's opinion. Would men dare swear, be 
    unchaste, or live in malice—if they believed in a day of judgment? Oh, 
    mingle this text with faith. "The Lord has appointed a day in which He will 
    judge the world." There must be such a day. Not only does Scripture assert 
    it—but reason confirms it. There is no kingdom or nation in the world but 
    has its sessions and courts of judicature; and shall not God, who sets up 
    all other courts, be allowed His? That there shall be a day of judgment is 
    engrafted by nature in the consciences of men. Peter Martyr tells us that 
    some of the heathen poets have written that there are certain judges 
    appointed (Minos, Rhadamanthus, and others) to examine and punish offenders 
    after this life.</p>

<p align="justify">See here the sad and deplorable estate of wicked men. 
    This text is as the handwriting on the wall which may make their "knees to 
    smite one against another," Daniel 5:6. The wicked shall <i>come </i>to 
    judgment—but they "shall not <i>stand </i>in the judgment," Psalm 1:5. In 
    the Hebrew it is "they shall not rise up." God shall be decked with glory 
    and majesty, His face as the appearance of lightning, His eyes as lamps of 
    fire, and a sword of justice in His hand, and shall call the sinner by name 
    and say, "Stand forth! Answer to the charge that is brought against you! 
    What can you say for your pride, oaths, drunkenness? These sins you have 
    been told of, by My ministers; but you persisted in your wickedness with a
    <i>neck </i>of iron, a <i>brow </i>of brass, and a <i>heart </i>of stone! 
    All the tools which I wrought with—were broken and worn out upon your rocky 
    heart! What can you say for yourself that the sentence should not be 
    passed?"</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, how bewildered and confused will the sinner be! He 
    will be found speechless; he will not be able to look his Judge in the face. 
    Job 31:14, "What then shall I do when God rises up? And when He visits, what 
    shall I answer Him?" Oh, wretch, you who can now outface your minister and 
    your godly parents, when they tell you of sin—you shall not be able to 
    outface your Judge. When God rises up, the sinner's countenance will be 
    fallen.</p>
<p align="justify">All the world is God's diocese, and shortly He is coming 
    on His visitation and will call men to account. Now, when God shall visit, 
    how shall the impure soul be able to answer Him? 1 Peter 4:18, "Where shall 
    the ungodly and the sinner appear?" You who die in your sin are sure to be 
    cast at the bar. John 3:18, "He who believes not, is condemned already." 
    That is, he is as sure to be condemned as if he were condemned already. And 
    once the sentence of damnation is passed, miserable man—what will you do? 
    Where will you go? Will you seek help from God? He is a consuming fire to 
    you. Will you seek help from the world? It will be all on fire about you. 
    From the saints? Those you derided on earth. From the good angels? They defy 
    you as God's enemy. From the bad angels? They are your executioners. From 
    your conscience? There is the worm which gnaws. From mercy? The lease is run 
    out—the day of mercy is forever past. Oh, the horror and hellish despair, 
    which will seize upon sinners at that day! Oh, the sad convulsions! Their 
    heads shall hang down, their cheeks blush, their lips quiver, their hands 
    shake, their conscience roar, and their heart tremble. What stupefying 
    medicine has the devil given to men—that they are insensible of the danger 
    they are in! The cares of the world have so filled their head, and the 
    profits of it have so bewitched their heart, that they mind neither death 
    nor judgment!</p>

</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 1.</p></b></font> Possess yourselves with the thoughts 
    of the day of judgment. Think of the <i>solemnity </i>and <i>impartiality
    </i>of this court. Feathers swim upon the water; gold sinks into it. Light, 
    feathery spirits float in vanity—but serious Christians sink deep in the 
    thoughts of judgment. If the ship is not well ballasted, it will soon 
    overturn. The reason why so many are overturned with the vanities of the 
    world is that they are not well ballasted with the thoughts of the day of 
    judgment. Were a man to be tried for his life, he would think to himself of 
    all the arguments he could to plead in his own defense. We are all shortly 
    to be tried for our souls. While others are thinking how they may grow rich, 
    let us think to ourselves how we may abide the day of Christ's coming. The 
    serious thoughts of judgment would be:
<b>
<p align="justify">First, a curbing bit to sin.</p></b> "Am I stealing the 
    forbidden fruit—and the judgment so near!"
<b>
<p align="justify">Second, a spur to holiness.</p></b> 2 Peter 3:10-11, "But the 
    day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will 
    pass away with a terrible noise, and everything in them will disappear in 
    fire, and the earth and everything on it will be burned up. Since everything 
    around us is going to melt away, what holy, godly lives you should be 
    living!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 2.</p></b></font> Let us solemnly prepare ourselves 
    for this last and great trial. That is, by setting up a judgment seat in our 
    own souls, let us begin a private session before the assizes. It is wisdom 
    to bring our souls first to trial. Lamentations 3:40, "Let us search and try 
    our ways." Let us judge ourselves according to the rule of the Word and let 
    conscience bring in the verdict. The Word of God gives several <b>
    characteristics </b>of a man who shall be absolved at the day of judgment 
    and is sure to go to heaven:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Characteristic 1. The first character is HUMILITY.</p></b></font> 
    Job 22:29, "The Lord shall save the humble person." Now, let conscience 
    bring in the verdict. Christian, are you humble? Not only humbled—but 
    humble? Do you esteem others better than yourself? Philippians 2:3. Do you 
    cover your duties with the veil of humility, as Moses put a veil on his face 
    when it shone? If conscience brings in this verdict, you are sure to be 
    acquitted at the last day.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Characteristic 2. LOVE to the saints. </p></b></font>1 John 
    3:14, "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the 
    brethren." Love makes us like God; it is the root of all the graces. Does 
    conscience witness this for you? Are you perfumed with this sweet spice of 
    love? Do you delight in those who have the image of God? Do you reverence 
    their graces? Do you bear with their infirmities? Do you love to see 
    Christ's picture in a saint, though hung in ever so poor a frame? This is a 
    good sign that you shall pass for currency at the day of judgment.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Characteristic 3. A PENITENTIAL frame of heart. </p></b>
</font>Acts 11:18, "Repentance unto life." Repentance unravels sin and makes 
    it not to be. Jeremiah 50:20, "In those days the iniquity of Israel shall be 
    sought for, and there shall be none." A great ball of snow is melted and 
    washed away with the rain; great sins are washed away by holy tears. Now, 
    can conscience bring in the evidence for you? Do you tune the penitential 
    string? Ambrose asked, "You who have sinned with Peter—do you weep with 
    Peter?" And do your tears drop from the <i>eye of faith? </i>This is a 
    blessed sign that you are judgment-proof, and that when your iniquities 
    shall be sought at the last day they shall not be found.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Characteristic 4.</p></b></font> <font color="#008000"><b>
    EQUITY in our dealings. </b></font>"Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
    Lord? Or who shall stand in His holy place?" Psalm 24:3-4. "He who has clean 
    hands." Injustice sullies and defiles the hand. What does conscience say? Is 
    your hand clean? It is a vain thing to hold the Bible in one hand, and false 
    weights in the other.
<p align="justify">Beloved, if conscience, upon a Scripture trial, gives in 
    the verdict for us, it is a blessed sign that we shall lift up our heads 
    with boldness at the last day. Conscience is God's echo in the soul. The 
    voice of conscience is the voice of God, and if conscience, upon an 
    impartial trial, acquits us, God will acquit us. 1 John 3:21, "If our heart 
    condemns us not, then have we confidence toward God." If we are absolved in 
    the lower court of conscience, we are sure to be absolved at the last day in 
    the high court of justice. It would be a sweet thing for a Christian thus to 
    bring himself to a trial. Seneca tells us of a Roman who every day called 
    himself to account, "What soul-infirmity is healed? How have you grown 
    better?" Then he would lie down at night with these words, "Oh, how sweet 
    and refreshing is my sleep to me!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 4. Of CONSOLATION.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Here is a fountain of consolation opened to a believer, 
    and that in three cases, 1. Discouraging fear; 2. Weakness of grace; and 3. 
    Censures of the world.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Case 1. </p></b></font>Here is comfort in case of
    <font color="#008000"><b>discouraging fear</b></font>. "Oh," said a 
    believer, "I fear my grace is not invincible armor. I fear the cause will go 
    against me at the last day." Indeed, so it would—if you were out of Christ. 
    But, as in our law courts the client has his attorney or advocate to plead 
    for him, so every believer, by virtue of the interest he has in Christ, has 
    Christ to plead his cause for him. 1 John 2:1, "If any man sins, we have an 
    Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." What if Satan is the 
    accuser if Christ is the Advocate? Christ never lost any cause that He 
    pleaded. Nay, His very pleading alters the nature of the cause. Christ will 
    show the debt book crossed out—with His own blood. And it is no matter what 
    is <i>charged</i>—if all is <i>discharged</i>. Here is a believer's 
    comfort—his Judge will be his Advocate!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Case 2. </p></b></font>Here is comfort with regard to
    <font color="#008000"><b>weakness of grace</b></font>. A Christian, seeing 
    his grace is so defective, is ready to be discouraged. But at the day of 
    judgment, if Christ finds but a small coin of sincerity, it shall be 
    accepted. If yours is true gold, though it may be light, Christ will put His 
    merits into the scales and make it sufficient. He who has no sin of 
    allowance shall have grains of allowance. I may allude to that verse in Amos 
    9:9, "Yet shall not the least grain fall to the earth." He who has but a 
    grain of grace—not the least grain shall fall to hell.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Case 3. </p></b></font>It is comfort in case of
    <font color="#008000"><b>censures and slanders</b></font>. The saints go 
    here through hurtful reports, "through evil report and a good report," 2 
    Corinthians 6:8. John the Baptist's head on a platter is a common dish 
    nowadays. It is ordinary to bring in a saint <i>beheaded of his good name.
    </i>But at the day of judgment Christ will unload His people, of all their 
    injuries. He will vindicate them from all their calumnies. Christ will be 
    the saint's character witness. He, at that day, will present His Church 
    "without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy 
    and without fault!" Ephesians 5:27.
