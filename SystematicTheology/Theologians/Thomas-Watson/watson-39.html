<p align="justify">"And it shall be with him (the King), and he shall read 
    therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his 
    God, to keep all the words of this Law and these statutes, to do them." 
    Deuteronomy 17:19</p>
<p align="justify">This book of Deuteronomy is full of golden eloquence. In 
    this chapter, God instructs the Jews about setting a <i>king </i>over them, 
    and there are two things specified, as to his election, and his religion.</p>
<p align="justify">1. His <b>election</b>, Deut 17:15. "You shall be sure to 
    appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses." Good reason that God 
    should have the choice of their king, since "by him kings reign." Prov 8:15.</p>
<p align="justify">2. His <b>religion</b>, Deut 17:18. "When he takes the 
    throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this 
    law." Here was a good beginning of a king's reign; the first thing he did 
    after he sat upon the throne, was to copy out the Word of God in a book. And 
    in the text, "It shall be with him, and he shall read therein, all the days 
    of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the 
    words of this Law and these Statutes, to do them." </p>
<p align="justify">"It shall be with him." The Book of the Law shall be his 
    daily companion. Charles the Great used to set his crown upon the Bible. 
    Indeed the Bible is the best support of government. </p>
<p align="justify">"And he shall read therein." It is not below the majesty 
    of a prince to peruse the oracles of Heaven; in them are comprised sacred 
    writings. Prov 8:6, "I will speak of <i>excellent </i>things." In the 
    Septuagint it is "<i>grave </i>things," in the Hebrew, "<i>princely </i>
    things," such as are fit for a God to speak—and a king to read. Nor must the 
    king only <i>read </i>the Book of the Law at his first installment into his 
    kingdom—but he "shall read in it all the days of his life." He must not 
    leave off <i>reading</i>—until he left off <i>reigning</i>. And the reasons 
    why he must be conversant in the law of God, are in the subsequent words:
    </p>
<p align="justify">1. "That he may learn to fear the Lord his God." Reading 
    of the Word is the best means to usher in the fear of the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify">2. "That he may keep all the words of this Law, to do 
    them." </p>
<p align="justify">3. "That he may prolong his days in his kingdom."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now confine myself to these words,<i> "He shall 
    read in it all the days of his life;" </i>that is—in the Book of the Law.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"The Holy Scripture is a golden epistle sent to us from 
    God!"</p></i> This we are to read diligently. Ignorance of Scripture is the 
    mother of <i>error</i>—not of <i>devotion</i>. Matt 22:29, "You are in 
    error—not knowing the Scriptures." We are commanded to "<i>search </i>the 
    Scriptures." John 5:39. The Greek word signifies <i>to search as for a vein 
    of gold</i>. How diligently does a child read over his father's will! With 
    the like diligence, should we read God's Word, which is our <i>Magna Charta
    </i>for Heaven. It is a mercy that the Bible is not prohibited. Let us 
    inquire at this sacred oracle. Apollos was "mighty in the Scriptures." Acts 
    18:24. Melancthon, when he was young, sucked the sincere milk of the Word. 
    Alphonsus, King of Arragon, read over the Bible fourteen times. That Roman 
    Lady, Cecilia, had by much reading of the Word, made her heart <i>the 
    Library of Christ</i>. Were the Scriptures confined to the original tongues, 
    many would plead excuse for not reading; but when the sword of the Spirit is 
    unsheathed, and the Word is made plain to us by being translated, what 
    should hinder us from a diligent search into these holy mysteries?
<p align="justify">Adam was forbidden upon pain of death to taste of the <i>
    tree of knowledge. </i>Gen 2:17, "In the day you eat thereof, you shall 
    surely die!" But there is no danger of touching this <i>tree of Holy 
    Scripture</i>; if we do not eat of this tree of knowledge—we shall surely 
    die! What will become of those who are strangers to the Scriptures? Hos 
    8:12, "I have written to him the great things of my law—but they were 
    counted as a strange thing." Many lay aside the Scriptures as rusty armor. 
    Jer 8:9, "They have rejected the Word of the Lord, so what wisdom do they 
    really have?" They are better read in romances, than in Paul; they spend 
    many hours between the comb and the looking-glass—but their eyes begin to be 
    sore when they look at a Bible! </p>
<p align="justify">The very Turks will rise up in judgment against these 
    Christians. They reverence the Books of Moses; and if they find but a leaf 
    whereon anything of the Pentateuch is written, they take it up and kiss it. 
    They who slight the written Word, slight God himself, whose stamp it bears. 
    To slight the <i>king's edict </i>is an affront offered to the person of the 
    king. They who reject and vilify the <i>Scriptures </i>are in a state of 
    condemnation. Prov 13:13, "Whoever despises the Word shall be destroyed."</p>
<p align="justify">Nor is it enough, to <i>read </i>the Word of God—but it 
    should be our care to get some spiritual nourishment and profit by it, that 
    our souls may be nourished up in the words of faith. 1 Tim 4:6. Why else was 
    the Scripture written—but that it might profit us? God did not give us his 
    Word only as a landscape to look upon—but he delivered it as a father 
    delivers a stock of money to his son—to improve. It is sad not to profit by 
    the Word, to be like the body in a consumption, which does not thrive. Men 
    would be reluctant to trade—and get no profit. </p>
<p align="justify">The grand question I am to speak to, is this.<i> How we 
    may read the Scriptures with most spiritual profit. </i>In answering this 
    question, I shall lay down several rules or directions about the reading of 
    Scripture.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">A. If you would profit from the Scriptures—remove those 
    things which will hinder your profiting. </p></b></font>That the body may 
    thrive, obstructions must be removed. There are three obstructions which 
    must be removed, if you would profit by Scripture. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Remove the love of every SIN.</p></b></font> Let a 
    physician prescribe ever so good a remedy, if the patient takes poison, it 
    will hinder the virtue and operation of the medicine. The Scripture 
    prescribes excellent remedies—but sin lived in, poisons all. The body cannot 
    thrive in a fever, nor can the soul under the feverish heat of lust. Plato 
    calls the <i>love of sin—</i>a great devil. As the rose is destroyed by the 
    canker which breeds in it—so are the souls of men by those sins in which 
    they indulge.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Take heed of those THORNS which will choke the Word.
    </p></b></font>These thorns, our Savior expounds to be the <i>cares of this 
    world</i>. Matt 13:22. By "cares" is meant covetousness. A covetous man has 
    such diversity of secular employment, that he can scarcely find time to read 
    God's Word; or if he does, what slips does he commit in reading! While his 
    eye is upon the Bible—his heart is upon the world! It is not the writings of 
    the Apostles, which he is so much taken up with, as the writing in his 
    account books! Is this man likely to profit? You may as soon extract oil out 
    of a rock—as he extract any real benefit out of Scripture! 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Take heed of JESTING with Scripture.</p></b></font> This 
    is playing with fire. Some cannot be merry unless they jest about God. When 
    they are sad, they bring forth the Scripture as their harp to drive away the 
    evil spirit. In the fear of God, beware of this! God will not endure to have 
    his Word jested with! Eusebius relates of one who took a piece of Scripture 
    to jest with, and God struck him with madness. The Lord may justly give over 
    such people to a reprobate mind. Rom 1:28.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">B. If you would profit from the Scriptures—prepare your
    <i>hearts </i>for the reading of the Word. </p></b></font>The heart is an 
    instrument which needs putting in tune. 1 Sam 7:3, "Prepare your hearts to 
    the Lord." The heathen, as Plutarch notes, thought it indecent to be too 
    hasty or rash in the service of their supposed deities. This preparation for 
    reading consists in two things:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In summoning our thoughts together to attend to that 
    solemn work we are going about.</p></b></font> The thoughts are stragglers, 
    therefore rally them together. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. In purging out those unclean affections which 
    indispose us to reading.</p></b></font> Before we come to the water of life, let 
    us cast away the poison of impure affections. Many come rashly to the 
    reading of the Word, and it is no wonder if they come without preparation, 
    that they go away without profit.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">C. Read the Scriptures with reverence.</p></b></font> Think 
    every line you read, that God is speaking to you. The ark wherein the law 
    was put, was overlaid with pure gold, and was carried on bars, that the 
    Levites might not touch it. Exod 25. Why was this but to breed in the people 
    reverence to the law? When Ehud told Eglon he had a message to him from God, 
    he arose from his throne. Judg 3:20. The written Word is a message from 
    Jehovah; with what veneration should we receive it.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">D. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Read the books 
    of Scripture in order.</p></b></font> Though occurrences may sometimes divert 
    our method—yet, for a constant course, it is best to observe an order in 
    reading. Order is a help to memory. We do not begin to read a friend's 
    letter in the middle.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">E. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Get a right 
    understanding of Scripture. </p></b></font>Ps 119:73, "Give me understanding, 
    that I may learn your commandments." Though there are some knots in 
    Scripture which are not easily untied—yet things essential to salvation, the 
    Holy Spirit has plainly pointed out to us. The knowledge of the <i>sense of 
    the Scriptures </i>is the first step to profit. In the Law, Aaron was first 
    to light the lamps, and then to burn the incense; the lamp of the 
    understanding must be first lighted, before the affections can be inflamed. 
    Get what knowledge you can by comparing Scriptures, by conferring with 
    others, by using the best commentators. Without knowledge, the Scripture is 
    a sealed book; every line is too high for us; and<i> if the Word shoots 
    above our head—it can never hit our heart!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">F. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Read the Word 
    with seriousness. </p></b></font>If one go over the Scripture quickly, there is 
    little good to be got by it; but if you are serious in reading it, it is the 
    savor of life. And well may we be serious if we consider the importance of 
    those truths which are bound up in this sacred volume. Deut 32:47, "They are 
    not just idle words for you—they are your life!" If a letter were to be 
    broken open and read, wherein a man's whole estate were concerned, how 
    serious would he be in reading it. In the Scripture our salvation is 
    concerned; it treats of the love of Christ, a serious subject. Christ has 
    loved mankind, more than the angels that fell. Heb 2:7. The loadstone, 
    indifferent to <i>gold </i>and diamond, draws the <i>iron </i>to it; thus 
    Christ passed by the <i>angels</i>, who were of more noble extraction, and 
    drew <i>mankind </i>to him. Christ loved us more than his own life; nay, 
    though we had a hand in his death—yet he would not leave us out of his will. 
    This is a love which passes knowledge; who can read this, without 
    seriousness? 
<p align="justify">The Scripture speaks of the mystery of faith, the eternal 
    recompenses, and the paucity of those who shall be saved. Matt 20:16, "Few 
    are chosen." One says the names of all the good emperors of Rome might be 
    engraved in a little ring. Just so, there are but comparatively few names in 
    the Book of Life. The Scripture speaks of striving for heaven as in an 
    agony. Luke 13:24. It cautions us of falling short of the promised rest. Heb 
    4:1. It describes the horrors of the infernal torments—the worm, and the 
    fire. Mark 9:44. Who can read this and not be serious! Some have light, 
    feathery, spirits; they run over the most weighty truths in haste—and they 
    are not benefitted by the Word. Read with a solemn, composed spirit. 
    Seriousness is the Christian's ballast, which keeps him from being 
    overturned with vanity.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">G. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Labor to 
    remember what you read.</p></b></font> Satan would steal the Word out of our 
    mind; not that <i>he </i>intends to make use of it himself—but lest <i>we
    </i>should make use of it. The memory should be like the chest in the ark, 
    where the ark was put. Ps 119:52, "I remembered your judgments of old."
<p align="justify">Jerome speaks of that pious lady, Paula, that she had 
    most of the Scriptures by heart. We are bid to have "the Word dwell in us." 
    Col 3:16. The Word is a jewel; it adorns the hidden man, and shall we not 
    remember it? If the Word stays not in the memory—it cannot profit. Some can 
    better remember a piece of news, than a line of Scripture; their memories 
    are like those ponds where the <i>frogs </i>live—but the <i>fish </i>die.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">H. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Meditate upon 
    what you read.</p></b></font> Ps 119:15, "I will meditate in your precepts." The 
    Hebrew Word to meditate, signifies to be <i>intense in the mind</i>. In 
    meditation there must be a fixing of the thoughts upon the object. Luke 
    2:19, "Mary <i>pondered </i>those things." <i>Reading </i>brings a truth 
    into our head, <i>meditation </i>brings it into our heart. Reading and 
    meditation, must always go together. Meditation without reading is 
    erroneous; reading without meditation is barren. The bee sucks the flower, 
    and then works it into the hive, and so turns it into honey; by reading we 
    suck the flower of the Word, by meditation we work it into the hive of our 
    mind, and so it turns to profit. Meditation is the bellows of the affection. 
    Ps 39:3, "While I was <i>musing—</i>the fire burned." The reason we come 
    away so cold from reading the Word, is because we do not warm ourselves at 
    the <i>fire of meditation</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Come to the 
    reading of Scripture with humble hearts.</p></b></font> Acknowledge how unworthy 
    you are that God should reveal himself in his Word to you. God's secrets are 
    with the humble. Pride is an enemy to profiting. It has been said that the 
    ground on which the peacock sits is barren; however that is, I am sure that 
    heart where pride sits is really barren. An arrogant person disdains the 
    counsels of the Word, and hates the reproofs—is he likely to profit? James 
    4:6, "God gives grace to the <i>humble</i>." The most eminent saints have 
    been of low stature in their own eyes; like the sun at the zenith, they 
    showed least when they were at the highest. David had "more understanding 
    than all his teachers." Ps 119:99—but how humble he was. Ps 22:6, "I am a 
    worm and no man."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">J. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Give <i>
    credence </i>to the written Word.</p></b></font> <i>Believe </i>it to be of God; 
    see the name of God in every line. The Romans, that they might gain credit 
    to their laws, reported that they were inspired by the gods at Rome. Believe 
    the Scriptures to be divinely inspired. 2 Tim 3:16, "All Scripture is given 
    by inspiration of God." Who but God could reveal the great doctrines of the 
    Trinity, the atonement of Jesus Christ for sinners, the resurrection? Where 
    did the Scriptures come from—if not from God? 
<p align="justify">1. The <i>ungodly </i>could not be the authors of 
    Scripture. Would they indite such holy lines, or inveigh so fiercely against 
    the sins which they love? </p>
<p align="justify">2. <i>Saints </i>could not be the authors of Scripture; 
    how could it stand with their sanctity to counterfeit God's name, and put <i>
    "thus says the Lord," </i>to a book of their own devising? </p>
<p align="justify">3. <i>Angels </i>could not be the authors of Scripture. 
    What angel in heaven dared impersonate God, and say, "I am the Lord?" 
    Believe the pedigree of Scripture to be sacred, and to come from the Father 
    of light. The antiquity of Scripture speaks its divinity. No human history 
    extant, reaches farther than Noah's flood; but the Scripture treats of 
    things <i>before time</i>. Beside, the <i>majesty</i>, <i>profundity</i>, <i>
    purity </i>and <i>harmony </i>of Scripture—show it could be breathed from 
    none but God himself. </p>
<p align="justify">Add to this the efficacy the written Word has upon men's 
    hearts and consciences; by reading Scripture they have been turned into 
    other men, as may be instanced in Augustine, Junius, and many others. If you 
    should set a seal upon a piece of marble, and it should leave a print 
    behind—you would say there was a strange virtue in that seal. Just so, when 
    the written Word leaves a heavenly print of grace upon the heart—it argues 
    it to be of divine authority. If you would profit by the Word—you must 
    believe it to be of God. Some skeptics question the verity of Scripture. 
    Though they have the articles of religion in their creed—yet not in their 
    belief. Unbelief enervates the virtue of the Word and makes it abortive; who 
    will obey truths he does not believe? Heb 4:2, "The Word did not profit 
    them—not being mixed with faith."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">K. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Highly prize 
    the Scriptures.</p></b></font> Ps 119:72, "Your law is more valuable to me than 
    millions in gold and silver!" Can he make a proficiency in any art, who 
    slights and depreciate it? Prize this book of God above all other books. 
    Gregory calls the Bible—<i>the heart and soul of God. </i>The Rabbis say 
    that there is a <i>mountain of truth </i>upon every point and tittle of 
    Scripture. Ps 19:7, "The law of the Lord is perfect." The Scripture is the 
    library of the Holy Spirit; it is a code of divine knowledge, an exact 
    model, and platform of true religion. The Scripture contains in it the <i>
    Credenda</i>—the things which we are to believe; and the <i>Agenda</i>—the 
    things which we are to practice. It is able to make us wise unto salvation. 
    2 Tim 3:15. The Scripture is the standard of truth, the judge of 
    controversy. The Scripture is the pole star to direct us to heaven. The 
    Scripture is the compass by which the <i>rudder of our will </i>is to be 
    steered. The Scripture is the field in which Christ, the pearl of great 
    price, is hidden. The Scripture is a rock of diamond. The Scripture is a <i>
    sacred eye-salve</i>; it mends the eyes of those who look upon it. The 
    Scripture is a spiritual optic glass, in which the glory of God is 
    resplendent. The Scripture is the panacea, or universal medicine for the 
    soul. The leaves of Scripture are like "the leaves of the tree of life—for 
    the healing of the nations." Rev 22:2. 
<p align="justify">The Scripture is the <i>breeder </i>and <i>feeder </i>of 
    grace. How is the convert <i>born</i>—but by "the Word of truth?" James 
    1:18. How does he <i>grow—</i>but by "the sincere milk of the Word?" 1 Pet 
    2:2. The written Word is the book out of which our evidences for heaven are 
    fetched. The Scripture is the sea-mark which shows us the rocks of sin. The 
    Scripture is the antidote against error and apostasy. The Scripture is the 
    two-edged sword which wounds the old serpent. It is our bulwark to withstand 
    the force of lust, like the Capitol at Rome, which was a place of strength 
    and ammunition. The Scripture is the tower of David, whereon the shields of 
    our faith hang. </p>
<p align="justify">"Take away the Word, and you deprive us of the sun!" said 
    Luther. The written Word is above an angelical embassy, or a voice from 
    heaven. 2 Pet 1:18, "This voice which came from heaven we heard; we have 
    also a <i>more sure </i>Word." If Caesar so valued his Commentaries, that in 
    preserving them he lost his purple robe, how should we estimate the sacred 
    oracles of God? Job 23:12, "I have esteemed the Words of his mouth more than 
    my necessary food." King Edward VI, on the day of his coronation, had 
    presented before him three swords, signifying that he was monarch of three 
    kingdoms. The King said there was one sword lacking; being asked what that 
    was, he answered, "the Holy Bible, which is the sword of the Spirit, and is 
    to be preferred before all these ensigns of royalty." Robert, King of 
    Sicily, did so prize God's Word, that, speaking to his friend Petrarch, he 
    said, "The Scriptures are dearer to me than my kingdom, and if I must be 
    deprived of one of them, I had rather lose my diadem than the Scriptures!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">L. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Get an ardent 
    LOVE to the Word.</p></b></font> Prizing relates to the judgment, love to the 
    affections. Ps 119:159, "Consider how I love your precepts." He is likely to 
    grow rich, who delights in his trade; a lover of learning will be a scholar.
    <i>Augustine </i>tells us before his conversion he took no pleasure in the 
    Scriptures—but afterwards they were his delights. <i>David </i>thought the 
    Word was sweeter than the honey which drops from the comb. <i>Thomas a 
    Kempis </i>used to say he found no contentment, but in a corner, with the 
    book of God in his hand. Did <i>Alphonsus</i>, King of Sicily, recover of a 
    fit of sickness from the great pleasure he took in reading a book of 
    philosophy? What infinite pleasure should we take in reading the book of 
    life! 
<p align="justify">There is enough in the Word to breed holy pleasure and 
    delight; it is a specimen and demonstration of God's holy love to us. The 
    Spirit is God's love-token—the Word his love-letter; how does one rejoice to 
    read over his friend's letter! The written Word is a divine treasury, or 
    storehouse; in it is scattered truth as pearls, to adorn the inner man of 
    the heart. The written Word is the true manna, which has all sorts of sweet 
    taste in it. The Word is a sovereign elixir; it gives wine to those of a 
    heavy heart.</p>
<p align="justify">I have read of an ancient Rabbi, who, in a great 
    concourse of people, made proclamation of a <i>sovereign cordial </i>he had 
    to sell; many resorting to him and asking him to show it, he opened the 
    Bible, and directed them to several places of comfort in it. Holy David 
    drank of this cordial; Ps 119:50, "This is my comfort in my affliction; for 
    your Word has quickened me." Chrysostom compares the Scripture to a garden; 
    every line in it is a fragrant flower, which we should wear not in our 
    bosom—but in our heart!</p>
<p align="justify">Delight in the Word causes profit, and we must not only 
    love the <i>comforts </i>of the Word—but the <i>reproofs</i>. Myrrh is <i>
    bitter </i>to the palate—but <i>good </i>for the stomach.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">M. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Come to the 
    reading of the Word with HONEST hearts.</p></b></font> Christ speaks of the 
    "honest heart." Luke 8:15. What is it to read the Word with an honest heart?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. To come with a heart willing to know the whole counsel 
    of God.</p></b></font> A good heart would not have any truth concealed—but says 
    as Job, "What I see not—teach me." When men pick and choose in religion, 
    they will do some things the Word enjoins them—but not others; these are 
    unsound hearts, and are not benefitted by holy writ. These are like a 
    patient, who having a bitter pill prescribed, will take a candy—but refuses 
    the pill.

<p align="justify">2. To read the Word with an honest heart, is to read that 
    we may be made better by it.</p></b></font> The Word is the medium and method of 
    sanctification, and we come to it not only to illuminate us—but to 
    consecrate us. John 17:17, "<i>Sanctify </i>them through your truth." Some 
    go to the Bible as one goes to the garden to pick <i>flowers</i>, that is <i>
    fine notions</i>. Augustine confesses that before his conversion he went to 
    hear Ambrose, more for the elegance of speech and quaintness of notion, than 
    the spirituality of the matter. This is like a woman who paints her face—but 
    neglects her health! But this is to have an honest heart—when we come to the 
    Scriptures as Naaman to the waters of Jordan—to be healed of our leprosy! 
    "O," says the soul, "that the <i>sword of the Spirit </i>may pierce the rock 
    of my heart; that this blessed Word may have such a virtue in it—that it may 
    kill my sin, and make me fruitful in grace!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">N. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Learn to APPLY 
    Scripture.</p></b></font> Take every Word as spoken to <i>ourselves</i>. When 
    the Word thunders against sin, think thus, "God means <i>my </i>sins!" When 
    it presses any duty, "God intends <i>me </i>in this!" Many put off Scripture 
    from themselves, as if it only concerned those who lived in the time when it 
    was written; but if you intend to profit by the Word, bring it home to 
    yourselves. A medicine will do no good—unless it be <i>applied</i>. The 
    saints of old took the Word—as if it had been spoken to them by name! When 
    king Josiah heard the threatening which was written in the book of God, he 
    applied it to himself; he "tore his clothes and humbled his soul before the 
    Lord." 2 Kings 22:11.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">O. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Observe the 
    PRECEPTIVE part of the Word, as well as the promises.</p></b></font> The <i>
    precepts </i>carry duty in them, like the veins which carry the blood. The
    <i>promises </i>carry comfort, like the arteries which carry the spirit. 
    Make use of the precepts—to <i>direct </i>you. Make use of the promises—to
    <i>comfort </i>you. Such as cast their eye on the <i>promises</i>, with a 
    neglect of the <i>commands—</i>are not edified by Scripture; they look more 
    after <i>comfort </i>than <i>duty</i>. They mistake their comforts—as Apollo 
    embraced the laurel tree instead of Daphne. A man may be filled with false 
    comfort—as well as that which is genuine and real.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">P. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Let your 
    thoughts dwell upon the most IMPORTANT passages of Scripture. </p></b></font>The 
    bee fastens on those flowers where she may suck most sweetness. Though the 
    whole of Scripture is excellent—yet some parts of it may have a greater 
    emphasis, and be more helpful and pungent. Reading the names of the tribes, 
    or the genealogies of the patriarchs, is not of the same importance as 
    reading of faith and the new creature. Mind the "<i>great </i>things of the 
    law." Hos 8:12. They who read only to satisfy their curiosity, do rather <i>
    busy, </i>than <i>profit </i>themselves. The searching too far into 
    prophecies, has weakened grace in some men's hearts.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Q. If you would profit from the Scriptures—COMPARE 
    yourselves with the Word.</p></b></font> See how the Scripture and your hearts 
    agree; how your dial goes with this sun. Are your hearts, as it were, a 
    transcript and counterpart of Scripture? Is the Word copied out into your 
    hearts? The Word calls for humility; are you not only humbled—but humble? 
    The Word calls for regeneration, John 3:7; have you a change of heart? Not 
    only a moral and partial change—but a spiritual change? Is there such a 
    change wrought in you, as if another soul did live in the same body? 1 Cor 
    6:11, "Such <i>were </i>some of you—but you are washed, you are sanctified." 
    The Word calls for love to the saints; 1 Pet 1:22. Do you love grace where 
    you see it? Do you love grace in a poor man as well as in a rich? A son 
    loves to see his father's picture, though hung in a poor frame. Do you love 
    grace, though mixed with some failings—as we love gold though it is in the 
    ore? The bringing the rule of the Word and our hearts together, to see how 
    they agree, would prove very advantageous to us. Hereby we come to know the 
    true complexion and state of our souls, and see what evidences and 
    certificates we have for heaven.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">R. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Take special 
    notice of those Scriptures which speak to your particular case.</p></b></font> 
    Were a cancerous person to read medical book—he would chiefly observe what 
    they said about cancer. Great regard is to be had to those paragraphs of 
    Scripture which are most pertinent to one's present case. I shall notice 
    three cases,

<p align="justify">1. Affliction. <br/>
      2. Desertion. <br/>
      3. Sin.</p>

<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Affliction</p></b></font>. Has God made your chain heavy? 
    Consult these Scriptures. Heb 12:7, "If you endure chastening, God deals 
    with you as sons." Isa 27:9, "By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be 
    purged." John 16:20, "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy." 2 Cor 4:17, 
    "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more 
    exceeding and eternal weight of glory." The artist lays his gold upon dark 
    colors. Just so, God first lays the dark color of affliction, and then the 
    golden color of glory.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Desertion</p></b></font>. Are your spiritual comforts 
    eclipsed? See Isa 54:8, "In a little wrath I hid my face from you, for a 
    moment—but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you." The sun may 
    hide itself in a cloud—but it is not out of the sky. Just so, God may hide 
    his face—but he is not out of the covenant. Isa 57:16, "I will not always be 
    angry." God is like the musician; he will not stretch the strings of his 
    lute too hard, lest they break. A saint's comfort may be hidden, as seed 
    under the clods—but at last it will spring up into a harvest of joy.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Sin</p></b></font>. <b><br/>
    1. Are you drawn away with LUST? </b>Read Gal 5:24; James 1:15; 1 Pet 2:11, 
    "Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." Lust kills with <i>
    embracing</i>. Prov 7:10,22-23; Prov 22:14, "Go to the <i>waters </i>of the 
    sanctuary—to quench the <i>fire </i>of lust."
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Are you under the power of UNBELIEF?</p></b> Read Isa 
    26:3, "You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you, 
    because he trusts in you." Mr. Boltor speaks of a distressed soul who found 
    much comfort from this Scripture, on his sick bed. 2 Sam 22:31, "As for God, 
    his way is perfect. All the Lord's promises prove true. He is a shield for 
    all who look to him for protection." John 3:15, "Whoever believes in him 
    should not perish." Unbelief is a God-affronting sin. 1 John 5:10, "He who 
    believes not God—has made him a liar." It is a soul-murdering sin! John 
    3:36, "He who believes not the Son shall not see life—but the wrath of God 
    abides on him!" 
<p align="justify">Thus, in reading, observe those Scriptures which do touch 
    upon your particular case. Although all the Bible must be read—yet those 
    texts which point most directly to your condition, be sure to put a special
    <i>asterisk </i>upon.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">S. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Take special 
    notice of the EXAMPLES in Scripture.</p></b></font> Make the examples of 
    others—living sermons to you.
<p align="justify">1. Observe the examples of God's <b>judgments </b>upon 
    sinners. They have been hanged up in chains, as a terror. How severely has 
    God punished proud men! Nebuchadnezzar was turned to eat grass; Herod eat up 
    with worms. How has God plagued idolaters! Num 25:3-4,9; 1 Kings 14:9-10. 
    What a swift witness has he been against liars! Acts 5:5,10. These examples 
    are set up as sea-marks to avoid! 1 Cor 10:11; Jude 7.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Observe the examples of God's <b>mercy </b>to saints. 
    Jeremiah was preserved in the dungeon; the three Hebrew children in the 
    furnace; Daniel in the lion's den. These examples are props to faith, spurs 
    to holiness.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">T. If you would profit from the Scriptures—do not leave 
    off reading in the Bible, until you find your hearts warmed. </p></b></font>Ps 
    119:93, "I will never forget your precepts, for with them you have quickened 
    me." Read the Word not only as a history—but strive to be <i>affected </i>
    with it. Let it not only <i>inform </i>you—but <i>inflame </i>you. Jer 
    23:29, "Is not my Word like as a fire? says the Lord." Do not go from the 
    Word, until you can say as those disciples; Luke 24:32, "Did not our hearts 
    burn within us!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">U. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Set upon the 
    PRACTICE of what you read. </p></b></font>Ps 119:66, "I have obeyed your 
    commandments." A medical student does not satisfy himself to read over a 
    medical book—but he falls upon its practice. The life blood of religion lies 
    in the <i>practical </i>part. So in the text, "He shall read in the book of 
    the law all the days of his life, that he may learn to <i>keep </i>all the 
    Words of this law and these statutes, to <i>do </i>them." <i>Christians 
    should be walking Bibles! </i>Xenophon said many read the laws of Lycurgus—but 
    few observed them. The written Word is not only a rule of knowledge—but a 
    rule of obedience; it is not only to mend our sight—but to mend our pace. 
    David calls God's Word a "lamp to his <i>feet</i>." Ps 119:105. It was not 
    only a light to his <i>eyes </i>to see by—but to his <i>feet </i>to walk by. 
    By practice, we turn our knowledge into profit. This is a blessed reading of 
    the Scriptures—when we <i>fly from the sins </i>which the Word forbids—and
    <i>espouse the duties </i>which the Word commands. <i>Scripture reading 
    without practice—will be but a torch to light men to hell!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">V. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Make use of 
    Christ's prophetic office.</p></b></font> He is the lion of the tribe of Judah, 
    to whom it is given to open the book of God, and unlock its seals. Rev 5:5. 
    Christ does so teach, as he does quicken. John 8:12. Where Christ comes into 
    the soul with his light—there is the heat of spiritual life going along with 
    it. Christ gives us a <i>taste </i>of his Word, "You have taught me how 
    sweet are your Words to my taste." Ps 119:102-103. It is one thing to read a 
    promise, another to <i>taste </i>it. Such as would be Scripture proficients, 
    let them get <i>Christ </i>to be their teacher. Luke 24:45, "Then <i>he</i> 
    opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures." 
    Christ did not only open the Scriptures—but opened their understanding!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">W. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Tread often 
    upon the threshold of the sanctuary. </p></b></font>Wait diligently upon a godly 
    teaching ministry. Prov 8:34, "Blessed is the man who hears me, watching 
    daily at my gates." Ministers are God's interpreters; it is their work to 
    open and expound dark places of Scripture. We read of pitchers, and lamps 
    within the pitchers. Judg 7:16. Ministers are earthen pitchers. 2 Cor 4:7. 
    But these pitchers have lamps within them, to light souls in the dark.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">X. If you would profit from the Scriptures—Pray that God 
    will make you profit.</p></b></font> Isa 48:17, "I am the Lord your God, who 
    teaches you to profit." Make David's prayer, "Open my eyes, that I may 
    behold wondrous things out of your law." Ps 119:18. Pray to God to take the 
    veil off the <i>Scriptures</i>—that you may understand it; and the veil on 
    your <i>heart</i>—that you may believe it. Pray that God will not only give 
    you his <i>Word </i>as a rule of holiness—but his <i>grace </i>as a 
    principle of holiness. 
<p align="justify">Implore the guidance of God's Spirit. Neh 9:20, "You gave 
    them your good Spirit to instruct them." Though the ship has a fine compass 
    to guide it, and a good sail—yet without a gale of wind, it cannot make 
    progress. Just so, though we have the written Word as our compass to sail 
    by, and make use of our endeavors as the sail—yet unless the Spirit of God 
    blows upon us, we cannot sail with profit. When the Almighty is as <i>dew
    </i>to us, then "we grow as the lily, and our beauty is as the olive tree." 
    Hos 14:5-6. One may see the figures on a dial—but he cannot tell the 
    time—unless the sun shines; we may read many truths in the Bible—but we 
    cannot know them savingly until God's Spirit shines into our souls. 2 Cor 
    4:6. The Spirit is a Spirit of wisdom and revelation. Eph 1:17. When Philip 
    joined himself to the eunuch's chariot—then he understood the Scriptures. 
    Acts 8:35. When God's Spirit joins himself to the Word—then it will be 
    effectual to salvation. </p>
<p align="justify">These rules observed, the written Word would, through 
    God's blessing, become an "engrafted Word." James 1:21. A good scion grafted 
    into a bad stock, changes the nature of it and makes it bear sweet and 
    generous fruit. So when the Word is grafted savingly into men's hearts, it 
    does sanctify them, and make them bring forth the sweet "fruits of 
    righteousness." Phil 1:11.Thus I have answered this question, <i>how we may 
    read the Scriptures with most spiritual profit. </i>In conclusion,</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Content not yourselves with the bare reading of the 
    Scriptures—but labor to find some spiritual improvement and profit.</p></b></font> 
    Get the Word transcribed into your hearts. Ps 37:31, "The law of his God is 
    in his heart." Such as profit by reading the book of God, are the best 
    Christians alive; they answer God's cost, they credit religion, they save 
    their souls.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. You who have profited by reading the Holy Scriptures, 
    adore God's distinguishing grace. </p></b></font>Bless God that he has not only 
    brought the <i>light </i>to you—but <i>opened your eyes </i>to see it! He 
    has unlocked his hidden treasure—and enriched you with saving knowledge. 
    Some perish by not <i>having </i>Scripture, and others by not <i>improving
    </i>it. That God should pass by millions, and the lot of his electing love 
    should fall upon you; that the Scripture, like the pillar of cloud, should 
    have a dark side to others—but a light side to you; that to others it should 
    be a dead letter—but to you the savor of life; that Christ should not only 
    be revealed <i>to </i>you—but <i>in </i>you; Gal 1:16; —how should you be in 
    a holy ecstasy of wonder, and wish that you had hearts of seraphim burning 
    in love to God, and the voices of angels to make heaven ring with God's 
    praises!
<p align="justify">But some of the godly may say, that they fear they do not 
    profit by the Word they read. As in the body when there is a failing of the 
    vital organs—cordials are employed; so let me apply a few divine cordials to 
    such as are ready to faint under the fear of non-proficiency.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. You may profit by reading the Word, though you come 
    short of others.</p></b></font> The ground, which brought forth <i>thirty </i>
    fold, was good ground. Matt 13:8. Do not say that you have obtained <i>no
    </i>profit—because you are not equal with other eminent saints; those were 
    counted strong men among David's worthies, though they did not attain to the 
    honor of the first three. 2 Sam 23:19.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. You may profit by reading the Word, though you are not 
    of quick apprehension.</p></b></font> Some impeach themselves because they are 
    slow of understanding. When our blessed Savior foretold his sufferings, the 
    apostles themselves understood not, and it was hidden from them. Luke 9:45. 
    The author to the Hebrews speaks of some who were dull of hearing. Heb 5:11. 
    Such as have weaker minds—may have stronger affections. A Christian with 
    little knowledge may be kept from sin—as a man who has but weak sight—yet is 
    kept by it from falling into the water.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. You may profit by reading Scripture, although you have 
    not excellent memories. </p></b></font>Many complain their memories leak. 
    Christian, are you grieved that you can remember no more? Then for your 
    comfort,
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. You may have a good heart—though you have not so good 
    a memory.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Though you can not remember all you read—yet you 
    remember that which is most important, and which you have most need of.</p></b></font> 
    At a feast we do not eat of every dish—but we take so much as nourishes. It 
    is with a good Christian's memory as it is with a lamp; though the lamp is 
    not full of oil—yet it has so much oil as makes the lamp burn; though your 
    memory is not full of Scripture—yet you retain so much as makes your love to 
    God to burn.
<p align="justify">Then, be of good comfort—you do profit by what you read. 
    Take notice of that encouraging Scripture, "The Comforter, who is the Holy 
    Spirit, he shall bring all things to your remembrance." John 14:26. <br/>
    Amen.</p>
