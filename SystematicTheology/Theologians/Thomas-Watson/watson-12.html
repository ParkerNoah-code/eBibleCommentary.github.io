<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><font color="#FF0000">SANCTIFICATION</font></b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>

<p align="justify"><i>"For this is the will of God, even your <b>
    sanctification</b>." </i>1 Thessalonians 4:3</p>
<p align="justify">The word <i>sanctification </i>signifies to <i>consecrate
    </i>and <i>set apart</i> to a holy use: thus they are sanctified people who 
    are separated from the world, and set apart for God's service. 
    Sanctification has a <i>privative </i>and a <i>positive </i>part.</p>
<p align="justify">I. A <b>privative </b>part, which lies in the <i>purging 
    out of sin</i>. Sin is compared to leaven, which sours; and to leprosy, 
    which defiles. Sanctification purges out "the old leaven." Though it does 
    not take away the <i>life </i>of sin—yet it takes away the <i>love </i>of 
    sin.</p>
<p align="justify">II. A <b>positive </b>part, which is the spiritual <i>
    refining of the soul</i>; which in Scripture is called a "renewing of our 
    mind," and a "partaking of the divine nature." The priests in the law were 
    not only <i>washed </i>in the great laver—but <i>adorned </i>with glorious 
    apparel. Exodus 28:2. Just so, sanctification not only <i>washes </i>from 
    sin—but <i>adorns </i>with purity.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What is the NATURE of sanctification?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">It is a principle of grace savingly wrought, whereby the 
    heart becomes holy, and is made after God's own heart. A sanctified person 
    bears not only God's <i>name</i>—but his <i>image</i>. In opening the nature 
    of sanctification, I shall lay down these seven positions:</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) Sanctification is a SUPERNATURAL thing; it is 
    divinely infused.</p></font> </b>We are naturally polluted, and to cleanse, God 
    takes to be his prerogative. "I am the Lord, who sanctifies you." Weeds grow 
    by themselves. Flowers must be planted and cultivated. Sanctification is a 
    flower of the Spirit's planting, therefore it is called, "The sanctification 
    of the Spirit." 1 Pet 1:2.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Sanctification is an INTERNAL thing; it lies chiefly 
    in the heart.</p></b> </font>It is called "the adorning the hidden man of the 
    heart." 1 Pet 3:4. The dew wets the <i>leaf</i>—but the <i>sap </i>is hidden 
    in the root. Just so, the religion of some consists only in externals—but 
    sanctification is deeply rooted in the soul. "In the hidden part you shall 
    make me to know wisdom." Psalm 51:6.
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(3.) Sanctification is an EXTENSIVE thing: it spreads 
    into the whole man.</p></font> </b>"May the God of peace sanctify you wholly." 
    As original corruption has depraved all the faculties—"the whole head is 
    sick, the whole heart faint," no part sound, as if the whole volume of blood 
    were corrupted; just so, sanctification goes over the whole soul. After the 
    fall, there was ignorance in the <i>mind</i>; but in sanctification, we are 
    "light in the Lord." After the fall, the <i>will </i>was depraved; there was 
    not only impotence to good—but obstinacy. In sanctification, there is a 
    blessed pliableness in the will, with the will of God. After the fall, the
    <i>affections </i>were misplaced on wrong objects; in sanctification, they 
    are turned into a sweet order and harmony—the <i>grief </i>placed on sin, 
    the <i>love </i>on God, the <i>joy </i>on heaven. Thus sanctification 
    spreads itself as far as original corruption; it goes over the whole soul. 
    "May God of peace sanctify you wholly." He is not a sanctified person who is 
    good only in some part—but who is all over sanctified; therefore, in 
    Scripture, grace is called a "new <i>man</i>," not a new <i>eye </i>or a new
    <i>tongue</i>—but a "new <i>man</i>." Col 3:10. A good Christian, though he 
    is sanctified but in part—yet in every part.
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(4.) Sanctification is an intense and ARDENT thing.</p></font>
</b>Its properties burn within the believer. "Fervent in spirit." Rom 12:2. 
    Sanctification is not a dead form—but it is inflamed into zeal. We call 
    water hot, when it is so in the third or fourth degree. Just so, he is holy 
    whose true religion is heated to some degree, and his heart boils over in 
    love to God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Sanctification is a BEAUTIFUL thing.</p></b></font> It 
    makes God and angels fall in love with us. "The beauties of holiness." Psalm 
    110:3. As the sun is to the world, so is sanctification to the soul, 
    beautifying and bespangling it in God's eyes. That which makes God glorious 
    must needs make us so. <i>Holiness is the most sparkling jewel in the 
    Godhead. </i>"Glorious in holiness." Sanctification is the first fruit of 
    the Spirit; it is heaven begun in the soul. <i>Sanctification </i>and <i>
    glory </i>differ only in degree. <i>Sanctification </i>is glory in the seed; 
    and <i>glory </i>is sanctification in the flower. Holiness is the 
    quintessence of happiness.
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(6.) Sanctification is an ABIDING thing.</p></font> </b>"His 
    seed remains in him." He who is truly sanctified, cannot fall from that 
    state. Indeed, mere <i>seeming </i>holiness may be lost—<i>colors </i>may 
    wash off. Sanctification may suffer an <i>eclipse</i>. "You have left your 
    first love." True sanctification is a blossom of eternity. "The anointing 
    which you have received, abides in you." He who is truly sanctified can no 
    more fall away, than the angels which are fixed in their heavenly orbs.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Sanctification is a PROGRESSIVE thing. </p></b></font>It 
    is growing; it is compared to seed which grows: first the blade springs up, 
    then the ear, then the ripe corn in the ear. Such as are already sanctified 
    may be more sanctified. <i>Justification </i>does not admit of degrees; a 
    believer cannot be more elected or justified than he is—but he may be more 
    sanctified than he is. Sanctification is still increasing, like the morning 
    sun, which grows brighter to the full meridian. <i>Knowledge </i>is said to 
    increase, and <i>faith </i>to increase. Col 1:10; 2 Cor 10:5. A Christian is 
    continually <i>adding an inch </i>to his spiritual stature. It is not with 
    us as it was with Christ, who received the Spirit <i>without measure</i>; 
    for Christ could not be more holy than he was. We have the Spirit only <i>in 
    measure</i>, and may be still augmenting our grace; as Apelles, when he had 
    drawn a picture, would be still mending it with his pencil. The image of God 
    is drawn but imperfectly in us, therefore we must be still mending it, and 
    drawing it in more lively colors. Sanctification is progressive; if it does 
    not <i>grow</i>—it is because it does not <i>live</i>. Thus you see the 
    nature of sanctification.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the COUNTERFEITS of sanctification?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">There are things which look like sanctification—but are 
    not.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The first counterfeit of sanctification is MORAL 
    VIRTUE. </p></b></font>To be <i>just</i>, to be <i>temperate</i>, to have a <i>
    kind </i>demeanor; not to have one's escutcheon blotted with ignominious 
    scandal, is good—but not enough; it is not sanctification. A <i>field</i>-flower 
    differs from a <i>garden</i>-flower. Many heathen have attained to morality; 
    as Cato, Socrates, and Aristides have. <i>Civility </i>is but nature 
    refined; there is nothing of Christ there, and the <i>heart </i>may be foul 
    and impure. Under these <i>beautiful leaves of civility </i>the <i>worm of 
    unbelief </i>may be hidden! A moral person has a secret antipathy against 
    grace: he hates vice, and he hates grace as much as vice. The snake has a 
    beautiful <i>color</i>—but a <i>sting</i>. A person adorned and cultivated 
    with moral virtue, has a secret spleen against sanctity. The <i>Stoics </i>
    who were the chief of the moralized heathens, were the bitterest enemies 
    Paul had. Acts 17:18.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The second counterfeit of sanctification is 
    SUPERSTITIOUS DEVOTION.</p></b></font> This abounds in Popery; adorations, 
    images, altars, vestments, and holy water—are far from sanctification. This
    <i>religious frenzy</i> does not put any intrinsic goodness into a man, it 
    does not make a man better. If the <i>legal </i>purifications and washings, 
    which were of God's own appointing, did not make those who used them more 
    holy; and the priests, who wore holy garments, and had holy oil poured on 
    them—were not more holy without the anointing of the Spirit; then surely 
    those <i>superstitious innovations</i> in religion, which God never 
    appointed, cannot contribute any holiness to men. A <i>superstitious 
    holiness </i>costs no great labor; there is nothing of the heart in it. If 
    to count over a few beads, or bow to an idol, or sprinkle themselves with 
    holy water were sanctification, and all that is required of those who should 
    be saved—then hell would be empty, none would go there!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The third counterfeit of sanctification is 
    HYPOCRISY; when men make a <i>pretense </i>of that holiness which they have 
    not.</p></b></font> As a comet may shine like a star—a luster may shine from 
    their profession, which dazzles the eyes of the beholders. "Having a form of 
    godliness—but denying the power." These are lamps without oil; whited 
    sepulchers, like the Egyptian temples, which had beautiful outsides—but 
    within were filled with spiders and vermin. The apostle speaks of <i>true 
    holiness</i>, Eph 4:24; implying that there is holiness which is <i>spurious
    </i>and <i>sham</i>. "You have a <i>name </i>to live—but are dead;" like <i>
    pictures </i>and <i>statues </i>which are destitute of a vital principle. 
    "Clouds without water." They pretend to be full of the Spirit—but are empty 
    clouds. 
<p align="justify">This <i>show of sanctification </i>is a self-delusion. He 
    who takes copper instead of gold, wrongs himself; the most counterfeit 
    professor deceives others while he <i>lives</i>—but deceives himself when he
    <i>dies!</i> To pretend to holiness when there is none, is a vain thing. 
    What were the foolish virgins the better, for their fine <i>lamps</i>, when 
    they lacked <i>oil</i>? What is the lamp of profession, without the oil of 
    saving grace? What comfort will a <i>show of holiness</i> yield at last? 
    Will <i>painted </i>gold enrich? Will painted <i>wine </i>refresh him who is 
    thirsty? Will painted <i>holiness </i>be a cordial at the hour of death? A 
    pretense of sanctification is not to be rested in. Many ships, that have had 
    the <i>name </i>of 'the Hope', 'the Safeguard', 'the Triumph', have been 
    dashed and destroyed upon rocks. Just so, many who have had the <i>name </i>
    of saints—have been cast into hell.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) The fourth counterfeit of sanctification is 
    RESTRAINING grace—when men forbear vice, though they do not hate it. </p></b>
</font>This may be the sinner's motto, "Gladly I would—but I dare not." The 
    dog has a mind to the bone—but is afraid of the cudgel. Just so, men have a 
    mind to lust—but conscience stands as the angel, with a flaming sword, and 
    affrights them. They have a mind to revenge—but the fear of hell is a 
    curb-bit to check them. There is no change of heart; sin is <i>curbed</i>—but 
    not <i>cured</i>. A <i>lion </i>may be in chains—but is a lion still.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) The fifth counterfeit of sanctification is COMMON 
    grace—which is a slight, transient work of the Spirit—but does not amount to 
    conversion. </p></b></font>There is some light in the judgement—but it is not 
    humbling. There are some checks in the conscience—but they are not 
    awakening. This looks like sanctification—but is not. Men have <i>
    convictions </i>wrought in them—but they break loose from them again, like 
    the deer, which, being shot, shakes out the arrow. After conviction, men go 
    into the house of mirth, and take the harp to drive away the spirit of 
    sadness—and so all dies and comes to nothing.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Wherein appears the NECESSITY of sanctification?</p></b></font> 
    In six things: 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) God has called us to it.</p></b></font> "His divine 
    power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our 
    knowledge of him who <i>called </i>us by his own <i>glory </i>and <i>
    goodness</i>." 2 Peter 1:3. We are called to <i>goodness</i>, as well as <i>
    glory</i>. "God has not called us to uncleanness—but unto holiness." We have 
    no call to sin; we may have a temptation—but no call to sin; no call to be 
    proud, or unclean; but we have a call to be holy.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Without sanctification, there is no evidencing our 
    justification.</p></b></font> Justification and sanctification go together. "But 
    you are sanctified—but you are justified." "Pardoning iniquity," Micah 7:18; 
    there is justification. "He will subdue our iniquities," 5:19; there is 
    sanctification. "Out of Christ's side came blood and water;" <i>blood </i>
    for justification; <i>water </i>for sanctification. Such as have not the 
    water out of Christ's side to <i>cleanse </i>them, shall never have the 
    blood out of his side to <i>save </i>them.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Without sanctification we have no title to the new 
    covenant.</p></b></font> The covenant of grace is our charter for heaven. The 
    condition of the covenant is, "That God will be our God." But who are 
    savingly interested in the covenant, and may plead the benefit of it? 
    Sanctified people only. "A new heart will I give you, and I will put my 
    Spirit within you, and I will be your God." If a man makes a <i>will</i>, 
    none but such people as are named in the will, can lay claim to the will. 
    Just so, God makes a will and testament—but it is limited to such as are 
    sanctified; and it is high presumption for anyone else to lay claim to the 
    will.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) There is no going to heaven without sanctification.</p></b></font> 
    "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord." God is a holy God, and he will 
    allow no unholy creature to come near him. A king will not allow a man with 
    plague-sores to approach into his presence. Heaven is not like Noah's 
    ark—where the <i>clean </i>beasts and the <i>unclean </i>entered. No unclean 
    beasts come into the <i>heavenly </i>ark; for though God allows the wicked 
    to live awhile on the earth, he will never allow heaven to be pestered with 
    such vermin! Are they fit to see God—who wallow in wickedness? Will God ever 
    lay such <i>vipers </i>in his bosom? "Without holiness no man shall see the 
    Lord." It must be a clear eye that sees a bright object: only a holy heart 
    can see God in his glory. Sinners may see God as an enemy—but not as a 
    friend! They will have an affrighting vision of him—but not a beatific 
    vision! They will see the flaming sword—but not the mercy-seat! Oh then, 
    what need is there of sanctification!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Without sanctification all our holy things are 
    defiled.</p></b></font> "Unto those who are defiled, is nothing pure." Under the 
    law, "If one of you is carrying a holy sacrifice in his robes and happens to 
    brush against some bread or stew, wine or oil, or any other kind of 
    food—will it also become holy?" No, the holy sacrifice would not purify the 
    other things—but it would be polluted by those things. Hag 2:12, 13. This is 
    an emblem of a sinner's polluting his holy offering. A foul stomach turns 
    the best food into ill humours. Just so, an unsanctified heart pollutes 
    prayers, alms, and sacraments. This evinces the necessity of sanctification. 
    Sanctification makes our holy things accepted. A holy heart is the altar, 
    which sanctifies the offering; if not to our satisfaction, yet to God's 
    acceptance.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Without sanctification we can show no sign of our 
    election.</p></b></font> 2 Thess 2:13. Election is the <i>cause </i>of our 
    salvation, sanctification is our <i>evidence</i>. Sanctification is the 
    ear-mark of Christ's elect sheep.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the SIGNS of sanctification?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First, such as are sanctified, can remember a time when 
    they were unsanctified.</p></b></font> "<i>Once </i>we too were foolish and 
    disobedient. We were misled by others and became slaves to many wicked 
    desires and evil pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy. We hated 
    others, and they hated us. But then God our Savior showed us his kindness 
    and love. He saved us, not because of the good things we did, but because of 
    his mercy. He washed away our sins and gave us a new life through the Holy 
    Spirit." Titus 3:3-5. We were in our blood, and then God washed us with 
    water, and anointed us with oil. Ezek 16:9. Those trees of righteousness 
    which blossom and bear almonds, can remember when they were like Aaron's dry 
    rod—not one blossom of holiness growing. A sanctified soul can remember when 
    it was estranged from God through ignorance and vanity—and when free grace 
    planted this flower of holiness in it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A second sign of sanctification is the indwelling of the
    <i>Holy </i>Spirit.</p></b></font> "The Holy Spirit which dwells in us." An <i>
    unclean </i>spirit dwells in the wicked and carries them to pride, lust, 
    revenge; the devil enters into these swine! But the Spirit of God dwells in 
    the elect, as their guide and comforter. The Spirit possesses the saints. 
    God's Spirit sanctifies the <i>imagination</i>, causing it to mint holy 
    thoughts; and sanctifies the <i>will </i>by putting a new bias upon it, 
    whereby it is inclined to godliness. He who is sanctified, has the <i>
    influence </i>of the Spirit, though not the <i>essence </i>of the Spirit.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A third sign of sanctification is an antipathy against 
    sin.</p></b></font> "I hate every wrong path." Psalm 119:104. A hypocrite may <i>
    leave </i>sin—yet <i>love </i>it; as a serpent casts its coat—but keeps its 
    sting! But a sanctified person can say he not only <i>leaves </i>sin—but <i>
    loathes </i>it. In a sanctified soul, there is a holy antipathy against sin; 
    and antipathies can never be reconciled. Because a man has an antipathy 
    against sin—he cannot but oppose it, and seek the destruction of it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A fourth sign of sanctification is the spiritual 
    performance of duties, with the <i>heart</i>, and from a principle of <i>
    love</i>. </p></b></font>The sanctified soul prays out of a love to prayer. A 
    man may have <i>gifts </i>to admiration; he may speak as an angel dropped 
    out of heaven—yet he may be carnal in spiritual things; his services may not 
    come from a renewed principle, nor be carried upon the wings of <i>delight
    </i>in duty. A sanctified soul worships God in the Spirit. "You also, like 
    living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy 
    priesthood, offering <i>spiritual sacrifices</i> acceptable to God through 
    Jesus Christ." 1 Peter 2:5. God judges not of our duties by their <i>length</i>—but 
    by the <i>love </i>from which they spring.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A fifth sign is a holy life.</p></b></font> "But just as he 
    who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do." 1 Peter 1:15. Where the
    <i>heart </i>is sanctified, the <i>life </i>will be holy. The temple had 
    gold <i>without, </i>as well as <i>within</i>. A coin has the king's image 
    and superscription stamped on it. Just so, where there is sanctification, 
    there is not only God's image in the <i>heart</i>—but a superscription of 
    holiness written in the <i>life</i>. Some say they have <i>good hearts</i>—but 
    their <i>lives </i>are <i>wicked</i>. "There is a generation that are pure 
    in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness." If the 
    water is foul in the <i>bucket</i>, it cannot be clean in the <i>well</i>. 
    "The king's daughter is all glorious <i>within</i>." Psalm 45:13. There is 
    holiness of heart. "Her <i>clothing </i>is of wrought gold." There is 
    holiness of life. Grace is most beautiful, when its light so shines that 
    others may see it; this adorns true religion, and makes proselytes to the 
    faith.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A sixth sign is steadfast resolution. </p></b></font>He is 
    resolved never to part with his holiness. Let others reproach it—he loves it 
    the more. Let water be sprinkled on the fire—it burns the more. He says, as 
    David, when Michal reproached him for dancing before the ark, "If this is to 
    be vile—I will yet be more vile!" Let others persecute him for his holiness, 
    he says as Paul, "None of these things move me!" He prefers <i>sanctity </i>
    before <i>safety</i>; and had rather keep his <i>conscience pure </i>than 
    his <i>skin whole</i>. He says as Job, "My integrity I will hold fast, and 
    not let it go!" He will rather part with his <i>life</i>, than his <i>
    conscience</i>.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: The main thing a Christian should look after, is 
    sanctification. </p></b></font>This is "the one thing needful." Sanctification 
    gives us a pure complexion, it makes us as the heavens, bespangled with 
    stars. Sanctification is our nobility, by it we are born of God, and partake 
    of the divine nature. Sanctification is our riches, therefore compared to 
    rows of jewels, and chains of gold. Canticles 1:10. Sanctification is our 
    best certificate for heaven. What <i>evidence </i>have we else to show? Have 
    we <i>knowledge</i>? So has the devil. Do we <i>profess</i> religion? Satan 
    often appears in Samuel's mantle, and transforms himself into an angel of 
    light. But our certificate for heaven is sanctification. Sanctification is 
    the first fruits of the Spirit; the only coin that will pass current in the 
    other world. Sanctification is the evidence of God's love. We cannot know 
    God's saving love by his giving us health, riches, or success; but only by 
    the drawing his image of sanctification on us, by the pencil of the Holy 
    Spirit—it is known.
<p align="justify">Oh the <i>misery </i>of such as are <i>destitute </i>of a 
    principle of sanctification! They are spiritually dead. Eph 2:1. Though they
    <i>breathe</i>—yet they do not <i>live</i>. The greatest part of the world 
    remains unsanctified. "The world lies in wickedness." That is, the major 
    part of the world. Many <i>call </i>themselves Christians—but blot out the 
    word 'saints'. You may as well call him a <i>man—</i>who lacks reason; as 
    him a <i>Christian—</i>who lacks grace. </p>
<p align="justify">Some are buoyed up to such a height of wickedness, that 
    they hate and deride sanctification. They hate it. It is bad to <i>lack </i>
    holiness—it is worse to <i>hate </i>it. They embrace the <i>form </i>of 
    religion—but hate the <i>power</i>. As the vulture hates sweet smells—so 
    they hate the the <i>perfume of holiness</i>. They say in derision, 'These 
    are your holy ones!' To deride sanctification argues a high degree of 
    atheism, and is a black brand of reprobation. <i>Scoffing Ishmael</i> was 
    cast out of Abraham's family; and such as scoff at holiness shall be cast 
    out of heaven!<br/>

<p align="justify">Use two: Above all things pursue after sanctification.
    </p></b></font>Seek grace more than gold. "Keep her, for she is your life!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the chief INDUCEMENTS to sanctification?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is the will of God that we should be holy.</p></b></font> 
    "This is the will of God—your sanctification." As God's <i>Word </i>must be 
    the rule, so his <i>will </i>must be the reason of our actions. This is the 
    will of God—our sanctification. Perhaps it is not the will of God we should 
    be <i>rich</i>—but it is his will that we should be <i>holy</i>. God's will 
    is our warrant.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Jesus Christ has died for our sanctification.</p></b></font> 
    Christ shed his blood to wash off our impurity. The cross was both an <i>
    altar </i>and a <i>laver</i>. "Our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who 
    gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for 
    himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good." Titus 
    2:13-14. If we could be saved without holiness, Christ needed not have died. 
    Christ died, not only to save us from <i>wrath</i>—but from <i>sin!
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Sanctification makes us resemble God.</p></b></font> It 
    was Adam's sin—that he aspired to be like God in <i>omniscience</i>; but we 
    must endeavor to be like him in <i>sanctity</i>. It is a clear glass—in 
    which we can see a face; it is a holy heart—in which something of God can be 
    seen. Nothing of God can be seen in an unsanctified man—but you may see <i>
    Satan's picture </i>in him. <i>Envy </i>is the devil's eye, <i>hypocrisy </i>
    his cloven foot; but nothing of God's image can be seen in him. "Just as He 
    who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written--Be 
    holy, because I am holy." 1 Peter 1:15-16.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Sanctification is that which God bears a great love 
    to.</p></b></font> God is not drawn to any person's outward beauty, great 
    abilities, noble blood, or worldly grandeur. But he is drawn to a heart 
    embellished with holiness! Christ never admired anything but the <i>beauty 
    of holiness</i>. He slighted the glorious buildings of the temple—but 
    admired the woman's faith, and said, "O woman, great is your faith." As a 
    king delights to see <i>his image </i>upon a piece of coin; so where God 
    sees his <i>likeness</i>—he gives his <i>love</i>. The Lord has <i>two 
    heavens </i>to dwell in—and the holy heart is one of them!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Sanctification is the only thing which makes us 
    differ from the wicked. </p></b></font>God's people have his seal upon them. 
    "The foundation of God stands sure, having this seal—The Lord knows those 
    who are his. And, Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from 
    iniquity." 2 Tim 2:19. The godly are sealed with a <i>double seal</i>—a seal 
    of <i>election</i>, "The Lord knows who are his;" and a seal of <i>
    sanctification</i>, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from 
    iniquity." This is the name by which God's people are known, "The people of 
    your holiness." Isa 63:18. As <i>chastity </i>distinguishes a virtuous woman 
    from a harlot, so <i>sanctification </i>distinguishes God's people from 
    others. "You have received an anointing from the Holy One." I John 2:20.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) It is as great a shame to have the <i>name </i>of a 
    Christian—yet lack sanctity</p></b></font>—as to have the name of a <i>steward
    </i>and lack fidelity; or the name of a <i>virgin</i>, and lack chastity. It 
    exposes true religion to reproach—to be baptized into the name of Christ 
    while unholy, and to have eyes full of tears on a sabbath, and on a week-day 
    eyes full of adultery! To be so <i>devout </i>at the Lord's table, as if 
    they were stepping into heaven; and so <i>profane </i>the day after, as if 
    they came out of hell! To have the name of 'Christian' while living unholy, 
    is a scandal to true religion, and makes the ways of God to be evil spoken 
    of.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Sanctification fits for heaven.</p></b></font> "Who has 
    called us to <i>glory </i>and <i>virtue</i>." <i>Glory </i>is the throne, 
    and <i>sanctification </i>is the step by which we ascend to it. As you first
    <i>cleanse </i>the vessel, and then pour in the wine; just so, God first 
    cleanses us by <i>sanctification</i>, and then pours in the wine of <i>glory</i>. 
    Solomon was first anointed with <i>oil</i>, and then was a <i>king</i>. 
    First God anoints us with the holy oil of his <i>Spirit</i>, and then sets 
    the crown of <i>happiness </i>upon our head. <i>Pureness of heart</i> and <i>
    seeing God </i>are linked together. Matt 5:8.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify">How may sanctification be ATTAINED?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Be conversant in the word of God. </p></b></font>
    "Sanctify them through your truth." John 17:17. The Word is both a <i>mirror
    </i>to show us the spots of our soul, and a <i>laver </i>to wash them away. 
    The Word has a <i>transforming </i>virtue in it; it irradiates the mind, and 
    consecrates the heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Get faith in Christ's blood.</p></b></font> "Having 
    purified their hearts by faith." She in the gospel, who <i>touched </i>the 
    hem of Christ's garment, was healed. A touch of faith purifies! Nothing can 
    have a greater force upon the heart, to sanctify it, than faith. If I 
    believe Christ and his merits are mine—how can I sin against him? <i>
    Justifying </i>faith does that in a spiritual sense, which <i>miraculous </i>
    faith does—it removes mountains, the mountains of pride, lust, envy. True 
    faith, and the <i>love of sin, </i>are inconsistent.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Breathe after the Spirit.</p></b></font> "The 
    sanctification of the Spirit." The Spirit sanctifies the heart, as the storm 
    purifies the air, and as fire refines metals. The Spirit at work, generates 
    his own likeness. The Spirit stamps the impression of its own sanctity upon 
    the heart, as the seal prints its likeness upon the wax. The Spirit of God 
    in a man perfumes him with holiness, and makes his heart a picture of 
    heaven.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Associate with sanctified people.</p></b></font> They 
    may, by their counsel, prayers, and holy example, be a means to make you 
    holy. As the <i>communion of saints </i>is in our creed, so it should be our 
    company. "He who walks with the wise shall be wise." <i>Association </i>
    begets <i>assimilation</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Pray for sanctification.</p></b></font> Job propounds a 
    question. "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?" God can do it! 
    Out of an unholy heart—he can produce grace! Oh! make David's prayer your 
    own, "Create in me a clean heart, O God." Lay your heart before the Lord, 
    and say, "Lord, my unsanctified heart pollutes all it touches. I am not fit 
    to live with such a heart, for I cannot <i>honor </i>you; nor die with such 
    a heart, for I cannot <i>see </i>you. Oh create in me a new heart! Lord, 
    consecrate my heart, and make it your temple, and your praises shall be sung 
    there forever!"<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Has God brought a clean thing out of an 
    unclean? Has he sanctified you? Wear this jewel of sanctification with 
    THANKFULNESS.</p></b></font> "Always thanking the Father, who has enabled you to 
    share the inheritance that belongs to God's <i>holy </i>people, who live in 
    the light." Colossians 1:12. Christian, you could <i>defile </i>yourself—but 
    you could not <i>sanctify </i>yourself. But God has done it—he has not only 
    chained up <i>sin</i>—but changed your <i>nature</i>—and made you as a 
    king's daughter—all glorious within! He has put upon you the breastplate of 
    holiness, which, though it may be shot <i>at</i>, can never be shot <i>
    through</i>. 
<p align="justify">Are there any here who are sanctified? God has done more 
    for you than for millions, who may have many temporal blessings—but are not 
    sanctified. He has done more for you than if he had made you an earthly 
    king! Are you sanctified? Heaven is begun in you—for <i>happiness </i>is 
    nothing but the quintessence of <i>holiness</i>. Oh, how thankful should you 
    be to God! Do as that blind man in the gospel did after he had received his 
    sight, who "followed Christ, glorifying God." Make heaven ring with God's 
    praises!</p>
