 </font></p>
<p align="center">1. The Covenant of Grace<br/>
 </p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 20: Did God leave all mankind to perish in the 
    estate of sin and misery?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: No! He entered into a covenant of grace to 
    deliver the <i>elect </i>out of that state, and to bring them into a state 
    of grace by a Redeemer.</p>
<p align="justify">"I will make an everlasting covenant with you." Man being 
    by his fall plunged into a labyrinth of <i>misery</i>, and having no way 
    left to recover himself, God was pleased to enter into a <i>new covenant </i>
    with him, and to restore him to life by a Redeemer.</p>
<p align="justify">The great proposition I shall go upon is, that there is a 
    new covenant ratified between God and the elect.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the new covenant?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is a solemn compact and agreement made between God and 
    fallen man, wherein the Lord undertakes to be our God, and to make us his 
    people.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What names are given to the covenant?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is called the covenant of <b>peace </b>in Ezek 
    37:26, because it seals up <i>reconciliation </i>between God and humble 
    sinners. Before this covenant there was nothing but enmity. God did not love 
    us, for a creature that offends God by its sin, cannot be loved by a holy 
    God. Also, we did not love him, since a God who condemns cannot be loved by 
    a guilty creature; so that there was war on both sides. But God has found 
    out a way in the new covenant to reconcile differing parties, so that it is 
    fitly called the covenant of peace.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is called a covenant of <b>grace</b>, and well it 
    may; for, </p>
<p align="justify">(1) It was of grace, that, when we had forfeited the 
    first covenant, God should enter into a new one, after we had cast away 
    ourselves. The covenant of grace is as a plank after shipwreck. Oh the free 
    grace of God, that he should parley with sinners, and set his wisdom and 
    mercy to work, to bring rebels into the bond of the covenant!</p>
<p align="justify">(2) It is a covenant of grace, because it is a royal 
    charter, all made up of terms of grace; that "God will cast our sins behind 
    his back;" that "he will love us freely;" that he will give us a will to 
    accept of the mercy of the covenant, and strength to perform the conditions 
    of the covenant. Ezek 36:27. All this is pure grace!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">WHY should God make a covenant with us?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is out of indulgence, favor, and regard to us. A 
    tyrant will not enter into a covenant with slaves, he will not show them 
    such respect. God's entering into a covenant with us, to be our God, is a 
    dignity he puts upon us. A covenant is the mark of distinction between God's 
    people and heathens. "I will establish my covenant with <i>you</i>." When 
    the Lord told Abraham that he would enter into a covenant with him, Abraham 
    fell upon his face, as being amazed that the God of glory should bestow such 
    a favor upon him. Gen 17:2.</p>
<p align="justify">God makes a covenant with us, to tie us fast to him; as 
    it is called in Ezekiel, the "bond of the covenant." God knows we have 
    slippery hearts, therefore he will have a covenant to bind us. It is horrid 
    impiety to go away from God, after covenant. If one of the vestal <i>nuns</i>, 
    who had vowed herself to religion, was deflowered, the Romans caused her to 
    be burnt alive. It is perjury to depart from God after solemn covenant.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">How does the covenant of grace differ from the first 
    covenant made with Adam?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The TERMS of the first covenant were more strict and 
    severe.</p></b></font> For, 
<p align="justify">(a) The least failing would have made the covenant with 
    Adam null and void—but many failings do not annul the covenant of grace. I 
    grant, the least sin is a trespass upon the covenant—but it does not make it 
    null and void. There may be many failings in the marital relation—but every 
    failing does not break the marriage bond. It would be dreadful, if, as oft 
    as we break covenant with God—that he should break covenant with us; but God 
    will not take strict justice with every failing—but in "anger remember 
    mercy."</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The first covenant being broken, allowed the sinner 
    no remedy, all doors of hope were shut; but the new covenant allows the 
    sinner a remedy. It leaves room for repentance, and provides a mediator. 
    "Jesus the mediator of the new covenant." Heb 12:24.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The first covenant ran all upon "working," the 
    second is upon "believing."</p></b></font> Rom 4:5.
<p align="justify">But are not works required in the covenant of grace?</p>
<p align="justify">Yes. "This is a faithful saying, that those who believe 
    in God, should be careful to maintain good works." But the covenant of <i>
    grace </i>does not require works in the same manner as the covenant of <i>
    works </i>did. In the first covenant, works were required as the <i>
    condition </i>of life; in the second covenant, they are required only as the
    <i>signs </i>of life. In the first covenant, works were required as <i>
    grounds </i>of salvation; in the new covenant, they are required as <i>
    evidences </i>of our love to God. In the first covenant, they were required 
    to the <i>justification </i>of our persons; in the new covenant, to the <i>
    manifestation </i>of our grace.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the condition of the covenant of grace?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The main condition is FAITH. "For it is by grace you have 
    been saved, through <b>faith</b>—and this not from yourselves, it is the 
    gift of God-- not by works, so that no one can boast." Ephesians 2:8-9. 
    "Jesus said to the woman—Your <b>faith </b>has saved you; go in peace." Luke 
    7:50. </p>
<p align="justify">Why is faith more the condition of the new covenant, than 
    any other grace?</p>
<p align="justify">To exclude all glorying in the creature. Faith is a 
    humble grace. If <i>repentance </i>or <i>works </i>were the condition of the 
    covenant, a man would say, "It is my righteousness which has saved me!" But 
    if it is of faith, where is boasting? Faith fetches all from Christ, and 
    gives all the glory to Christ! Faith is a most humble grace. Hence it is 
    that God has singled out this grace to be the condition of the covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">If faith is the condition of the covenant of grace, it 
    excludes desperate presumptuous sinners from the covenant. They say there is 
    a covenant of grace, and they shall be saved even if they have no faith. But 
    the condition of the covenant is faith, and if you have no faith, you have 
    no more to do with the covenant, than a foreigner has to do with the city 
    charter.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Of INFORMATION. </p></b></font>See the amazing 
    goodness of God, to enter into covenant with <i>us!</i> He never entered 
    into covenant with <i>angels </i>when they fell. It was much condescension 
    in God to enter into covenant with <i>us </i>in a state of innocence—but 
    more so when we were in a state of enmity. In this covenant of grace, we may 
    see the cream of God's love, and the working of his affections to sinners. 
    This is a marriage covenant. "I am married to you—says the Lord." Jeremiah 
    3:14. In the new covenant, God makes <i>himself </i>over to us, and what can 
    he give more? He makes over his <i>promises </i>to us, and what better bonds 
    can we have?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of TRIAL. </p></b></font>Whether we are in covenant 
    with God. There are three characteristics of God's covenant people.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) God's covenant people are a HUMBLE people. </p></b>
</font>"Be clothed with humility." 1 Pet 5:5. God's people esteem others 
    better than themselves; they shrink into nothing in their own thoughts. Phil 
    2:3. David cries out, "I am a worm, and no man:"Psalm 22:6. Though a saint, 
    though a king—yet a worm! When Moses' face shined, he covered it with a 
    veil. When God's people shine most in grace, they are covered with the veil 
    of humility. Pride excludes from the covenant, for "God resists the proud." 
    Surely, such as whom God resist, He will not take to be with Himself in 
    glory. Abraham the father of the faithful, confesses, "I am nothing but dust 
    and ashes." Genesis 18:27.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) A people in covenant with God are a WILLING people.
    </p></b></font>Though they cannot serve God perfectly--they serve Him willingly. 
    They do not grudge God a little time spent in his worship. They do not 
    murmur at sufferings. They will go through a sea and a wilderness—if God 
    calls. "Your people shall be a willing people." This spontaneity and 
    willingness is from the attractive power of God's Spirit. The Spirit does 
    not force--but sweetly draws the will. This willingness in makes all our 
    services accepted. God does sometimes accept of willingness without the 
    work--but never the work without willingness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) God's covenant people are a CONSECRATED people.</p></b></font> 
    They have "holiness to the Lord" written upon them. "You are a holy people 
    to the Lord your God." Deut 7:6. God's covenant people are separated from 
    the world, and sanctified by the Spirit. The priests under the law were not 
    only to wash in the great laver—but were arrayed with glorious apparel. Exod 
    28:2. This was typical, to show God's people are not only washed from gross 
    sins—but adorned with holiness of heart. They bear not only God's name—but 
    His image. Tamerlane refused a pot of gold, when he saw it had not his 
    father's stamp upon it—but the Roman stamp. Holiness is God's stamp; if he 
    does not see this stamp upon us, he will not own us for his covenant people.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Of EXHORTATION. </p></b></font>To such as are out 
    of covenant—labor to get into covenant, and have God for your God. How glad 
    would the old world have been of an ark! How industrious should we be to get 
    within the ark of the covenant!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Consider—the misery of such as live and die outside 
    of covenant with God.</p></b></font> Such have none to go to in an hour of 
    distress. When <i>conscience </i>accuses, when <i>sickness </i>approaches 
    (which is but a harbinger to bespeak a lodging for death), then what will 
    you do? Where will you flee? Will you look to Christ for help? He is a 
    mediator only for such as are in covenant. Oh, how will you be filled with 
    horror and despair! and be as Saul, when he said, "The Philistines make war 
    against me, and the Lord has departed!" Until you are in covenant with 
    God—there is no mercy. The mercy-seat was placed upon the ark, and the 
    mercy-seat was no larger than the ark. This was to show, that the <i>mercy
    </i>of God reaches no further than the <i>covenant</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Consider—the excellency of the covenant of grace.
    </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. It is a better covenant than the covenant made with 
    Adam—because it is more <b>friendly </b>and <b>acceptable</b>. Those 
    services which would have been rejected in the first covenant are accepted 
    in the second covenant. Here God accepts of the <i>will </i>for the deed, 2 
    Cor 8:12; here <i>sincerity </i>is crowned in the covenant of grace. Wherein 
    we are <i>weak</i>, God will give strength; and wherein we <i>come short</i>, 
    God will accept of a surety. </p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a better covenant—because it is <b>surer</b>. 
    "You have made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things—and 
    sure." The first covenant was not sure, it stood upon a tottering foundation 
    of <i>works</i>. Adam had no sooner a stock of righteousness to trade 
    with—than he lost it! But the covenant of grace is sure; it is confirmed 
    with God's decree, and it rests upon two mighty pillars—the <i>oath </i>of 
    God, and the <i>blood </i>of God. </p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a better covenant—because it has better <b>
    privileges</b>. The covenant of grace brings great blessings. Our nature now 
    is more ennobled, we are raised to higher glory than in innocence, we are 
    advanced to sit upon Christ's throne. Rev 3:21. We are, by virtue of the 
    covenant of grace, nearer to Christ than the angels! They are his friends, 
    we his spouse! God is willing to be in covenant with you. Why does God woo 
    and beseech you by his ambassadors to be reconciled, if he were not willing 
    to be in covenant?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">I would gladly be in covenant with God—but I have been a 
    great sinner, and I fear God will not admit me into covenant.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">If you see your sins, and loathe yourself for them, God 
    will take you into covenant. "I, even I, am he who blots out your 
    transgressions." As the sea covers great rocks, so God's covenant mercy 
    covers great sins. Some of the Jews who crucified Christ, had their sins 
    washed away in his blood.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">But I am not worthy that God should admit me into 
    covenant.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">It never came into God's thoughts to make a new covenant 
    upon terms of <i>worthiness</i>. If God should show mercy to none but such 
    as are worthy, then must he show mercy to none! But it is God's design in 
    the new covenant— to advance the riches of grace, to love us freely; and 
    when we have no worthiness of our <i>own</i>, to accept us through <i>
    Christ's </i>worthiness. Therefore let not unworthiness discourage you; it 
    is not <i>unworthiness </i>which excludes any from the covenant—but <i>
    unwillingness</i>.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">What shall we do that we may be in covenant with God?</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Seek God by prayer.</p></b> "Demand compassion from the 
    Lord," Augustine. "Lord, be my God in covenant." The Lord has made an 
    express promise, that, upon our prayer to him, the covenant should be 
    ratified, he will be our God, and we shall be his people. "They will call on 
    My name, and I will answer them. I will say: They are My people, and they 
    will say: The Lord is our God." Zechariah 13:9. Only it must be an 
    importunate prayer; come as earnest suitors, resolve to take no denial.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If you would be in covenant with God, break off the 
    covenant with sin.</p></b> Before the marriage-covenant, there must be a 
    divorce. "If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then rid 
    yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to 
    the Lord and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the 
    Philistines." 1 Samuel 7:3. Will any king enter into covenant, with that man 
    who is in league with his enemies?
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) If you would enter into the bond of the covenant, 
    get faith in the blood of the covenant.</p></b> Christ's blood is the blood of 
    atonement. Believe in this blood—and you are safely arked in God's mercy! 
    "You are made near by the blood of Christ."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Of COMFORT to such as can make out their 
    covenant interest in God.</p></b></font> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) You that are in covenant with God, all your sins are 
    pardoned.</p></b></font> Pardon is the crowning mercy. "Who <i>forgives </i>your 
    iniquity, who <i>crowns </i>you." This is a branch of the covenant. "I will 
    be their God, and I will <i>forgive </i>their iniquity." Sin being pardoned, 
    all wrath ceases. How terrible is it when but a spark of God's wrath flies 
    into a man's conscience! But sin being forgiven, there is no more wrath. God 
    does not appear now in the fire or earthquake—but covered with a rainbow 
    full of mercy!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) All your temporal mercies are fruits of the 
    covenant.</p></b></font> Wicked men have mercies by Providence, not by virtue of 
    a covenant; they have their mercies with God's leave, not with his love. But 
    such as are in covenant have their mercies sweetened with God's love—and 
    they swim to them in the blood of Christ! As Naaman said to Gehazi, "Take 
    two talents," so says God to such as are in covenant, take two talents, take 
    health—and take Christ with it; take riches—and take my love with them; take 
    the venison—and take the blessing with it; take two talents.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) You may upon all occasions plead the covenant.</p></b></font> 
    If you are haunted with <i>temptations</i>, plead the covenant, "Lord, you 
    have promised to bruise Satan under my feet shortly; will you allow your 
    child to be thus harassed? Take off the roaring lion." If in <i>need</i>, 
    plead the covenant, "Lord, you have said, I shall lack no good thing; will 
    you save me from hell, and not from poverty? will you give me a <i>kingdom</i>, 
    and deny me daily <i>bread</i>?"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) If in covenant with God, all things shall co-operate 
    for your good.</p></b></font> Psalm 25:10. Not only golden paths—but his bloody 
    paths are for good. Every wind of Providence shall blow them nearer heaven. 
    Affliction shall humble and purify. Heb 12:10. Out of the bitterest 
    medicine, God distills your salvation. Afflictions add to the saints, glory. 
    The more the diamond is cut, the more it sparkles; the heavier the saints' 
    cross is, the heavier shall be their crown.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) If you are in covenant once, then forever in 
    covenant. </p></b></font>The text calls it an "everlasting covenant." Such as 
    are in covenant are elected; and God's electing love is unchangeable. "I 
    will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from 
    them; but I will put my fear in their heart, that they shall not depart from 
    me." Jer 32:40. God will so love the saints, that he will not forsake them; 
    and the saints shall so fear God that they shall not forsake him. It is a 
    covenant of eternity. It must be so; for whom is this covenant made with? Is 
    it not with believers? and have not they coalition and union with Christ? 
    Christ is the head, they are the body. Eph 1:22, 23. This is a near union, 
    much like that union between God the Father and Christ. "As you, Father, are 
    in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us." John 17:2I. Now, the 
    union between Christ and the saints being so inseparable, it can never be 
    dissolved, or the covenant made void; so that you may die with comfort.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) You are in covenant with God, and you are going to 
    your God.</p></b></font> Behold a death-bed cordial; death breaks the union 
    between the body and the soul—but perfects the union between Christ and the 
    soul. This has made the saints desire death as the bride the wedding-day. 
    Phil 1:23. "Lead me, Lord, to that glory," said one, "a glimpse whereof I 
    have seen, as in a glass darkly."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Of DIRECTION. </p></b></font>To show you how you 
    who have tasted of covenant-mercy should walk, and live as a people in 
    covenant with God. As you differ from others in respect of dignity, so you 
    must in point of life-style.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) You must love this God.</p></b></font> God's love to you 
    calls for love. It is <i>Amor gratiatus—</i>a free love. Why should God pass 
    by others, and take you into a league of friendship with himself? In the 
    law, God passed by the lion and eagle, and chose the dove; so he passes by 
    the noble and mighty. It is <i>Amor plenus</i>—a full love. When God takes 
    you into covenant, you are his Hephzihah; Isa 62:4; <i>his delight is in you</i>; 
    he gives you the key of all his treasure, he heaps pearls upon you, he 
    settles heaven and earth upon you; he gives you a bunch of grapes by the 
    way, and says, "Son, all I have is yours!" And does not all this call for 
    love? Who can tread upon these hot coals, and his heart not burn in love to 
    God?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Walk holily. </p></b></font>The covenant has made you a 
    royal nation, therefore be a holy people. Shine as lights in the world; live 
    as earthly angels. God has taken you into covenant, that you and he may have 
    communion together; and what is it that keeps up your communion with God, 
    but holiness?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Walk thankfully.</p></b></font> Psalm 103:1. God is your 
    God in covenant; he has done more for you than if he had made you ride upon 
    the high places of the earth, and given you crowns and scepters! Oh take the 
    cup of salvation, and bless the Lord! Eternity will be little enough to 
    praise him. Musicians love to play on their music where there is the loudest 
    sound, and God loves to bestow his mercies where he may have the loudest 
    praises. You that have angels' <i>reward</i>—do angels, <i>work</i>. Begin 
    that work of praise here, which you hope to be always doing in heaven.
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">2. Christ, the MEDIATOR of the Covenant</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant." Hebrews 12:24</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ is the sum and quintessence of the gospel! 
    He is the wonder of angels; and the joy and triumph of saints. The name of 
    Christ is sweet—it is as music in the ear, honey in the mouth, and a cordial 
    at the heart!</p>
<p align="justify">I shall waive the context, and only speak of that which 
    concerns our present purpose. Having discoursed of the covenant of grace, I 
    shall speak now of the <b>Mediator </b>of the covenant, and the restorer of 
    lapsed sinners, "Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">There are several names and titles in Scripture given to 
    Christ, as the great restorer of mankind: </p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Sometimes he is called a SAVIOR.</p></b></font> "His name 
    shall be called Jesus." Matt 1:21. The Hebrew word for JESUS signifies a 
    Savior, and whom he saves from hell, he saves from sin; where Christ is a 
    Savior he is a sanctifier. "He shall save his people from their sins." Matt 
    1:21. There is no other Savior. "Neither is there salvation in any other." 
    Acts 4:12. As there was but one ark to save the world from drowning—so there 
    is but one Jesus to save sinners from damning. As Naomi said to her 
    daughters-in-law, "Are there yet any more sons in my womb?" Ruth 1:11, so 
    has God no other sons in the womb of his eternal decree, to be saviors to 
    us, besides Christ. "Where shall wisdom be found? The depth says, It is not 
    in me; and the sea says, It is not with me." Where shall salvation be found? 
    The <i>angel </i>says, It is not in me; <i>mortality </i>says, It is not in 
    me; the <i>ordinance </i>says, It is not in me. Christ alone is the 
    well-spring of life; the ordinance is the conduit-pipe which conveys 
    salvation—but Christ is the spring which feeds it. "Neither is there 
    salvation in any other."

<p align="justify">[2] Sometimes Christ is called a REDEEMER. </p></b></font>
    "The Redeemer shall come to Zion." Some understand it of Cyrus, others of an 
    angel; but the most ancient Jewish doctors understood it of Christ, the 
    Redeemer of the elect. "My Redeemer lives." The Hebrew word for Redeemer 
    signifies such a one as is near akin, and has right to redeem a mortgage; so 
    Christ is near of kin to us, being our elder brother, therefore has the best 
    right to redeem us.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Christ is called a MEDIATOR </p></b></font>in the text. 
    "Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant." The Greek word for Mediator 
    signifies a middle person, one who makes up the breach between two 
    disagreeing parties. God and we were at variance by sin; now Christ <i>
    mediates </i>and becomes <i>umpire </i>between us; he reconciles us to God 
    through his blood, therefore he is called the Mediator of the new covenant. 
    There is no way of communion and fellowship between God and man, but in and 
    through a Mediator. Christ takes away the enmity in us, and the wrath of 
    God, and so makes peace between us and God. Nor is Christ a Mediator of 
    reconciliation only—but intercession. "Christ has entered, not into the holy 
    place made with hands—but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence 
    of God for us." When the priest had slain the sacrifice, he was to go with 
    the blood before the altar and mercy-seat, and show it to the Lord. Now, in 
    Christ, our blessed Mediator, consider two things. 1. His person. 2: His 
    graces.
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">I. Christ's PERSON.</p></font> </b>His person is amiable; he 
    is made up of all love and beauty. He is the effigy of his Father. "The 
    express image of his person." Consider,
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[1] Christ's person in two NATURES. </p>
</font><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">(1.) Look upon his HUMAN nature as incarnate. </p></font></b>
    Some deny his human nature; but John 1:14 says "The Word was made flesh." It 
    is spoken of Christ the promised Messiah. Christ took our flesh, that the 
    same nature which sinned, might suffer; and "The Word was made flesh," that 
    through the glass of his human nature we might look upon God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Why is Christ called the Word?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Because, as a <i>word </i>is the revealer of the <i>mind</i>, 
    and manifests what is in a man's heart; so Jesus Christ reveals his Father's 
    mind to us concerning the great matters of our salvation. John 1:18. Were it 
    not for Christ's <i>manhood</i>, the sight of the <i>Godhead </i>would be 
    formidable to us; but through Christ's flesh we may look upon God without 
    terror. </p>
<p align="justify">And Christ took our flesh—that he might know how to pity 
    us; he knows what it is to be faint, sorrowful, tempted. "He knows our 
    frame." And he took our flesh, that he might (as Augustine says) ennoble our 
    human nature with honor. Christ having married our flesh, has exalted it 
    above the angelic nature.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Look upon Christ's DIVINE nature. </p></b></font>Christ 
    may be fitly compared to Jacob's ladder, which reaches from earth to heaven. 
    Gen 28:12. Christ's <i>human </i>nature was the foot of the ladder, which 
    stood upon earth; his <i>divine </i>nature the top of the ladder, which 
    reaches to heaven. This being a grand article of our faith I shall amplify 
    it. I know the Arians, Socinians, and Ebionites would rob Christ of the best 
    jewel of his crown, his <i>Godhead</i>; but the Apostolic, Nicene, 
    Athanasian creeds, affirm Christ's Deity. The Scripture is clear for it. He 
    is called "the mighty God." "And in him dwells the fullness of the Godhead." 
    He is of the same nature and essence with the Father. Is God the Father 
    called Almighty? So is Christ. "The Almighty." Rev 1:8. Is God the Father 
    the heart-searcher? So is Christ. "He knew their thoughts." John 2:25. Is 
    God the Father omnipresent? So is Christ. "The Son of Man who is in heaven." 
    John 3:13. Christ as God was then in heaven, when as man he was upon the 
    earth.
<p align="justify">Is Christ eternal? Christ is the everlasting Father, Isa 
    9:6, may be urged against the Cerinthian heretics, who denied the 
    pre-existence of Christ's Godhead, and held that Christ had no being until 
    he derived it from the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p align="justify">Does <i>divine worship </i>belong to the first person in 
    the Trinity? So it does to Christ. John 5:23. "Let all the angels of God 
    worship him." Heb 1:6. Is <i>creation </i>proper to the Deity? this is a 
    flower of Christ's crown. "By him were all things created." Col 1:16. Is 
    prayer proper to the Deity? this is given to Christ. "Lord Jesus, receive my 
    spirit." Is faith and trust peculiar to God the Father? this is given to 
    Christ. "You believe in God, believe also in me." Christ must needs be God, 
    not only that the divine nature might support the human from sinking under 
    God's wrath—but also to give <i>value </i>and <i>weight </i>to his 
    sufferings.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ being God, his death and passion are meritorious. 
    Christ's blood is called <i>sanguis Dei</i>, the blood of God, in Acts 
    20:28, because the person who was offered in sacrifice was <i>God </i>as 
    well as <i>man</i>. This is an invincible support to believers; it was God 
    who was <i>offended</i>, and it was God who <i>satisfied</i>. Thus Christ's 
    person is in two natures.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Consider Christ's two natures in one person, God-man.
    </p></b></font>"God manifest in the flesh." 1 Tim 3:16. Christ had a twofold 
    substance, divine and human—yet not a twofold subsistence; both natures make 
    but one Christ. A scion may be grafted into another tree — like a pear-tree 
    into an apple tree; which, though it bears different fruits, is but one 
    tree; so Christ's manhood is united to the Godhead in an ineffable manner; 
    yet though there are two natures—yet but one person. This union of the two 
    natures in Christ was not by <i>transmutation</i>, the divine nature changed 
    into the human, or the human into the divine; nor by <i>mixture</i>, the two 
    natures mingled together, as wine and water are mixed; but both the natures 
    of Christ remain distinct, and yet make not two distinct persons—but one 
    person; the human nature not God—yet one with God.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Consider Christ, our Mediator, in his GRACES. </p></b>
</font>These are the sweet savor of his ointments, which make the virgins 
    love him. Christ, our blessed Mediator, is said to be "<i>full </i>of grace 
    and truth." John 1:14. He had the anointing of the Spirit <i>without measure</i>. 
    John 3:34. Grace in Christ is after a more eminent and glorious manner, than 
    it is in any of the saints.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Jesus Christ, our Mediator, has PERFECTION in every 
    grace. </p></b></font>Col 1:19. He is a panoply, treasury and storehouse of all 
    heavenly treasure, all fullness. This no saint on earth has; he may excel in 
    one grace—but not in all; as Abraham was eminent for faith, Moses for 
    meekness; but Christ excels in every grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] There is a NEVER-FAILING fullness of grace in Christ.</p></b></font> 
    Grace in the saints is ebbing and flowing, it is not always in the same 
    degree and proportion; at one time David's faith was strong, at another time 
    so faint and weak, that you could hardly feel any pulse. "I said, I am cut 
    off from before your eyes." Psalm 31:22. But grace in Christ is a 
    never-failing fullness, it never abated in the least degree; he never lost a 
    drop of his holiness. What was said of Joseph in Gen 49:23, may more truly 
    be applied to Christ. "The archers shot at him—but his bow abode in 
    strength." Men and devils shot at him—but his grace remained in its full 
    vigor and strength; "his bow abode in strength."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Grace in Christ is COMMUNICATIVE. </p></b></font>His 
    grace is for us; the holy oil of the Spirit was poured on the head of this 
    blessed Aaron, that it might run down upon <i>us! </i>The saints have not 
    grace to bestow on others. When the foolish virgins would have bought oil of 
    their neighbor virgins, saying, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are 
    gone out," the wise virgins answered, "Not so, lest there be not enough for 
    us and you." The saints have no grace to spare for others; but Christ 
    diffuses his grace to others. Grace in the saints is as water in the <i>
    vessel</i>, grace in Christ is as water in the <i>spring</i>. "Of his 
    fullness have all we received and grace for grace." John 1:16. Set a glass 
    under a still, and it receives water from it, drop by drop; so the saints 
    have the drops and influences of Christ's grace distilling upon them. What a 
    rich consolation is this to those who either have no grace, or their stock 
    is low! They may go to Christ, the Mediator, as a treasury of grace: "Lord, 
    I am <i>indigent</i>; but where shall I carry my empty vessel—but to a full 
    fountain? 'All my springs are in you.' I am <i>guilty</i>, you have blood to 
    pardon me; I am <i>polluted</i>, you have grace to cleanse me; I am <i>sick
    </i>unto death, you have the balm of Gilead to heal me! Joseph opened all 
    the storehouses of <i>grain</i>; Christ is our Joseph, that opens all the 
    treasuries and storehouses of <i>grace</i>, and bestows to us. He is not 
    only <i>sweet </i>as the honey-comb—but <i>drops </i>as the honey-comb. In 
    Christ our Mediator there is a cornucopia and fullness of all grace; and 
    Christ is desirous that we should come to him for grace, like the full 
    breast which aches until it be drawn.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Admire the glory of this Mediator</p></b></font>; he 
    is God-man, he is co-essentially glorious with the Father. All the Jews who 
    saw Christ in the <i>flesh</i>, did not see his <i>Godhead</i>; all who saw 
    the <i>man </i>did not see the <i>Messiah</i>. The temple of Solomon <i>
    within </i>was embellished with gold; travelers, as they passed along, might 
    see the <i>outside </i>of the temple—but only the <i>priests </i>saw the 
    glory which sparkled within the temple. Just so, believers only, who are 
    made priests unto God, see Christ's glorious inside, the Godhead shining 
    through the manhood. Rev 1:16.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If Christ is God-man in one person, then look 
    unto Jesus Christ alone for salvation. </p></b></font>There must be something of 
    the <i>Godhead </i>to fasten our <i>hope </i>upon; in Christ there is 
    Godhead and manhood hypostatically united. If we could weep rivers of tears, 
    out-fast Moses on the mount, if we were exact moralists, touching the law 
    blameless, if we could arrive at the highest degree of sanctification in 
    this life—all this would not save us, without looking to the merits of him 
    who is God. Our perfect holiness in heaven is not the cause of our 
    salvation—but the righteousness of Jesus Christ. To this therefore did Paul 
    flee, as to the horns of the altar. "That I may be found in him, not having 
    my own righteousness." Phil 3:9. It is true, we may look to our <i>graces
    </i>as <i>evidences </i>of salvation—but to Christ's blood only as the <i>
    cause</i> of salvation. In time of Noah's flood, all who trusted to the high 
    hills and trees, and not to the ark, were drowned. "Looking unto Jesus;" and 
    so look unto him, as to believe in him, so that Christ may not only be 
    united to our nature—but to our persons. Heb 12:2. "That believing, you may 
    have life through his name." John 20:31.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Is Jesus Christ God and man in one person? 
    This shows the dignity of believers, that they are so closely related and 
    united to Christ.</p></b></font> "In him dwells the fullness of the Godhead 
    bodily," so it is of unspeakable comfort. Col 2:9. Christ's two natures 
    being married together, the divine and human, all that Christ in either of 
    his natures can do for believers, he will do. In his human nature he <i>
    prays </i>for them, in his divine nature he <i>merits </i>for them.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Admire the love of Christ our Mediator; that he 
    should humble himself, and take our flesh, that he might redeem us.</p></b></font> 
    Believers should put Christ in their bosom, as the spouse did. "Lie between 
    my breasts." Cant 1:13. What was said of Ignatius, that the name of Jesus 
    was found written in his heart, should be verified of every saint; he should 
    have Jesus Christ written in his heart.

</b></font>
<p align="justify">"The Lord your God will raise up unto you a Prophet," 
    etc. Deut 18:15.</p>
<p align="justify">Having spoken of the PERSON of Christ, we are next to 
    speak of the OFFICES of Christ. These are Prophetic, Priestly, and Regal.</p>
<p align="justify">"The Lord your God will raise up unto you a Prophet." 
    This is spoken of Christ. There are several names given to Christ as a 
    Prophet. He is called "the Counselor" in Isa 9:6. "The Angel of the 
    covenant." Mal 3:1. "A Lamp." 2 Sam 22:19. "The Morning Star." Rev 22:16. 
    Jesus Christ is the great Prophet of his church. The woman of Samaria gave a 
    shrewd guess. John 4:19. He is the best teacher; he makes all other teaching 
    effectual. "He <i>opened </i>their understanding." Luke 24:45 He not only 
    opened the Scriptures—but opened their <i>understanding</i>. He teaches to 
    profit. "I am the Lord your God, who teaches you to profit." Isa 48:17.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How does Christ teach?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Externally, by his Word. </p></b></font>"Your word is a 
    lamp to my feet." Such as pretend to have a light or revelation above the 
    Word, or contrary to it—never had their teaching from Christ. Isa 8:20.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ teaches these sacred mysteries, inwardly, by 
    the Spirit.</p></b></font> John 16:13. The world knows not what this teaching 
    is. "The natural man receives not the things of God, neither can he know 
    them." 1 Cor 2:14. He knows not what it is to be transformed by the renewing 
    of the mind, Rom 12:2, or what the inward workings of the Spirit mean; these 
    are riddles and paradoxes to Him. He may have more insight into the things 
    of the <i>world, </i>than a believer—but he does not see the deep things of
    <i>God</i>. A swine may see an <i>acorn </i>under a tree—but he cannot see a
    <i>star</i>. He who is taught of Christ sees the the secrets of the kingdom 
    of heaven.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the lessons which Christ teaches?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">He teaches us to see into our own hearts.</p></b></font> Take 
    the most soaring wits, the greatest politicians, who understand the 
    mysteries of state, they know not the mysteries of their own hearts, they 
    cannot believe the evil that is in them. "Is your servant a dog—that he 
    should do such a thing?" The heart is a great deep, which is not easily 
    fathomed. But when Christ teaches, he removes the veil of ignorance, and 
    illuminates the way for a man to see into his own heart. And now that he 
    sees swarms of vile and vain thoughts, he blushes to see how sin mingles 
    with his duties, his <i>stars </i>are mixed with <i>clouds</i>; he prays, as 
    Augustine, that God would deliver him from himself!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">The second lesson Christ teaches is the vanity of the 
    creature. </p></b></font>A natural man sets up his happiness in earthly things, 
    and worships the golden image; but he who Christ has anointed with his 
    eye-salve, has a spirit of discerning; he looks upon the creature in its 
    night-dress, sees it to be empty and unsatisfying, and not commensurate to a 
    heaven-born soul. Solomon had put all the creatures into a still, and when 
    he came to extract the spirit and quintessence, all was vanity. Eccles 2:11. 
    The apostle calls it a <i>show </i>or <i>apparition</i>, having no intrinsic 
    goodness. 1 Cor 7:31.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">The third lesson is the excellency of unseen realities.
    </p></b></font>Christ gives the soul a sight of glory, a prospect of eternity. 
    "We look not at things which are seen—but at things which are not seen." 
    Moses saw him who is "invisible." Heb 11:27. And the patriarchs saw a better 
    country, namely, a heavenly one, where are delights of angels; rivers of 
    pleasure; the flower of joy, fully ripe and blown. Heb 11:16.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How does Christ's teaching differ from other teaching?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Several ways.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Christ teaches the heart.</p></b></font> Others may 
    teach the ear, Christ teaches the heart. "Whose heart the Lord opened." Acts 
    16:14. All that the dispensers of the word can do is but to work <i>
    knowledge</i>; Christ works <i>grace</i>. They can but give the <i>light </i>
    of the truth; Christ gives the <i>love </i>of the truth. They can only teach
    <i>what </i>to believe, Christ teaches <i>how </i>to believe.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ gives us a taste of the word. </p></b></font>
    Ministers may set the food of the word before you, and carve it out to you; 
    but it is only Christ, who can cause you to taste it. "If so be you have 
    tasted that the Lord is gracious." "Taste and see that the Lord is good." It 
    is one thing to <i>hear </i>a truth preached, another thing to <i>taste </i>
    it; one thing to <i>read </i>a promise, another thing to <i>taste </i>it. 
    David had got a taste of the word. "You have taught me: How sweet are your 
    words unto my taste! yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth." The apostle calls 
    it the <i>savor </i>of knowledge. 2 Cor 2:14. The light of knowledge is one 
    thing, the savor another. Christ makes us taste a <i>savouriness </i>in the 
    word.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) When Christ teaches, he makes us obey. </p></b></font>
    Others may instruct—but cannot command obedience. They teach to be 
    humble—but men remain proud. The prophet had been denouncing judgments 
    against the people of Judah—but they would not hear. "We will do whatever 
    goes out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven." Men 
    come as it were, with thick armor, which the sword of the word will not 
    enter; but when Christ comes to teach, he removes this obstinacy; he not 
    only informs the <i>mind</i>—but inclines the <i>will</i>. He does not only 
    come with the light of his word—but the rod of his strength, and makes the 
    stubborn sinner yield to him. His grace is irresistible.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Christ teaches easily.</p></b></font> Others teach with 
    difficulty. They have difficulty in finding out a truth, and in inculcating 
    it. "Precept must be upon precept, and line upon line." Some may teach all 
    their lives, and the word take no impression. They complain, "I have spent 
    my labor in vain!" I have plowed on rocks! But Christ the great Prophet 
    teaches with ease. He can with the least touch of his Spirit convert; he can 
    say, "Let there be light;" with a word he can convey grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) When Christ teaches, he makes men willing to learn.</p></b></font> 
    Men may teach others—but they have no mind to learn. "Fools despise 
    instruction." They rage at the word, as if a patient should rage at the 
    physician when he brings him a remedy; thus backward are men to their own 
    salvation. But Christ makes his people a "willing people." They prize 
    knowledge, and hang it as a jewel upon their ear. Those who Christ teaches 
    say, "Come let us go up to the mountains of the Lord, and he will teach us 
    of his ways, and we will walk in them;" and "We are all here present before 
    God, to hear all things commanded."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) When Christ teaches, he not only illuminates but 
    animates.</p></b></font> He so teaches—that he quickens! "I am the light of the 
    world: he who follows me shall have <i>lumen vitae</i>—the light of life." 
    By nature we are dead, therefore unfit to be taught. Who will make an 
    oration to the dead? But Christ teaches those who are dead! he gives the 
    light of life. As when Lazarus was dead, Christ said, "Come forth," and he 
    made the dead to hear, for Lazarus came forth. Just so, when he says to the 
    dead soul, "Come forth of the grave of unbelief!" he hears Christ's voice, 
    and comes forth! The philosophers say, "heat and light increase together." 
    Where Christ comes with his <i>light</i>, there is the <i>heat </i>of 
    spiritual life going along with it.

    angel could find out. Who but God can anoint the eyes of the blind, and give 
    not only light—but sight? Who but he, who has the key of David, can open the

    full of clearness and brightness, which enlightens the whole world. Christ 
    is the great luminary; in him are hidden all treasures of knowledge. Col 
    2:3. The middle lamp of the sanctuary gave light to all the other lamps; so 
    Christ diffuses his glorious light to others. We are apt to admire the 
    learning of Aristotle and Plato; alas! what is this poor <i>spark </i>of 
    light, compared to that which is in Christ, from whose infinite wisdom both 
    men and angels light their lamps!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) See the misery of man in the state of nature.</p></b></font> 
    Before Christ becomes their prophet they are enveloped in ignorance and 
    darkness. Men know nothing in a sanctified manner, they know nothing as they 
    ought to know. I Cor 8:2. This is dreadful. Men in the dark cannot discern 
    colors; so in the state of nature they cannot discern between morality and 
    grace they take one for the other. In the dark the greatest beauty is 
    hidden. Let there be rare flowers in the garden, and pictures in the room, 
    in the dark their beauty is veiled over. Just so, though there is such 
    transcendent beauty in Christ as amazes the angels, man in the state of 
    nature sees none of this beauty. What is Christ to him? or heaven to him? 
    The veil is upon his heart. A man in the dark is in danger every step he 
    takes; so man in the state of nature is in danger, at every step, of falling 
    into hell. Thus it is before Christ teaches us; nay, the darkness in which a 
    sinner is, while in an unregenerate state, is worse than natural darkness; 
    for natural darkness affrights. "A horror of great darkness fell upon 
    Abraham." But the spiritual darkness is not accompanied with horror, men 
    tremble not at their condition; nay, they like their condition well enough. 
    "Men loved darkness." This is their dreadful condition, until Jesus Christ 
    comes as a prophet to teach them, and to turn them from darkness to light, 
    and from the power of Satan to God.

</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) See your need of Christ's teaching. </p></font></b>You 
    cannot see your way without this morning star. Some speak much of improving 
    the <i>light of reason</i>; alas! the plumb-line of reason is too short to 
    fathom the deep things of God; the light of reason will no more help a man 
    to believe, than the light of a candle will help him to understand. A man 
    can no more by the power of nature reach Christ, than an infant can reach 
    the top of the pyramids, or the ostrich fly up to the stars. See your need 
    of Christ's anointing and teaching in Rev 3:18. "I counsel you to buy from 
    me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to 
    wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your 
    eyes, so you can see."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Go to Christ to teach you.</p></b></font> "Lead me in 
    your truth, and teach me." As one of the disciples said, "Lord, teach us to 
    pray," I, so say, "Lord, teach me to profit. Light my lamp, O great prophet 
    of your church! Give me a spirit of wisdom and revelation, that I may see 
    things in another manner than I ever saw them before; teach me in the Word 
    to hear your voice, and in the sacrament to discern your body. Give light to 
    my eyes!" Psalm 13:3. 
<b>
<p align="justify">That we may be encouraged to go to our great Prophet:</p>
<font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">(1.) Jesus Christ is very willing to teach us. </p></font>
</b>Why else did he enter into the calling of the ministry—but to teach the 
    mysteries of heaven? "Jesus went about teaching and preaching the gospel of 
    the kingdom." Why did he take the prophetic office upon him? Why was Christ 
    so angry with those who kept away the key of knowledge? "Woe to you experts 
    in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves 
    have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering." Luke 
    11:52. Why was Christ anointed with the Spirit without measure—but that he 
    might anoint us with knowledge? Knowledge is in Christ, for us as milk in 
    the breast for the child. Oh then go to Christ for teaching. None in the 
    gospel came to Christ for sight—but he restored their eyesight; and surely 
    Christ is more willing to work a cure upon a blind soul, than ever he was to 
    do so upon a blind body.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2:) There are none so dull and ignorant, but Christ can 
    teach them.</p></b></font> Everyone is not fit to make a scholar of; but there 
    is none so dull but Christ can make him a good scholar. Even such as are 
    ignorant, and of low abilities, Christ teaches in such a manner that they 
    know more than the great sages and wise men of the world. The unlearned men 
    rise up, and take heaven; they know the truths of Christ more savingly than 
    the great admired Rabbis. The duller the scholar, the more is his skill seen 
    that teaches. Hence it is, that Christ delights in teaching the ignorant, to 
    get himself more glory. "The eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears 
    of the deaf shall be unstopped." Who would go to teach a blind or a deaf 
    man? Yet such dull scholars Christ teaches. Such as are blinded with 
    ignorance, shall see the mysteries of the gospel, and the deaf ears shall be 
    unstopped.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Wait upon the means of grace which Christ has 
    appointed.</p></b></font> Though Christ teaches by his Spirit—yet he teaches in 
    the use of ordinances. Wait at the gates of wisdom's door. Ministers are 
    teachers under Christ. "Pastors and teachers." We read of pitchers, and 
    lamps within the pitchers. Judges 7:16. Ministers are earthen vessels—but 
    these pitchers have lamps within them to light souls to heaven. Christ is 
    said to speak to us from heaven now, by his ministers, as the king speaks by 
    his ambassador. Heb 12:25. Such as wean themselves from the breast of 
    ordinances seldom thrive; either they grow faint in their head, or lame in 
    their feet. The word preached is Christ's voice in the mouth of the 
    minister; and those who refuse to hear Christ speaking in the ministry, 
    Christ will refuse to hear speaking on their death-bed.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) If you would have the teachings of Christ, walk 
    according to the knowledge which you have already. </p></b></font>Use your 
    little knowledge well, and Christ will teach you more. "If any man will do 
    his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or whether I 
    speak of myself." A master seeing his servant improve a little stock well, 
    gives him more to trade with.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: If you have been taught by Christ savingly, be 
    THANKFUL. </p></b></font>It is your honor to have God for your teacher, and that 
    he should teach you, and not others, is a matter of admiration and 
    congratulation. Oh how many knowledgeable men are ignorant! They are not 
    taught of God; they have Christ's Word to enlighten them—but not his Spirit 
    to sanctify them. But that you should have the inward as well as the outward 
    teaching, that Christ should anoint you with the heavenly unction of his 
    Spirit, that you can say, "One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I 
    see." Oh, how thankful should you be to Christ, who has revealed his 
    Father's bosom secrets unto you! "No man has seen God at any time; the only 
    begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed him." If 
    Alexander thought himself so much obliged to Aristotle for the philosophic 
    instruction he received from him—oh, how are we obliged to Jesus Christ, 
    this great Prophet, for opening to us the eternal purposes of his love, and 
    revealing to us the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven!

<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">4. Christ's PRIESTLY Office</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 35: How does Christ execute the office of a 
    priest?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: In his once offering up of himself a sacrifice to 
    satisfy divine justice, and reconcile us to God, and in making continual 
    intercession for us.</p>
<p align="justify">"Now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put 
    away sin by the sacrifice of himself." Heb 9:26.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What are the parts of Christ's priestly office?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Christ's priestly office has two parts— his satisfaction 
    and intercession.</p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Christ's SATISFACTION</p></b></font>; this consists of two 
    branches. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] His ACTIVE obedience. </p></b></font>"He fulfilled all 
    righteousness." Christ did everything which the law required; his holy life 
    was a perfect commentary upon the law of God; he obeyed the law for us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] His PASSIVE obedience.</p></b></font> Our guilt being 
    transferred and imputed to him, he suffered the penalty which was due to us; 
    he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. The paschal lamb 
    slain, was a type of Christ who was offered up in sacrifice for us. Sin 
    could not be done away without blood. "Without blood there is no remission 
    of sin." Christ was not only a lamb without <i>spot</i>—but a lamb <i>slain</i>.
<p align="justify">Why was it requisite there should be a priest?</p>
<p align="justify">There needed a priest to be an umpire (a mediator), to 
    mediate between a guilty creature and a holy God.</p>
<p align="justify">How could Christ suffer, being God?</p>
<p align="justify">Christ suffered only in the human nature.</p>
<p align="justify">But if only Christ's humanity suffered, how could this 
    suffering satisfy for sin?</p>
<p align="justify">The human nature being united to the divine, the human 
    nature suffered, the divine satisfied. Christ's Godhead supported the human 
    nature that it did not faint, and gave virtue to his sufferings. The altar 
    sanctifies the thing offered on it. Matt 23:19. The altar of Christ's divine 
    nature, sanctified the sacrifice of his death, and made it of infinite 
    value.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherein does the greatness of Christ's sufferings appear?</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In the sufferings of his <b>body</b>. He suffered 
    truly, not in appearance only. The apostle calls it the death of the cross. 
    Phil 2:8. Cicero, when speaking of this kind of death, says, "How can I 
    describe being raised up on a cross?" Though he was a great orator he lacked 
    words to express it. The thoughts of this made Christ sweat great drops of 
    blood in the garden. Luke 22:24. It was an ignominious, painful, cursed 
    death. Christ suffered in all his senses. His <i>eyes </i>beheld two 
    dreadful objects, his enemies insulting, and his mother weeping. His <i>ears
    </i>were filled with the revilings of the people. "He saved others, himself 
    he cannot save." Matt 27:42. His <i>smell </i>was offended when their 
    spittle fell upon his face. His taste; when they gave him gall and vinegar 
    to drink. His <i>feeling</i>; when his head suffered with thorns, his hands 
    and feet with the nails. His whole body was one great wound; now was this <i>
    white lily </i>dyed with <i>purple </i>color.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In the sufferings of his <b>soul</b>. He was pressed 
    in the wine-press of his Father's wrath. This caused that vociferation and 
    outcry on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me!" Christ 
    suffered a double eclipse upon the cross, an eclipse of the sun, and an 
    eclipse of the light of God's countenance. How bitter was this agony! The 
    evangelists use three words to express it. "He began to be <i>amazed</i>." 
    "He began to be <i>faint</i>." "To be exceeding <i>sorrowful</i>." Christ 
    felt the pains of hell in his soul, though not locally—yet equivalently.</p>
<p align="justify">Why did Christ suffer?</p>
<p align="justify">Surely not for any desert of his own. "The Messiah shall 
    be cut off—but not for himself," it was for us. One man sins, another takes 
    the punishment; he suffered, that he might satisfy God's justice for us. We, 
    by our sins, had infinitely wronged God; and, could we have shed rivers of 
    tears, offered up millions of holocausts and burnt-offerings, we could never 
    have pacified an angry Deity; therefore Christ must die, that God's justice 
    may be satisfied.</p>
<p align="justify">It is hotly debated among divines, whether God <i>could
    </i>have forgiven sin freely without a sacrifice. Not to dispute what God <i>
    could </i>have done, when he was resolved to have the law satisfied, and to 
    have man saved in a way of <i>justice </i>as well as <i>mercy</i>; it was 
    necessary that Christ should lay down his life as a sacrifice.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To fulfill the predictions of Scripture. "It was 
    written long ago that the Messiah must suffer and die and rise again from 
    the dead on the third day."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To bring us into favor with God. It is one thing for 
    a traitor to be pardoned, and another thing to be made a favorite. Christ's 
    blood is not only called a sacrifice, whereby God is appeased—but a 
    propitiation, whereby God becomes gracious and friendly to us. Christ is our 
    mercy-seat, from which God gives answers of peace to us.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ died, that he might make good his last will 
    and testament with his blood. There were many legacies which Christ 
    bequeathed to believers, which would all have been null and void had he not 
    died, and by his death confirmed the will. Heb 9:16. A testament is in force 
    after men are dead; the mission of the Spirit, the promises, those legacies, 
    were not in force until Christ's death; but Christ by his blood has sealed 
    them, and believers may lay claim to them.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) He died that he might purchase for us glorious 
    mansions; therefore heaven is called not only a <i>promised</i>—but a "<i>purchased
    </i>possession." Eph 1:14. Christ died for our preferment; he suffered that 
    we might reign; he hung upon the cross that we might sit upon the throne. 
    Heaven was shut to us—but the cross of Christ is the ladder by which we 
    ascend to heaven. <b>His crucifixion is our coronation!</b></p>
<font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">Use one: In the bloody sacrifice of Christ, see the 
    horrid nature of sin. </p></font>Sin, it is true, is odious as it banished 
    Adam out of paradise, and threw the angels into hell; but that which most of 
    all makes it appear horrid is this, that it made Christ veil his glory, and 
    lose his blood. We should look upon sin with indignation, and pursue it with 
    a holy malice, and shed the blood of those sins which shed Christ's blood. 
    The sight of Caesar's bloody robe incensed the Romans against those who slew 
    him. The sight of Christ's bleeding body should incense us against sin. Let 
    us not parley with it; let not that be our joy, which made Christ a man of 
    sorrow.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Is Christ our priest sacrificed? See God's mercy 
    and justice displayed. </p></b></font>I may say as the apostle, "Behold the <i>
    goodness </i>and <i>severity </i>of God."
<p align="justify">(1.) The <b>goodness </b>of God in providing a sacrifice. 
    Had not Christ suffered upon the cross, we must have lain in hell forever, 
    satisfying God's justice.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The <b>severity </b>of God. Though it were his own 
    Son, the Son of his love, and our sins were but <i>imputed </i>to him—yet 
    God did not spare him—but his wrath did flame against him. Rom 8:32. If God 
    was thus severe to his own Son, how dreadful will he be one day to his 
    enemies! Such as die in wilful impenitence, must feel the same wrath as 
    Christ did; and because they cannot bear it at once, therefore they must 
    endure it forever.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Is Christ our priest, who was sacrificed for 
    us? Then see the endeared affection of Christ to us sinners. </p></b></font>"The 
    cross," says Augustine, "was a pulpit, in which Christ preached his love to 
    the world." That Christ should die, was more than if all the angels had been 
    turned to dust; and especially that Christ should die as a malefactor, 
    having the weight of all men's sins laid upon him, and that he should die 
    for his enemies. Rom 5:10. The balm-tree weeps out its precious balm, to 
    heal those who cut and mangle it; just so, Christ shed his blood, to heal 
    those who crucified him. 
<p align="justify">He died freely. It is called the offering of the body of 
    Jesus. Heb 10:10. Though his sufferings were so great, that they made him 
    sigh, and weep, and bleed; yet they could not make him repent. "He shall see 
    of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied." Isa 53:1. Christ had hard 
    travail upon the cross—yet he does not repent of it—but thinks his sweat and 
    blood well bestowed, because he sees redemption brought forth to the world. 
    Oh infinite, amazing love of Christ! a love which passes knowledge! a love 
    which neither man nor angel can parallel. Eph 3:19. How should we be 
    affected with this love! If Saul was so affected with David's kindness in <i>
    sparing </i>his life, how should we be affected with Christ's kindness in <i>
    parting </i>with his life for us! At Christ's death and passion, the very 
    stones cleave asunder, "The earth shook, rocks split apart." Matt 27:51. Not 
    to be affected with Christ's love in dying, is to have hearts harder than 
    rocks.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Is Christ our sacrifice? Then see the 
    excellence of his sacrifice.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">(1.) Christ's sacrifice is <b>perfect</b>. "By one 
    offering, he has perfected those who are sanctified." Therefore, how impious 
    are the Papists, in joining their merits and the prayers of saints with 
    Christ's sacrifice! They offer him up daily in the mass, as if Christ's 
    sacrifice on the cross were imperfect. This is a blasphemy against Christ's 
    priestly office.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ's sacrifice is <b>meritorious</b>. He not 
    only died for our example—but to merit salvation. The person who suffered 
    being <i>God </i>as well as <i>man</i>, put virtue into his sufferings; our 
    sins were expiated, and God appeased. No sooner did the messengers say, "Uriah 
    is dead," but David's anger was pacified. No sooner did Christ die—but God's 
    anger was pacified.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ's sacrifice is <b>beneficial</b>. Out of the 
    dead lion, Samson had honey. Christ's sacrifice procures justification of 
    our persons, acceptance of our service, access to God with boldness, and 
    entrance into the holy place of heaven. Heb 10:19. Through the side of 
    Christ, a way to Heaven lies open to us. Israel passed through the Red sea 
    to Canaan; so through the red sea of Christ's blood, we enter into the 
    heavenly Canaan.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Let us <i>apply </i>this blood of Christ. </p></b>
</font>All the virtue of a medicine is in the application; though the 
    medicine is made of the blood of God, it will not heal, unless applied by 
    faith. As fire is to the chemist, so is faith to the Christian; the chemist 
    can do nothing without fire, so there is nothing done without faith. Faith 
    makes Christ's sacrifice ours. "Christ Jesus <i>my </i>Lord." It is not gold 
    in the <i>mine </i>which enriches—but gold in the <i>hand</i>. Faith is the 
    hand which receives Christ's golden merits. It is not a cordial in the glass 
    that refreshes the spirit—but a cordial drunk down. "By faith we drink the 
    blood of Christ," Cyprian. Faith opens the orifice of Christ's wounds, and 
    drinks the precious cordial of his blood. Without faith Christ himself will 
    not avail us.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use six: Let us love a bleeding Savior, and let us show 
    our love to Christ, by being ready to suffer for him.</p></b></font> Many 
    rejoice at Christ's suffering for them—but do not dream of their suffering 
    for him. Joseph dreamed of his <i>preferment</i>—but not of his <i>
    imprisonment</i>. Was Christ a sacrifice? Did he bear God's wrath for us? We 
    should bear man's wrath for him. Christ's death was voluntary. "Lo, I come 
    to do your will, O God." "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how it 
    consumes Me until it is finished!" Christ calls his sufferings a baptism; he 
    was to be (as it were) baptized in his own blood, and how did he thirst for 
    that time! "How it consumes Me!" Oh then, let us be willing to suffer for 
    Christ! Christ has taken away the venom and sting of the saints' sufferings: 
    there is no wrath in their cup. Our sufferings Christ can make sweet. As 
    there was oil mixed in the peace-offering, so God can mix the oil of 
    gladness with our sufferings. Life must be parted with shortly; what is it 
    to part with it a little sooner, as a sacrifice to Christ, as a seal of 
    sincerity, and a pledge of thankfulness!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use seven: This sacrifice of Christ's blood may 
    infinitely comfort us.</p></b></font> This is the blood of atonement. Christ's 
    cross is the hinge of our deliverance; the hinge and fountain of our 
    comfort. 
<p align="justify">(1.) This blood comforts in case of <b>guilt</b>! "Oh, 
    says the soul, my sins trouble me!" But Christ's blood was shed for the 
    remission of sin. Matt 26:28. Let us see our sins laid on Christ—and then 
    they are no more ours, but his.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In case of <b>pollution</b>. Christ's blood is a 
    healing and cleansing blood. It is healing. "With his stripes we are 
    healed." It is the best healing-salve, it heals at a distance. Though Christ 
    is in heaven, we may feel the virtue of his blood healing our corruptions.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Christ's blood is <b>cleansing</b>. It is therefore 
    compared to fountain-water. Zech 13:1. The word is a glass to show us our 
    spots, and Christ's blood is a fountain to wash them away; it turns leprosy 
    into purity. "The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all our sin." I John 1:7. 
    There is indeed one spot so black, that Christ's blood does not wash away, 
    namely, the sin against the Holy Spirit. Not but that there is virtue enough 
    in Christ's blood to wash it away; but he who has sinned that sin, will not 
    be washed; he despises Christ's blood, and tramples it under foot. Heb 
    10:29. Thus we see what a strong cordial Christ's blood is; it is the 
    anchor-hold of our faith, the spring of our joy, the crown of our desires, 
    and the only support both in life and death! In all our fears, let us 
    comfort ourselves with the sin atoning sacrifice of Christ's blood. Christ 
    died both as a <i>purchaser </i>and as a <i>conqueror</i>: as a <i>purchaser
    </i>in regard of God, having by his blood obtained our salvation, and as a
    <i>conqueror </i>in regard of Satan, the cross being his triumphant chariot, 
    wherein he has led hell and death captive.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use seven: Bless God for this precious sacrifice of 
    Christ's death.</p></b></font> "Bless the Lord, O my soul!" And for what does 
    David bless him? "Who redeems your life from destruction!" Christ gave 
    himself a <i>sin</i>-offering for us; let us give ourselves a <i>thank</i>-offering 
    to him. If a man redeems another out of <i>debt</i>, will he not be 
    grateful? How deeply do we stand obliged to Christ, who has redeemed us from
    <i>hell </i>and damnation! "And they sang a new song, saying You are worthy 
    to take the book, and open the seals; for you were slain, and have redeemed 
    us to God by your blood." Let our hearts and tongues join in concert to 
    bless God, and let us show thankfulness to Christ by fruitfulness; let us 
    bring forth (as spice trees) the fruits of humility, zeal, and good works. 
    This is to live unto him who died for us. 2 Cor 5:15. The wise men not only 
    worshiped Christ—but presented him with gifts of gold, and frankincense, and 
    myrrh. Matt 2:11. Let us present Christ with the fruits of righteousness, 
    which are unto the glory and praise of God.
<font color="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    II. Christ's INTERCESSION.</p></b></font> "Who also makes intercession for us." 
    Rom 8:34.
<p align="justify">When <i>Aaron </i>entered into the holy place, his bells 
    gave a sound; so <i>Christ </i>having entered into heaven, his intercession 
    makes a melodious sound in the ears of God. Though Christ is exalted to 
    glory, he has not laid aside his affections of compassion—but is still 
    mindful of his mystic body, as Joseph was mindful of his father and 
    brethren, when he was exalted to the court. "Who also makes intercession for 
    us." To intercede is to make request in behalf of another. Christ is the 
    great Master of requests in heaven.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the QUALIFICATIONS of our intercessor?</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He is holy.</p></b></font> "For this is the kind of high 
    priest we need: <b>holy</b>, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, 
    and exalted above the heavens." Heb 7:26. "Christ knew no sin." He knew sin 
    in its <i>weight</i>, not in the <i>act</i>. It was requisite, that he, who 
    was to do away the sins of others, should himself be without sin. Holiness 
    is one of the precious stones which shine on the breast-plate of our high 
    priest!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) He is faithful.</p></b></font> "For this reason he had 
    to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a 
    merciful and <b>faithful </b>high priest in service to God, and that he 
    might make atonement for the sins of the people." Heb 2:17. Moses was 
    faithful as a servant, Christ as a Son. He does not forget any cause he has 
    to plead, nor does he use any deceit in pleading. An ordinary attorney may 
    leave out some word which might help the client; or put in a word against 
    him, having received a fee on both sides; but Christ is true to the cause he 
    pleads. We may leave our matters with him, we may trust our lives and souls 
    in his hand.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) He never dies. </p></b></font>While the <i>office </i>of 
    the priests under the law lived, they themselves died. "They were not 
    allowed to continue, by reason of death." But "Christ ever lives to make 
    intercession." He has no succession in his priesthood.
<b>
<p align="justify">Whom does Christ intercede for?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not for all people—but only for the elect. "I pray for <i>
    them</i>. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, 
    for they are yours." John 17:9. The efficacy of Christ's <i>prayer</i>, 
    reaches no further than the efficacy of his <i>blood</i>; his blood was shed 
    only for the elect, therefore his prayers reach them only. The high priest 
    went into the sanctuary with the names of the twelve tribes only upon his 
    breast; so Christ goes into heaven with the names of the elect only upon his 
    breast. Christ intercedes for the <i>weakest </i>believers, and for <i>all
    </i>the sins of believers. John 17:20. In the law, there were some sins for 
    which the high priest was neither to offer sacrifice, nor prayer. "Anyone 
    who <i>sins defiantly</i>, whether native-born or alien, blasphemes the 
    Lord, and that person must be cut off from his people." Numb 15:30. The 
    priest might offer up prayers for sins of <i>ignorance</i>—but not of 
    defiance; but Christ's intercession extends to all the sins of the elect. Of 
    what a bloody color was David's sin; yet it did not exclude him from 
    Christ's intercession!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">What does Christ do in the work of intercession?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Three things.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) He presents the merit of his blood to his Father; 
    and, in the virtue of that price paid, pleads for mercy. </p></b></font>The high 
    priest was herein a lively type of Christ. Aaron was to do four things:
<p align="justify">Kill the animals. </p>
<p align="justify">Enter with the blood into the holy of holies. </p>
<p align="justify">Sprinkle the mercy-seat with the blood. </p>
<p align="justify">Kindle the incense, and with the smoke of it cause a 
    cloud to arise over the mercy-seat. Thus atonement was made. Lev 16:11-16.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Christ our high priest exactly answered to this type. He 
    was offered up in sacrifice, which answers to the priest's killing the 
    bullock; and he is gone up into heaven, which answers to the priest's going 
    into the holy of holies; and he spreads his blood before his Father which 
    answers to the priest's sprinkling the blood upon the mercy-seat; and he 
    prays to his Father, that for his blood's sake, he would be propitious to 
    sinners, which answers to the cloud of incense going up; and through his 
    intercessions God is pacified, which answers to the priest's making 
    atonement.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ by his intercession answers all bills of 
    indictment brought in against the elect. </p></b></font>Do what they can, sin, 
    and then Satan—accuses believers to God, and conscience accuses them to 
    themselves. But Christ, by his intercession, answers all these accusations. 
    "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? it is Christ who makes 
    intercession for us!" When Esculus was accused for some rebellion, his 
    brother stood up for him, and showed the magistrates how he had lost his 
    hand in the service of the state, and so obtained his pardon. Thus, when 
    Satan accuses the saints, or when the justice of God lays anything to their 
    charge, Christ shows his own wounds, and by virtue of his bloody sufferings 
    answers all the demands and challenges of the law, and counterworks Satan's 
    accusations!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ, by his intercession, calls for acquittance.
    </p></b></font>"Father," he says, "let the sinner be absolved from guilt!" In 
    this sense he is called an advocate. 1 John 2:1. He requires that the sinner 
    be set free in the court. An <i>advocate </i>differs much from an <i>orator</i>; 
    an <i>orator </i>uses rhetoric to persuade and entreat the judge to show 
    mercy to another; but an <i>advocate </i>tells the judge what is law. Thus 
    Christ appears in heaven as an advocate, he represents what is law. When 
    God's justice opens the debt-book, Christ opens the law-book. "Father," says 
    he, "You are a just God, and will not be pacified without payment; lo, here 
    my blood is shed, therefore in justice, give me a discharge for these 
    distressed creatures!" The law being satisfied, the sinner must be 
    acquitted. Upon Christ's plea, God sets his hand to seal the sinner's 
    pardon!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">In what manner does Christ intercede?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Freely. </p></b></font>He pleads our cause in heaven, 
    and takes no fee. Any lawyer will have his fee, and sometimes a bribe too; 
    but Christ is not mercenary. How many causes does he plead every day in 
    heaven—and will take nothing! As Christ laid down his life freely—so he 
    intercedes freely. John 10:15, 18.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Feelingly.</p></b></font> He is as sensible of our 
    condition as his own. "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to 
    sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in 
    every way, just as we are—yet was without sin." Heb 4:15. Jesus pleads for 
    us—as a tender-hearted mother would plead with a judge for a child ready to 
    be condemned! Oh, how would her affections work! How would her tears trickle 
    down! What <i>weeping rhetoric</i> would she plead to the judge, for mercy! 
    So the Lord Jesus is full of sympathy and tenderness, that he might be a 
    merciful high priest. "For this reason he had to be made like his brothers 
    in every way, in order that he might become a <i>merciful </i>and <i>
    faithful </i>high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement 
    for the sins of the people." Hebrews 2:17. Though he has left his <i>passion</i>—yet 
    not his <i>compassion</i>. An ordinary lawyer is not affected with the cause 
    he pleads, nor does he care which way it goes; it is <i>profit </i>which 
    alone makes him plead, not <i>affection</i>. But Christ intercedes 
    feelingly; and that which makes him intercede with affection is—it is his 
    own cause which he pleads. He has shed his blood to purchase life and 
    salvation for the elect; and if they should not be saved, he would lose his 
    purchase!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Efficaciously.</p></b></font> It is a <i>prevailing </i>
    intercession. Christ never lost any cause he pleaded. Christ's intercession 
    must needs be effectual, if we consider,
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The excellency of his person.</p></b> If the prayer of a 
    saint is so prevalent with God, as <i>Moses' </i>prayer bound God's hand, 
    "Now leave me alone so my anger can blaze against them and destroy them all. 
    But <i>Moses pleaded</i> with the Lord his God not to do it. Turn away from 
    your fierce anger. Change your mind about this terrible disaster you are 
    planning against your people! So the Lord withdrew his threat and didn't 
    bring against his people the disaster he had threatened." Exodus 32:10-14.
<i>
<p align="justify">Jacob</p></i>, as a prince, prevailed with God, Gen 32:28. <i>
    Elijah </i>by prayer opened and shut heaven, James 5:17. Then what 
    prevalence has Christ's prayer! He is the Son of God, the Son in whom he is 
    well pleased. Matt 3:17. What will not a father grant a son! "I know that 
    you hear me always." If God could forget that Christ were a <i>Priest</i>, 
    he could not forget that he is a <i>Son!
</i><b>
<p align="justify">(2:) Christ prays for nothing but what his Father has a 
    mind to grant.</p></b> There is but one will between Christ and his Father. 
    Christ prays, "Sanctify them through your truth;" and "This is the will of 
    God, even your sanctification." So then, if Christ prays for nothing but 
    what God the Father has a mind to grant, then he is sure to succeed.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3:) Christ prays for nothing but what he has power to 
    give.</p></b> What he prays for as he is <i>man</i>, that he has power to give 
    as he is <i>God</i>. "Father, I will." John 17:24. "Father," there he prays 
    as a man; "I will," there he gives as God. It is a great comfort to a 
    believer, when his prayer is weak, and he can hardly pray for himself, that 
    Christ's prayer in heaven is mighty and powerful. Though God may refuse 
    prayer as it comes from <i>us</i>—yet he will not as it comes from <i>
    Christ!
</i><b>
<p align="justify">(4:) Christ's intercession is always ready at hand. </p></b>
    The people of God have sins of daily occurrence; and, besides these, they 
    sometimes lapse into great sins, and God is provoked, and his justice is 
    ready to break forth upon them. But Christ's intercession is ready at hand, 
    he daily makes up the breaches between God and them; he presents the merits 
    of his blood to his Father, to pacify him. When the wrath of God began to 
    break out upon Israel, <i>Aaron </i>presently stepped in with his censer, 
    and offered incense—and so the plague was stayed. Numb 16:47. Just so, no 
    sooner does a child of God sin, and God begins to be angry—but immediately 
    Christ steps in and intercedes! "Father," he says, "it is my child who has 
    sinned; though he has forgotten his duty, you have not lost your affections. 
    Oh, pity him, and let your anger be turned away from him!" Christ's 
    intercession is ready at hand, and, upon the least failings of the godly—he 
    stands up and makes request for them in heaven!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the FRUITS of Christ's intercession?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Justification. </p></b></font>In justification there are 
    two things. <i>Guilt </i>is remitted, and <i>righteousness </i>is imputed. 
    "The Lord our righteousness." We are counted not only as righteous as the <i>
    angels</i>—but as righteous as <i>Christ</i>, having his robes put upon us! 
    2 Cor 5:21. But whence is it, that we are justified? It is from Christ's 
    intercession. "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? 
    It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who 
    died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God 
    and is also interceding for us." Romans 8:33-34. "Father," says Christ, 
    "these are the people I have died for! Look upon them as if they had never 
    sinned, and count them as perfectly righteous!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The unction of the Spirit.</p></b></font> "You have an 
    unction from the Holy One." This <i>unction </i>or <i>anointing </i>is 
    nothing else but the work of sanctification in the heart, whereby the Spirit 
    makes us partakers of the divine nature. 2 Pet 1:4. Such as speak of <i>the 
    philosopher's magic stone, </i>imagine it to have such a property, that when 
    it touches any metal—it turns it into gold. Such a property has the Spirit 
    of God upon the soul; when He touches the soul—it puts into it a divine 
    nature; it makes it to be holy and to resemble God! <i>The sanctifying work 
    of the Spirit is the fruit of Christ's intercession! </i>"The Holy Spirit 
    was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." Christ being 
    glorified, and in heaven, he prays to the Father—and the Father sends the 
    Spirit, who pours out the holy anointing upon the elect!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The purification of our holy things.</p></b></font> It 
    is Christ's work in heaven, not only to present his own prayers to his 
    Father—but <i>he prays our prayers over again! </i>"Another angel, who had a 
    golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to 
    offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the 
    throne." Revelation 8:3. This angel was Christ; he takes the golden censer 
    of his merits, and puts our prayers into this censer, and with the incense 
    of his intercession makes our prayers go up as a sweet perfume in heaven! It 
    is observable in Lev 16:16. "Aaron will make atonement for the Most Holy 
    Place, because of the defiling sin and rebellion of the Israelites." This 
    was typical, to show that our <i>holy duties </i>need to have atonement made 
    for them. Our best services, as they come from us, are mixed with 
    corruption, as wine which tastes of the cask. Our best services are filthy 
    menstrous rags. Isa 64:6. But Christ purifies and sweetens these services, 
    mixing the sweet incense of his intercession with them; and then God accepts 
    and crowns them. What would become of our duties, without such a high 
    priest? Christ's intercession is to our prayers, as the fan to the chaff, 
    which winnows it from the grain. Just so, Christ winnows out all the chaff, 
    which intermixes with our prayers.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Access with boldness unto the throne of grace. </p></b>
</font>"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with 
    our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as 
    we are—yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with 
    confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our 
    time of need." Hebrews 4:15-16. We have a friend at court, who speaks a good 
    word for us, and is following our cause in heaven; let this animate and 
    encourage us in prayer. Do we think it too much boldness for such sinners as 
    we are, to come for pardon, and that we shall be denied? Surely this is a 
    sinful modesty. Did we indeed come in our <i>own </i>name in prayer, it 
    would be sinful presumption! But Christ intercedes for us in the force and 
    efficacy of his blood! To be afraid to come to God in prayer, is a dishonor 
    to Christ's intercession.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Sending the Comforter.</p></b></font> "I will ask the 
    Father, and he shall give you another Comforter." The <i>comfort </i>of the 
    Spirit is distinct from the <i>anointing</i>. Here is sweet comfort, sweeter 
    than the honey-drops from the honey-comb; it is the manna in the golden pot! 
    A <i>drop </i>of this heavenly comfort is enough to sweeten a <i>sea </i>of 
    worldly sorrow! It is called the "pledge of the Spirit." A pledge assures us 
    of the whole sum. 2 Cor 1:22. The Spirit gives us a pledge of heaven in our 
    hand. Whence is this comforting work of the Spirit? Thank Christ's 
    intercession for it! "I will ask the Father, and he shall give the 
    Comforter."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Perseverance in grace.</p></b></font> "I will remain in 
    the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to 
    you. Holy Father, <i>protect </i>them by the power of your name." John 
    17:11. It is not our prayer, or watchfulness, or grace which keeps us—but it 
    is God's care and preservation! He preserves us, that we do not fall away. 
    Whence is it that God preserves us? It is from Christ's intercession. "Holy 
    Father, <i>protect </i>them." The prayer of Christ for Peter, "Simon, Simon, 
    Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that 
    your faith may not fail." Luke 22:31-32. This is the copy of Christ's prayer 
    now in heaven. Peter's faith did fail in some degree, when he denied Christ; 
    but Christ prayed that it might not <i>totally </i>fail. The saints 
    persevere in <i>believing</i>, because Christ perseveres in <i>praying!
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Absolution at the day of judgment.</p></b></font> Christ 
    shall judge the world. "God has committed all judgment to the Son." Those 
    for whom Christ has so prayed—he will absolve when he sits upon his throne 
    of judgment. Will Christ condemn those for whom he prays? Believers are his 
    spouse—will Jesus condemn his own spouse?
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">Use one: Of INSTRUCTION. </p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) See here the constancy of Christ's love to the 
    elect.</p></font></b> He not only died for them—but intercedes for them in 
    heaven. When Christ has done <i>dying</i>, he has not done <i>loving</i>. He 
    is now at work in heaven for the saints, he carries their names on his 
    bosom, and will never stop praying, until that prayer be granted. "Father, I 
    want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, 
    the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the 
    world." John 17:24.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) See whence it is, that the prayers of the saints are 
    so powerful with God.</p></b></font> Jacob, struggled with God, and prevailed. 
    Moses' prayer tied God's hands. By his prayers he held God bound as if by 
    chains! "Let Me alone!" Exod 32:10. Whence is this? It is Christ's prayer in 
    heaven, which makes the saints' prayers so prevalent. Christ's divine nature 
    is the altar on which he offers up our prayers, and so they prevail. Prayer, 
    as it comes from the saints is but weak and languid; but when the <i>arrow 
    of a saint's prayer </i>is put into the <i>bow of Christ's intercession—</i>it 
    pierces the throne of grace!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It shows that a Christian when he prays, must 
    chiefly fix his eye on Christ's intercession.</p></b></font> We are to look up 
    to the mercy-seat—but to hope for mercy through Christ's intercession. We 
    read in Lev 16 that Aaron made atonement by the <i>incense, </i>as well as 
    by the <i>blood</i>. So we must look to the cloud of incense, namely, the 
    intercession of Christ. Christian, look up to your Advocate, one to whom God 
    can deny nothing. A word from Christ's mouth, is more than if all the angels 
    in heaven were pleading for you! If a man had an important suit in the 
    Court—and had a skillful lawyer to plead, it would much encourage him. 
    Christ is at the court appearing for us, "For Christ has entered into heaven 
    itself to appear now before God as our Advocate!" Heb 9:24. He has great 
    power in heaven, which should much encourage us to look up to him, and hope 
    for audience in prayer. We might indeed be afraid to offer our petitions, if 
    we did not have Christ to present them!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) See the dreadful condition of an unbeliever.</p></b></font> 
    He has none in heaven to speak a word for him. "I do <i>not </i>pray for the 
    world." As good be shut out of heaven—as shut out of Christ's prayer! Christ 
    pleads for the saints, as Queen Esther did for the Jews, when they would 
    have been destroyed. "Let <i>my </i>people be spared at my request."<b> When 
    the devil shows the blackness of their sins—Christ shows the redness of his 
    wounds! </b>How dreadful is the condition of that man <i>for </i>whom Christ 
    will not pray, nay, <i>against </i>whom he will pray! Then Queen Esther 
    petitioned against Haman, and he grew pale with fright, and was led away to 
    execution. It is dreadful when the law, and conscience, and the judge shall 
    be against the sinner—and no friend to speak a word for him; there is no 
    way, then—but for the <i>jailer </i>to take the prisoner.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) If Christ makes intercession, then we have nothing 
    to do with other intercessors. </p></b></font>The Church of Rome teaches that 
    the angels intercede for us—and they pray to them! But Christ alone can 
    intercede for us! God has consecrated him as high priest. "You are a priest 
    forever." Christ intercedes by virtue of his merit—in the virtue of his shed 
    blood. He pleads <i>his </i>merits to his Father; but the angels have no 
    merits to bring to God, and therefore cannot be intercessors for us. Whoever 
    is our <i>advocate </i>must be our <i>atoning sacrifice</i>, to pacify God. 
    "But if anyone does sin, we have an <i>advocate </i>with the Father—Jesus 
    Christ the righteous One. He Himself is the <i>atoning sacrifice</i> for our 
    sins." 1 John 2:1-2. The angels cannot be our <i>atoning sacrifice</i>, and 
    not therefore our <i>advocates</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of TRIAL.</p></b></font> How shall we know that 
    Christ intercedes for us? They have little ground to think Christ prays for 
    them—who never pray for themselves! Well—but how shall we know?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) If Christ is praying <i>for </i>us, his Spirit is 
    praying <i>in </i>us.</p></b></font> "He has sent forth his Spirit into your 
    hearts, crying, Abba, Father." The Spirit helps us with sighs and groans; 
    not only with gifts but groans. "And the Holy Spirit helps us in our 
    distress. For we don't even know what we should pray for, nor how we should 
    pray. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be 
    expressed in words. And the Father who knows all hearts, knows what the 
    Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with 
    God's own will." We need not climb up the skies, to see if the sun is there; 
    we may see the beauty of it upon the earth. Just so, we need not go up into 
    heaven to see if Christ is there interceding for us; but let us look into 
    our hearts, if they are quickened and inflamed in prayer, and we can cry, 
    "Abba, Father!" By this interceding of the Spirit <i>within </i>us, we may 
    know Christ is interceding <i>above </i>for us.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If we are <i>given </i>to Christ, then he <i>
    intercedes </i>for us.</p></b></font> "I pray for those whom you have given me." 
    It is one thing for <i>Christ </i>to be given to us; it is another thing for
    <i>us </i>to be given to Christ.
<b>
<p align="justify">How do we know that we are given to Christ?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">If you are a believer, then you are one given to 
    Christ—and he prays for you. Faith is an act of recumbency. We rest on 
    Christ as the stones in the building rest upon the corner-stone. Faith 
    throws itself into Christ's arms; it says, "Christ is my priest, his blood 
    is my sacrifice, his divine nature is my altar, and here I rest!" This faith 
    is seen by its effects; it is a <i>refining </i>work and a <i>resigning </i>
    work. It <i>purifies </i>the heart, there is the refining work; it makes a 
    deed of gift to Christ, it gives up its love to him, there is the <i>
    resigning </i>work of faith. They who believe are given to Christ, and have 
    a part in his prayer. "I am praying not only for these disciples but also 
    for all who will ever believe in me because of their testimony." John 17:20.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Of EXHORTATION. </p></b></font>It stirs us up to 
    several duties. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) If Christ appears for us in heaven—then we must 
    appear for him upon earth.</p></b></font> Christ is not ashamed to carry our 
    names on his bosom, and shall we be ashamed of his truth? Does he plead our 
    cause, and shall we not stand up in his cause? What a mighty argument is 
    this to stand up for the honor of Christ, in times of apostasy! Christ is 
    interceding for us. Does he present our names in heaven, and shall not we 
    profess his name on earth?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If Christ lays out all his interest for us at the 
    throne of grace, we must lay out all our interest for him.</p></b></font> "That 
    Christ may be magnified." Trade your talents for Christ's glory; there is no 
    man but has some talent to trade—one learning, another estate. Oh, trade for 
    Christ's glory! Spend and be spent for him. Let your <i>heart </i>study for 
    Christ, your <i>hands </i>work for him, your <i>tongue </i>speak for him. If 
    Christ is an advocate for us in heaven—we must be agents for him on earth; 
    everyone in his sphere must act vigorously for him.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Believe in this glorious intercession of Christ</p></b></font>; 
    that he now intercedes for us, and that for his sake God will accept us, as 
    in the text, "Who makes intercession for us." If we believe not, we dishonor 
    Christ's intercession. If a poor sinner may not go to Christ as his high 
    priest, believing in his intercession, then we are Christians in a worse 
    condition under the gospel—than the Jews were under the law. When they had 
    sinned they had their high priest to make atonement; and shall not we have 
    our High Priest? Is not Christ our <i>Aaron</i>, who presents his blood and 
    incense before the mercy seat? Oh look up by faith to Christ's intercession! 
    Christ did not only pray for his disciples and apostles—but for the weakest 
    believer.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Love your Intercessor. </p></b></font>"If anyone does 
    not love the Lord, that person is cursed." I Cor 16:22. God's kindness, 
    invites our love. Had you a friend at court, who, when you were questioned 
    for delinquency or debt, should plead with the judge for you, and bring you 
    off your troubles, would you not love that friend? How often does Satan put 
    in his bills against us in the court! Now Christ is at the judge's hand; he 
    sits at his Father's right hand, ever to plead for us, and to make our peace 
    with God. Oh, how should our hearts be fired with love to Christ! Love him 
    with a sincere and superlative love—above your possessions, and your family. 
    Our fire of love should be as fire on the altar—never to go out. Lev 6:13.

<p align="justify">Use four: Of COMFORT to believers.</p></b></font> Christ is 
    at work for you in heaven; he makes intercession for you.
<p align="justify">"Oh! But I am afraid Christ does not intercede for me. I 
    am such a sinner! For whom does Christ intercede?"</p>
<p align="justify">"He made intercession for the transgressors." Did Christ

    for you?</p>
<p align="justify">"But I have offended my High Priest, by distrusting his

<p align="justify">Which of us may not say so? But, Christian, do you mourn 
    for unbelief? Be not discouraged, you may have a part in Christ's prayer. 
    "The congregation murmured against Aaron;" but though they had sinned 
    against their high priest, Aaron ran in with his censer, and "stood between 
    the dead and the living." If so much affections in Aaron, who was but a type 
    of Christ, how much more affections are in Christ, who will pray for those 
    who have sinned against their High Priest! Did he not pray for those who 
    crucified him, "Father, forgive them"?</p>
<p align="justify">"But I am unworthy. What am I, that Christ should 
    intercede for <i>me?"</i></p>

<p align="justify">The work of Christ's intercession is a work of free 
    grace. Christ's <i>praying </i>for us is from his <i>pitying </i>us. He 
    looks not at our <i>worthiness</i>—but our <i>wants</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">"But I am followed with dreadful temptations."</p>
<p align="justify">But though Satan tempts, Christ prays; and Satan shall be 
    vanquished. You may lose a single battle—but not the victory. Christ prays 
    that your faith will not fail; therefore, Christian, say, "Why are you cast 
    down, O my soul?" Christ intercedes. It is man who sins, it is God that 
    prays. The Greek word for <i>advocate </i>signifies <i>comforter</i>. It is 
    a sovereign comfort—that Christ makes intercession.</p>

    5. Christ's KINGLY Office</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 26: How does Christ execute the office of a 
    KING?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: In subduing us to himself, in ruling and 
    defending us, and in restraining and conquering all his and our enemies.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us consider now Christ's regal office. "And he has on 
    his vesture, and on his thigh, a name written, "King of kings, and Lord of 
    lords!" Rev 19:16. Jesus Christ is of mighty renown, he is a king: </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He has a kingly <i>title</i>. "High and Lofty." Isa 
    57:15. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He has his <i>ensigns of royalty</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">He has his <i>crown</i>; Rev 6:2; [a crown is the symbol 
    of royal power]. </p>
<p align="justify">He has his <i>sword</i>, "Gird your sword upon your 
    thigh."</p>
<p align="justify">He has his <i>scepter</i>, "A scepter of righteousness is 
    the scepter of your kingdom."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He has his escutcheon, or <i>coat of armor</i>; he 
    inserts the lion in his coat of arms. "The lion of the tribe of Judah." The 
    text says "he is King of kings." He has a pre-eminence of all other kings, 
    and is called, "The Prince of the kings of the earth." He must needs be so, 
    for "by him kings reign." They hold their crowns by immediate tenure from 
    this great King. Christ infinitely outvies all other princes; he has the 
    highest <i>throne</i>, the largest <i>dominions</i>, and the longest <i>
    possession</i>. "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever." He has many 
    heirs—but no successors. Well may he be called "King of kings," for he has 
    an unlimited power! The power of other kings is limited—but Christ's power 
    is unlimited. "I know the greatness of the Lord—that our Lord is greater 
    than any other god. The Lord does whatever pleases him throughout all heaven 
    and earth, and on the seas and in their depths!" Psalm 135:5-6. Christ's <i>
    power </i>is as large as his <i>will</i>. The angels take the oath of 
    allegiance to him. "Let all the angels of God worship him."</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">How did Christ come to be king?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">Not by usurpation—but legally. He holds his crown by 
    immediate tenure from heaven. God the Father has decreed him to be king. "I 
    have placed my chosen king on the throne." God has anointed and sealed him 
    to his regal office. "Him has God the Father sealed." God has set the crown 
    upon his head.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">In what sense is Christ king?</p></b></font> Two ways: 
<p align="justify">1. In reference to his people. </p>
<p align="justify">2. In reference to his enemies.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. In reference to his PEOPLE.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1.] To govern them.</p></b></font> It was prophesied of 
    Christ before he was born, "And you, Bethlehem, are not the least among the 
    princes of Judah; for out of you shall come a governor who shall <i>rule </i>
    my people Israel." It is a vain thing for a king to have a <i>crown </i>on 
    his head, unless he has a <i>scepter </i>in his hand to rule.
<i>
<p align="justify">Where does Christ rule as king?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">His kingdom is spiritual. He rules in the hearts of men. 
    He sets up his throne where no other king does; he rules the will and 
    affections; his power binds the conscience; he subdues men's lusts. "He will 
    subdue our iniquities." Mic 7:19.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">What does Christ rule by?</p></i> By law, and by love. 
<p align="justify">(1.) He rules by LAW. It is one of the flowers of the 
    crown, to enact laws. Christ as a king makes laws, and by his laws he rules; 
    as the law of faith; "believe in the Lord Jesus;" and the law of sanctity; 
    "you must be holy in everything you do, just as God—who chose you to be his 
    children—is holy" 1 Pet 1:15. Many would admit Christ to be their <i>
    advocate </i>to plead for them—but not their <i>king </i>to rule over them.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He rules by LOVE. He is a king full of mercy and 
    clemency; as he has a scepter in his hand, so an olive branch of peace in 
    his mouth. Though he is the Lion of the tribe of Judah for majesty—yet he is 
    the Lamb of God for meekness. His regal rod has honey at the end of it. He 
    sheds abroad his love into the hearts of his subjects; he rules them with <i>
    promises </i>as well as <i>precepts</i>. This makes all his subjects become 
    volunteers; they are willing to pay their allegiance to him. "Your people 
    shall be a <i>willing </i>people."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2.] Christ is a king to DEFEND his people. </p></b></font>As 
    Christ has a <i>scepter </i>to rule them, so he has a <i>shield </i>to 
    defend them. "You, O Lord, are a shield for me." Christ preserves his 
    church—as a <i>spark </i>in the ocean, as a flock of <i>sheep </i>among 
    wolves. That the sea should be higher than the earth, and yet not drown it, 
    is a wonder; so, that the wicked should be so much higher than the church in 
    power, and not devour it, is, because Christ has this inscription on his 
    vesture and his thigh, KING OF KINGS. "If the Lord had not been on our side 
    when people rose up against us, they would have swallowed us alive because 
    of their burning anger against us." Psalms 124:2-3. They say that lions have 
    little or no sleep; it is true of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, he never 
    slumbers or sleeps—but watches over his church to defend it. "In that day we 
    will sing of the pleasant vineyard. I, the Lord, will watch over it and tend 
    its fruitful vines. Each day I will water them; <i>day </i>and <i>night </i>
    I will watch to keep enemies away." Isaiah 27:2-3. If the enemies destroy 
    the church, it must be at a time when it is neither night nor day, for 
    Christ keeps it day and night. 
<p align="justify">Christ is said to carry his church, as the eagle her 
    young ones upon her wings. Exod 19:4. The arrow must first hit the eagle 
    before it can hurt the young ones, and shoot through her wings: the enemies 
    must first strike through Christ, before they can destroy his church. Let 
    the wind and storms be up, and the church almost covered with waves—yet 
    Christ is in the ship of the church, and there is no danger of shipwreck!</p>
<p align="justify">Nor will Christ <i>defend </i>his church only, as he is 
    king—but <i>deliver </i>it. "He <i>delivered </i>me out of the mouth of the 
    lion," namely, Nero. 2 Tim 4:17. "The Lord saved them by a great <i>
    deliverance</i>." I Chron 11:14. Sometimes Christ is said to command 
    deliverance. Psalm 44:4. Sometimes to create deliverance. Isa 45:8. Christ 
    as a <i>King </i>commands deliverance, and as a <i>God </i>creates it. And 
    deliverance shall come in his time. "I the Lord will hasten it in his time." 
    Isa 60:22.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">When is the time that this king will deliver his people?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">When the hearts of his people are most humble, when their 
    prayers are most fervent, when their faith is strongest, when their forces 
    are weakest, when their enemies are highest; then is the usual time that 
    Christ puts forth his kingly power for their deliverance. Isa 33:2, 8, 9.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3.] Christ is a king to REWARD his people. </p></b></font>
    There is nothing lost by serving this king. He rewards his subjects in this 
    life. He gives them inward peace and joy; a bunch of grapes by the way; and 
    oft-times riches and honor. "Godliness has the promise of this life." But 
    the great reward is to come. "An eternal weight of glory!" Christ makes all 
    his subjects kings! "I will give you a <i>crown </i>of life!" This crown 
    will be full of jewels, and it will "never fade."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Christ is a king in reference to his ENEMIES</p></b></font>, 
    in subduing and conquering them. He pulls down their pride, befools their 
    carnal policy, restrains their malice. That stone cut out of the mountain 
    without hands, which smote the image, was an emblem, says Augustine, of 
    Christ's kingly power, conquering and triumphing over his enemies. Dan 2:34. 
    Christ will make his enemies his footstool. Psalm 110:1. He can destroy them 
    with ease. "It is nothing for you, Lord, to help." 2 Chron 14:11. He can do 
    it with <i>weak </i>means, or <i>without </i>means. He can make the enemies 
    destroy themselves. He set the Persians against the Grecians; and the 
    children of Ammon helped to destroy one another. 2 Chron 20:23. Thus Christ 
    is king in vanquishing the enemies of his church.
<p align="justify">It is a great ground of comfort to the church of God in 
    the midst of all the combinations of the enemy, that "Christ is king;" and 
    he cannot only <i>bind </i>the enemies' power—but <i>break </i>it. The 
    church has more with her—than against her; she has Emmanuel on her side, 
    even that great KING to whom all knees must bend!</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is called "a man of war." Exod 15:3. He 
    understands all the policy of warfare; he is described with seven eyes and 
    seven horns. Rev 5:6. The seven <i>eyes </i>are to discern the conspiracies 
    of his enemies, and the seven <i>horns </i>are to overpower and vex his 
    enemies.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is described with a <i>crown </i>and a <i>bow</i>. 
    "He who sat upon the white horse had a <i>bow</i>, and a <i>crown </i>was 
    given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer." The <i>crown
    </i>is an ensign of his kingly office, and the <i>bow </i>is to shoot his 
    enemies to death.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is described with a vesture dipped in blood. Rev 
    19:13. He has a <i>golden scepter</i> to rule his people—but an <i>iron rod
    </i>to break his enemies! "The ten horns you saw are ten kings; these shall 
    make war with the Lamb—but the Lamb shall overcome them; for he is the King 
    of kings." The enemies may set up their standard—but Christ will set up his 
    trophies at last. "So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and loaded the
    <i>grapes </i>into the great winepress of God's wrath. And the grapes were 
    trodden in the winepress, and blood flowed from the winepress." Rev 14:19, 
    20. The enemies of Christ shall be but as so many clusters of ripe grapes, 
    to be cast into the great wine-press of the wrath of God, and to be trodden 
    by Christ until their blood comes out. Christ will at last come off victor, 
    and all his enemies shall be put under his feet.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one:</p></b></font> 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is no disparagement to serve Christ</p></b></font>; 
    he is a king, and it is no dishonor to be employed in a king's service. Some 
    are apt to reproach the saints for their piety; but they serve the Lord 
    Christ, he who has this inscription upon his vesture, KING OF KINGS. 
    Theodosius thought it a greater honor to be a servant of Christ than the 
    head of an empire. Christ's servants are called <i>vessels of honor</i>; 2 
    Tim 2:21; and a <i>royal nation</i>, I Pet 2:9. Serving Christ ennobles us 
    with dignity; it is a greater honor to serve Christ—than to have kings serve 
    us!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If Christ is king, it informs us, that all matters 
    must one day be brought before him for judgment.</p></b></font> Christ has the 
    power of life and death in his hand. "The Father has committed all judgment 
    to the Son." He who once hung upon the cross shall sit upon the bench of 
    judicature; kings must come before him to be judged; they who once sat upon 
    the throne must appear at Christ's bar. God has committed all judgment to 
    the Son, and Christ's is the highest court of judicature; if this King once 
    condemns men, there is no appeal to any other court.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) When we are foiled by <i>corruption </i>we must go 
    to Christ, for he is king; desire him by his kingly power to subdue our 
    corruptions, to bind these <i>kings </i>with chains. </p></b></font>Psalm 149:8. 
    We are apt to say of our sins, "These sons of Zeruiah will be too strong for 
    us!" "We shall never overcome our corruptions!" Go to Christ—he is king. 
    Though our lusts are too strong for <i>us</i>—they are not for <i>Christ </i>
    to conquer; for by his Spirit he can break the power of sin. When Joshua had 
    conquered five kings, he caused his servants to set their feet on the necks 
    of those kings; so Christ can and will set his feet on the necks of our 
    lusts!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Is Christ King of kings? Let all these <i>great
    </i>ones take heed how they employ their power against him.</p></b></font> He 
    gives them their power, and if this power shall be made use of for 
    suppressing his kingdom and ordinances, their account will be dreadful. God 
    has laid the key of government upon Christ's shoulders, Isa 9:6, and to 
    oppose Christ in his kingly office is as if the thorns should set themselves 
    in battle array against the fire, or a child fight with an archangel! 
    Christ's sword on his thigh is able to avenge all his quarrels. It is not 
    good to stir a <i>lion</i>; let no man provoke the <i>Lion of the tribe of 
    Judah</i>, whose eyes are a lamp of fire, and "the rocks are thrown down by 
    him." "Let everyone bring tribute to the Awesome One. For he breaks the 
    spirit of princes and is feared by the kings of the earth." Psalm 76:11-12.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: If Christ is a great king, submit to him.</p></b></font> 
    Say not, as those Jews, "We have no king but Caesar!" "We have no king but 
    our lusts!" This is to choose the bramble to rule over you, and "out of the 
    bramble will come forth a fire." Submit to Christ <i>willingly</i>. All the 
    devils in hell submit to Christ; but it is against their will; they are his 
    slaves, not his subjects. Submit <i>cheerfully </i>to Christ's person and 
    his laws. Many would have Christ their <i>Savior</i> to save them from 
    hell—but not their King to rule them; such as will not have Christ to be 
    their king to rule over them, shall never have his blood to save them. Obey 
    all Christ's princely commands; if he commands love, humility, good works, 
    be as the needle which points whichever way the loadstone draws.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Let those admire God's free grace—who were once 
    under the power, and slavery and tyranny of Satan—and now Christ has made 
    them to become the subjects of his kingdom.</p></b></font> Christ did not need 
    subjects, he has legions of angels ministering to him; but in his love he 
    has honored you to make you his subjects. Oh, how long was it before Christ 
    could prevail with you to come under his banner! How much opposition did he 
    meet with before you would wear this prince's colors! At last <i>omnipotent 
    grace </i>overcame you! When Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, an 
    angel came and took off his chains, Acts 12:7; so, <i>when you were sleeping 
    in the devil's arms,</i> Christ by his Spirit smote your heart, and caused 
    the chains of sin to fall off, and made you a subject of his kingdom. Oh 
    admire free grace! You are a subject of Christ, and are sure to reign with 
    him forever!

    6. Christ's Humiliation in His Incarnation</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Great is the mystery of godliness, God was manifest in 
    the flesh." 1 Timothy 3:16. "And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled 
    Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross." 
    Philippians 2:8</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Question 27: In what did Christs humiliation consist?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: In his being born, and that in a low condition, 
    made under the law, undergoing the miseries of this life, the wrath of God, 
    and the cursed death of the cross.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Christ's humiliation consisted in his incarnation, his 
    taking flesh, and being born.</p></b> It was real flesh that Christ took; not 
    the image of a body (as the Manichees erroneously held) —but a true body; 
    therefore he is said to be "made of a woman." As bread is made of wheat, and 
    wine is made of the grape; so Christ is made of a woman: his body was part 
    of the flesh and substance of the virgin. This is a glorious mystery, "God 
    manifest in the flesh." In the creation, man was made in God's image; in the 
    incarnation God was made in man's image.
<i>
<p align="justify">How did Christ come to be made flesh?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">It was by his Father's special designation. "God <i>sent
    </i>forth his Son, made of a woman." God the Father in a special manner 
    appointed Christ to be incarnate; which shows how needful a call is, to any 
    business of weight and importance: to act without a call, is to act without 
    a blessing. Christ would not be incarnate, and take upon him the work of a 
    mediator until he had a call. "God <i>sent </i>forth his Son, made of a 
    woman."</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">But was there no other way for the restoring of fallen 
    man, but that God should take flesh?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">We must not ask a reason of God's will; it is dangerous 
    to pry into God's ark. We are not to <i>dispute, </i>but <i>adore</i>. The 
    wise God saw it to be the <i>best </i>way for our redemption, that Christ 
    should be incarnate. It was not fit for any to satisfy God's justice but a
    <i>man</i>; none could do it but <i>God</i>; therefore, Christ being both 
    God and man, is the fittest to undertake this work of redemption.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Why was Christ born of a woman?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">(1.) That God might fulfill that promise in Gen 3:15, 
    "The seed of the woman shall break the serpent's head." </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ was born of a woman, that he might roll away 
    that reproach from the woman, which she had contracted by being seduced by 
    the serpent. Christ, in taking his flesh from the woman, has honored her 
    gender; that as, at the first, the woman had made man a <i>sinner</i>; so 
    now, to make him amends, she should bring him a <i>Savior</i>.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Why was Christ born of a virgin?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">(1.) For <i>decency</i>. It was not befitting for God to 
    have any mother but a virgin; and it was not befitting for a virgin to have 
    any other son but a God.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) For <i>necessity</i>. Christ was to be a high 
    priest, most pure and holy. Had he been born after the ordinary course of 
    nature, he would have been defiled, since all who spring out of Adam's loins 
    have a tincture of sin. That Christ's substance might remain <i>pure </i>and
    <i>immaculate</i>, he was born of a virgin.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) To answer the <i>type</i>. Melchisedec was a type of 
    Christ, who is said to be "without father and without mother." Christ being 
    born of a virgin, answered the type; he was without father and without 
    mother; without mother as he was God, without father as he was man.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">How could Christ be made of the flesh and blood of a 
    virgin, and yet be without sin?</p></i> The purest virgin is stained with 
    original sin.
<p align="justify">This knot the Scripture unties. "The Holy Spirit will 
    come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the 
    baby born to you will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God." Luke 
    1:35. "The Holy Spirit will come upon you," that is, the Holy Spirit did 
    consecrate and purify that part of the virgin's flesh whereof Christ was 
    made. As the alchemist extracts and draws away the dross from the gold, so 
    the Holy Spirit refines and clarifies that part of the virgin's flesh, 
    separating it from sin. Though the Virgin Mary herself had sin—yet that part 
    of her flesh, whereof Christ was made, was without sin; otherwise it must 
    have been an impure conception.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">What is meant by the power of the Most High overshadowing 
    the virgin?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">The Holy Spirit having framed Christ in the virgin's 
    womb, did, in a wonderful manner, unite Christ's human nature to his divine, 
    and so of both made one person. This is a mystery, which the angels pry into 
    with adoration.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">When was Christ incarnate?</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">In the fullness of time. "When the fullness of time was 
    come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman." By the fullness of time we 
    must understand, <i>the determinate time which God had set. </i>More 
    particularly, this fullness of time was when all the prophecies of the 
    coming of the Messiah were accomplished; and all legal shadows and figures, 
    whereby he was typified, were abrogated. This may comfort us, in regard to 
    the church of God, that though at present we do not see that peace and 
    purity in the church which we could desire—yet in the fullness of time, when 
    God's time is come and mercy is ripe, then shall deliverance spring up, and 
    God will come riding upon the chariots of salvation.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Why was Jesus Christ made flesh?</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The prime cause was free grace.</p></b> It was love in 
    God the Father, to send Christ; and love in Christ that he came to be 
    incarnate. Love was the intrinsic motive. Christ is God-man, because he is a 
    lover of man. Christ came to us, out of pity and love. Not our <i>deserts</i>—but 
    our <i>misery</i>, made Christ take flesh. Christ's taking flesh was a plot 
    of free grace, and a design of pure love. God himself, though Almighty, was 
    overcome with love! Christ incarnate, is nothing but <i>'love</i>' <i>
    covered with flesh! </i>As Christ's assuming our human nature was a 
    master-piece of wisdom, so it also was a monument of free grace!
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ took our flesh upon him, that he might take 
    our sins upon him.</p></b> "He was," says Luther, "<i>maximus peccator</i>, the 
    greatest sinner, having the weight of the sins of the whole world lying upon 
    him." He took our flesh that he might take our sins, and so appease God's 
    wrath for us.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ took our flesh that he might make the human 
    nature appear lovely to God, and the divine nature appear lovely to man.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1:) That he might make the human nature lovely to God. 
    Upon our fall from God, our nature became odious to him; no vermin is so 
    odious to us as the human nature was to God. When once our virgin nature was 
    become sinful, it was like flesh imposthumated, or running into sores, 
    loathsome to behold. It was so odious to God that he could not endure to 
    look upon us. Christ taking our flesh, makes this human nature appear lovely 
    to God. As when the sun shines on the glass it casts a bright luster, so 
    Christ being clad with our flesh makes the human nature shine, and appear 
    amiable in God's eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">(2:) As Christ being clothed with our flesh makes the 
    human nature appear lovely to God, so he makes the divine nature appear 
    lovely to man. The pure Godhead is terrible to behold, we could not see it 
    and live; but Christ clothing himself with our flesh, makes the divine 
    nature more amiable and delightful to us. We need not be afraid to look upon 
    God through Christ's human nature. It was a custom of old among shepherds to 
    clothe themselves with sheepskins, to be more pleasing to the sheep; so 
    Christ clothed himself with our flesh, that the divine nature may be more 
    pleasing to us. The human nature is a glass, through which we may see the 
    love and wisdom and glory of God clearly represented to us. Through the 
    lantern of Christ's humanity we may behold the light of the Deity. Christ 
    being incarnate makes the sight of the Deity not formidable—but delightful 
    to us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Jesus Christ united himself to man, "that man might 
    be drawn nearer to God."</p></b> God before was an enemy to us by reason of sin; 
    but Christ having taken our flesh, mediates for us, and brings us into favor 
    with God. As when a king is angry with a subject, the king's son marries his 
    daughter, and so mediates for the subject, and brings him into favor with 
    the king again; so when God the Father was angry with us, Christ married 
    himself to our nature, and now mediates for us with his Father, and brings 
    us to be friends again, and God looks upon us with a favorable aspect. As 
    Joab pleaded for Absalom, and brought him to King David, and David kissed 
    him; so Jesus Christ ingratiates us into the love and favor of God. 
    Therefore he may well be called a peacemaker, having taken our flesh upon 
    him, and so made peace between us and his Father.

<p align="justify">(1.) See here, as in a glass, the infinite love of God 
    the Father</p></b></font>; that when we had lost ourselves by sin, God, in the 
    riches of his grace, sent forth his Son, made of a woman, to redeem us! And 
    behold the infinite love of Christ, in that he was willing thus to 
    condescend to take our flesh! Surely the angels would have disdained to have 
    taken our flesh; it would have been a disparagement to them. What king would 
    be willing to wear sackcloth over his cloth of gold? But Christ did not 
    disdain to take our flesh. Oh the love of Christ! Had not Christ been made
    <i>flesh</i>—we would have been made a curse! Had he not been incarnate, we 
    would have been incarcerate, and had been forever in the prison of hell. 
    Well might an angel be the herald to proclaim this joyful news of Christ's 
    incarnation: "I bring you good news of great joy for everyone! The 
    Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born tonight in Bethlehem, the 
    city of David!" The love of Christ, in being incarcerated, will the more 
    appear if we consider—
<p align="justify">(1:) Consider<b> where </b>Christ came from. He came from 
    heaven, and from the richest place in heaven, his Father's bosom, that hive 
    of sweetness.</p>
<p align="justify">(2:) Consider for <b>whom </b>Christ came. Was it to his 
    friends? No! He came for sinful man! Man who had defaced his image, and 
    abused his love; man who was turned rebel! Yet he came to man, resolving to 
    conquer our <i>obstinacy </i>with his <i>kindness</i>. If he would come to 
    any, why not to the <i>angels </i>which fell? "He took not on him the nature 
    of angels." Heb 2:16. The angels are of a more noble origin, more 
    intelligent creatures, more able for service! But behold the love of 
    Christ—he did not come to the fallen angels—but to sinful mankind! Among the 
    several wonders of the <i>magnet</i>, is that it will not draw <i>gold </i>
    or <i>pearl</i>—but despising these, it draws the <i>iron </i>to it, one of 
    the most inferior metals. Just so, Christ leaves angels, those noble 
    spirits, the gold and the pearl—and comes to poor sinful man, and draws him 
    into his embraces!</p>
<p align="justify">(3:) Consider in what <b>manner </b>he came. He came not 
    in the majesty of a king, attended with his royal retinue—but he came poor; 
    not like the heir of heaven—but like one of an inferior descent. Consider 
    the <b>place </b>he was born in, was poor; not the royal city Jerusalem—but 
    Bethlehem, a poor obscure place. A feeding trough was his cradle, the 
    cobwebs were his curtains, the beasts were his companions; he descended of 
    poor parents. One would have thought, if Christ would have come into the 
    world, he would have made choice of some queen or personage of honor to have 
    descended from; but he comes of lowly obscure parents, for that they were 
    poor appears by their offering. "A pair of turtle-doves," which was the 
    usual offering of the poor. Lev 12:8. Christ was so poor, that when he 
    needed money, he had to work a miracle to obtain it. Matt 17:27. When he 
    died he made no will. He came into the world poor.</p>
<p align="justify">(4:) Consider <b>why </b>he came. That he might take our 
    flesh, and redeem us; that he might instate us into a kingdom. He was 
    poor—that he might make us rich. 2 Cor 8:8. He was born of a virgin—that we 
    might be born of God. He took our flesh—that he might give us his Spirit. He 
    lay in the manger—that we might lie in paradise. He came down from 
    heaven—that he might bring us to heaven. And what was all this but love? If 
    our hearts are not rocks, this love of Christ should affect us. Behold love 
    which passes knowledge! "May you experience the love of Christ, though it is 
    so great you will never fully understand it!" Ephesians 3:19</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) See here the astonishing humility of Christ.</p></b></font> 
    Christ was made flesh. That Christ should clothe himself with our flesh—a 
    piece of that earth which we tread upon—oh infinite humility! Christ's 
    taking our flesh was one of the lowest steps of his humiliation. He humbled 
    himself more in lying in the virgin's womb than in hanging upon the cross. 
    It was not so much for man to die—but for God to become man was the wonder 
    of humility. "He was made in the likeness of men." For Christ to be made 
    flesh, was more humility than for the angels to be made worms. Christ's 
    flesh is called a veil, "Through the veil," that is, his flesh. Christ's 
    wearing our flesh veiled his glory. For him to be made flesh, who was equal 
    with God—oh what humility! "Who being in the form of God thought it not 
    robbery to be equal with God." He stood upon even ground with the Father, he 
    was co-essential and con-substantial with his Father—yet for all that, he 
    takes flesh. He stripped himself of the robes of his glory, and covered 
    himself with the rags of our humanity. 
<p align="justify">If Solomon wondered that God should dwell in the temple 
    which was enriched and hung with gold—how may we wonder that God should 
    dwell in man's weak and frail nature! Nay, which is yet more humility, 
    Christ not only took our flesh—but took it when it was at the worst, under 
    disgrace; as if a servant should wear a nobleman's livery when he is 
    impeached of high treason. </p>
<p align="justify">Besides all this he took all the <b>infirmities </b>of 
    our flesh. There are two sorts of infirmities; such as are <i>sinful </i>
    infirmities without pain; and such as are <i>painful </i>infirmities without 
    sin. These <i>sinful </i>infirmities (such as to be covetous or ambitious) 
    Christ did not take upon him. But he took upon him <i>painful </i>
    infirmities, such as—</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) <b>Hunger</b>. He came to the fig-tree and was 
    hungry. Matt 21:18, 19. </p>
<p align="justify">(2:) <b>Weariness</b>, as when he sat on Jacob's well to 
    rest. John 4:6. </p>
<p align="justify">(3:) <b>Sorrow</b>. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even 
    unto death." Matt 26:38. It was a sorrow guided with reason—not disturbed 
    with passion. </p>
<p align="justify">(4:) <b>Fear</b>. "He was heard in that he feared." Heb 
    5:7. </p>
<p align="justify">A further degree of Christ's humility was, that he not 
    only was made flesh—but in the<i> likeness of sinful flesh</i>. "God made 
    him who had no sin—to be sin for us!" 2 Corinthians 5:21. He was like a 
    sinner; he had all sin laid <i>upon </i>him—but no sin lived <i>in </i>him. 
    "He was numbered among transgressors." Isa 53:12. He who was numbered among 
    the persons of the Trinity, is said "to bear the sins of many." Heb 9:28. 
    Now, this was the lowest degree of Christ's humiliation; for Christ to be 
    reputed as a sinner, was the greatest pattern of humility. That Christ, who 
    would not endure sin in the angels, should himself endure to have sin 
    imputed to him, is the most amazing humility that ever was!</p>
<p align="justify">From all this, learn to be humble. Do you see Christ 
    humbling himself, and are you proud? It is the humble saint, who is Christ's 
    picture. Christians, do not be proud of your fine feathers. Have you an <b>
    estate</b>? Do not be proud. The earth you tread on, is richer than you. It 
    has mines of gold and silver in its depths. Have you <b>beauty</b>? Do not 
    be proud. It is but air mingled with dirt. Have you <b>skill </b>and <b>
    abilities</b>? Be humble. Lucifer has more knowledge than you. Have you <b>
    grace</b>? Be humble. It is not of your own making—it was given to you by 
    God. Would it not folly, to be proud of a ring that is merely lent to you? 
    "What makes you better than anyone else? What do you have that God hasn't 
    given you? And if all you have is from God, why boast as though you have 
    accomplished something on your own?" 1 Corinthians 4:7. You have more sin 
    than grace, more spots than beauty. Oh look on Christ, this rare pattern of 
    humility—and be humbled! It is a sad sight, to see God humbling himself and 
    man exalting himself; to see a humble Savior and a proud sinner. God hates 
    the very semblance of pride! God would have no <i>honey </i>in the 
    sacrifice. Lev 2:11. Indeed, leaven is sour; but why no honey? Because, when 
    honey is mingled with meal or flour, it makes the meal to rise and swell; 
    therefore no honey. God hates the resemblance of the sin of pride! "I hate 
    pride and arrogance!" Proverbs 8:13. It is better to lack abilities—than 
    humility. "If God," says Augustine, 'spared not the angels, when they grew 
    proud, will he spare you, who are but dust and rottenness?"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Behold here a sacred riddle or paradox</p></b></font>—"God 
    manifest in the flesh." That man should be made in God's image was a 
    wonder—but that God should be made in man's image is a greater wonder. That 
    the Ancient of Days should be born, that he who thunders in the heavens 
    should cry in the cradle; that he who rules the stars should suck the 
    breast; that a virgin should conceive; that Christ should be made of a 
    woman, and of that woman which he himself made; that the branch should bear 
    the vine; that the mother should be younger than the child she bore, and the 
    child in the womb bigger than the mother; that the human nature should not 
    be God—yet one with God; this is the most astonishing miracle! Christ taking 
    flesh is a mystery we shall never fully understand until we come to heaven, 
    when our <i>light </i>shall be clear, as well as our <i>love </i>perfect.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) </p></b></font>From hence, "God manifest in the flesh," 
    Christ born of a virgin, a thing not only strange in nature—but impossible, 
    learn—<font color="#008000"><b>That there are no impossibilities with God.
    </b></font>God can bring about things which are impossible; as that iron 
    should swim, that the rock should gush out water, and that the fire should 
    lick up the water in the trenches. I Kings 18:38. It is natural for water to 
    quench fire—but for fire to consume water—is impossible in the course of 
    nature; but God can bring about all this. "There is nothing too hard for 
    you." "This is what the Lord Almighty says—All this may seem impossible to 
    you. But do you think this is impossible for me, the Lord Almighty?" Zech 
    8:6. 
<p align="justify">How should <i>God </i>be united to our <i>flesh</i>? It 
    is impossible to us—but not with God; he can do what transcends reason, and 
    exceeds faith. He would not be our God if he could not do more than we can 
    think. Eph 3:20. He can reconcile contraries. How apt are we to be 
    discouraged with seeming impossibilities! How do our hearts die within us 
    when things go contrary to sense and reason! We are apt to say as that 
    prince in 2 Kings 7:1-2, "Even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the 
    heavens, could this happen?" It was a time of <i>famine</i>—so how could a 
    bushel of wheat be sold for such a cheap price—how can this be? So, when 
    things are contrary, or strange, God's own people are apt to question—how 
    they could be brought about with success? </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Moses</p></i>, who was a man of God, and one of the brightest 
    stars which ever shone in the skies of God's church, was apt to be 
    discouraged with seeming impossibilities. "But Moses said—There are 600,000 
    foot soldiers here with me, and yet you promise them meat for a whole month! 
    Even if we butchered all our flocks and herds, would that satisfy them? Even 
    if we caught all the fish in the sea, would that be enough?" Numbers 
    11:21-22. As if he had said, in plain language, he did not see how the 
    people of Israel, being so numerous, could be fed for a month. "Then the 
    Lord said to Moses—Is there any limit to my power? Now you will see whether 
    or not my word comes true!" Verse 23. 
<p align="justify">That God who brought Isaac out of a <i>dead </i>womb, and 
    the Messiah out of a <i>virgin's </i>womb—what can he not do? Oh let us rest 
    upon the arm of God's power, and believe in him, in the midst of seeming 
    impossibilities! Remember, there are no impossibilities with God! He can 
    subdue a proud heart. He can raise a dying church. Christ born of a virgin! 
    The wonder-working God who wrought this, can bring to pass the greatest 
    seeming impossibility.</p>

    What will it profit us, that Christ was born into the world—unless he is 
    born in our hearts? Marvel not that I say unto you—Christ must be born in 
    your hearts. "Until Christ is formed in you." Now, then—see if Christ is 
    born in your hearts. How shall we know that?
<p align="justify">Are there <b>pangs </b>before the birth? So before Christ 
    is born in the heart, there are spiritual pangs; pangs of conscience, and 
    deep convictions. "They were pricked at their heart." I grant in the new 
    birth—some receive more, some less pangs—all have not the same pangs of 
    sorrow and humiliation; yet all have some pangs! If Christ is born in your 
    heart, you have been deeply afflicted for sin. Christ is never born in the 
    heart without pangs. Many thank God they never had any trouble of spirit, 
    they were always quiet; but this is a sign that Christ is not yet formed in 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">When Christ was born into the world, he was made <b>flesh</b>; 
    so, if he is born in your heart, he makes your heart a heart of flesh. "I 
    will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you 
    from all your impurities and from all your idols. I will give you a new 
    heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of 
    stone and give you <i>a heart of flesh!" </i>Ezekiel 36:25-26. Is your heart 
    flesh? <i>Before</i>, it was a rocky heart, and would not yield to God, or 
    take the impressions of the word; <i>now </i>it is fleshy and tender like 
    melted wax, to take any stamp of the Spirit. It is a sign that Christ is 
    born in our hearts, when they are hearts of flesh, when they melt in tears 
    and in love. What is it the better that Christ was made flesh, unless he has 
    given you a heart of flesh?</p>
<p align="justify">As Christ was conceived in the womb of a <b>virgin</b>; 
    so, if he is born in you—your heart is a virgin-heart, in respect of 
    sincerity and sanctity. Are you purified from the love of sin? If Christ is 
    born in your heart, it is a <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>—a holy of holies. If 
    your heart is polluted with the predominant love of sin, never think Christ 
    is born there, Christ will never lie any more in a <i>filthy stable</i>. If 
    he is born in your heart, it is consecrated by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">If Christ is born in your heart, then it is with you, as 
    in a birth. There is <b>life</b>. Faith is the vital organ of the soul. "The 
    life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and 
    gave himself for me." Gal 2:20. There is <b>appetite</b>. "As new-born 
    babes, desire the sincere milk of the word." The word is like 
    breast-milk—pure, sweet, nourishing; and the soul in which Christ is formed, 
    desires this breast-milk. Bernard, in one of his soliloquies, comforts 
    himself with this, that he surely had the new birth in him, because he found 
    in his heart such strong breathings and thirstings after God. After Christ 
    is born in the heart, there is great <b>motion</b>; there is a striving to 
    enter in at the strait gate, and offering violence to the kingdom of heaven. 
    Matt 11:12. By this we may know Christ is formed in us. This is the only 
    comfort—that as Christ was born into the world, so he is born in our hearts!</p>

    should walk just as He walked." 1 John 2:6. "I have set you an example that 
    you should do as I have done for you." John 13:15. Christ being incarnate 
    was made like us—let us labor to be made like him. There are five things in 
    which we should labor to be like Christ. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1:) Be like Christ in DISPOSITION. </p></b></font>He was of 
    a most sweet disposition. "He was the delight of humanity," Titus Vespasian. 
    He invites sinners to come to him. He has a heart to pity us, breasts to 
    feed us, wings to cover us. He would not break our heart—but with mercy. Was 
    Christ made in our likeness? Let us be like him in sweetness of disposition; 
    be not of a morose spirit. It was said of Nabal, "He's so ill-tempered that 
    no one can even talk to him!" 1 Samuel 25:17. Some are so ill-tempered, as 
    if they were akin to the beasts—they are fired with rage, and breathe forth 
    nothing but revenge! Or they are like those two men in the gospel, 
    "possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that 
    no one could pass that way." Matt 8:28. Let us be like Christ in mildness 
    and sweetness. Let us pray for our enemies, and conquer them by love. 
    David's kindness melted Saul's heart. I Sam 24:16. A frozen heart will be 
    thawed with the fire of love.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2:) Be like Christ in grace and HUMILITY. </p></b></font>He 
    was like us in having our flesh, let us be like him in having his grace. We 
    should labor to be like Christ, in humility. "He humbled himself." He left 
    the bright robes of his glory—to be clothed with the rags of our humanity—a 
    wonder of humility! Let us be like Christ in this grace. "Humility," says 
    Bernard, "is a despising of self-excellence," a kind of a self-annihilation. 
    This is the glory of a Christian. We are never so <i>lovely </i>in God's 
    eyes—as when we are <i>black </i>in our own eyes. In this let us be like 
    Christ. <b>True true religion is to imitate Christ. </b>And indeed, what 
    cause have we to be humble—if we look <i>within </i>us, <i>about </i>us,
<i>
<p align="justify">below </p></i>us, and <i>above </i>us!
<p align="justify">If we look <b>within us</b>—here we see our sins 
    represented to us in the looking-glass of conscience; lust, envy, passion. 
    Our sins are like vermin crawling in our souls. "How many are my 
    iniquities!" Job 13:23. Our sins are as the sands of the sea for <i>number</i>; 
    as the rocks of the sea for <i>weight! </i>Augustine cries out, "My heart, 
    which is God's temple—is polluted with sin!"</p>
<p align="justify">If we look <b>about us</b>—there is that which may humble 
    us. We may see other Christians outshining us in gifts and graces, as the 
    sun outshines the lesser planets. Others are laden with fruit—and perhaps we 
    have but here and there an olive-berry growing, to show that we are of the 
    right kind. Isa 17:6.</p>
<p align="justify">If we look <b>below us</b>—there is that may humble us. 
    We may see the mother earth, out of which we came. The earth is the most 
    ignoble element: "They were viler than the earth." Job 30:8. </p>
<p align="justify">"Then the Lord God formed the man out of the dust from 
    the ground." Genesis 2:7. "You will return to the ground from which you 
    came. For you were made from dust, and to the dust you will return." Genesis 
    3:19. You who are so proud, behold your pedigree—you are but walking dirt! 
    And will you be proud? What is <i>man</i>? The son of dust. And what is 
    dust? The son of nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">If we look <b>above us</b>; there is that which may 
    humble us. If we look up to heaven, there we may see God resisting the 
    proud. God pursues the proud in vengeance. The proud man is the mark which 
    God shoots at—and he never misses the mark. He threw proud Lucifer out of 
    heaven; he thrust proud Nebuchadnezzar out of his throne, and "he was driven 
    away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the 
    dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his 
    nails like the claws of a bird!" Daniel 4:33. Oh then—be like Christ in 
    humility!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3:) </p></b></font>Did Christ take our flesh? Was he made 
    like to us? <font color="#b07050"><b>Let us be made like him in ZEAL. </b>
</font>"Zeal for Your house has consumed Me, and the insults of those who 
    insult You have fallen on Me!" Psalm 69:9. He was zealous when his Father 
    was dishonored. In this let us be like Christ, zealous for God's <i>truth
    </i>and <i>glory</i>, which are the two orient pearls of the crown of 
    heaven. Zeal is as needful for a Christian as salt for the sacrifice, or 
    fire on the altar. Zeal without prudence is rashness; prudence without zeal 
    is cowardliness. Without zeal, our duties are not acceptable to God. Zeal is 
    like the bow-strings, without which the lute makes no music.

    When Christ took our flesh, he came not in the pride of flesh, he did not 
    descend immediately from kings and nobles—but was of lowly parentage. Christ 
    was not ambitious for titles or honor. He declined worldly dignity and 
    greatness—as much as others seek it. When they would have made him a king, 
    he refused it; he chose rather to ride upon the foal of an donkey, than be 
    drawn in a chariot; and to hang upon a wooden cross, than to wear a golden 
    crown. He scorned the pomp and glory of the world. He ignored secular 
    affairs. "Who made me a judge?" His work was not to arbitrate matters of 
    law; he did not come into the world to be a magistrate—but a Redeemer. He 
    was like a star in a higher orb, he minded nothing but heaven. Was Christ 
    made like us? Let us be made like him, in heavenliness and contempt of the 
    world. Let us not be ambitious of the empty honors and glories of the world. 
    Let us not purchase the world with the loss our soul. What wise man would 
    damn himself—to grow rich? or throw down his soul to hell—to build up an 
    earthly estate? Be like Christ in a holy contempt of the world.

<p align="justify">(5:) Be like Christ in HOLINESS of life.</p></b></font> Was 
    Christ incarnate? Was he made like us? Let us be made like him in holiness 
    of life. No temptation could fasten upon him. "The prince of this world 
    comes, and has nothing in me." John 14:30. Temptation to Christ, was like a 
    spark of fire upon a marble pillar, which glides off. Christ's life, says 
    Chrysostom, was brighter than the sunbeams. Let us be like him in this. "As 
    the One who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all your 
    conduct." 1 Peter 1:15. "We are not," says Augustine, "to be like Christ in 
    working miracles—but in a holy life." A Christian should be both a magnet 
    and a diamond; a magnet—in drawing others to Christ; a diamond—in casting a 
    sparkling luster of holiness in his life. Oh let us be so <i>just </i>in our 
    dealings, so <i>true </i>in our promises, so <i>devout </i>in our worship, 
    so <i>unblamably </i>in our lives—that we may be the walking pictures of 
    Christ! Thus as Christ was made in our likeness, let us labor to be made in 
    his.

    be <i>disgraced </i>for Christ. That is a good saying of Augustine, "those 
    who take away a saint's reputation, shall add to his reward." While they 
    make his reputation weigh lighter—they will make his crown weigh heavier. 
    Oh, was Christ content to be humbled and abased for us, to take our flesh, 
    and to take it when it was in disgrace? Let us not think much to be abased 
    for Christ. Say as David, "If this is to be vile—I will yet be more vile!" 
    "If to serve my Lord Christ, if to keep my conscience pure—if this is to be 
    vile—I will yet be more vile!"

</b></font>
<p align="justify">"God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the 
    name that is above every name." Phil 2:9.</p>
<p align="justify">We have before spoken of Christ's humiliation; we shall 
    now speak of his exaltation. Before you saw the Sun of Righteousness in the 
    eclipse; now you shall see it coming out of the eclipse, and shining in its 
    full glory. "God exalted him to the highest place;" "Above all exaltation."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Question 28: What does Christ's exaltation consist of?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: In his rising from the dead, his ascending into 
    heaven, and his sitting at the right hand of God the Father, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">In what sense has God exalted Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">Not in respect of his Godhead, for that cannot be exalted 
    higher than it is: as in his humiliation, the Godhead was not lower; so in 
    his exaltation, the Godhead is not higher: but Christ is exalted as 
    Mediator, his human nature is exalted.</p>
<p align="justify">How many ways is Christ exalted?</p>
<p align="justify">Five ways. God has exalted Christ, </p>
<p align="justify">1. In his titles. </p>
<p align="justify">2. In his office. </p>
<p align="justify">3. In his ascension. </p>
<p align="justify">4. To his right-hand. </p>
<p align="justify">5. In constituting him judge of the world.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. God has exalted Christ in his TITLES.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] He is exalted to be a LORD.</p></b></font> "The name of 
    the Lord Jesus was magnified." He is a Lord in respect of his sovereignty; 
    he is Lord over angels and men. "All power is given to him." Christ has 
    three keys in his hand, the key of the grave, to open the graves of men at 
    the resurrection; the key of heaven, to open the kingdom of heaven to 
    whomever he will; the key of hell, to lock up the damned in that fiery 
    prison. "I am the living one who died. Look, I am alive forever and ever! 
    And I hold the keys of death and the grave." Revelation 1:18.
<p align="justify">To this Lord all knees must bow. "That at the <i>name </i>
    of Jesus every knee should bow." <i>Name </i>is here put for <i>person</i>; 
    to that holy Jesus, to the scepter of that divine person, every knee shall 
    bow. Bowing is put for subjection. All must be subdued to him as sons or 
    captives, submit to him as to the Lord or Judge. Psalm 2:12, "Kiss the Son" 
    with a kiss of love and loyalty. We must not only cast ourselves into 
    Christ's <i>arms </i>to be saved by him—but we must cast ourselves at his <i>
    feet </i>to serve him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Christ is exalted to be a PRINCE.</p></b></font> "At that 
    time <i>Michael </i>the great prince who stands watch over your people will 
    rise up." Some think it was a created angel—but it was Christ the angel of 
    the covenant. He is a great prince. "The prince of the kings of the earth." 
    Human kings hold their crowns by immediate tenure from him; his throne is 
    above the stars, he has angels and archangels for his attendants. Thus he is 
    exalted in his titles of honor.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. God has exalted Christ in his OFFICE. </p></b></font>God 
    has honored him to be <i>Salvator mundi</i>—the Savior of the world. "Him 
    has God exalted with his right hand, to be a prince and a Savior." It was a 
    great honor to Moses to be a temporal savior; but what is that, compared to 
    the Savior of souls? "He has sent us <i>a mighty Savior </i>from the royal 
    line of his servant David." Luke 1:69. He saves from sin, Matt 1:21; from 
    wrath, I Thess 1:10. To save, is a flower belonging only to his crown. 
    "Neither is there salvation in any other." Acts 4:12. What an honor is this 
    to Christ! How did it make heaven ring with the praises of the saints! They 
    sing hallelujahs to Christ their Savior. "And they sang a new song—You are 
    worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and 
    with your blood you <i>redeemed </i>men for God from every tribe and 
    language and people and nation." Revelation 5:9.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. God has exalted Christ in his ASCENSION</p></b></font>; 
    for if he is ascended, then he is exalted. The Scripture plainly says he 
    ascended into heaven. Luke 24:51 and Eph 4:10. "Far above all heavens;" 
    therefore above the skies. He is ascended into the highest part of the 
    empyrean heaven, which Paul calls the third heaven. Concerning Christ's 
    ascension, two things may be observed:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The MANNER of his ascension.</p></b></font> When Christ 
    ascended he blessed his disciples. "He lifted up his hands, and blessed 
    them, and while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up 
    into heaven." Luke 24:50, 51. He did not leave them houses and lands—but he 
    left them his blessing.
<p align="justify">He ascended as a conqueror, in a way of triumph. "You 
    have led captivity captive." He triumphed over sin, hell, and death; and his 
    triumph is a believer's triumph. He has conquered sin and hell for every 
    believer.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The FRUIT of Christ's ascension. </p></b></font>His <i>
    ascension </i>to heaven causes the <i>descension </i>of the Holy Spirit into 
    our hearts. "When he ascended up on high, he gave gifts to men." Having 
    ascended up in the clouds, as his triumphant chariot, he gives the gift of 
    his Spirit to us; as a king at his coronation bestows gifts liberally on his 
    favorites.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">IV. God has exalted Christ to His right hand. </p></b></font>
    "After the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat 
    upon the right hand of God." "He raised him from the dead and seated him at 
    his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, 
    power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the 
    present age but also in the one to come." Ephesians 1:20-21.
<p align="justify">What is meant by Christ sitting at God's right hand?</p>
<p align="justify">God really has no right-hand or left; for being a Spirit, 
    he is void of all bodily parts. This is a metaphor taken from the manner of 
    kings, who were accustomed to advance their favorites next to their own 
    persons, and set them at their right hand. Solomon caused a seat to be set 
    for the queen his mother, and placed her at his right hand. So for Christ to 
    sit at the right hand of God, is to be in the next place to God the Father 
    in dignity and honor. The human nature of Christ, being personally united to 
    the divine nature, is now set down on a royal throne in heaven, and adored 
    even by angels!</p>
<p align="justify">By virtue of the personal union of Christ's human nature 
    with the divine, there is a communication of all that glory from the Deity 
    of Christ of which his human nature is capable. Not that the manhood of 
    Christ is advanced to an equality with the Godhead—but the divine nature 
    being joined with the human, the human nature is wonderfully glorified, 
    though not deified. Christ as mediator is filled with all majesty and honor, 
    beyond the comprehension of the highest order of angels. In his humiliation 
    he descended so low—that it was not fit to go lower; and in his exaltation 
    he ascended so high—that it is not possible to go higher. In his <i>
    resurrection </i>he was exalted above the grave; in his <i>ascension </i>he 
    was exalted above the starry heavens; in his sitting at God's right hand he 
    was exalted far above the highest heavens, "Far above all heavens."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">V. God has exalted Christ in constituting him JUDGE of 
    the whole world</p></b></font>. "The Father has committed all judgement to the 
    Son." At the day of judgement Christ shall be exalted supereminently. "He 
    shall come in the glory of his Father." He shall wear the same embroidered 
    robes of majesty as the Father; and he shall come with all his holy angels. 
    Matt 25:31. He who was led to the <i>bar </i>with a band of soldiers, shall 
    be attended to the <i>bench </i>with a guard of angels. Christ shall judge 
    his judges, he shall judge Pilate who condemned him; kings must leave their 
    thrones and come to his bar. And this is the highest court of judicature, 
    from whence is no appeal.

    scene altered! When he was on earth, he lay in a manger; now he sits on a 
    throne! Then he was hated and scorned of men; now he is adored by angels! 
    Then his name was reproached; now, "God has given him a name above every 
    name." Then he came in the form of a servant, and as a servant, stood with 
    his bason and towel, and washed his disciples' feet; now he is clad in his 
    princes' robes, and the kings of the earth cast their crowns before him. On 
    earth he was a man of sorrows; now he is anointed with the oil of gladness. 
    On earth was his crucifixion; now his coronation. Then his Father frowned 
    upon him in desertion; now he has set him at his right hand. Before, he 
    seemed to have no form or beauty in him; Isa 53:2; now he is in the 
    brightness of his Father's glory. Heb 1:3. Oh what a change is here! "Him 
    has God highly exalted."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Was Christ first humbled and then exalted? Hence 
    learn, that the way to true honor is humility. </p></b></font>"He who humbles 
    himself shall be exalted." The world looks upon humility as that which will 
    make contemptible—but it is the sure way to honor. The way to rise is to 
    fall; the way to ascend is to descend. Humility exalts us in the esteem of 
    men, and it exalts us to a higher throne in heaven. "Whoever shall humble 
    himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of 
    heaven." He shall have a greater degree of glory in it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ first <i>suffered</i>—and then was <i>exalted</i>.

    for him. "If we suffer with him, we shall reign with him." The <i>wicked </i>
    first reign—and then suffer; the <i>godly </i>first suffer—and then reign. 
    There is no way to heaven—but through sufferings. There is no way to the 
    crown—but by the cross. Jerusalem above is a pleasant city, streets of gold, 
    gates of pearl; but we must travel through a dirty road to it, through many 
    reproaches and sufferings. Acts 14:22. We must enter into glory as Christ 
    did; who first <i>suffered </i>shame and death—and then was <i>exalted </i>
    to sit at God's right hand.

    Though, as man, he was made a little lower than the angels—yet as the human 
    nature is united to the divine, and is at God's right hand—so the human 
    nature is above the angels. If God has so dignified our nature, what a shame 
    is it that we should debase it! God has exalted the human nature above the 
    angels, and the drunkard debases the human nature below the beasts!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ being exalted at God's right hand, the key of 
    government is laid upon his shoulders; he governs all the affairs of the 
    world for his own glory.</p></b></font> Do you think that when Christ is so 
    highly advanced, and has all power in heaven and earth in his hand, he will 
    not take care of his elect, and turn the most astonishing providences to the 
    good of his church? In a clock, the wheels move contrary one to another—but 
    all make the clock strike. Just so, Christ being at his Father's right hand, 
    will make the most contrary providences tend to the salvation of his church.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ being at God's right hand, we may be assured 
    he has now finished the work of man's redemption.</p></b></font> "This man, 
    after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right 
    hand of God." If Christ had not fully expiated sin, and satisfied God's law, 
    he would not have sat down at God's right hand—but had still lain in the 
    grave; but now he is exalted to glory; which is an evident token that he has 
    done and suffered all that was required of him, for working out our 
    redemption.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Though Jesus Christ is so highly exalted in

    to places of honor, forget their friends; as the chief butler, when restored 
    to his place at court, forgot poor Joseph in prison. But it is not so with 
    Christ; though exalted to such glory in <i>heaven</i>, he is not unmindful 
    of his saints on <i>earth</i>. Our high priest has all the names and needs 
    of his people written upon his breast-plate. Are you tempted? Though Christ 
    is in glory, he knows how to pity and support you. "For we do not have a 
    high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one 
    who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin." 
    Hebrews 4:15. Do you mourn for sin? Christ, though in a glorified 
    state—hears your sighs, and bottles your tears!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Christ being exalted at God's right hand is for the 
    comfort of believers—that they will one day be exalted to that place of 
    glory where he is!</p></b></font> Christ's exaltation is our exaltation. He has 
    prayed for this. "Father, I will that all those, whom you have given me, be 
    with me where I am." "There are many rooms in my Father's home, and I am 
    going to prepare a place for you. If this were not so, I would tell you 
    plainly. When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will 
    always be with me where I am." John 14:2-3. Christ is called the <i>head</i>, 
    and the church is called the <i>body</i>. Eph 1:22, 23. The <i>head </i>
    being exalted to honor, the mystic<i> body</i> shall be exalted also. As 
    surely as Christ is exalted far above all heavens—so surely will he instate 
    believers in all that glory with which his human nature is adorned. "I have 
    given them the glory you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are." John 
    17:22. As he here puts his <i>grace </i>upon the saints, so shortly will he 
    put his <i>glory </i>upon them!
<p align="justify">This is comfort for the poorest Christian. Perhaps you 
    have scarcely a house to put your head in—yet you may look up to heaven, and 
    say, "There is my house, there is my country; I have already taken 
    possession of heaven in my head, Christ! He sits there, and it will not be 
    long before I shall sit there with him; he is upon the throne of glory, and 
    I have his word for it—I shall sit upon the throne with him" "To him who 
    overcomes, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I

    Our <i>bodies </i>are the temples of the Holy Spirit, our tongues must be

    living holy lives. This is true true religion—when men strive to live 
    blameless lives. Not all the doxologies and prayers in the world so exalt

    8. Christ The REDEEMER</p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Question 30: How does the Spirit apply the redemption 
    purchased by Christ to us?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: The Spirit applies to us the redemption purchased 
    by Christ by working faith in us, and thereby uniting us to Christ in our 
    effectual calling.</p>
<p align="justify">In this answer, there are two things. It is <b>implied
    </b>that <i>Christ is the glorious purchaser of our redemption</i>, in the 
    words, "The redemption purchased by Christ". And it is <b>declared </b>that
    <i>the Spirit applies to us this purchased redemption</i>, by working in us 
    faith, etc.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The thing implied is—that Jesus Christ is the glorious 
    purchaser of our redemption. </p></b></font>The doctrine of redemption by Jesus 
    Christ is a glorious doctrine; it is the marrow and quintessence of the 
    gospel, in which all a Christian's comfort lies. Great was the work of <i>
    creation</i>—but greater the work of <i>redemption</i>; it cost more to 
    redeem us than to make us. In <i>creation</i>, there was but the speaking of 
    a word; in <i>redemption</i>, there was the shedding of blood. The creation 
    was but the work of God's fingers. Psalm 8:3. Redemption is the work of his 
    arm. Luke 1:51. 
<p align="justify">"Having obtained eternal redemption for us." Heb 9:12. 
    Christ's purchasing redemption for us implies that our sins mortgaged and 
    sold us. Had there not been some kind of mortgaging there had been no need 
    of redemption. When we were thus mortgaged, and sold by sin, Christ 
    purchased our redemption. He had the best right to redeem us, for he is our 
    kinsman. The Hebrew word for Redeemer, <i>Goel</i>, signifies a kinsman, one 
    who is near in blood. In the old law the nearest kinsman was to redeem his 
    brother's land. Ruth 4:4. Thus Christ being near akin to us, "Flesh of our 
    flesh," is the fittest to redeem us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">How does Christ redeem us?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">By his own precious blood. "In whom we have redemption 
    through his blood." Among the Romans, he was said to redeem another, who 
    laid down a price equivalent for the ransom of the prisoner. In this sense 
    Christ is a Redeemer; he has paid a price. Never was such a price paid to 
    ransom prisoners. "You are bought with a price; and this price was his own 
    blood." So, in the text, "by his own blood he entered in once into the holy 
    place, having obtained eternal redemption for us." This blood being the 
    blood of that person who was God as well as man, is a price sufficient for 
    the ransom of millions.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">From what does Christ redeem us?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">From sin. To be redeemed from <i>slavery </i>is a great 
    mercy—but it is infinitely more to be redeemed from <i>sin</i>. There is 
    nothing that can hurt the soul but sin. Affliction cannot hurt it, it often 
    makes it better, as the furnace makes gold the purer; but it is sin that 
    damnifies. Now, Christ redeems us from sin. "Now, once in the end of the 
    world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."</p>
<p align="justify">But how are we redeemed from sin? Do we not see 
    corruption stirring in the regenerate? Do we not see much pride and 
    unmortified passion?</p>
<p align="justify">Redemption is either <i>begun</i>—or <i>perfect</i>. Sin 
    cannot stand with a <i>perfect </i>redemption; but here on earth, redemption 
    is only <i>begun</i>, and sin may stand with an imperfect redemption. There 
    may be some darkness in the air at the sun's first rising—but not when the 
    sun is at the full meridian. While our redemption is but begun, there may be 
    sin; but not when it is perfect in glory.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In what sense has Christ redeemed justified people from 
    sin?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) A justified person is redeemed from the <b>guilt </b>
    of sin—though not the <i>stain </i>of sin. Guilt is the binding a person 
    over to punishment. Now, Christ has redeemed a justified person from the 
    guilt of sin; he has discharged his debts. Christ says to God's justice, as 
    Paul to Philemon, "If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, 
    charge that to my account." Verse 18.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A justified person is redeemed from the <b>power </b>
    and dominion of sin—though not from the <i>presence </i>of sin. Sin may may 
    rage in a child of God—but not reign. <i>Lust </i>raged in David, and <i>
    fear </i>in Peter—but it did not reign; they recovered themselves by 
    repentance. "Sin shall not have dominion over you." Rom 6:14. Sin lives in a 
    child of God—but is deposed from the throne; it lives not as a king—but a 
    captive.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A justified person is redeemed from the <b>curse </b>
    due to sin. "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a 
    curse for us." Gal 3:13. Christ said to his Father, as Rebecca to Jacob, 
    "Upon me, upon me be the curse; let the blessing be upon them—but upon me be 
    the curse." And now, there is no condemnation to believers. "Therefore, 
    there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." Romans 8:1.</p>
<p align="justify">An unbeliever has a double condemnation; one from the law 
    which he has transgressed, and the other from the gospel which he has 
    despised. But Christ has redeemed the believer from this malediction, he has 
    set him outside of the power of hell and damnation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To what has Christ redeemed us?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Christ has redeemed us to a glorious inheritance. "For 
    God has reserved a priceless inheritance for his children. It is kept in 
    heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay!" 1 
    Peter 1:4.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Christ has redeemed us to an <b>inheritance</b>. 
    Christ has not only redeemed us out of prison—but he has redeemed us to a 
    state of happiness, to an inheritance. Heaven is not a lease which soon 
    expires—but an inheritance; and a glorious inheritance; called an 
    inheritance in light. Col 1:12. Light adorns and gilds the world. What would 
    the world be without light—but a prison? The heavenly inheritance is 
    irradiated with light. Christ, as a continual sun, enlightens it with his 
    beams. Rev 21:23.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ has redeemed us to an <b>incorruptible </b>
    inheritance. It does not moulder away or suffer dissolution. Earthly 
    comforts are shadowed out by the <i>tabernacle</i>, which was transient. But 
    heaven is set out by the <i>temple</i>, which was fixed and permanent, built 
    with stone, overlaid with gold. This is the glory of the celestial 
    inheritance; it is incorruptible. Eternity is written upon the frontispiece 
    of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Christ has redeemed us to an <b>undefiled </b>
    inheritance. The Greek word for <i>undefiled, </i>alludes to a precious 
    stone called <i>Amiantus</i>, which cannot be blemished. Such a place is 
    heaven, undefiled, nothing can stain it; there is no sin there to eclipse 
    its purity. For holiness and undefiledness, it is compared to pure gold, and 
    to the sapphire and emerald. Rev 21:19. "The sapphire has a virtue," says 
    Pliny, "to preserve chasteness, the emerald to expel poison." These are the 
    lively emblems of heaven, to show the sanctity of it; no fever of lust; no 
    venom of malice; none but pure virgin spirits inhabit it.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Christ has redeemed us to an <b>unfading </b>
    inheritance. The Greek word is the name of a flower, <i>Amarantus</i>, which 
    keeps fresh and green for a long time. Such is the heavenly inheritance, it 
    does not lose its orient color—but keeps its freshness and greenness to 
    eternity; its beauty never fades away. </p>
<p align="justify">To this glorious inheritance has Christ redeemed the 
    saints; an inheritance which cannot be fully described or set forth by all 
    the lights of heaven, though every star were a sun. And that which is the <i>
    diamond </i>in the ring, the <i>glory </i>of this inheritance—is the eternal 
    sight and fruition of the blessed God! The sight of God will be a most 
    alluring, heart-ravishing object; the king's presence makes the court. "We 
    shall see him as he is!" It is comfortable to see God showing himself 
    through the lattice of an ordinance, to see him in the Word and sacrament. 
    The martyrs thought it comfortable to see him in a prison. Oh then, what 
    will it be to see him in glory, shining ten thousand times brighter than the 
    sun! and not only see him—but enjoy him forever! Faith itself is not able 
    fully to comprehend this reward. All this blessedness has Christ purchased 
    for us, through the redemption of his blood.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Of INSTRUCTION.</p></b></font> 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) See into what a wretched deplorable condition we had 
    brought ourselves by sin! </p></b></font>We had sinned ourselves into slavery, 
    so that we needed Christ to purchase our redemption. Says Cicero, "Slavery 
    is the worst condition." But by sin we are in the worst slavery—slaves to 
    Satan, a merciless tyrant, who sports in the damnation of souls! We were in 
    this deplorable condition, when Christ came to redeem us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) See in this, as in a transparent glass, the love of 
    Christ to the elect. </p></b></font>He came to redeem them; and died 
    intentionally for them. It would be great love for a king to pay a great sum 
    of money to redeem a slave. But if the king should willingly become a 
    prisoner in his stead, and die for his ransom—this would be a matter of 
    astonishment! Jesus Christ has done all this, he has written his love in 
    characters of blood! It would have been much for Christ to speak a good word 
    to his Father for us—but he knew <i>that </i>was not enough to redeem us. 
    Though a word speaking made a world—yet it would not redeem a sinner. 
    "Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of TRIAL.</p></b></font> If Christ came to purchase 
    our redemption, then let us <i>test </i>ourselves—to see whether or not we 
    are the people whom Christ has redeemed from the guilt and curse due to sin. 
    This is a needful trial; for there is only a certain number whom Christ has 
    redeemed. "Oh," say sinners, "Christ is a redeemer, and we shall be saved by 
    him!" Beloved, Christ came not to redeem all, for that would overthrow the 
    decrees of God. <i>Redemption </i>is not as large as <i>creation</i>. I 
    grant there is a sufficiency of merit in Christ's blood to save all; but 
    there is a difference between sufficiency and efficiency. Christ's blood is 
    a sufficient price for all—but it is effectual only to those who believe. A 
    plaster may have a sovereign virtue in it to heal any wound—but it does not 
    heal any, unless applied to the wound. And if it is so, that <i>all </i>have 
    not the benefit of Christ's redemption—but only <i>some</i>—then it is a 
    necessary question to ask our own souls, "Are we in the number of those who 
    are redeemed by Christ, or not?"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">How shall we know that?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Such as are redeemed are RECONCILED to God.</p></b></font> 
    The enmity is taken away. Their <i>judgments </i>approve of God, and their
    <i>wills </i>are inclined to God. Col 1:21. Are they redeemed—who are 
    unreconciled to God, who hate God and his people, who do all they can to 
    disparage holiness? Are they redeemed who are unreconciled to God? Christ 
    has purchased a reprieve for these; but a sinner may have a reprieve, and 
    yet go to hell. John 5:6.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Such as are redeemed by Christ are redeemed from the 
    WORLD.</p></b></font> "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver (or 
    redeem) us from this present evil world." Gal 1:4. Such as are redeemed by 
    Christ—are risen with Christ, Col 3:1. As birds that land upon the ground to 
    pick up a little seed, immediately fly up to heaven again; so the redeemed 
    of the Lord use the world, and take the lawful comforts of it—but their 
    hearts are presently off these things, and they ascend to heaven. They live 
    here—and trade above. Such people as Christ has died for, are "dead to the 
    world." They are dead to its honors, profits, and preferments. What shall we 
    think of those who say they are redeemed of the Lord—and yet are lovers of 
    the world? They are like the tribes who desired to have their portion on 
    this side Canaan. "They mind earthly things." They pull down their souls—to 
    build up an estate. They are not redeemed by Christ—who are not redeemed 
    from the world.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Of COMFORT to such as are redeemed.</p></b></font> 
    You are most blessed—the lot of free grace has fallen upon you! You were 
    once in the devil's prison—but God has freed you from that prison! You were 
    once bound in the chains of sin—but God has begun to beat off your chains, 
    and has freed you from the power of sin, and the curse due to it. What a 
    comfort is this! Is there any consolation in Christ? It is shine. Is there 
    any sweet fruit growing upon the promise? You may gather this sweet fruit. 
    Are there any glorious privileges in the gospel? They are yours— 
    justification, adoption, glorification. Is there any glory in heaven? You 
    shall shortly drink of that river of pleasure. Have you any temporal 
    comforts? These are but a pledge of more. Your meal in the barrel is but a 
    meal by the way, and a pledge of that angels' food which God has prepared 
    for you. How may you be comforted in all worldly afflictions, though your 
    fig-tree does not flourish! Death itself has lost its sting. Death shall 
    carry you to your Redeemer! Do not fear dying, since you cannot be perfectly 
    happy but by dying.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Of EXHORTATION.</p></b></font> Long for the time 
    when you shall have a full and perfect redemption in heaven—an eternal 
    jubilee—when you shall be freed not only from the <i>power </i>but from the
    <i>presence </i>of sin! Here a believer is as a prisoner who has broken 
    prison—but walks with a fetter on his leg. When the banner of glory shall be 
    displayed over you, you shall be as the angels of God! You shall never more 
    have a sinful thought; nor pain nor grief, nor aching head nor unbelieving 
    heart. You shall see Christ's face, and lie forever in his arms! Long for 
    that time, when you shall put off your prison garments, and change your 
    raiment, and put on the embroidered garment of glory! Oh long for it! Yet be 
    content to wait for this full and glorious redemption, when you shall be 
    more happy than you can desire! "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no 
    mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him." 1 
    Corinthians 2:9.
