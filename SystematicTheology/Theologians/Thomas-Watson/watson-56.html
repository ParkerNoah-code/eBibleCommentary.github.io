<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Peace of Christ</font></b></p>
<p align="center">By Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">"I have told you these things, so that <b>in Me you may 
    have peace</b>. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have 
    overcome the world." John 16:33 </p>
<p align="justify">These words were spoken by our blessed Savior not long 
    before His suffering. This chapter is full of spiritual sweetness. This 
    blessed Sun of righteousness, it seems, shone more glorious and brightly, a 
    little before His setting. Our Savior Christ was now about to leave the 
    world and go to His Father. He knew they would be sorrowful because of His 
    sufferings and death. Therefore He endeavors the more to comfort the hearts 
    of His apostles and disciples; and this is the great cordial He gave them 
    before His death, "I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have 
    peace."</p>
<p align="justify">Christ foretold that sufferings would befall His apostles 
    and disciples. "In this world," said He, "you shall have <i>trouble</i>." 
    The Greek word for <i>trouble</i> is a metaphor which alludes to grapes 
    which are squeezed in the winepress, until the blood of the grapes comes 
    out. So, said Christ, "In this world you will have trouble." You shall be 
    put into the winepress and, perhaps, the blood of the grape may be pressed 
    out. Trouble is the saints' bitter drink; it is bitter but it is wholesome. 
    All that God does in afflicting His children is but to make them better, and 
    to purify them and make them white, Daniel 10:12. Is it not far better to 
    swim through the Red Sea of affliction—to heaven; than to swim through the 
    world's perfumed joys and pleasures—to hell and damnation? "In this world," 
    said Christ, "you must expect, and you shall have—trouble!" But Christ, 
    having told of this <i>bitter pill</i>, gives them some <i>sugar of comfort
    </i>to sweeten it and make it go down better. In the words of this text, "I 
    have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace."</p>
<p align="justify">First, here is the <i>dark </i>side of the 
    cloud—"trouble."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, here is the <i>bright </i>side of the cloud—"that 
    in Me you may have peace."</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, The Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Peacemaker, 
    gives His sweet peace to all His people.</p>
<p align="justify">The peace meant here in the text, is <i>spiritual </i>and
    <i>sacred</i>. It is the immediate fruit and product of our justification. 
    Romans 5:1, "Being justified by faith—we have peace with God." This 
    spiritual peace the Lord Jesus procures by His blood, conveys by His Spirit, 
    and maintains by His intercession.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First, this peace is PURCHASED and procured by His blood.
    </p></b></font>It swims to us in the blood of Christ! The justice of God being 
    wronged by us, Jesus Christ laid down His life as a payment price. He paid 
    His blood, for our peace. It is His blood that cements us and reconciles us 
    to God the Father. Colossians 1:20, "Having made peace through the blood of 
    Jesus."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, Christ CONVEYS this blessed peace by His Spirit.
    </p></b></font>He <i>procures </i>it by His merit—and He <i>conveys </i>it by 
    His Spirit, John 16:7. The Lord Jesus left this peace to us as a legacy. And 
    the Spirit is Christ's executor to see that His will is made good and that 
    we should have this peace. And now that God is at peace with us through 
    Christ, conscience is at peace too. If the heavens are quiet and serene, and 
    there is no tempest there or wind blowing, then the sea is calm. So, if the 
    great God is at peace with us, and there is no tempest in His face, then 
    conscience is quiet and all is calm.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, as Christ <i>procures </i>this blessed peace by 
    His blood and <i>conveys </i>it by His Spirit, so He MAINTAINS this peace by 
    His daily intercession.</p></b></font> What saint alive does not sometimes 
    offend God and cause the fury of His anger to rise up in His face? Now when 
    the case is thus, that we offend God and are ready to break His peace, then 
    Jesus Christ stands up as an intercessor and speaks to God the Father on our 
    behalf. And it is His request that God would lay aside His anger and that He 
    would smile upon His people again. Therefore, in Scripture, Christ is called 
    our atonement to make peace, and He is called our Advocate to purchase 
    peace. When we break our peace, Christ pleads our case and makes up this 
    peace again by His intercession, 1 John 3:7.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. </p></b></font>To make some application of this, 
    first, by way of inference, see where we must go for this spiritual peace, 
    which is our consolation in life and death. Go to <i>Christ </i>for it, 
    "That in <i>Me </i>you might have peace."
<p align="justify">Cyprian said, "Peace is in Christ—as sap is in the root 
    of the vine, as water is in the springs." "That in Me you might have peace," 
    said Christ. This blessed peace that Christ gives is worth going to Him for; 
    it is superior to all other peace. Peace in a kingdom is very desirable; 
    peace is everyone's vote. Peace is the very quintessence of earthly 
    blessings, to sit quietly under our vines and fig trees. Surely better, a 
    great deal better—is the sounding of the lute and the violin, than the 
    roaring of the cannon. See what a sweet promise God makes, Isaiah 2:4. He 
    will break their swords into plowshares. All shall be peace. But what is 
    this peace, compared to the holy peace which Christ gives to His people? 
    This peace our Savior gives has these two properties or qualifications, it 
    is an emboldening peace and it is a lasting peace.</p>
<p align="justify">It is an <b>emboldening </b>peace. Friends that are at 
    peace use a kind of freedom and boldness one with another. So we, having 
    peace through Christ's blood conveyed by His Spirit, may be bold to make use 
    of God's promises. There is never a promise in the Bible but a believer may 
    pluck a leaf from, and be at peace with God through Christ. We may now use a 
    holy boldness in prayer. We may come to God as children to their father, 
    Hebrews 4:16. Let us come with boldness to the throne of grace. God is our 
    Father, and He, being at peace with us, will not deny anything that may 
    conduce to our real good. This may make us come with boldness to the mercy 
    seat. That's the first property. It is an emboldening peace.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ's peace, as it is an emboldening peace, so it is 
    also a <b>lasting </b>peace. Here is an eternal peace. All earthly peace, to 
    speak properly, is a <i>truce </i>rather than a peace. A truce is but for a 
    small time and it ends, yes—but this peace that Christ gives is forever. 
    Once in Christ—forever in Christ. Once justified—forever justified. Here is 
    a lasting peace. Isaiah 54:10, "The covenant of my peace shall not be 
    removed, says the Lord." The peace of a believer is but <i>begun </i>here in 
    this life; it is <i>perfected </i>in the kingdom of heaven. Isaiah 57:2, "He 
    shall enter into peace."</p>
<p align="justify">Here is a godly man's privilege. When he dies, he dies in 
    peace; and as soon as he is dead—he enters into peace. That is, he shall go 
    to the Jerusalem above, that city of peace. Here the saints' peace is but 
    begun; it is but in the seed, there it shall be in the flower. Here it is 
    but in its infancy; there it shall be in its full growth. That's the first. 
    See to what coast you must trade for this peace. Go to Christ for it. "That 
    in Me you might have peace."</p>
<p align="justify">Second, see what a sad condition all wicked men are in 
    who live and die in their sins. They have nothing to do with peace. What! 
    Shall they have peace who make war with heaven and persecute Christ in His 
    members? Shall they have peace who deride and grieve the Spirit of God, 
    whose very office it is to drop peace into the conscience? What, a sinner to 
    have peace? 2 Kings 9:22, "What peace, so long as the whoredoms of your 
    mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many!" A wicked man is a worker of 
    iniquity. As a man works at his shop, so he works at the trade of sin; and 
    what has he to do with peace? And how deplorable is his case! Isaiah 57:21, 
    "There is no peace to the wicked, says my God." And if God says it, he knows 
    it to be true.</p>
<p align="justify">The wicked may perhaps delude themselves and presume 
    that, though they go on in sin, they shall have peace. But to undeceive 
    them, turn to one Scripture, Deuteronomy 29:19-20, "And it come to pass when 
    he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, 
    saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart. 
    . . . The Lord will not spare him—but then the anger of the Lord and His 
    jealousy shall smoke against that man."</p>
<p align="justify">One may as well think to suck health out of poison—as to 
    suck peace out of sin. Sinners may be quiet and secure for the present—but 
    it will be bitterness in the end! Guilt will sooner or later raise a storm, 
    said Chrysostom. Sin will conjure up the winds and storms into the 
    conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">I have sometimes thought it is with sin as it is with 
    poison. There are some sorts of poison that will lie a great while in the 
    body and not work—but at last it wrings and tortures the bowels—a fit 
    resemblance of sin. Men drink this poison, and they may be quiet a while—but 
    at last, especially at death, then it begins to work and then the poison 
    begins to touch the conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">The great God of heaven and earth has set up His standard 
    and proclaimed open war against every impenitent sinner. And it will not be 
    long, if men go on in sin, before God's cannon bullets will begin to fly. 
    God's wrath may seem like a sleeping lion—but this lion will awake and roar 
    and tear his prey! I will only say this. I confess God may bear long with 
    wicked men and leave them alone. He may bear long with them in respect of 
    punishment, when He does not remit the sin. But it will be sad with the 
    sinner at last, a sad hour at death. The body and soul must part, and Christ 
    and the soul must part. "There is no peace to the wicked, says my God." Can 
    they have peace who strike against the crown and dignity of heaven, who make 
    war with Christ, God, and heaven?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. OF TRIAL.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Let us then search and examine. Have we this secret and 
    sweet peace in our souls flowing from the Lord Jesus? You may know it these 
    three ways, and they are three sure notes which will never fail.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Such as have Christ's peace in their souls are 
    engrafted into Christ.</p></b></font> They are one with Christ. Mark the words 
    of the text, "In Me you shall have peace." First, we must be in Christ 
    before we can have peace from Christ. "In Me." Then comes peace. The graft 
    or branch must first be inoculated into the tree before it receives sap and 
    influence from the tree. We must by faith be inoculated into Christ before 
    we can receive of His fullness.
<p align="justify">The wicked may presume to have peace, and that they shall 
    have peace, and yet they are not acquainted with Christ. Do they think ever 
    to have an interest in Christ's <i>peace</i>—who have no interest in 
    Christ's <i>person</i>? It cannot be! A Christless soul has no more claim to 
    Christ's peace, than a woman can lay claim to a man's estate who was never 
    married to him. "In Me," said Christ. First you must be in Christ and then 
    you shall have peace from Christ—sacred peace. It is a legacy which Christ 
    bequeaths. He gives this legacy not to strangers but to His friends—such as 
    are united to Him.</p>
<p align="justify">The pipe must first be laid to the spring before it 
    receives water from the spring. So we must first by faith be united to 
    Christ, laid to this spring by faith, before we can receive the sweet 
    influences of peace from him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Wherever Christ gives peace to any soul, there He 
    always sets up His governing scepter to bear sway in that soul.</p></b></font> A 
    pregnant Scripture for this is Isaiah 9:7, "Of His government and peace 
    there shall be no end." There must be Christ's government set up in the soul 
    before there is peace. Whenever the Lord Jesus comes with an<i> olive branch 
    of peace </i>in His mouth—He always comes with a <i>scepter </i>in His hand. 
    A parallel Scripture for this is Zechariah 6:13. It is a promise of Christ, 
    "He shall sit and rule, and He shall be a priest upon the throne." Observe, 
    Christ as a priest makes peace—but He will be a priest upon the <i>throne</i>. 
    That is, He will bring the heart, where He gives peace, into a full 
    subjection to His laws. He will be a priest upon His throne.
<p align="justify">Now, let us examine. Have we given subjection to Christ 
    Jesus? Do we submit to His blessed laws? Does Christ sit and rule in our 
    hearts as a priest upon His throne? Then all is well. There are many people 
    who would have Christ to speak peace to them—but they will not allow Him to 
    rule. They would have His <i>olive branch </i>but they will not endure His
    <i>scepter</i>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If Christ has given us this blessed peace, then we 
    shall know it by this, He has made us to be of a meek, quiet, and peaceable 
    disposition.</p></b></font> Wherever Christ gives His peace—He makes the heart 
    to be peaceable. Isaiah 11:6, "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb; the 
    leopard shall lie down with the kid." That is, after grace is brought into a 
    man's heart, and Christ has given him peace, this man becomes of a peaceable 
    and quiet disposition. Now, "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb." The 
    fierceness of the wolf shall be turned into the meekness of the lamb.
<p align="justify">Bernard, that godly man, was a man of a peaceable spirit. 
    And any time someone fell out with him he would say, "I will be at peace 
    with you, though you go on in trouble." Such turbulent spirits that are 
    troublers of the common peace are like the salamander which lives in the 
    fire of broils and of contention; and they love to live in this fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Surely, where Christ gives this peace, it makes men of a 
    peaceable spirit. It turns the briar into a myrtle tree. So by this we may 
    know whether Christ has given us this peace or not.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. </p></b></font>And here I will turn myself to such as 
    are acquainted with Christ and this blessed peace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, have you this blessed peace from Christ? Then be 
    not overly troubled about the afflictions and encumbrances that are 
    incidental to this present life. </p></b></font>It is true, our lives are full 
    of vicissitudes and troubles. It will be so. He who does not expect some 
    trouble, must go out of the world. Fear and grief are the two constant 
    companions of man's life. You may as well separate weight from lead, or 
    moisture from the air—as trouble from the life of man. Does not the text 
    say, "In the world you shall have trouble"?
<p align="justify">But here is that which may sweeten the troubles of God's 
    people. Christ gives peace. Here is an antidote against your fears and 
    troubles. And there is no antidote, like a Scripture antidote. Christ said, 
    "That in Me you might have peace." This is a glorious peace indeed. It is a 
    peace that will hold out in a storm and tempest. It turns a prison into a 
    paradise. It turns our mourning into music. It turns our sighs into songs 
    and triumphs. That holy man dated his letter thus, "Written from the 
    pleasant garden of the prison."</p>
<p align="justify">David was Christ-prepared. Though the times were ever so 
    stormy—he would lie down in peace. Psalm 4:8, "I will lay me down in peace." 
    It was a very tempestuous time. David was fleeing from his son Absalom. Now, 
    said David, "I will lay me down in peace." If Jesus Christ has given us this 
    peace, this will give light to the soul when the clouds gather and you are 
    tossing upon the waters of affliction.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, if Christ has given you a well-grounded peace, 
    oh! be thankful for this great gift.</p></b></font> No rhetoric, no tongue of 
    angels can set it forth in all its glory. Peace of soul makes thankful music 
    in a Christian. Though there are never so many discouragements in the 
    world—yet he enjoys harmony in his own soul. This inward peace is the best 
    music. That you may be thankful for this peace, consider how sad it is to 
    lack this peace because this is the contrary of it. I argue thus:
<p align="justify">If the devil and horror of conscience are so dreadful, 
    then certainly inward peace of conscience flowing from Christ must be very 
    sweet. To have conscience vex and fury is, as it is well-called, a sharp 
    fury. Spira had that inward horror of soul when he had sinned so that he 
    died with the fear and terror of hell in his soul. He thought judgment less 
    than that. Now if the sting of conscience is so bitter, then the peace of 
    conscience must be sweet.</p>
<p align="justify">Has God set your soul, which was once like a troublesome 
    sea, now to be calm and peaceful? Oh! then sound your harp and violin. 
    Admire this God; sing forth praises and acclamations unto Christ, this 
    blessed Prince of Peace.</p>
<p align="justify">Last, if Christ has spoken peace, if He has dropped this 
    blessed peace into your souls, then let me beseech you that you would be 
    careful not to lose this jewel. Labor to preserve this peace in your souls. 
    Preserve your peace as you would preserve your lives. And to that end:</p>
<p align="justify">1. If you would preserve your peace, take heed of 
    relapses. They are dangerous. Do not tamper any more with sin. Dare not to 
    feed sin in a corner. Sin is the peace-breaker. Psalm 85:8, "The Lord will 
    speak peace to His people." But what follows? "But let them not return again 
    to folly." Let them not return again to their sins any more. There is a 
    great deal of folly in our relapsing from a strict and holy life.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Would you preserve this jewel in your bosoms, this 
    blessed peace? Then make up your accounts with God daily. Frequent reckoning 
    keeps God and conscience friends. Psalm 4:4, "Commune with your own hearts." 
    That is, call yourselves to an account. Make up your account, make them 
    even, see how things stand between God and your souls. Observe whether your 
    affections are lively. Examine your evidences and see if there is no decay 
    in your graces, no loss of first love. Oh! keep the reckoning even, between 
    God and yourself. That's the way to keep your peace.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Walk closely with God every day. Live as under the 
    continual inspection of God's omniscient eye. Live holily. Peace and purity 
    go together. The way to preserve our peace is to preserve our purity. Oh! 
    keep your constant hours every day with God. Turn your closets into temples. 
    Search the Scriptures.<i> The two Testaments are the two lips by which God 
    has spoken. </i>Love the Word. Love prayer. Love the Sabbath. Psalm 119:165, 
    "Great peace have they that love Your law."</p>
<p align="justify">Thus you may sweetly enjoy yourselves—and this jewel of 
    peace will be preserved in your bosoms.</p>
