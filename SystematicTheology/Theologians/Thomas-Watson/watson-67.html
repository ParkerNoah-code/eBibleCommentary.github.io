<p align="center">ORIGINAL SIN</p>
</b></font>
<p align="center">Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
<b>Question 16: Did all mankind fall in Adam's first transgression?</b></p>

<p align="justify">Answer: The covenant being made with Adam, not only for 
      himself—but for his posterity, all mankind descending from him, by 
      ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him in his first 
      transgression.</p>
<p align="justify">"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one 
      man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because 
      all sinned." Romans 5:12 </p>
<p align="justify">Adam being a representative person, while he stood, we 
      stood; when he fell, we fell, We sinned in Adam; so it is in the text, "In 
      whom all have sinned."</p>
<p align="justify">Adam was the head of mankind, and being guilty, we are 
      guilty, as the children of a traitor have their blood stained. "All of 
      us," says Augustine, "sinned in Adam, because we were part of Adam."</p>
<p align="justify">If when Adam fell, all mankind fell with him; why, when 
      one angel fell, did not all fall?</p>
<p align="justify">The case is not the same. The angels had no relation to 
      one another. They are called morning-stars; the stars have no dependence 
      one upon another; but it was otherwise with us, we were in Adam's loins; 
      as a child is a branch of the parent, we were part of Adam; therefore when 
      he sinned, we sinned.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">How is Adam's sin made ours?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By <b>imputation</b>. The Pelagians of old held, 
      that Adam's transgression is hurtful to posterity by <i>imitation </i>
      only, not by <i>imputation</i>. But the text, "In whom all have sinned," 
      confutes that.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Adam's sin is ours by <b>propagation</b>. Not only 
      is the guilt of Adam's sin imputed to us—but the depravity and corruption 
      of his nature is transmitted to us, as poison is carried from the fountain 
      to the cistern. This is that which we call original sin. "In sin did my 
      mother conceive me." Psalm 51:5. Adam's leprosy cleaves to us, as Naaman's 
      leprosy did to Gehazi. 2 Kings 5:27. This original sin is called,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The "old man." Ephesians 4:22. It is said to be 
      the old man, not that it is weak, as old men are—but for its long 
      standing, and for its deformity. In old age the fair blossoms of beauty 
      fall; so original sin is the old man, because it has withered our beauty, 
      and made us deformed in God's eye.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Original sin is called "the law of sin." Romans 
      7:25 Original sin has the power of a law which binds the subject to 
      allegiance. Men must needs do what sin will have them, when they have both 
      the <i>love </i>of sin to draw them, and the <i>law </i>of sin to force 
      them.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. In original sin there is something privative, and 
      something positive.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">[1] Something <b>privative</b>. The lack of that 
      righteousness which should be ours. We have lost that excellent 
      quintessential frame of soul which once we had. Sin has cut the lock of 
      original purity, where our strength lay.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] Something <b>positive</b>. Original sin has 
      contaminated and defiled our virgin nature. Original sin has poisoned the 
      spring of our nature, it has turned beauty into leprosy; it has turned the 
      azure brightness of our souls, into midnight darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">Original sin has become natural to us. A man by nature 
      cannot but sin; though there were no devil to tempt, no bad examples to 
      imitate—yet there is such an innate principle in him that he cannot 
      forbear sinning. 2 Peter 2:14. We cannot cease to sin, as a horse that is 
      lame, cannot walk without halting. <b>In original sin there is,</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>(1.) An aversion from good. </b>Man has a desire to 
      be happy—yet opposes that which would promote his happiness. He has a 
      disgust of holiness, he hates to be reformed. Since we fell from God, we 
      have no mind to return to him.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>(2.) A propensity to evil.</b> If, as the Pelagians 
      say, there is so much goodness in us since the fall, why is there not as 
      much natural proneness to good as there is to evil? Our experience tells 
      us, that the natural bias of the soul, is to that which is bad. The very 
      heathens by the light of nature saw this. Hierocles the philosopher said, 
      "it is grafted in us by nature to sin." Men roll sin as honey under their 
      tongue. "They drink iniquity as water," Job 15:16. Like a person who 
      thirsts for drink, and is not satisfied; they have a kind of drought on 
      them, they thirst for sin. Though they are tired out in committing sin—yet 
      they sin. "Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to 
      sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual 
      lust for more." Ephesians 4:19. "They weary themselves to commit 
      iniquity"; as a man who follows his game while he is weary—yet delights in 
      it, and cannot leave it off. Jeremiah 9:5. Though God has set so many 
      flaming swords in the way to stop men in their sin—yet they go on in it; 
      which all shows what a strong appetite they have to the forbidden fruit.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. That we may further see the nature of original sin, 
      consider,</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[1] The UNIVERSALITY of it.
      </b></font>It has, as poison, diffused itself into all the parts and 
      powers of the soul. "The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is 
      faint." Isaiah 1:5. Like a sick patient, that has no part sound, his liver 
      is swelled, his feet are gangrened, his lungs are withered; such infected, 
      gangrened souls have we, until Christ, who has made a medicine of his 
      blood, cures us.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>(1.) Original sin has depraved 
      the intellectual part—the MIND.</b></font> As in the creation "darkness 
      was upon the face of the deep," so it is with the understanding; darkness 
      is upon the face of this deep. As there is salt in every drop of the sea, 
      bitterness in every branch of wormwood, so there is sin in every faculty. 
      The mind is darkened, we <i>know </i>little of God. Ever since Adam ate of 
      the tree of knowledge, and his eyes were opened—we lost our eye-sight! 
      Besides <b>ignorance </b>in the mind, there is <b>error </b>and <b>mistake</b>; 
      we do not judge rightly of things, we put bitter for sweet, and sweet for 
      bitter. Isa 5:20. Besides this, there is much pride, disdainfulness and 
      prejudice, and many fleshly reasonings. "How long shall your vain thoughts 
      lodge within you?" Jeremiah 4:14.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>(2.) Original sin has defiled 
      the HEART. </b></font>The heart is deadly wicked. "The human heart is most 
      deceitful and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?" 
      Jeremiah 17:9. It is a lesser hell. In the heart are legions of lusts, 
      obdurateness, infidelity, hypocrisy, sinful lusts. It boils as the 
      sea—with passion and revenge. "The hearts of men, moreover, are full of 
      evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live." Ecclesiastes 
      9:3. The heart is "the devil's workshop," where all mischief is framed.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>(3.) Original sin has defiled 
      the WILL. </b></font>Contumacy is the seat of rebellion. The sinner 
      crosses God's will, to fulfill his own. "We <i>will </i>burn incense to 
      the queen of heaven." There is a rooted enmity in the will against 
      holiness; it is like an iron sinew, it refuses to bend to God. Where is 
      then, the <i>freedom </i>of the will, when it is so full not only of 
      indisposition—but opposition to what is spiritual?</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>(4.) Original sin has defiled 
      the AFFECTIONS.</b></font> These, as the strings of a violin, are out of 
      tune. They are the lesser wheels, which are strongly carried by the will, 
      the master-wheel. Our affections are set on wrong objects. Our love is set 
      on sin, our joy is set on the creature. Our affections are naturally as a 
      sick man's appetite, who desires things which are noxious and hurtful to 
      him. So we have impure lustings, instead of holy longings.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[2] The ADHESION of original 
      sin. </b></font>It cleaves to us, as blackness to the skin of the 
      Ethiopian, so that we cannot get rid of it. Paul shook off the viper on 
      his hand—but we cannot shake off this inbred corruption. It may be 
      compared to a wild fig-tree growing on a wall, the roots of which are 
      pulled up, and yet there are some fibers of it in the joints of the 
      stonework, which will not be eradicated—but will sprout forth until the 
      wall is pulled in pieces. Original sin comes not, as a lodger, for a 
      night—but as an indweller. "Sin which dwells in me." Romans 7:17.</p>
<p align="justify">It is an evil spirit, which haunts us wherever we go. 
      "The Canaanite would dwell in that land." Josh 17:12.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[3] Original sin retards and 
      hinders us in the exercise of God's worship. </b></font>Whence is "all 
      that dullness and deadness in religion? It is the fruit of original sin. 
      This it is, which rocks us asleep in duty. "The good that I would, I do 
      not." Romans 7:17. Sin is compared to a <b>weight</b>. Hebrews 12:2. A man 
      who has weights tied to his legs cannot run fast. It is like that fish 
      Pliny speaks of, a sea lamprey, which cleaves to the keel of the ship, and 
      hinders its progress when it is under sail.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[4] Original sin, though 
      latent in the soul, and as a spring which runs under ground, often breaks 
      forth unexpectedly.</b></font> Christian, you can not believe that evil 
      which is in your heart, and which will break forth suddenly—if God should 
      leave you. "Is your servant a dog that he should do this monstrous thing?" 
      2 Kings 8:13. Hazael could not believe he had such a root of evil in his 
      heart, that he should rip up pregnant women. "Is your servant a dog?" Yes, 
      and worse than a dog, when that original corruption within is stirred up. 
      If one had come to Peter and said, Peter, within a few hours you will deny 
      Christ, he would have said, "Is your servant a dog?" But alas! Peter did 
      not know his own heart, nor how far that corruption within would prevail 
      upon him. The sea may be calm, and look clear; but when the wind blows—how 
      it rages and foams! So though now your heart seems good—yet, when 
      temptation blows, how may original sin reveal itself, making you foam with 
      lust and passion. Who would have thought to have found <i>adultery </i>in 
      David, and <i>drunkenness </i>in Noah, and <i>cursing </i>in Job? If God 
      leaves a man to himself, how suddenly and scandalously may original sin 
      break forth in the holiest men on the earth!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] Original sin mixes and incorporates itself with our 
      duties and graces. </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>(1.) With our duties. </b>
</font>As the hand which is paralyzed cannot move without shaking—as it 
      lacks some inward strength; so we cannot do any holy action without 
      sinning—as we lack a principle of original righteousness. As whatever the 
      leper touched became unclean; such a leprosy is original sin; it defiles 
      our prayers and tears. We cannot write without blotting. Though I do not 
      say that the holy duties and good works of the regenerate are sins, for 
      that were to reproach the Spirit of Christ, by whom they are wrought; yet 
      this I say—that the best works of the godly have sin cleaving to them. 
      Christ's blood alone, makes atonement for our <i>holy </i>things.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>(2.) With our graces. </b>
</font>There is some unbelief mixed with our faith, some lukewarmness 
      mixed with our zeal, some pride mixed with our humility. As bad lungs 
      cause shortness of breath, so original corruption has infected our hearts, 
      so that our graces breathe very faintly.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[6] Original sin is a vigorous 
      active principle within us.</b></font> It does not lie still—but is ever 
      exciting and stirring us up to evil; it is a very restless inhabitant. 
      "What I hate—that I do!" How came Paul to do so? Original sin irritated 
      and stirred him up to it. Original sin is like quicksilver, always in 
      motion. When we are asleep, sin is awake in the imagination. Original sin 
      sets the <i>head </i>plotting evil, and the <i>hands </i>working it. It 
      has in it, a principle of restless activity; it is like the pulse—ever 
      beating.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[7] Original sin is the cause 
      of all actual sin.</b></font> It is the kindling-wood of sin; it is the 
      womb in which all actual sins are conceived. Hence come murders, 
      adulteries, rapines. Though actual sins may be more <i>scandalous</i>—yet 
      original sin is more <i>heinous</i>; the cause is always more than the 
      effect.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>[8] Original sin is not 
      perfectly cured in this life. </b></font>Though grace does <i>subdue </i>
      sin—yet it does not wholly <i>remove </i>it. Though we are like Christ, 
      having the <i>first </i>fruits of the Spirit—yet we are unlike him, having 
      the remainders of sinful flesh. There are two nations in the womb. 
      Original sin is like that tree, in Daniel 4:23, though the branches and 
      the main body of it were hewn down—yet the stumps and root of the tree 
      were left. Though the Spirit is still weakening and hewing down sin in the 
      godly—yet <i>the stump of original sin is left</i>. It is a sea that will 
      not, in this life, be dried up.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>But why does God leave original corruption in us 
      after regeneration?</b> He could free us from it if he pleased.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He does it to show the power of his grace in the 
      weakest believer. Grace shall prevail against a torrent of corruption. 
      Whence is this? The corruption is ours—but the grace is God's.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God leaves original corruption to make us long 
      after heaven, where there shall be no sin to defile, no devil to tempt. 
      When Elijah was taken up to heaven his mantle dropped off; so, when the 
      angels shall carry us up to heaven, this mantle of sin shall drop off. We 
      shall never more complain of an aching head—or an unbelieving heart.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>Use one: If original sin be 
      propagated to us, and will be inherent in us while we live here, it 
      confutes the Libertines and Quakers, who say they are without sin. </b>
</font>They hold to sinless perfection; they show much pride and 
      ignorance; but we see the seeds of original sin remain in the best. "There 
      is not a just man lives and sins not." And Paul complained of a "body of 
      death." Though grace <i>purifies </i>nature, it does not <i>perfect </i>
      it.</p>
<p align="justify">But does not the apostle say of believers, that their 
      "old man is crucified;" and they are "dead to sin?"</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are dead spiritually. They are dead as to the
      <i>guilt </i>of it; and as to the <i>power </i>of it; the <i>love </i>of 
      sin is crucified.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are dead to sin <i>legally</i>. As a man who 
      is sentenced to death is dead in law, so they are legally dead to sin. 
      There is a sentence of death gone out against sin. It shall die, and drop 
      into the grave; but at the present, sin has its life lengthened out. 
      Nothing but the death of the body can quite free us from the body of this 
      death.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>Use two: Let us lay to heart 
      original sin, and be deeply humbled for it. </b></font>It cleaves to us as 
      a disease, it is an active principle in us, stirring us up to evil. 
      Original sin is worse than all actual sin; the fountain is more than the 
      stream. Some think, as long as they are civil, they are well enough; 
      ay—but the nature is poisoned. A river may have fair streams—but vermin at 
      the bottom. You carry a hell about you, you can do nothing but you defile 
      it; your heart, like muddy ground, defiles the purest water that runs 
      through it. Nay, though you are regenerate, there is much of the old man 
      in the new man. Oh how should original sin humble us!</p>
<p align="justify">This is one reason God has left original sin in us, 
      because he would have it as a thorn in our side to humble us. As the 
      bishop of Alexandria, after the people had embraced Christianity, 
      destroyed all their idols but one, that the sight of that idol might make 
      them loathe themselves for their former idolatry; so God leaves original 
      sin to pull down the plumes of pride. Under our silver wings of grace, are 
      black feet.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>Use three: Let the sense of 
      this make us daily look up to heaven for help. </b></font>Beg Christ's 
      blood to wash away the <i>guilt </i>of sin, and his Spirit to mortify the
      <i>power </i>of it; beg further degrees of grace. Though grace cannot make 
      sin not to <i>be</i>—yet it makes it not to <i>reign</i>; though grace 
      cannot <i>expel </i>sin, it can <i>repel </i>it. And for our comfort, 
      where grace makes a <i>combat </i>with sin—death shall make a <i>conquest</i> 
      of sin.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>Use four: Let original sin 
      make us walk with continual jealousy and watchfulness over our hearts. </b>
</font>The sin of our nature is like a sleeping lion, the least thing 
      which awakens it, makes it rage. Though the sin of our nature seems quiet, 
      and lies as fire hidden under the embers—yet if it be a little stirred and 
      blown up by a temptation, how quickly may it flame forth into scandalous 
      evils! therefore we need always to walk watchfully. "I say to you 
      all—Watch!" A wandering <i>heart</i>, needs a watchful <i>eye!</i></p>
