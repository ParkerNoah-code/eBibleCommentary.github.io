<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Mystical Temple</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    "The temple of God is holy, and you are that temple." 1 Corinthians 3:17</p>
<p align="justify">It is admirable to observe how the Holy Spirit delights 
    to set forth the <i>spiritual union between Christ and believers </i>by 
    several metaphors. Sometimes this union is shadowed out by the natural union 
    between the <i>head </i>and the members. Christ is called the Head—and 
    believers the body. Sometimes this union is resembled by the <i>marital </i>
    union. Christ is the Husband—and believers the spouse, by virtue of which 
    marriage-union, all Christ's riches go to them.</p>
<p align="justify">In the text, this union is illustrated by the union 
    between the stones in an edifice and the foundation. In the former verses, 
    the Apostle had said that the saints are God's building, verse 9. But here 
    he goes higher and calls them His temple. "The temple of God is holy, and 
    you are that temple." A temple is more than an ordinary building. We must 
    understand this word "temple" by a figure, because a spiritual heart much 
    resembles a temple. Under the law there was </p>
<p align="justify">(1) The outward court of temple where the people stood;
    </p>
<p align="justify">(2) The inner temple into which none but the priests 
    entered.</p>
<p align="justify">In like manner it is with a Christian; there is:</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>outward </i>temple of his <b>body</b>. 1 
    Corinthians 6:19, "Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit." The body is 
    like a temple; the bones may be resembled to the stonework, the blood to the 
    cement, the eyes to the windows, the head to the roof, and the mouth to the 
    door of the temple. What a care we should have to keep our bodies decent, 
    which are the temples of God!</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>inward </i>temple of the <b>soul</b>. This is the 
    holy of holies, where none but Jesus Christ our High Priest must come.</p>
<p align="justify">In the words are two general parts,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The <i>specification </i>of the temple, "<i>you </i>
    are that temple."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The <i>sanctification </i>of the temple, "the temple 
    of God is <i>holy</i>."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. The heart of every believer is God's temple.
    </p></b>2 Corinthians 6:16, "You are the temple of the living God." Temples are 
    held in great veneration. I shall show several analogies and resemblances 
    between a believer's soul and a temple.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. All the materials were fitted for the building of the 
    temple.</p></b></font> The timber was to be sawn, the stones to be hewn and 
    polished, <i>before </i>they were fit to be laid in the temple. So it is in 
    a spiritual sense. By nature, we are not qualified for a temple; we are 
    unhewn and unpolished —not one good thought, not one grace inherent in us. 
    We are so far from preparing ourselves for a temple, that we unfit 
    ourselves. But God, by His mighty power and artifice, fits the heart for a 
    temple. He hews us by His prophets, Hosea 2:5. He cuts and carves us by 
    afflictions, and so makes us fit for a spiritual temple.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The temple was very magnificent.</p></b></font> 1 Kings 
    6:32. It was full of pomp and splendor; all admired it. The Hebrew word for
    <i>temple </i>signifies a <i>palace </i>or <i>royal edifice</i>. The temple 
    was so carved with flowers and embellished with gold—that it dazzled the 
    eyes of beholders. Just so, the soul of a believer is an illustrious temple; 
    not the kings of the earth—but <i>God Himself </i>brings His glory into it. 
    "The king's daughter is all glorious within," Psalm 45:13. A <i>saint in 
    rags </i>carries a temple about him, which is more glorious than the most 
    orient pearls and diamonds that hang on the crowns of princes. Christ never 
    admired the goodly stones of the visible temple—but admired the glory of the 
    spiritual temple. Matthew 15:28, "O woman, great is your faith." The beauty 
    of a saint is inward; the <i>hidden man of the heart </i>is sumptuous and 
    magnificent, 1 Peter 3:4.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The temple was a place set apart for God's peculiar 
    worship. </p></b></font>It was separated from all other places. Just so, a 
    believer's heart is consecrated ground and is set apart for God's service. 
    Psalm 4:3, "The Lord has set apart him who is godly for Himself." A believer 
    is not a common person—but peculiarly devoted to God, Psalm 119:38.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The temple was a place of God's special presence.</p></b></font> 
    The Lord put His name there; He there commanded His blessings. So, in a 
    spiritual heart, God wonderfully manifests His presence. There He gives 
    forth the influences of His grace, the communications of His love. God 
    visits His temple. Oh, the sweet smiles of His face, the whispers of His 
    Spirit in a believer's heart! When a Christian is enlarged in duty, and his 
    heart burns within him—here is God's presence in the temple; yes, His 
    answering by fire!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The temple was adorned with splendid pictures.</p></b></font> 
    So the temple of the heart has God's image in it, Colossians 3:10. This 
    picture is drawn by the pencil of the Holy Spirit. The temple of God is not 
    mortar and stones—but the soul of man bearing God's likeness. This is the 
    lovely picture which adorns the spiritual temple.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The temple had a fire burning on the altar.</p></b></font> 
    Just so, a believer's heart is the altar on which there is a sacred fire 
    still burning. Romans 12:13, "fervent in spirit." The fire of love is never 
    lacking. Psalm 119:97, "O how I love Your law!" Though the <i>flame </i>may 
    go out—yet there are some <i>sparks </i>kept alive. Christ's temple always 
    has holy fire in it. Wicked men have fire of anger and malice burning in 
    them. This is not the fire of the temple—but strange fire kindled from hell! 
    James 3:6.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">7. The temple, being a hallowed place, was to be kept 
    clean.</p></b></font> We read of the cleaning of the temple, 2 Chronicles 29:15. 
    There were porters set at the gates of the temple to keep out any unclean 
    thing, 2 Chronicles 23:3. Thus the temple of the heart must be kept clean. 2 
    Corinthians 7:1, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of flesh and 
    spirit." The <i>dust of sin </i>will be falling into this temple; sweep and 
    wash it by repenting tears. Christ whipped the money-changers out of the 
    temple, John 2:14. To these money-changers I compare the cares of the world; 
    these will possess the heart. Now, get a whip made of the threatenings of 
    the law—and drive them out! The temple of the heart, must not be made a 
    worldly marketplace. We may <i>use </i>the world—but look that it is kept 
    out of the heart. None may come to reside in this temple. but Christ!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1.</p></b></font> Behold the dignity of the saints—they 
    are God's temples! A sanctified heart is God's illustrious temple. Believers 
    are children of God the Father; members of God the Son; temples of God the 
    Holy Spirit. The foolish world despises the saints—but they are honorable. 
    The temple of a devout heart, is Christ's walkway. Christ is in all the 
    world—in regard of His omnipresence; but only in His spiritual temples—in 
    regard of His <i>gracious </i>presence. The heart of a sinner is a 
    wilderness, and God does not care for walking there. We never read that 
    Christ was in a wilderness but once, and that was not a place of delight—but 
    combat. "He was led there to be tempted of the devil," Matthew 4:1. But 
    Christ was often in the temple, Mark 14:49. He esteems His spiritual 
    temples; He walks with delight among His saints. He says of these temples, 
    as of Zion, Psalm 132:14, "This is My rest forever, here will I dwell, for I 
    have desired it."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I shall now show wherein this <i>divine</i> temple of the 
    soul, differs from other temples, and has a transcendent excellency above 
    them.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Other material temples, though of a beautiful 
    structure—yet have no life in them; but a believer is a living temple.</p></b></font> 
    1 Peter 2:5, "You as living stones are built up a spiritual house." 
    Hypocrites make a <i>show </i>of life; they have a <i>name </i>to live—but 
    are dead, Revelation 3:1. They are not <i>temples</i>—but <i>tombs</i>, who 
    have their eyes and hands lifted up to heaven—but have no life. A believer 
    is a living temple; there is the life of faith in him, Habakkuk 2:4. There 
    are no <i>dead stones </i>in a spiritual temple.
<p align="justify">This is a <b>heavenly </b>temple. Other temples are 
    constituted of earthly materials, lead and stone; but the believer is a 
    heavenly temple. His soul was breathed from heaven and that which is in 
    heaven is to be found in him. In heaven there is <i>light</i>, Colossians 
    1:12; so in a saint there is a light of knowledge, Ephesians 5:8. In heaven 
    there is a <i>love</i>, 1 John 4:7; so a saint's heart is a temple of love, 
    John 21:15. He not only serves God—but loves Him. In heaven there is <i>joy</i>, 
    Matthew 25:23, so a saint has joy in believing, Romans 15:13. Thus a 
    Christian is a heavenly temple. There is that in him—which is in heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">He is an <b>everlasting </b>temple. Other temples are of 
    a perishable nature. King Solomon's temple was of a stately structure—but it 
    had not one stone left upon another. There was a temple at Rome which, by 
    reason of its ancient standing, was called <i>eternal</i>—but at last it 
    fell down and was broken. Our material churches and temples in this city 
    have been burnt with fire; but the spiritual temple abides forever. Let 
    death destroy the temple of the body; within a while it shall be raised to 
    greater glory. As for the temple of the soul, it being immaterial, is not 
    capable of corruption. When Xerxes destroyed all the Grecian temples, he 
    caused the beautiful temple of Diana to be preserved. That soul which has 
    the beauty of holiness shining in it shall be preserved to eternity. God 
    will not demolish His own temple; Christ is the <i>Foundation </i>on which 
    this temple is built, 1 Corinthians 3:9. His blood cements all the stones 
    together, and as long as the foundation and cement hold, so long this temple 
    shall last—and that is forever!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. See the difference between the godly and the wicked.</p></b></font> 
    The heart of the godly is a <i>temple</i>; the heart of the wicked is a <i>
    dunghill</i>, "a cage of unclean birds," Revelation 18:2. His <i>mind </i>is 
    the devil's mint; he is continually minting unchaste, impure thoughts; his
    <i>heart </i>is the anvil where he is daily hammering of sin. He is far from 
    being a temple; he is a Sodom wherein are the heavings and boilings of lust. 
    Proverbs 10:20, "The heart of the wicked is little worth." A sinner's heart 
    is a common inn where all who will, may lodge; it is not a temple—but a pest 
    house. He has the plague of the heart. But a godly man's heart is a sacred 
    temple which God highly values, and which He has promised to dwell in and 
    revive, Isaiah 57:15.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. See wherein a great part of the nation's safety lays, 
    namely, in having a store of these spiritual temples.</p></b></font> In ancient 
    times, temples were places of safety. When Adonijah was in fear of his life, 
    he ran to the temple and caught hold on the horns of the altar. Believers 
    are temples; they are the safeguard of a nation. It is the best policy of a 
    magistrate to preserve these living temples. The presence of the godly 
    privileges a land from many judgments which else would befall it. "Hasten!" 
    said the angel to Lot, "Get to Zoar, for I can do nothing until you be come 
    there!" Genesis 19:22. So long as this spiritual temple stood there, Sodom 
    was a privileged place; but when Lot was gone—then came fire and brimstone!
<p align="justify">It is a great mercy to London that, though many of the 
    churches have been burned in the great fire—yet we still have so many 
    spiritual temples standing, in which prayer is made night and day for this 
    city. The saints are England's sanctuaries. God put His name in Solomon's 
    temple—but He puts His Spirit in His living temples, 1 Corinthians 3:16. 
    Were it not for a few believers, the Lord would soon break up house in 
    England and let the fox and wild boar come to devour. David was the <i>atlas
    </i>who helped to bear up church and state. Psalm 75:3, "I bear up the 
    pillars." Believers bear up the trembling pillars of a nation. No sooner 
    were the Christians gotten out of Jerusalem and fled to Pella, than 
    Jerusalem was destroyed. The safety and happiness of a kingdom is in being 
    stored with living temples. The holy seed supports the state, Isaiah 6:13. 
    The throne stands safest, when it joins to the temple.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. If the saints are the temples of God—then how 
    dangerous it is for any to abuse and injure them!</p></b></font> Wicked men 
    reproach the godly, calling them factious and seditious. And now they brand 
    them with a new name "Puritans". But don't you know that the saints are the 
    temples of God? How dare you thus throw dirt on God's temples! 
<p align="justify">Many seem to give great reverence to <i>outward </i>
    temples and churches—but they have no concern for <i>spiritual </i>temples. 
    They consecrate <i>dead </i>temples—but persecute <i>living </i>temples! To 
    injure the people of God—is to do violence to God Himself! The Lord will 
    avenge those who have wronged His living temples. Nero caused the Christians 
    to be devoured by lions. Others, he dipped in tar and set on fire—to be 
    torches. As a just recompense for his cruelty, the afterward cut his own 
    throat. "You are just in sending this judgment, O Holy One, who is and who 
    always was. For your holy people and your prophets have been killed, and 
    their blood was poured out on the earth. So you have given their murderers 
    blood to drink. It is their just reward." Revelation 16:5-6.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2.</p></b></font> Are God's people temples? It reproves 
    such as are careful to beautify the outward temple of their bodies—but not 
    the inward temple of their souls. Pambus wept when he saw a harlot 
    attractively dressing herself with the comb and mirror. The Apostle exhorts 
    us to adorn the inward man, Peter 3:4. Many clothe the body in gold apparel 
    and deck it with pearls and diamonds—but have no regard to deck their souls 
    with the jewels of grace! The soul is to be the place of Christ's residence, 
    the holy of holies; but this temple is not cleansed by repentance, nor 
    adorned with humility. Nay, how many stain their souls with pride and 
    envy—so that they look rather like <i>Satan's synagogue </i>than <i>God's 
    temple!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3.</p></b></font> Let us examine whether we are the 
    temples of God. How shall that be known? I answer, by being made like God.
    <b>All God's temples are made in some measure like Him.
</b>
<p align="justify">1. God is a <font color="#008000"><b>spirit</b></font>. 
    Are we spiritual? How can he say that he is God's temple—who savors the <i>
    earth</i>? Is he a divine temple—who is made only of earth? He is rather a
    <i>mud-hole </i>than a temple!</p>
<p align="justify">2. God is <font color="#008000"><b>pure</b></font>. 
    Purity is as essential to the Godhead, as light is of the essence of the 
    sun. Have we holy and chaste affections? Is the love of sin purged out? Then 
    we are temples because we resemble God. Alas, what shall we say to those who 
    are immersed and steeped in wickedness? They <i>swim in sin </i>as the fish 
    in the water! Do these look like temples of God? Are they like Him? It would 
    be blasphemy to call them God's temples!</p>
<p align="justify">3. God is <font color="#008000"><b>merciful</b></font>. 
    He does good to the unjust as well as the just—as the dew falls on the <i>
    thistle </i>as well as the <i>rose</i>. All God's temples are like Him; they 
    are full of mercy and sympathy. They are still pitying and helping others 
    like the good Samaritan, who poured in oil and wine into the man's wounds, 
    Luke 10:34. What shall we say to those who have no mercy? Their affections 
    are frozen; they cruelly oppress others. Is this to be like God, who is 
    merciful? Shall we call these <i>temples</i>, or rather <i>sepulchers</i>, 
    who swallow up others alive? James 2:13, "He shall have judgment without 
    mercy, who showed no mercy." Well, by this we may evidence whether we are 
    the temples of Jehovah. God makes all His temples like Him; therefore, they 
    are said to be partakers of the divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 4. </p></b></font>EXHORTATION, and it has two branches:
<b><font color="#ff0000">
<p align="justify">1. You who are the temples of God, let me beseech you to 
    take heed of defiling God's temple.</p></font><font color="#008000"> </font></b>
    1 Corinthians 3:17, "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God 
    destroy."
<p align="justify">Do not defile God's temple by <font color="#b07050"><b>
    intermixing with the wicked</b></font>. Bad company is defiling. 1 
    Corinthians 5:9, "I have written you in my letter not to associate with 
    sexually immoral people." The wicked are good for nothing, but to defile 
    God's temple. Their <i>words </i>are defiling, 1 Corinthians 15:33; their <i>
    examples </i>are defiling, Psalm 106:35. It was an abomination by the law to 
    touch any dead things, Leviticus 22:4. He who touched them was unclean. What 
    are saints, who are living temples, doing—<i>touching the dead</i>? 2 
    Corinthians 6:14, "What fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness?" 
    We would be loathe to lie in an house haunted with spirits. Wicked men are 
    haunted with devils, Ephesians 2:3, and shall we have any familiarity with 
    the devil? If we cannot make others better—let not them make us worse.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not defile God's temple by <font color="#b07050"><b>
    immorality</b></font>. This sin defiles both the outward temple—and the 
    inner. It defiles the outward temple of the body and turns it into a 
    brothel. Many desire to have their dead bodies embalmed—but their living 
    bodies are adulterated. Again, immorality pollutes the inner temple of the 
    soul; it turns its azure brightness into sable. The lustful person, Clemens 
    Alexandrinus compares to a <i>centaur </i>which, according to the heathens, 
    was half a man and half a beast. He is a man while reason guides, a beast 
    while lust sways. The Scripture brings in the lustful man <i>neighing </i>as 
    a horse, Jeremiah 5:8. Lust is like a feverish heat, very pernicious. It is 
    better to deny lust—than feed it. Lust pleases the depraved senses; but, as 
    sweet things breed bile, so all the sweet delights in sin will turn to 
    bitter bile. Proverbs 7:23, "Until a dart strikes through his liver." <i>
    Cupid's </i>dart makes way for <i>death's </i>dart!</p>
<p align="justify">There are three Scriptures which should sound a retreat 
    and call off people from their lustful pursuit. Proverbs 22:14, "The mouth 
    of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the Lord's wrath will fall 
    into it!" Ephesians 5:5, "For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure 
    person—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God." 2 Peter 
    2:9-10, "The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the 
    unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, especially those who 
    follow the polluting desires of the flesh." I think such as are not atheists 
    should have their joints loosed and their knees smite one against another 
    when they read this <i>handwriting of God. </i>The fair fruit of beauty has 
    poison in it. Adulterers swim into the Dead Sea at last. The harlots house 
    "leads to death; it is the road to hell," Proverbs 2:18. <i>Who would, for a 
    drop of pleasure, drink a sea of wrath!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Do not defile the temple of God by <font color="#b07050">
<b>error</b></font>. Errors and heresies are as the leprosy which defiles 
    the house, Leviticus 14:39. When I speak of errors, I mean "damnable 
    heresies," 2 Peter 2:1. Such as strike at the core of true religion as: </p>
<p align="justify">(1) Denying the God-head of Christ; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Denying the divinity of Scripture; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Denying original sin; </p>
<p align="justify">(4) Denying actual sin in the regenerate; </p>
<p align="justify">(5) Denying predestination; </p>
<p align="justify">(6) Denying the call of God by the preaching of the Word;
    </p>
<p align="justify">(7) Denying the soul's immortality. </p>
<p align="justify">These are <i>doctrines of devils</i>, I Timothy 4:1, 
    which would root up all true religion. You who are the temples of God, take 
    heed of defiling yourselves with these!</p>
<p align="justify">Among other soul-damning errors which defile God's 
    temples, <b>IDOLATRY </b>is not the least. "Keep yourselves from idols!" 1 
    John 5:21. In the law, God laid claim to the fat of the sacrifice, Leviticus 
    3:3. Just so, all divine worship, which is the fat of the sacrifice, the 
    Lord will have peculiarly reserved for Himself, whereas the idolater gives 
    that to the idol which is due to God. Idolatry is spiritual adultery. 
    Ezekiel 23:37, "With their idols have they committed adultery!" Idolatry 
    opens the sluice to all God's judgments; therefore, the Jews used to say in 
    all the punishments which befell them—there was <i>an ounce of the golden 
    calf </i>in them.</p>
<p align="justify">Our nature is as prone to idolatry—as dry wood is to take 
    fire. This plague is catching. The Jews "made cakes to offer to the Queen of 
    Heaven. And they gave drink offerings to their other idol gods!" Jeremiah 
    7:18. Rather than not worship something, men will worship the devil! 
    Leviticus 17:7, "They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the 
    goat-demons that they have prostituted themselves with." In the Hebrew, it 
    is "to the hairy ones," because the devils appeared to them in the form of 
    satyrs or goats.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all God's people, as they prize their salvation, 
    beware of idolatry! It is remarkable when the Apostle has said, "You are the 
    temple of the living God," he adds presently, "What agreement has the temple 
    of God with idols?" and verse 17, "Come out from among them, and be 
    separate, says the Lord." </p>
<p align="justify">And what is <font color="#0000ff"><b>POPERY, </b></font>
    but Romish idolatry? That God's living temples may not be defiled with 
    idolatry of the church of Rome, I shall show some of the chief teachings in 
    Popery, and anatomize that religion a little. And, when I am done, I think 
    everyone should abhor that <i>cheat of Rome</i>, and say of the papists, as 
    once Jacob did of Simeon and Levi, brethren in evil, Genesis 49:6, "May I 
    never enter their council; may I never join their assembly!"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The first popish doctrine is that the pope is 
    appointed by Christ to be the head of the church, and that he is the <i>
    Vicar of Christ </i>upon earth. </p></b></font>This contradicts Scripture, which 
    call Christ expressly the head of the Church, Colossians 2:19, Ephesians 
    5:23. For the pope to be head would be to make the church monstrous—to have 
    two heads. I read of a beast rising up out of the sea, and the dragon gave 
    him his power and his authority. Revelation 13:1. By the beast I understand 
    Antichrist; and the dragon giving him power, that is, Satan giving power to 
    the pope to exercise his papal greatness. If, then, the pope is the beast, 
    he is very unfit to be the head of the church.

<p align="justify">2. The second popish doctrine is the Mass, which is gross 
    idolatry.</p></b></font> Herein there are two errors:
<p align="justify">The first error of the mass is <font color="#b07050"><b>
    transubstantiation</b></font>. The papist's hold that the <i>host </i>or <i>
    bread </i>in the sacrament, after the words of consecration, is turned into 
    the very body of Christ! This is against reason. A body, having its 
    dimensions, cannot be in several places at once. If Christ's body is locally 
    and physically in heaven, then it cannot be in the bread—but it is in 
    heaven. Acts 3:21, "Whom the heavens must receive until the time of 
    restitution of all things." That the bread is not turned into the body of 
    Christ, I prove thus. If the bread is the very body of Christ—then all who 
    eat the bread in the sacrament receive Christ; but that is not so, for the 
    Apostle said of some, they did "eat and drink their own damnation," 1 
    Corinthians 11:27. The fathers were against this opinion of the corporal 
    presence of Christ in the host. We eat Christ's body, said Cyprian, 
    sacramentally by faith. "This is My body," that is, a <i>sign </i>and <i>
    figure </i>of my body, said Tertullian.</p>
<p align="justify">The second error of the mass is the papist's
    <font color="#b07050"><b>daily offer up Christ by way of sacrifice in the 
    mass</b></font>. This reflects dishonor upon Christ's priestly office—as if 
    His sacrifice on the cross was imperfect. Hebrews 10:12, "This man after He 
    had offered <i>one </i>sacrifice for sins <i>forever</i>, sat down at the 
    right hand of God;" verse 14, "For by one offering He has perfected forever 
    those who are sanctified." Behold the completeness of Christ's sacrifice. He 
    has finished His work, and there remains nothing for us now, but to believe 
    in Him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third popish error is that they hold the 
    Scriptures are not for the common people. </p></b></font>They lock them up in 
    Latin—an unknown language. They make the Scripture a book sealed. Faith 
    comes by knowledge—but they, as Christ said, "take away the key of 
    knowledge," Luke 11:52. If the Bible is searched into by the common people, 
    it is a <i>crime </i>and is brought into the inquisition. God would have the 
    Law read before all Israel in their hearing, Deuteronomy 31:11. Therefore, 
    surely it was not to be in an unknown language. The prince of Rome does as 
    the prince of the air—he <i>blinds </i>men's eyes—and then leads them to 
    execution! 2 Corinthians 4:4.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fourth error in the church of Rome is their 
    doctrine of satisfaction for sin.</p></b></font> They exalt human nature and 
    make it copartner with Christ in Justification. They hold that we, in our 
    own persons, satisfy God's justice by penance, fasting, and good deeds. So 
    said the council of Trent and the Rhemists. But where does the Scripture 
    mention any such thing? Our <i>confession </i>of sin is no satisfaction for 
    sin. If a traitor confesses his guilt, his confession does not satisfy 
    justice for his treason. Our <i>contrition </i>is not satisfaction for sin. 
    If a man is sorry that he owes such a debt, this does not at all satisfy for 
    the debt. God's justice receives no satisfaction, except through Christ. The 
    publican "smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!" 
    Luke 18:13. Here was a confession, a sinner; and contrition, he smote upon 
    his breast—but it was far from satisfaction for his sin; therefore, he cries 
    out for mercy, "God be merciful to me."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A fifth soul-poisoning doctrine in popery is their 
    distinction of <i>mortal </i>and <i>venial </i>sins. </p></b></font><i>Mortal
    </i>sins, they say, such as perjury, adultery, murder—cast us out of God's 
    favor and deserve damnation. But <i>venial </i>sins are such as somewhat 
    displease God—yet do not deserve death—but are of their own nature 
    pardonable. For instance, lust, rash anger, vain thoughts are venial sins. 
    But we affirm, according to Scripture, that there are no venial sins, none 
    of which we can say they do not deserve damnation. Lust is a violation of 
    God's law, therefore, not in its own nature venial. Matthew 5:28, "Whoever 
    looks on a woman to <i>lust </i>after her, has already committed adultery 
    with her in his heart." Christ makes an impure glance of the eye, to be 
    adultery. The least tincture of sin exposes to God's curse, Galatians 3:10. 
    It is true, the greatest sins, through Christ's blood, are pardonable—but 
    none are pardonable in their own nature.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The sixth error in the Romish religion is the doctrine 
    of free-will.</p></b></font> Bellarmine holds that the will is piously inclined, 
    and that a man has an innate power to do good. But Augustine denies this, 
    and I think our own experience may confute it. It is a saying of Chrysostom, 
    "As a ship, when the rudder is broken, is carried up and down in the sea 
    wherever the tempest will, so man, having lost the rudder of free-will, is 
    carried up and down to sin where the devil will." The papists affirm that a 
    man has some seeds and relics of spiritual life, and has power to convert 
    himself. But the Apostle tells us that we are, by nature, without spiritual 
    strength, Romans 5:6. Sin has cut the <i>lock of righteousness </i>where our 
    strength lay. A man cannot of himself know the things of God, 1 Corinthians 
    2:14. He cannot think a good thought, 2 Corinthians 3:5. Nay, there is in 
    the will of man not only <i>impotency </i>but <i>obstinacy</i>; our will is 
    in rebellion against God! Acts 7:51. It is crooked, like a piece of iron 
    that is bent awry. It is only the sweet efficacy of omnipotent grace, which 
    can overcome us. We yield not to God by surrender, but storm. We do not <i>
    lay down </i>our weapons—but they are <i>beaten </i>out of our hands. 
    Whenever God converts, He creates, which is a sufficient confutation of the 
    proud doctrine of freewill. "Man," said Ambrose, "has free-will to <i>sin</i>—but 
    none to <i>conversion</i>."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. The seventh popish error is their <i>indulgences</i>.</p></b></font> 
    They affirm that the pope, as Peter's successor, has power to grant an 
    indulgence to men, by virtue whereof they are set free in the sight of God 
    from the guilt and punishment of sin. This brings <i>grist </i>to the pope's 
    mill. To give a pardon or indulgence is a flower of the crown of heaven 
    alone! Mark 7:2, "Who can forgive sin but God alone?" The indulgence which 
    the <i>pontiff of Rome </i>grants, is a key that opens the door to all vice. 
    For what do the papists care what sins they commit—when they have a license 
    from the pope! Roger Holland, the martyr, who was at first a Catholic and 
    later converted, made this confession before Bonner, "At first," said he, "I 
    was of your popish religion and I made no reckoning of any sin, trusting the 
    priest's absolution; swearing and immorality were no sins with me, because I 
    could have them absolved for money."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. The eighth popish error is their doctrine of <i>
    salvation by personal merit</i>. </p></b></font>They hold that their good works 
    expiate sin and merit mercy. Bellarmine said that a man has right to heaven 
    upon a double title: the one is Christ's merit, and the other his own merit. 
    And he brings that Scripture, 2 Timothy 4:8, "Henceforth is laid up for me a 
    crown of righteousness, which the Lord the just judge shall give me, at that 
    day." His argument is this: If God crowns our good works—then they have 
    merit. I answer, this does not follow. A king may confer a large gratuity 
    not because it is deserved—but because he has a mind to set forth his 
    bounty. God crowns us not for our works sake—but for His name's sake, 
    Ezekiel 20:9.
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But if God, in justice, bestows the crown—then 
    do not our works merit?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. God gives a reward as a just judge; not to the 
    worthiness of our works, but to the worthiness of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. God, in justice, gives a reward not because we 
    have deserved it but because He has promised it. The truth is that God, in 
    free grace, crowns those works in the court of <i>mercy</i>, which He 
    condemns in the court of <i>justice</i>. That good works cannot merit 
    appears thus:</p>
<p align="justify">1. That which merits at God's hands must be a gift, not a 
    debt. If a debtor pays his creditor what he borrowed, he does not merit 
    anything from the creditor. Whatever service we do for God is a due debt; 
    nay, it is but <i>part </i>of the debt. How then can we merit?</p>
<p align="justify">2. He who will merit must give God that which is perfect. 
    But our good works are but <i>shining sins</i>, they are showered with <i>
    pride</i>, tainted with <i>hypocrisy</i>, so that we are far from meriting. 
    I conclude this from Bernard, "Good works are the <i>way </i>to the kingdom, 
    not the <i>cause </i>of it."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. The ninth popish error is their <i>purgatory </i>fire.</p></b></font> 
    There is, said Bellarmine, an infernal place in the earth called <i>
    purgatory </i>in which the souls which were not fully cleansed in this life, 
    are purged there by fire, before they can be received into heaven. <i>
    Purgatory fire </i>the papists make satisfactory for sin; which much 
    derogates from the virtue and benefit of Christ's sufferings, "who Himself 
    has purged our sins," Hebrews 1:3.
<p align="justify">The Scripture nowhere asserts this doctrine of purgatory. 
    It mentions no <i>middle </i>place. The wicked, at death, go immediately to 
    hell. Luke 16:23, "The rich man was buried—and in hell he lift up his eyes 
    in torment." Believers, at death, go immediately to heaven. Luke 23:43, "<i>This 
    day </i>you shall be with Me in paradise." Christ was to be instantly in 
    heaven, and the penitent thief was to be with Christ that very day. So that 
    he was in no such place as purgatory—but went immediately from the cross to 
    paradise. Christ's blood is purgatory in this life, 1 John 1:7. If men are 
    not purged by Christ's blood, there is no purging by fire. Not only the 
    Scripture but the Fathers were against purgatory. We do not read of <i>two 
    fires</i>, said Augustine, only of hell-fire, not purgatory-fire. But this 
    imaginary fire of purgatory, makes for something to sell in the pope's 
    kitchen. For when men are about to make their will, if they leave good sums 
    of money to the pope and his priests—they tell them that they will pray for 
    them that they may be speedily released out of the pains of purgatory!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. The next popish error is their praying to saints and 
    angels.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Their praying to <font color="#b07050"><b>saints</b></font>: 
    The papists pray to several saints for the removal of temporal evils. They 
    pray to St. Apolline to ease their toothache, to St. Petronelle to cure 
    their fevers. They pray to other saints for the removal of spiritual evils. 
    One said, if we pray to the departed saints, they, being stricken with 
    compassion, pray to God for us. But how absurd is this! The saints in heaven 
    do not know our grievances. "Abraham is ignorant of us," Isaiah 63:16. When 
    Elijah was to be taken up to heaven, he said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do 
    for you <i>before </i>I am taken from you," 2 Kings 2:9, clearly implying 
    that there was no place to ask him, after he was gone.</p>
<p align="justify">Their praying to <font color="#b07050"><b>angels</b></font>: 
    They bring that Scripture, Revelation 8:3, "Then another angel with a gold 
    incense burner came and stood at the altar. And a great quantity of incense 
    was given to him to mix with the prayers of God's people, to be offered on 
    the gold altar before the throne." They say, that if the angels pray for 
    us—may we pray to them. I answer, the angel there is to be understood of 
    Christ, the Angel of the covenant, who offers up our prayers and puts His 
    incense on them to perfume them. Just so, Augustine expounds it. Angel 
    worship is prohibited, Colossians 2:9, "Let no man beguile you of your 
    reward in worshiping of angels." And what is praying to them but a part of 
    divine worship?</p>
<p align="justify">They distinguish between mediators of <i>redemption, </i>
    and <i>intercession</i>. They say they pray to Christ only as a mediator of 
    redemption—but to angels as mediators of intercession. To this I answer, 
    Christ is not only a Redeemer but an Advocate 1 John 2:1. He pleads our 
    cause like the advocate for the client. Now, as it is a sin to make any our 
    redeemer, but Christ—so it is a sin to make any our advocate but Christ. 
    Those who pray to angels make them their advocates. That we may not pray to 
    angels, I prove by two Scriptures. The first is Romans 10:14, "How then 
    shall they <i>call </i>on Him in whom they have not <i>believed</i>?" We may 
    not <i>pray </i>to any but whom we <i>believe </i>in. But we may not believe 
    in an angel; therefore, we may not pray to him. The second Scripture is 
    Hebrews 10:19, "Having boldness therefore to enter into the holiest by the 
    blood of Jesus." The argument is this: he only is to be prayed to, by whom 
    we have admission into heaven. By the blood of Jesus alone, we have 
    admission into heaven; therefore, He alone is to be prayed to. When the 
    angels can purchase for me an entrance into glory—then I will pray to 
    them—and not before!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. The next popish error is their image-worship.</p></b></font> 
    Pope Stephen the Third, maintaining images in temples, proclaimed their 
    veneration, and caused the people to burn incense to them. This is contrary 
    to the letter of the commandment, "Do not <i>make </i>idols of any kind. You 
    must never <i>worship </i>or bow down to them." Images are teachers of lies; 
    they represent God in a bodily shape. God said, "Let us make man in Our 
    image," Genesis 1:16. But the papists say, "Let us make God in our image!" 
    When the Lord delivered the Law, the people "heard His words but didn't see 
    His form; there was only a voice," Deuteronomy 4:12. God cannot be pictured 
    by any image. You cannot picture the <i>soul</i>—much less God, Isaiah 
    40:18, "To whom then will you liken God?" The papists tell us they worship 
    God by the image. I answer, if it is absurd to bow down to the picture of a 
    king—when the king himself is present—then much more to bow down to the 
    image when God Himself is present! Jeremiah 23:24, "<i>Do not I fill heaven 
    and earth, </i>says the Lord?"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">12. The next popish error is that they deny that Christ 
    endured the pains of hell in His soul.</p></b></font> They are very rhetorical 
    in setting forth the torments of His body—but they deny the sufferings of 
    His soul. This opinion much derogates from Christ's sufferings, Isaiah 
    53:10, "You shall make His soul an offering for sin." Whatever would lessen 
    Christ's sufferings, would lessen Christ's love to us. Jesus Christ 
    underwent those pains which were equivalent to the pains of hell. He felt 
    the displeasure of the Almighty; He was in a soul-agony when He was 
    deserted. All which aggravates Christ's passion all the more—and declares 
    His compassion to us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">13. The next popish error is their assuming power to 
    themselves to absolve men of their oaths.</p></b></font> Ecclesiastes 5:4, "When 
    you make a vow to God, don’t delay fulfilling it, because He does not 
    delight in fools. Fulfill what you vow." But the papists make nothing of 
    absolving and freeing men from their oaths. They hold that the pope has 
    power to dispense with all vows made to God, and oaths of fidelity to 
    princes. The pope, having <i>Peter's key </i>in his hand, undertakes to 
    unlock men's consciences and loose them from all their obligations. How can 
    that be good doctrine, which teaches men how they may be perjured, yet 
    innocent? You who are the temples of the living God, take heed of defiling 
    yourselves with these popish doctrines. Do not pollute and adulterate your 
    souls by joining the temple of God to the house of demons. 2 Kings 5:18.
<p align="justify">Besides, these soul-poisoning doctrines in popery, I 
    shall show <font color="#0000ff"><b>what a detestable religion it is—where 
    you may see the wrinkled face of the whore of Rome!</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The Romish religion is an UNSCRIPTURAL religion.</p></b></font> 
    The papists cannot say as much, as once the devil said, "<i>It is written</i>." 
    They have not God's Word to show, for what they do. What Scripture have they 
    to show, for their <i>seven sacraments</i>? What Scripture have they to 
    show, for keeping the <i>cup </i>from the people? What Scripture have they 
    to show, for their dirges and pilgrimages, going many miles to visit the <i>
    shrines of saints</i>? The Lord will say to them at last, "Who has required 
    these things at your hand!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The Romish religion is a CARNAL religion.</p></b></font> 
    It consists only of worshippings, cringings, and penance. 1 Corinthians 3:3, 
    "Are you not carnal?" Whereas God will be worshiped in spirit, John 4:24. 
    Living by faith, examining the heart, mortifying sin—these things Catholics 
    are wholly strangers to. Popery is a mere <i>external shell</i>. It is a <i>
    carcass, </i>which has no soul in it.

<p align="justify">3. The Romish religion is an UNEDIFYING religion.</p></b></font> 
    1 Corinthians 14:12, "Let all things be done to edifying." But what edifying 
    is done in their ceremonies? Their candles, flowers; their 'Hail Marys'; 
    their incense, their beads, rings, medals, altar-clothes—what intrinsic 
    goodness can there be in these? They draw the heart <i>from </i>the serious 
    worship of God, causing it to mind <i>superstitious vanities!</i> What are 
    the baptizing of bells, adoring of crucifixes, and sprinkling with ashes—but 
    the deliriums of sick brains? Can these things purify the conscience? What 
    is there in <i>holy water </i>to wash a defiled soul? Will the papist's balm 
    and incense make them a sweet odor to God? Will their lighted candles show 
    them the way to heaven?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The Romish religion is a PROUD religion.</p></b></font> 
    The pope calls himself Peter's successor—but he more truly exceeds him in 
    pomp—than succeeds him in humility. The pope of Rome sets his mitre above 
    all temporal crowns. He calls himself "servant of the servants of God," but 
    he insults princes. He makes them stand barefoot at <i>his holiness' </i>
    gate and hold his stirrup. Pope Alexander the Third trod upon the neck of 
    Frederick the Emperor. The pope causes the monarchs of the earth to become 
    his tributaries.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The Romish religion is an IMMORAL religion.</p></b></font> 
    The papists are not the <i>holy </i>catholic church. At Rome, fornication 
    keeps open shop and is, in some cases, preferred before honorable matrimony. 
    The pope is called <i>his holiness</i>—but his chair is fouled. Pope Plus 
    the Second and Julius the Third were stained with vice. Some of their popes 
    have been guilty of sodomy, as Dr. Rivet relates out of their own writers. 
    Pope John was guilty of selling sacred things and murder.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The Romish religion is a TOOTHLESS religion.</p></b></font> 
    It never hurts Satan. Popery is like a sword with a fine hilt—but has no 
    edge; or like weak medicine which will not work. Some of the popish writers 
    say that the <i>cross </i>is a holy charm or spell against the devil. But I 
    think that it rather <i>invites </i>the devil—than <i>frightens </i>him! 
    Their singing, and their prayers in Latin, is the devil's music. Their <i>
    whipping </i>themselves, will not let out the blood of one sin. There 
    lent-fasts will no more starve the devil, than it does their fat monks.

<p align="justify">7. The Romish religion is a BLOODY religion. </p></b></font>
    The pope does not content himself to have <i>Peter's key </i>in his hand, 
    the power of excommunication—but he gets the <i>civil sword </i>too. That 
    what he cannot defend by strength of argument, he may maintain by force of 
    violence. Popery is propagated by violence. Witness the persecution under 
    Pope <i>Pius </i>the Fourth, where multitudes of Christians were put to 
    death. Witness the many thousands of the Albigenses and Waldenses who were 
    cruelly murdered. Witness the Spanish inquisition, the massacre at Paris. 
    Our own nation has felt the weight of antichrist; they who would not drink 
    in the <i>golden cup of Rome's fornication </i>were forced to drink in the 
    bloody cup of martyrdom! We know the papists are good at <i>fireworks</i>. 
    It is an observation of a learned man that the persecutions under the bishop 
    of Rome have been far greater then those under the emperors of Rome. God 
    forbid we should ever nourish that <i>Italian wolf </i>which has sucked so 
    much blood!

<p align="justify">- They hold that the virgin Mary is to be worshiped; they 
    give her veneration. They call her "the queen of the world", "the ladder of 
    heaven", "the gate of paradise". They say we may appeal from God's court—to 
    the Virgin Mary's court. They affirm that she is at the golden altar in 
    heaven—not only requesting mercy but commanding it. "God has decreed to give 
    nothing without her," said Ozorius the Jesuit. The papists honor the Virgin 
    Mary above Christ, ascribing more to her <i>milk</i>—than His <i>blood!</i> 
    In their doxologies they say, "Praise be to God and the Virgin Mary, and 
    also to Jesus Christ." What Christian ear can endure to hear these

<p align="justify">9. The Romish religion is a RIDICULOUS religion</p></b></font>, 
    more fit to move to laughter, than devotion. What are their adoring of

    They show John the Baptist's ear for a relic in Floride, his forehead in

    person the plagues described in this book. And if anyone removes any of the 
    words of this prophetic book, God will remove that person's share in the 
    tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book." The 
    papists are guilty of this: they take away from Scripture for they blot out 
    the second commandment; and they add to Scripture. They say that Scripture 
    is not perfect; therefore replace it with their traditions, which they hold 
    to be not only <i>equal </i>with Scripture, but <i>superior </i>to it.
<p align="justify">Oh, then, if we are the temples of God, let us not defile 
    ourselves with popery! Let us not receive the mark of the beast—either in 
    our right hand or forehead. For what agreement has the temple of God with 
    idols! It would be worse for us to embrace popery, than for our forefathers. 
    They lived in times of darkness and knew no better; but we, like Jonathan, 
    have tasted the <i>honey of the Gospel </i>and our eyes have been 
    enlightened. Therefore, if we should pollute ourselves with idols, what 
    judgment and fiery indignation might we expect! So much for the first branch 
    of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">2. The second branch of the exhortation is,
    <font color="#ff0000"><b>you who are the temples of God—show it forth</b></font>. 
    Live as temples. Do temple <i>work </i>and study temple <i>purity</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Do temple WORK.</p></b></font> Offer up spiritual sacrifices. 
    In the temple, sacrifices were offered up. You are both temple and priests, 
    1 Peter 2:5. Offer up a <i>threefold sacrifice </i>to God in the temple of 
    your souls.
<p align="justify">First, the sacrifice of <font color="#008000"><b>prayer</b></font>. 
    The temple was a place of prayer, 1 Kings 8:30. Prayer is the pouring out of 
    the soul—and God is delighted with this sacrifice! Proverbs 8:15, "The 
    prayer of the upright is His delight." Prayer is the breathing of God's 
    Spirit within us, Romans 8:26, and is not He delighted with the voice of His 
    own Spirit? Offer up this sacrifice daily!</p>
<p align="justify">Second, as spiritual temples, offer up the sacrifice of a
    <font color="#008000"><b>broken heart</b></font>, Psalm 51:17. This is 
    better then all burnt-offerings. <i>Sighs </i>and <i>groans </i>coming from 
    a heart broken for sin, are like the breaking of the <i>alabaster box of 
    very precious perfume</i>, or like the incense which perfumed the temple.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, as spiritual temples, offer up the sacrifice of
    <font color="#008000"><b>praise</b></font>. Psalm 50:23, "Whoever offers 
    praise, glorifies Me." There was singing and praising God in the temple. The
    <i>heart </i>must be the <i>altar </i>of praise—and the <i>tongue </i>the <i>
    organ</i>. Where should God's high praises be resounded, but in His temples? 
    Does the sun and stars praise God, and shall not the temple much more? God 
    has but little praise in the world; sinners dishonor and blaspheme Him. Oh, 
    you who are the living temples of God—show forth His praise! Read over your 
    receipts of mercy—and be thankful. When mercies descend from God's 
    throne—praises must ascend from His temple! Has not God given you Christ? 
    Has not He enriched and bespangled you with grace? And does not all this 
    call for gratitude? Oh, sound forth the honor of God's name! Be joyful in 
    Him and triumph in His praise. Join with the angels and arch-angels in 
    blessing God. Christians must not be graves to bury God's mercies in—but 
    temples to sound forth His praise.</p>
<p align="justify">Study temple <font color="#008000"><b>purity</b></font>. 
    The temple was very holy. So, Christians, your hearts must be refined and 
    consecrated. "The temple of God is holy, and that is what you are." Then we 
    look like God's temples when this inscription is written upon us:<i> 
    "holiness to the Lord." </i>The temple was overlaid with <i>gold </i>within 
    and without, which a was a type of the spiritual temple; both heart and life 
    must be overlaid with this pure <i>gold of holiness</i>. All the three 
    persons in the Trinity come into the temple of the heart. God the <i>Father
    </i>is said to dwell in the heart, Isaiah 57:15, and God the <i>Son</i>, 
    Ephesians 3:17, and God the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, 2 Timothy 1:14. Shall not 
    that place be kept pure, which is the temple and presence-chamber of the 
    blessed Trinity! Consider: </p>
<p align="justify">Holiness <i>beautifies </i>God's temples. We read that 
    the temple was decked with beautiful stonework, Luke 21:5. Holiness is the 
    adorning of God's spiritual temples with beautiful stonework. Aaron had 
    garments for <i>glory </i>and <i>beauty</i>, Exodus 28. When God's temples 
    are hung with the tapestry of holiness, it is for <i>glory </i>and <i>beauty</i>. 
    What is the glory of God Himself, but holiness? Exodus 15:11, "Glorious in 
    holiness." That which makes the Godhead glorious, must make the temples of 
    God glorious.</p>
<p align="justify">Holiness is the <i>nourisher of a Christian's peace</i>. 
    The holy oil of grace, keeps the lamp of peace burning. Acts 9:31, "The 
    believers were walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the 
    Holy Spirit." Sin bores an hole in the vessel, to let all our joy and peace 
    run out.</p>
<p align="justify">Holiness is that which Satan raises his chief batteries 
    against. He does not envy you of your estate, be as rich as you will. But 
    his spite is at your piety. He would blast the <i>flower of your grace </i>
    and turn God's temple into a den of thieves! Oh, look to your holiness! 
    Fortify that place most—where the devil labors to break in!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 5. </p></b></font>The fifth and last use is for <b>
    comfort </b>to such as are God's spiritual temples. They shall have much of 
    God's company. 2 Corinthians 6:16, "You are the temple of God, as God has 
    said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them." It is no small privilege to 
    have God inhabit His temples. We who at first had Satan to dwell in us, 
    Ephesians 2:2, being made temples of grace—now have God to dwell in us.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <i>How does God dwell in us?</i></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. By His Spirit, 2 Timothy 2:14, "The Holy Spirit, 
    who dwells in us." The Spirit of God dwells in us by His wonderful <i>
    presence </i>and <i>influence</i>. The indwelling of the Spirit carries in 
    it these three privileges:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Spirit of God, being in us, <b>infuses sanctity</b>. 
    Let us be ever so vigilant, corruption will gather in the heart. Now the 
    Spirit, dwelling there, takes part with grace against sin. He enables us to 
    check corruption, and cast filth out of the temple. The Spirit, being in us, 
    makes our heart as a <i>garden </i>for delight; and as a <i>temple </i>for 
    purity. Bernard relates there was a <i>fountain of oil </i>which ran into 
    the temple of Rome. By virtue of the Spirit's indwelling, a fountain of holy 
    oil issues forth and runs in the temple of our hearts. 1 John 2:27, "You 
    have received an anointing from the Holy One."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Spirit of God, dwelling in us as His temples, <b>
    sweetly communicates Himself to us. </b>To dwell with one is an act of 
    communion. God's Spirit dwelling in us, is a Spirit of wisdom and revelation 
    opening the deep mysteries of Christ to us, 1 Corinthians 2:12. He is a 
    spirit of activity, exciting and animating our grace, John 6:63. He is a 
    spirit of magnanimity, firing us with zeal and courage, Acts 4:8. He is a 
    spirit of joy, witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God, 
    Romans 8:16. Such as are not God's temples, have none of the impressions and 
    holy ardors of the Spirit in them; they know not, what communion with God 
    means.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Spirit of God dwelling in us <b>will never wholly 
    leave us. </b>Where one <i>dwells</i>, he is constant. God's Spirit will not 
    totally leave His temple. God's Spirit may withdraw from the soul in respect 
    of His <i>comfortable </i>presence—but not in respect of His <i>gracious </i>
    presence. He is not only a <i>lodger </i>in His temple—but an <i>indweller</i>. 
    He does not only <i>operate, </i>but <i>command</i>. He may <i>work </i>in a 
    reprobate—but He <i>dwells </i>in a believer. Oh, Christian, this is your 
    comfort—if ever the Spirit of God has come savingly into your soul and taken 
    possession of you—He will never leave you altogether! He will ripen grace 
    into perfection. Fear not, of final perishing. That temple can never be 
    demolished by Satan, which has Christ the Cornerstone supporting it—and the 
    blessed Spirit inhabiting it!</p>
<p align="justify">Such as are <i>gracious </i>temples—shall one day be <i>
    glorious </i>temples! Those who are temples of <i>virtue</i>, shall be 
    temples of eternal <i>honor</i>. As God filled the temple with His glory, 1 
    Kings 8:11, so He will, in heaven, manifest His glory in His living temples, 
    in a more precious and illustrious manner.</p>
<p align="justify">If the saints shall be glorious temples—then surely there 
    will be <i>joy </i>in these temples. What a climax of joy will it be, when 
    the everlasting doors of our souls shall be set open, that the King of glory 
    may enter in! Praises to the most High God, shall be eternally sung in the 
    temples of our hearts. It will be the work of heaven—to love God and admire 
    free grace, who has made us temples so richly wrought and embellished with 
    glory, where God Himself will reside forever and display the infinite 
    brightness of His face!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, you saints, lay aside all your despondencies and 
    discontents, and comfort yourselves with the hopes of future eternal 
    happiness! Shall the outward temple of our <i>body </i>be so splendid and 
    magnificent, like Christ's glorious body, Philippians 3:21? Oh, then, how 
    transcendently shining and beautiful shall the inward temple of our <i>soul
    </i>be! What angel can express this! But here I must draw a veil. We shall 
    never fully understand heaven—until we come to heaven!</p>
