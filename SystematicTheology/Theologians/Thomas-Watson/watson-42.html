<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">A Plea for the Godly</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor."</p></i> 
    Proverbs 12:26
<p align="justify">Solomon was a man of renown. He was the world's wonder; 
    he discoursed on trees from the cedar-tree in Lebanon, to the hyssop which 
    springs out of the wall. The Proverbs are profound and holy aphorisms, 
    inspired by the Spirit of God and penned by him who was both a king and a 
    preacher. A great part of this book is to set forth the differences between 
    the godly and the wicked, the happiness of the one and the misery of the 
    other. The text is spoken in the eulogy and commendation of a righteous man:<i> 
    "The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor."</i></p>

<p align="justify">1. I begin with the first word, <b><font color="#008000">
    "righteous"</font>. </b>There is a twofold righteousness:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There is a CIVIL or MORAL righteousness.</p></b></font> He 
    is morally righteous, who is adorned with the <b>moral </b>virtues: 
    prudence, justice, and temperance; who keeps free from breaking penal 
    statutes, and does not dash upon the <i>rock of visible scandal</i>. This 
    righteousness is valid in <i>man's </i>court—but is insufficient to 
    salvation. Under the fair leaves of civility and morality—the <i>worm of 
    unbelief </i>may be hidden. Many a person who is decked with morality, is 
    now descended into hell-fire. A bull may be tied with ribbons and wear a 
    garland on his head—yet go to the slaughter. "He saved us—not by works of 
    righteousness that we had done—but according to His mercy." Titus 3:5
<p align="justify">However, for the good of this age, it were to be wished 
    that there were more <i>moral </i>righteousness to be found in the world.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There is a GOSPEL righteousness,</p></b></font> which is 
    first an IMPUTED righteousness, namely, when Christ's righteousness is made 
    over to us. In Adam, in whom "all have sinned"—we were all criminal persons. 
    Romans 5:12. If the <i>head </i>plots treason, all the <i>body </i>is guilty 
    as well. "But Christ is made to us righteousness," 1 Corinthians 1:30. 
    Indeed, it is only in this righteousness, which we can stand before the 
    justice of God. This is the name whereby He shall be called, "The Lord <i>
    our </i>righteousness," Jeremiah 23:6. This righteousness is a coat without 
    seam, which not only <i>covers </i>but <i>adorns </i>us. This is as truly 
    our righteousness to justify us—as it is Christ's righteousness to bestow.
<p align="justify">There is an IMPARTED righteousness, which is the infusing 
    the seed and habit of grace in the soul, making a person internally holy. 
    And so he is said to be righteous who has a change of heart wrought in him 
    and is transformed by the renewing of his mind, Romans 12:2. Such a one, 
    though he is not <i>another </i>man, yet he is a <i>new </i>man, 2 
    Corinthians 5:17. The <i>faculties </i>are not new but the <i>desires </i>
    and <i>affections </i>are—as the strings of a violin are the same—but the 
    tune is altered.</p>
<p align="justify">Righteousness is <i>extensive </i>in the subject; it has 
    a <i>spreading </i>virtue. "The God of peace sanctify you <i>wholly</i>," 1 
    Thessalonians 5:23. A child of God is regenerate in <i>every </i>part—though 
    but in part.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. "He is more excellent."</p></b></font> Excellency is the 
    ennobling of a person, or a gradual elevation of him above others. The 
    righteous man is more excellent; that is, he is a better man. The word for 
    "excellent", in the Hebrew signifies <i>abundant</i>. It is as if the Spirit 
    of God had said, "The righteous has more abundant <i>worth </i>in him, more 
    intrinsic <i>goodness</i>." 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. "Than his neighbor."</p></b></font> "Neighbor" is not to 
    be taken here strictly for one who lives in a vicinity and is nearly 
    situated; but by <i>neighbor </i>is meant <i>anyone who is unrighteous</i>, 
    and does not have the fear of God before his eyes.
<i>
<p align="justify">"The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor."</p></i> 
    Solomon seems, as it were, to put the righteous and the wicked in a pair of 
    scales; the one weighs as weighty gold; the other weighs lighter than the 
    dust of the balance!
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. He who is <i>truly </i>righteous, is far more 
    excellent than any wicked person in the world. </p></b></font>I say "truly 
    righteous" to exclude the hypocrite who has a <i>form </i>and slight <i>
    tincture </i>of piety—but does not know "the grace of God in truth," 
    Colossians 1:6. He has nothing of religion—but the name; and reputation of 
    true religion often suffers by him. But he who is really righteous, is the 
    excellent person and has a superiority to all others.
<p align="justify">For the illustrating of the proposition, I shall do two 
    things. I shall show:</p>
<p align="justify">First, HOW the righteous man is more excellent.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, WHY the righteous man is more excellent</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. HOW a righteous man is more excellent than another.</p></b></font> 
    This appears three ways in respect of:
<p align="justify">1. What he <i>is.</i></p>

<p align="justify">2. What he <i>has</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">3. What he <i>shall have</i>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A righteous man is more excellent than a wicked man—in 
    respect of what he IS.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He is more richly endued with WISDOM.</p></b></font> He is 
    of a dexterous sagacity, mixing the <i>serpent's cunning </i>with the <i>
    dove's innocence</i>. "The man without the Spirit does not accept the things 
    that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he 
    cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. We who have 
    the Spirit understand these things," 1 Corinthians 2:14-15. As the soul in 
    the eye is the cause why it sees, so the Spirit of God in the mind is the 
    cause why it savingly understands. The anointing of the Holy Spirit is 
    irradiating; it clears a Christian's eyesight. "His anointing teaches you 
    about all things," 1 John 2:27. The saints are compared to wise virgins. 
    Sensualists often have a greater reach in matters of the <i>world—</i>but 
    they have no insight into the deep things of <i>God</i>, 1 Corinthians 2:14. 
    A swine may see an acorn on the ground—but it cannot see a star. David, 
    being divinely illuminated, grew wiser than his teachers, Psalm 119:99. A 
    righteous man is wise:
<p align="justify">(1) To know <b>himself</b>. Take the most keen wit, the 
    most sharp politician who is able to dive into the mysteries of state—yet he 
    is ignorant of his own heart. There are those meanderings and windings, 
    those intrinsic pollutions, which he cannot find out. He dresses himself by 
    the mirror of self-love. He does not see the evil that is in him, nor will 
    he believe it. Hazael could not imagine he could he so bad when he came to 
    be king, 2 Kings 8:13.</p>
<p align="justify">But a spiritually-enlightened soul sees that which the 
    natural man does not see. He sees legions of vain thoughts. He sees how his 
    grace is choked with corruption, his humility is stained with pride, his 
    faith mixed with unbelief. His very pious duties are but <i>shining sins</i>. 
    He sees so much of his deceitful heart, that he dare not trust it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) A righteous man is wise to know <b>Jesus Christ</b>. 
    The natural man hears of Christ by the hearing of the ear—but he does not 
    know Him. "What, is your beloved more than another beloved?" Those who 
    journeyed with Paul heard a voice—but saw no man, Acts 9:7. So the 
    unregenerate person hears the minister set forth Christ as altogether 
    lovely; he hears a voice but sees no man. He does not see Christ's 
    magnificent beauties. Christ is a treasure—but a <i>hidden </i>treasure. But 
    a gracious soul has the veil taken off; he sees the amazing excellencies of 
    Christ. "Unto you therefore who believe—He is precious!" 2 Peter 2:7. His 
    merits, graces, and benefits are precious. A righteous man has Christ's 
    eye-salve to see his tried gold, Revelation 3:18. If a carnal man could see 
    with a spiritual man's eyes, he would wonder at those surpassing beauties in 
    Jesus Christ, which he now makes light of.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) A righteous man is wise to discern the <b>times</b>. 
    The children of Issachar were men who had understanding of the times. The 
    world cries out, "Glorious times!" but a righteous man has an eye of 
    discernment. He can see when the wicked make void God's law and when 
    religion is crucified by those who cry "hosanna" to it. He is wise to keep 
    from the contagion of the times. "These are those who did not defile 
    themselves with women, for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb 
    wherever he goes." Revelation 14:2. A person divinely qualified is wiser 
    than to run himself into snares or go to hell for company; he is wise to 
    salvation. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow 
    His instructions have good insight." Psalm 111:10 </p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A righteous man is of a more excellent BIRTH.</p></b></font> 
    Alexander the Great made himself out to be the son to Jupiter. Every 
    Christian is high-born; he is born of God, and that is more than to come 
    from princes and be of the royal blood. David thought it no small honor to 
    be the king's son-in-law, 1 Samuel 18:18. Oh, what an infinite honor it is, 
    to be regenerated by the Spirit and enrolled among the first-born of heaven! 
    The righteous man derives his pedigree from the Ancient of Days, Daniel 7:9. 
    He is near akin to the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Isaiah 40:31.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A righteous person is of a more excellent BEAUTY.</p></b></font> 
    Worldly beauty is courted by all—but what is it? "Beauty is vain!" Proverbs 
    31:30. The finest features of the body, and the most lovely face—are nothing 
    other than <i>well-colored dirt! </i>But a righteous person has a celestial 
    beauty shining in him. He is embellished with knowledge, love, and meekness, 
    which are of such splendor as to allure the very angels! A godly Christian 
    has some idea and resemblance of that sparkling holiness which is in the 
    Deity. Christ is infinitely taken with the spiritual beauty of His church. 
    "You are beautiful, O my love!" Song of Solomon 6:4. "Turn away your eyes 
    from me—for they have overcome me." verse 5. It is as if Christ had said, 
    "Oh, My spouse, such a resplendent luster is in your countenance that I can 
    hardly bear it. I am wounded with the delightful darts of your beauty!" One 
    eye of a believer draws Christ's heart to it. "You have ravished My heart 
    with one of your eyes!" Song of Solomon 4:9 A saint's beauty never withers; 
    it outlives death. True grace is like colors laid in oil, which cannot be 
    washed off.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A righteous man's THOUGHTS are more excellent.</p></b></font> 
    Thoughts are the firstborn of the soul; sinful thoughts arise out of a bad 
    heart, like sparks out of a furnace. An unsanctified mind, is Satan's 
    work-house. Micah 2:1, "Woe to those who <i>plan iniquity</i>, to those who
    <i>plot evil </i>on their beds!" "The thoughts of the righteous are just," 
    Proverbs 12:5. A righteous man's thoughts have wings, and fly to heaven. 
    "When I awake, I am still with You," Psalm 139:18. God is a saint's 
    treasure—and where should his <i>mind </i>be but upon this treasure? A 
    righteous man thoughts ascend to heaven, as he solaces himself in Jehovah. 
    He contemplates the beauty of holiness, the love of Christ, the felicity of 
    glorified saints. His thoughts are among the cherubim! The soul, while it is 
    musing on Christ, is filled with holy and sweet raptures. It is caught up 
    into paradise. It is in heaven, before its time. "My meditation of Him shall 
    be sweet!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A righteous man's DESIRES are more excellent.</p></b></font> 
    He spreads the sails of his desire to receive the fresh breathings of God's 
    Spirit. I do not deny that a wicked man may have some faint aspirings after 
    the best things. Those deserters of Christ cried, "Lord, give us this bread 
    always," John 6:34. But a righteous man's desires excel.
<p align="justify">He desires Christ for <i>Himself</i>—not only for His 
    jewels—but His beauty; not only as He is a Savior—but as He is the Holy One, 
    Acts 3:14.</p>
<p align="justify">He is unsatisfied without Christ. Neither the richest 
    foods, nor golden chalices filled with sapphires or diamonds—will content 
    him without Christ. As the two Marys were not satisfied with the linen 
    clothes lying in the sepulcher unless they had seen the body of Jesus, so it 
    is not the linen on the communion table or the elements of bread and wine 
    which will satisfy a believer—unless he meets with Christ whom his soul 
    loves. He desires still more of Christ and would be swallowed up in the 
    sweet ocean of His love. Behold here a desire which God Himself has raised 
    in the soul, and He will open the <i>breast of mercy </i>and satisfy it.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A righteous man's DISCOURSE is more excellent.</p></b></font> 
    His tongue is tuned to the language of heaven. What is the discourse of the 
    wicked about? Their wares and shops, like the fish in the gospel, which had 
    a piece of <i>money in its mouth</i>. "He who is of the earth speaks of the 
    earth," John 3:31. And too often, <i>corrupt </i>communication proceeds from 
    the wicked, their mouth being like a sewer where all the filth of the house 
    runs out. These <i>lepers </i>need to have their lips covered.
<p align="justify">Sinners, in their ordinary discourse, bring forth 
    Scripture as the Philistines did Sampson—to make sport; as if the Bible were 
    a foolish jest. It is a saying of Luther, "Whom God has a mind to destroy, 
    He lets them play with Scripture." </p>
<p align="justify">But in this sense the righteous is more excellent. "The 
    tongue of the just is as choice silver," Proverbs 10:20. Gracious words drop 
    as silver from him to the enriching of the souls of others. "The words of a 
    wise man's mouth are gracious," Ecclesiastes 10:12. In the Hebrew it is, 
    "they are grace." His words are not as vinegar to fret others—but as salt to 
    season others, Colossians 4:6. A godly man's mouth is full of heaven. He 
    speaks as if he had already been in heaven. The holy conference of the two 
    disciples going to Emmaus brought Christ into their company. "While they 
    communed together, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them," Luke 24:15. 
    Such savory speeches drop from the holy lips, that God has a notebook to 
    write them down. "Then those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and 
    the Lord listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of 
    remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and 
    loved to think about him," Malachi 3:16. It is reported of Tamerlain (the 
    Mongol conqueror) that he kept a register of the names and good deeds of his 
    soldiers. Just so, God registers the speeches of His people, so that they 
    may not be lost.</p>
<b><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">7. A righteous man is of a more excellent SPIRIT.</p></font>
</b>An excellent spirit was found in Daniel, Daniel 5:12. "My servant Caleb 
    has a different spirit and has followed Me completely," Numbers 14:24. A 
    wicked man has the "spirit of the world," 1 Corinthians 2:12. He is of an 
    atheistic spirit—but a person invested with grace has choiceness of spirit 
    in him. He is of a heavenly, noble, invincible spirit.
<p align="justify">He is of a <b>heavenly </b>spirit; he savors the things 
    of God. A person rich in grace, sets his feet where others set their hearts. 
    He, being clothed with Christ the Son of righteousness and crowned with the 
    graces as glittering stars, has the world under him. The world may have his 
    look—but Christ has his love; he dwells below—but trades in the Jerusalem 
    above. A true saint is taken up about higher matters: getting the love and 
    favor of God. He aspires after glory and immortality; he looks no lower than 
    a heavenly crown; he feeds as the birds of paradise—on the dew of heaven; he 
    is employed about angels' work, lifting up God's name in the world; he is a 
    living organ of God's praise.</p>
<p align="justify">He is of a <b>noble </b>spirit; he has the spirit of an 
    heir of heaven. He scorns anything that is vile and degraded. He can <i>deny
    </i>himself—but not <i>debase </i>himself. He can be humble—but not vile. He 
    does not endorse the sins of any—which would be to wash the devil's face. He 
    cannot prostitute himself to the lusts of men, or flatter to get 
    advancement, Job 32:21. A righteous man abhors to swerve from the truth, to 
    gain secular advantage. It was said of Luther that he cared not for gold; 
    his spirit was more noble than to be bribed with money. A godly man will not 
    purchase his liberty, by ensnaring his conscience. "Others were tortured and 
    refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection." 
    Hebrews 11:35.</p>
<p align="justify">He is of an <b>invincible </b>spirit. He bears 
    afflictions without fainting or fretting, though the archers shoot at him. 
    His bow abides in strength. Such people as lack a principle of grace, faint 
    in the day of adversity; they cannot bear a frown or a reproach. If the 
    bough of a tree is rotten, the least weight hung upon it breaks it. But the 
    righteous has the heart of a lion. He is not startled at the reproaches of 
    the world. He looks upon reproaches for Christ, as badges of honor, 1 Peter 
    4:11. When the Roman Catholics taunted Luther for his apostasy from their 
    church, Luther replied, "I confess I am an apostate from you—but a blessed 
    one; I am such an apostate as a sorcerer is, when he renounces his compact 
    made with the devil and betakes himself to Christ." Grace steels the heart 
    with courage—and fires it with zeal.</p>
<p align="justify">Athanazius was both a loadstone and an adamant rock; a 
    loadstone for the sweetness of his disposition and an adamant rock for the 
    invincibleness of his resolution. When the emperor Valens promised Basil 
    great preferment if he would subscribe to the Arian heresy, Basil responded, 
    "Sir, these speeches are fit to catch little children—but we who are taught 
    by the Spirit are ready to endure a thousand deaths—rather than suffer one 
    word of Scripture to be altered." A righteous man is willing to take the 
    cross for his estate and, with Ignatius, wear Christ's sufferings as a 
    necklace of pearls. "We glory in tribulation," Romans 5:3. "Paul rattled his 
    chain and gloried in it, as a woman who is proud of her jewels!" said 
    Chrysostom. "It is to my loss," said Gordius the martyr, if you abate me 
    anything of my sufferings." Of what heroic and undaunted spirits, were the 
    primitive Christians who could scorn preferments, laugh at imprisonments, 
    snatch up torments as crowns, and whose love to Christ burned hotter than 
    the fire, insomuch that the heathens cried out, "Great is the God of the 
    Christians!"</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">8. The PRAYERS of a righteous man are more excellent. </p></b>
</font>Another may have more <i>elegance </i>in prayer—but he has more <i>
    sincerity</i>. "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the 
    Lord—but the prayer of the upright is His delight," Proverbs 15:8. A 
    sinner's praying is howling, "They do not cry to Me from their hearts; 
    rather, they howl on their beds." Hosea 7:14—but the prayer of a righteous 
    man is music in God's ears. "Let me hear your voice, for your voice is 
    sweet," Song of Solomon 2:14. Maximinius, a persecutor, being on his sick 
    bed, craved the prayers of the godly.
<p align="justify">The excellency of a righteous man's prayer is seen by its
    <i>noble exploits</i>—and by its <i>gracious returns</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(1) By its noble exploits.</p></b> Luther's prayer recovered 
    Theordorus Vitus from death, after the physicians had given him over for 
    dead. The prayer of the righteous has stopped the sun in its course, Joshua 
    10:13. It has divided the waters, Exodus 14:15,21; overcome armies, Exodus 
    17:11; cast out devils, Matthew 17:21; opened prisons, Acts 12:9; shut the
    <i>windows </i>of heaven, James 5:17. Prayer has had power with God, Hosea 
    12:4. The Tyrians tied fast their god Hercules with a golden chain. The 
    great Jehovah is held by the prayers of His people. "I will not let You go 
    until You bless me!" said Jacob, Genesis 32:26.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2) By its gracious return. </p></b>When the <i>tree of the 
    promise </i>is shaken by the <i>hand of prayer</i>, some fruit falls. "When 
    they call on me, I will answer; I will be with them in trouble. I will 
    rescue them and honor them." Psalms 91:15. Prayer is the golden fleet which 
    the saints send out to heaven—which comes home richly laden with mercy. 
    Sometimes God gives His people the <i>same </i>mercy in kind that they pray 
    for. "For this child I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition," 1 
    Samuel 1:27. Sometimes God gives them that which is <i>better </i>than they 
    ask for. They pray for temporal things—and He gives them spiritual 
    blessings! They pray for more <i>health</i>—and He gives them more <i>grace</i>. 
    They desire the <i>venison </i>and, instead of that, He gives them the <i>
    blessing</i>; so He pays them in a better coin. That which makes the prayer 
    of a righteous man so excellent and availing is:
<b>
<p align="justify">First, because his affections are drawn forth strongly in 
    prayer;</p></b> his eyes melt into tears; his heart burns with desire. He is 
    "fervent in spirit," Romans 12:11. It is a metaphor which alludes to water 
    boiling over. A good heart boils over with hot affections in prayer! There 
    may be powder in a gun—when there is no fire. Some may have good matter in 
    prayer—but no fire of affection to discharge it. Prayer without fervency is 
    like wine which has lost the spirits. Without fervency, prayer is not 
    prayer. A righteous man is carried up to heaven, in a fiery chariot of 
    devotion. This holy fervency is caused by the Spirit of God, who both 
    inspires and inflames the saint's prayers, Romans 8:26. The Spirit helps us 
    with sighs and groans. Not only gifts—but groans; and surely the incense of 
    a righteous man's prayer, with the Holy Spirit's fire put to it—must ascend 
    as a sweet perfume to heaven!
<b>
<p align="justify">Second, a righteous man's prayers are so excellent 
    because he sprinkles faith in every prayer.</p></b> "Unto You, O Lord, do I lift 
    up my soul, O my God I <i>trust </i>in You," Psalm 25:1. Faith is the <i>
    breath of prayer</i>. As the body cannot live without breath, so prayer 
    cannot live unless faith breathes in it. Faith is the <i>bullet </i>which is 
    shot in prayer. A believing prayer can obtain anything from God. It is 
    reported of a nobleman of this nation, that the Queen gave him a ring and 
    told him that, when he was in any difficulty, let him send that ring to her 
    and she would assist him. To this ring I compare prayer. When a child of God 
    stands in need of anything, he sends this ring to God, presents it by the <i>
    hand of faith</i>—and has his desires granted!
<b>
<p align="justify">Third, a righteous man's prayers are so excellent because 
    Jesus Christ presents them to His Father.</p></b> Prayer, as it comes from the 
    godly, is mixed with sin—but Christ takes the dross out of their prayers—and 
    presents nothing but pure gold! He dips the prayers of His people in His 
    blood, and mingles them with His sweet incense—and so they are most fragrant 
    and aromatic to God. A weak prayer being laid upon Christ as the altar—the 
    altar sanctifies it. Christ's praying over a saint's prayer, makes it 
    prevalent in respect of his office (as He is a priest), His relation (as He 
    is a Son), and His merit (as He is God). "Therefore he is able to save 
    completely those who come to God through Him, because He always lives to 
    intercede for them!" Hebrews 7:25. "But I have prayed for you that your 
    faith may not fail." Luke 22:32. "The Spirit Himself intercedes for us." 
    Romans 8:26 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">9. The TEARS of a righteous man are more excellent. </p></b>
</font>Holy tears are the precious ointment which distills from the trees of 
    righteousness. Mary Magdalene stood at Christ's feet weeping. Her tears 
    dropped as <i>diamonds </i>from her eyes! The tears of the wicked are good 
    for nothing. They are either carnal (they weep for worldly losses) or 
    spurious (they are more troubled for <i>hell, </i>than <i>sin</i>). Their 
    conscience is in agony. There is water in their eyes—because there is fire 
    in their bones. But the tears of a true penitent are more precious. They 
    drop from the <i>eyes of faith and hope</i>. They are <i>purifying </i>
    tears. The holy mourner weeps out sin. These tears are the wine of angels. 
    They are so precious—that God bottles them! "You keep track of all my 
    sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded 
    each one in your book!" Psalm 56:8. In the Hebrew it is "my tear," to show 
    that God takes notice of <i>every </i>tear. Though holy tears are silent—yet 
    they have a voice. "The Lord has heard the voice of my weeping!" Psalm 6:8 
    Though our tears fall to the earth—yet they reach heaven! Tears dropping 
    from the saints' eyes are as sweet water dropping from the roses.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">10. The LIFE of a righteous man is more excellent for 
    spiritualness and for usefulness.</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First</p></b></font>, the life of a righteous man is more 
    excellent for <font color="#0000ff"><b>spiritualness</b></font>, and that 
    three ways:
<b>
<p align="justify">(1) The life of a righteous man is more excellent for 
    spiritualness—as he lives by a more spiritual RULE than others. </p></b>A sinner 
    either lives by <i>no </i>rule—or by a <i>false </i>rule. He walks according 
    to the course of the world. "You used to live just like the rest of the 
    world, full of sin, obeying Satan, the mighty prince of the power of the 
    air. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey 
    God." Ephesians 2:2. But a righteous man goes by the rule of Scripture, as a 
    well-made dial goes exactly by the sun. God's Word is the oracle he consults 
    with; it is his pillar of fire, or pole-star to direct him. "Your word is a 
    lamp unto my feet," Psalm 119:105. The Word is a divine treatise; it is a 
    revelation of God's mind, to which a pious man conforms both his moral and 
    sacred actions. He will not form his beliefs from church councils or church 
    fathers; nor will he follow the examples of the best men further than they 
    follow the Word.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2) A</p></b> <b>The life of a righteous man is more 
    excellent for spiritualness—as he he lives a life ABOVE others</b>, whereas 
    they live no higher than <i>human reason</i>. The godly man lives by faith. 
    A righteous man moves in a higher sphere. He penetrates the clouds. Moses 
    saw Him who is invisible. <i>Sense </i>and <i>reason </i>are too low in 
    stature to see Christ. Faith does not climb up into the tree as Zaccheus 
    (Luke 19:1-4)—but within the veil, and there sees Jesus. A holy person sends 
    out faith as a spy—to view the land of promise. Faith unties difficulties. 
    "Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed," Romans 4:18. Against all hope 
    of human reason, Abraham believed in hope of the promise. Faith anticipates 
    future things, and makes them present. When God told Abraham what a glorious 
    country He would give him, Abraham looked upon it as if it had been actually 
    done and he had taken possession of it. 
<p align="justify">Faith can live upon God, in the deficiency of visible 
    comforts. "Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the 
    vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though 
    there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will 
    rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior!" Habakkuk 3:17-18. A 
    righteous man believes that if God will save him from hell—He will save him 
    from need; if He will give him a kingdom—He will not deny him daily bread.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(3) The life of a righteous man is more excellent for 
    spiritualness—as he shows forth more of the powers of HOLINESS in his life 
    than others. </p></b>He is a <i>pattern of piety</i>. Aaron, the saint of the 
    Lord, was adorned more by his sanctity—more than his fine linen garments. A 
    moralist may live as a man—but he who is regenerate lives the life of 
    Christ. The Macedonians, on the birthday of Alexander the Great, wore 
    Alexander's picture about their necks set with gold and pearl. So the 
    righteous carry the living picture of Christ in their holy example. They 
    live so devoutly as if they had seen the Lord with bodily eyes!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Second</p></b></font>, the life of a righteous man is more 
    excellent for <font color="#0000ff"><b>usefulness</b></font>. He is a 
    blessing in the midst of the land. He spends and is spent for Christ; yet he 
    would rather wear out—than rust out. The lives of the wicked are <i>
    unprofitable, </i>therefore they are compared to <i>chaff</i>. The lives of 
    the wicked are <i>hurtful, </i>therefore they are compared to <i>thorns</i>. 
    But a righteous man is like the bee or silk-worm, working for the good of 
    others. "It comforts me," said worthy John Jewel, "that I have exhausted 
    myself in the labors of my holy calling." A godly man hangs between these 
    two as a needle between two loadstones: longing to be with Christ in 
    heaven—and loving to serve Him on earth.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1) A righteous man is helpful to the BODIES of others.</p></b> 
    He is a temporal savior. He has one eye shut—to wink at the <i>failings </i>
    of others; and another eye open—to observe their <i>needs</i>. He is like 
    the heavens, diffusing his influence and sending down his silver drops of 
    charity; he is a <i>staff </i>to the lame, and <i>bread </i>to the hungry. 
    He is a golden crutch to support others, when they are falling. As Mary 
    brought her sweet ointments to anoint Christ's body, so a gracious soul 
    brings his ointments of charity to anoint the saints, who are Christ's 
    living <i>body</i>. 
<p align="justify">A godly man judiciously considers how he himself lives 
    upon charity—the earth enriches him with veins of silver and crops of grain. 
    One creature brings him wool, another oil, another silk. Observing every 
    creature conspiring for his good, he studies to lay out himself for the good 
    of others. Faith, if it has no works, is dead, James 2:17. Faith sanctifies 
    works—and works testify of faith. A believer, with one hand, receives 
    Christ's merits; with the other hand he relieves his fellow members. And he 
    not only gives to the necessities of the poor—but gives <i>freely</i>. 
    Charity drops from him as myrrh from the tree. He does not put his alms 
    among his catalog of <i>debts</i>; he is thankful that God has made him in 
    the number of givers—and not receivers.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2) A righteous man is helpful to the SOULS of others.
    </p></b>He who pities his neighbor's <i>ox </i>when it is fallen into a pit—much 
    more pities his neighbor's <i>soul </i>that is falling into hell. He 
    counsels the ignorant, confirms the weak, gathers the wandering, and 
    converts the sinner from the error of his way.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3) A righteous man is helpful to his COUNTRY.</p></b> He 
    stands as a screen between it and the fire of God's wrath. "So He said He 
    would have destroyed them—if Moses His chosen one had not stood before Him 
    in the breach, to turn His wrath away from destroying them." Psalm 106:23. 
    When a breach is made in the wall of a castle, soldiers stand in that breach 
    until the enemy is beaten back. So when the wrath of God was coming against 
    Israel, Moses stood in the breach and, by his prayers, kept if off. The 
    saints are the <i>Atlases—</i>who bear up a nation from sinking. The poets 
    thought that as long as Hector lived, Troy could not be demolished. "I bear 
    up the pillars," Psalm 75:3. Ambrose was called <i>the wall of Italy</i>. 
    Lot, while in Sodom, kept off the fire. "Hasten! escape to Zoar, for I 
    cannot do anything until you get there," Genesis 19:22. A wicked nation is 
    often reprieved—for the sake of the godly. The tares are spared—for the 
    wheat's sake.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">11. The DEATH of a righteous man is more excellent. </p></b>
</font>Death comes with a blessing. "What man is he who lives and shall not 
    see death?" Psalm 89:48. Grace itself gives no charter of exemption from it. 
    An earthen pot, though full of gold, may break. The righteous, who are 
    earthen vessels, though they are filled with the golden graces, are not 
    freed from breaking by death. But their death is precious. 
<p align="justify">Wicked men, when they die, there is no missing them. 
    Their life was scarcely worth a prayer, nor their death worth a tear. The 
    wicked die in their sins, John 8:24. <i>Death to them is but a trap door, to 
    let them into hell. </i>But when a righteous man dies, his sins die with 
    him. The pale face of death looks ruddy, being sprinkled with the blood of 
    the Lamb. When a believer has death in his body, he has Christ in his soul. 
    The day of his death is his ascension day to heaven. The death of a saint is 
    precious to God; the righteous are said to be <i>gathered</i>. A sinner is 
    carried away in a storm, whereas the righteous are gathered, like we gather 
    precious fruit and preserve it. </p>
<p align="justify">So greatly does God value the death of a saint that He 
    makes inquisition for every drop of his blood. His death is precious to the 
    saints who survive him. They follow his hearse weeping, as David did Abner's. 
    Though they know that, when a godly man dies, he is fixed in a higher and 
    more transparent orb, yet they cannot but mourn at the fall of such a star. 
    It is a lamentation when God cuts down the pillars of a land; the great 
    cables and anchors of a ship being gone, there is danger of a shipwreck. It 
    presages a storm coming when God hides His <i>jewels</i>. After Austin's 
    death followed the sacking of Hippo by the Goths and Vandals. After the 
    decease of Paraeus came the destruction of Heidelberg. Hence it is that the 
    saints who are left behind, when they see such as are the glory of a kingdom 
    taken away by a stroke of death, cannot but cry as Elisha did when Elijah 
    was parted from him. "My Father, my Father, the chariot of Israel and tile 
    horsemen thereof", 2 Kings 2:12. The saints living are affected with the 
    loss of the godly, and carry them to their grave with a shower of tears. </p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">12. The DUST of a righteous man is more excellent. </p></b>
</font>When the bodies of the wicked are laid in the grave, there lies a 
    heap of dust to be tumbled into hell. But the dust of a righteous man is 
    part of Christ's mystical Body. The dust of a saint is united to Christ 
    while it is in the grave, and as the dust of believers is now excellent, so 
    it will appear shortly in the sight of men and angels. Emperor Trajan's 
    ashes were honored at Rome, so the ashes of the saints at the resurrection 
    shall be honored when they shall be made like Christ's glorious body in its 
    beauty, strength, agility, and immortality.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    2. A righteous man is more excellent than a wicked man—in respect of what he 
    HAS.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He has a more excellent NAME.</p></b></font> God Himself 
    embalmed Moses' name and set a garland of honor upon him. Joshua 1:2, "Moses 
    My servant is dead." The names of the righteous are registered in the sacred 
    records of Scripture. Proverbs 10:7, "The memory of the just is blessed." 
    Isaiah 65:15 "The wicked leave their name for a curse." How cursed is the 
    name of Judas! What Christian would give his child that name? How odious are 
    the names of Nero, Domitian, and Bonner! When their bodies rot <i>under</i>ground, 
    their names rot <i>above </i>ground. But by faith, the righteous obtained a 
    good report. How renowned was Moses for his meekness, and Cornelius for his 
    alms? Their names send forth a fragrant perfume in the church of God to this 
    day. "The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance," Psalm 112:6. It 
    may be said of a gracious person as once was said of King David, his name 
    was much esteemed. A wicked man may leave a great estate behind; a righteous 
    man leaves a good name.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A righteous man has more excellent COMPANY. </p></b>
</font>He has the fellowship of the <b>saints</b>. "I am companion to all 
    those who fear You," Psalm 119:6. A godly man delights in a companion of his 
    own species. The lamb does not care to be with the wolf. If unawares a godly 
    man comes into the company of the wicked, he fears either <i>pollution </i>
    or <i>scandal</i>. Therefore, he makes haste to get out—as out of an 
    infected house. A righteous man flourishes among the saints. He is joined to 
    Christ's mystical body. "After they were released, they went to their own 
    fellowship," Acts 4:23. 
<p align="justify">A righteous man has fellowship with <b>God</b>. "Our 
    fellowship is with the Father and His Son Jesus," 1 John 1:3. A gracious 
    soul has sweet communion with heaven; he goes to God by prayer and God comes 
    to him by His Spirit. How happy is that person who has the angels to guard 
    him—and God to keep him company!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A righteous man has more excellent PROMISES belonging 
    to him.</p></b></font> What a sinner has is rather by <i>providence, </i>than by 
    virtue of a promise. It is the saints who are called "heirs of the promise;" 
    Hebrews 6:17, and those promises are precious, 2 Peter 1:4. They are the 
    beams of the sun of righteousness, the pleasant streams which run in the 
    paradise of Scripture. "All things work together for good," Romans 8:28—but 
    to whom? "To those who love God." All <i>mercies </i>shall work for their 
    good. They shall be footstools to lift up their hearts higher to heaven. And 
    all <i>afflictions </i>shall work for their good; the <i>chastening rod </i>
    shall be a divine pencil to draw Christ's image more lively upon their 
    souls!
<p align="justify">There is another promise. "I will never leave you nor 
    forsake you," Hebrews 13:5. This promise belongs to the heirs of salvation. 
    God will not leave His people either to their strong corruptions or their 
    weak graces. He will counsel them in their doubts, supply them in their 
    needs, and defend them in their dangers. When they are most <i>assaulted</i>, 
    they shall be most <i>assisted</i>. How can God leave them? They are His 
    spouse. Will a man leave his spouse?</p>
<p align="justify">Thus the saints have the royal charter of the promises 
    settled upon them. As these promises are sweet, so they are sure. Men reckon 
    their wealth not always by what ready money they have in their houses—but by 
    their bonds and deeds. A Christian's estate lies mostly in bonds and deeds 
    of God's hand, sealed with His oath. What better security can there be?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A righteous man has more excellent FREEDOM.</p></b></font> 
    "And I will walk at liberty," Psalm 119:45. Another is capable of <i>civil
    </i>freedom; he may be a Roman born—but he is still <i>enslaved to his lusts</i>. 
    But a righteous person is God's freeman, 1 Corinthians 7:22. His neck is out 
    of the devil's yoke. He is "free from the law of sin," Romans 8:2. He has 
    God's free Spirit, Psalm 51:12, which makes him free and cheerful in his 
    obedience. The will is not compelled, but changed. A regenerate person is 
    drawn indeed by the Spirit, but sweetly—as one is drawn into a <i>garden of 
    spices </i>by the fragrance of their smell. He is drawn to Christ as one is 
    drawn with another's beauty. He is free; a righteous soul chooses the ways 
    of God, Psalm 119:30, and what greater act of freedom is there, than an act 
    of choice? A saint cannot have his spiritual freedom taken away from him. 
    While he suffers in prison, his conscience is most free.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A righteous man has more excellent FOOD.</p></b></font> 
    Carnal men feed only on earthly provision; the righteous feeds on heavenly. 
    He tastes how sweet the Lord is, Psalm 34:8. He feeds on God's love; this is 
    the hidden manna. He eats Christ's flesh, which not only begets life, John 
    6:33—but prevents death. "This is the bread which comes down from heaven, 
    that a man may eat thereof and not die," John 6:50—that is, not die the 
    second death. Other bread may nauseate or cause bloating—but there is no 
    excess here. We cannot eat too much of the Bread of Life. We cannot have too 
    much of Christ, as one cannot have too much of health. Oh, what excellent 
    food is this! God Himself is in this cheer!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A righteous man has more excellent ARMOR</p></b></font>, 
    namely, "the armor of light," Romans 13:12. This armor is of God's making, 
    and the Lord, with His armor, gives strength. Alexander the Great might have 
    given <i>armor </i>to a coward—but he could not give him <i>courage</i>. But 
    God infuses a spirit of <i>magnanimity </i>into His people. With His armor 
    He conveys <i>strength</i>. "My strength is made perfect in weakness," 2 
    Corinthians 12:9. When a Christian has on God's armor, and goes forth in the 
    power of His might, nothing can hurt him. The <i>wicked one </i>touches him 
    not, that is, with a deadly touch. Grace is bullet-proof armor; it may be 
    shot—but it cannot be shot <i>through</i>. 
<p align="justify">This spiritual armor is not burdensome; a Christian may
    <i>run </i>his race in it—as well as <i>fight</i>. The more the armor of God 
    is struck at—the stronger it is; the more faith is assaulted—the more 
    vigorous it is; the more zeal is opposed—the hotter it is. This excellent 
    armor makes a Christian steadfast in religion. Hypocrites wear Christ's 
    colors—but lack His armor; therefore, they fall away. The righteous man 
    never gives over the spiritual combat, until the trophies are hung up and 
    the palm branches are put in his hand in token of victory!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">7. A righteous man has more excellent HOPES. </p></b></font>A 
    sinner's hope is in this life; he hopes to increase his estate. He makes the 
    wedge of gold his hope—but it is a perishing hope, "When the wicked die, 
    their hopes all perish!" Proverbs 11:7.
<p align="justify">But the righteous man's hope excels. His hope is in <i>
    Christ</i>; this is both a <i>helmet </i>and an <i>anchor</i>. While he is 
    fighting with <i>temptation</i>—hope is a helmet. While he is upon the 
    waters of <i>affliction</i>—hope is an anchor. The anchor of a ship is cast
    <i>downwards</i>; but the anchor of the soul is cast <i>upwards </i>in 
    heaven. A saint's hope is a purifying hope, a death-bed hope, a 
    soul-comforting hope. He is "looking for that blessed hope and the glorious 
    appearing of the great God and our Savior," Titus 2:13. When Christ was in 
    the flesh, He appeared as a <i>Surety</i>; now in heaven He appears as an <i>
    Advocate </i>and, when He comes in the clouds, He will appear as a <i>Judge</i>. 
    A righteous man hopes for this blessed appearing, when Christ shall 
    vindicate His saints from all unjust calumnies and openly acquit them in the 
    court.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">8. A righteous man has more excellent JOYS. </p></b></font>
    True religion does not restrain his joy—but refines his joy. What is the joy 
    of a sinner? He takes joy in food and wine; he sucks from the <i>flower of 
    pleasure</i>. Alas! What is this, compared to the joy of the righteous? We 
    joy in God. This joy arises from the pardon of sin, the first fruits of the 
    Spirit, and the foretaste of glory. The <i>gleanings </i>of this heavenly 
    joy, are better than the <i>vintage </i>of carnal joy. Plato told the 
    musicians that philosophers could dine and sup without them. How much more 
    can a believer be merry in the Lord without the supplement of worldly 
    comforts!
<p align="justify">The joy of the righteous is a more <b>inward </b>joy. 
    "You have put gladness in my heart," Psalm 4:7. Other joy lies more in the 
    surface; it pleases the senses. It is like the paradise the Turks dream of, 
    where they shall have all dainty dishes served with gold in abundance, 
    silken and purple apparel, and angels their servants bringing them red wine 
    in silver cups. This delights the the senses—but divine joy cheers the 
    conscience. The saints' joy, being inward, sweetens affliction. It turns 
    their <i>water </i>into wine. "Having received the Word in much affliction, 
    with joy" I Thessalonians 1:6.</p>
<p align="justify">The joy of the righteous is a more <b>unmixed </b>joy. 
    Worldly joy is usually spiced with some bitterness; guilt eclipses it. "In 
    laughter the heart is sorrowful," Proverbs 14.13. One may drink <i>wormwood
    </i>in a <i>golden </i>cup; but the joy of the righteous, like David's harp, 
    drives away sadness. It gives honey without gall; it has no alloy or 
    bitterness.</p>
<p align="justify">The joy of the righteous is a more <b>durable</b> joy. 
    Other joy is like a flower which withers while you are smelling it. I have 
    read of a river which runs in the day with a full torrent, but is dry at 
    night. The comforts of the world run strongly in the day of health and 
    prosperity—but at the <i>night of death </i>they are dried up. But as joy <i>
    abounds </i>in the godly, so it <i>abides</i>. "Your hearts will rejoice, 
    and no one will rob you of your joy," John 16:22. Divine joy is but <i>begun
    </i>in this life; it is <i>perfected </i>in glory! Here is but the tuning of 
    the instrument; the sweet concert is reserved for heaven. Here the saints do 
    but <i>sip </i>of the cup of joy—there they shall drink of the <i>rivers </i>
    of pleasure forevermore!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    3. A righteous man is more excellent than a wicked man—in respect of what he</p></b></font>
<font color="#008000"><b>SHALL have.
</b></font>
<p align="justify">He shall have a better <font color="#b07050"><b>reward</b></font>. 
    Both righteous and wicked are rewarded—but there is a vast difference. The 
    wicked shall have a reward of punishment, the righteous shall have a reward 
    of mercy. So that a man shall say, "truly there is a reward for the 
    righteous," Psalm 58:11. They shall be rewarded with a <i>kingdom</i>. The 
    height of men's ambition, is a kingdom. Earthly kingdoms are corruptible. 
    What has become of the pride of Babylon, the glory of Athens, the pomp of 
    Troy? They lie buried in their own ruins! But the kingdom of heaven cannot 
    be shaken, Hebrews 12:28; it runs parallel with eternity. In that blessed 
    kingdom, we shall have a transforming <i>sight </i>of God. We shall be <i>
    like </i>Him, 1 John 3:2—as a pearl, by the beams of the sun, becomes bright 
    and radiant like the sun. God's terror shall be then laid aside. The majesty 
    in God shall appear—but majesty shining with beauty and sweetened with love. 
    This will be unspeakable, and full of glory.</p>
<p align="justify">And this reward is near at hand. "Now is our salivation 
    nearer than when we believed," Romans 13:11. When Columbus's men were weary 
    of their voyage, he begged them to go on but three days longer. They did so 
    and discovered America. While the righteous fall upon the waters of 
    affliction, this may comfort them in their voyage; by going a little further 
    they will see heaven! There the tree of life grows and the crystal streams 
    flow from Lebanon! The saints' salvation is now nearer, than on the birthday 
    of their faith. Thus I have beaten out this gold in the text into the leaf, 
    and shown you wherein "the righteous is more excellent than his neighbor," 
    Proverbs 12:26.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    II. The second thing is WHY a righteous man is more excellent than another.</p></b></font> 
    The reason is in respect of that near relation he stands in to Christ. There 
    is blood kinship; He is brother to Christ. Christ partakes of his flesh—and 
    he partakes of Christ's Spirit. There is unity—a righteous man is one with 
    Christ as the members are one with the head. Then, surely, the righteous 
    must have a surpassing dignity. If Christ is a precious corner-stone, 1 
    Peter 2:6, then also those living stones must be precious, which are built 
    upon Him.

<p align="justify">USE 1. See from hence, what it is which raises the value 
    of a person.</p></b></font> It is righteousness; this puts a glory and 
    excellency upon him. He who is graceless is worthless. "The heart of the 
    wicked is of little value," Proverbs 10:20. But righteousness makes the 
    heart like the heaven bespangled with stars. The Christian's <i>graces </i>
    are compared to chains of gold for their value, and to myrrh and cassia for 
    their fragrance. As the precious stones shone upon Aaron's breastplate, so 
    righteousness shines in the eyes of God and angels. What made Christ admire 
    the woman of Canaan—but her graces? "Great is your <i>faith</i>," Matthew 
    15:28. Christ was more pleased with her faith—than all the fancy buildings 
    of the Temple. God does not esteem the better of any man because he is rich 
    or noble or embellished with worldly ornaments. It is righteousness which 
    advances him. Righteousness is to the soul—as the <i>diamond </i>is to the 
    ring—as <i>light </i>is to the world which bespangles and adorns it.

    religion because they think it will be a stain to their reputation; but you 
    see how righteousness emblazons one's name—and gives him a super-eminence 
    above others. Novarinus relates of an ancient king who invited a company of 
    poor Christians and set them above some of his nobles. Being asked why he 
    showed so much respect to men of such low birth and extract, he replied, "I 
    must honor these as the children of the most high God; they will be kings 
    and princes with me in another world." Theodosius thought it a greater 
    renown to be a member of Christ—than the head of an empire.
<p align="justify">The righteous are highly in favor with God, and He has 
    enrolled their names in the Book of Life. It was a custom among the Romans 
    to write down the names of their senators in a book. This is the honor of 
    the righteous—their names are written among the courtiers of heaven. 
    Believers, in regard of their mystical union with Christ, have a kind of 
    excellence above the angels. The angels are morning stars, Job 38:7—but 
    these are clothed with the sun. Can it be any shame to be listed among the 
    saints, when God is not ashamed to be called their God? Hebrews 11:16.</p>

<p align="justify">USE 3. See what high thoughts God has of the righteous</p></b></font>—He 
    looks upon them as more excellent than others, and His judgment is best 
    worth praising. The saints have low thoughts of themselves; they overlook 
    their own worth, like Moses who did not know that his face shined. The eye, 
    though beautiful, does not see itself. Yet, as low thoughts as the righteous 
    have of themselves, God has high thoughts of them. "You are precious in My 
    sight and honored, and I love you," Isaiah 43:4. The Lord throws away the 
    wicked like dross. The greatest man in the world, lacking holiness, is like 
    Naaman, who was captain of the king's host and a mighty man of valor—but he 
    was a <i>leper</i>, 2 Kings 5:1. A wicked man may be higher than others in 
    nobility and worldly grandeur. A dunghill is higher than other ground—but it 
    is never the better; it sends forth odious vapors.

    their eminence. A saint has that eternal glory which cannot be beheld by a 
    carnal eye; the lovely face is hidden, when under a veil Second, righteous

    trials." Daniel 12:10. "I have refined you in the furnace of suffering." 
    Isaiah 48:10. "He will sit as a Refiner and Purifier of silver; He will

<p align="justify">God calls them a crown of glory and a diadem in His hand, 
    Isaiah 62:3 That is, said a learned writer, they are exceedingly eminent and

    honor. Nay, the Lord calls them expressly His glory. "Israel My glory" 
    Isaiah 46:13, as if His glory lay in His people.</p>
<p align="justify">All this shows what a high estimate God puts upon the 
    righteous, in giving them such illustrious titles of honor. They are princes 
    in all lands. The Lord will give <i>whole kingdoms </i>to ransom them, "I 
    gave Egypt for your ransom," Isaiah 43:3. That was when God destroyed Egypt

    blemish! If gold is valuable in the ore—then how precious is it when it is 
    fully refined? If wheat is excellent when it is mingled with chaff—then how 
    much worth has it, when it is winnowed and made pure? If God reputes the 
    righteous more excellent than others when conflicting with infirmities—then 
    how incomparably excellent and glorious will they appear in His eye, when 
    they shall be cleansed from all remaining corruption, and shall shine with 
    perfect purity! If a man prizes his friend when he is filled with 
    leprosy—how much more will he prize him when he sees him in perfect health?

<p align="justify">USE 4. See the different esteem which <i>God </i>has of 
    the righteous—and that which the <i>ungodly </i>have of them. </p></b></font>The 
    ungodly esteem the saints lightly; they disdain them and scarcely allow them 
    any notice. They think, of all things, that it would be best if the people 
    of God were swept from the earth; they look upon them as the <i>burden </i>
    and <i>refuse </i>of the earth. "We are treated like the world's garbage, 
    like everybody's trash!" 1 Corinthians 4:13. The apostles were treated by 
    some like the <i>dung cart </i>which goes through the city—into which 
    everyone throws his filth. The saints are loaded with invectives and are not 
    judged worthy to live in the world. "Away with such a fellow from the earth, 
    for it is not fit that he should live!" Acts 22:22.
<p align="justify">But God has an entirely different way of evaluating the 
    righteous. He thinks the world is not worthy of them. "Of whom the world was 
    not worthy, Hebrews 11:38. Hence it is, that He takes his children so fast 
    away by death and places them among the angels! God looks upon the righteous 
    as His skillful needle-work, wrought with the finger of the Holy Spirit, and 
    the glory of the creation. He would soon break up house in the world—were it 
    not for their sakes. This excellent esteem God has of them, will be best 
    seen when Christ shall <i>separate </i>between the precious and the vile, 
    and shall say to the wicked, "Away with you, you cursed ones, into the 
    eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his demons!" Then He will say to the

<font color="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 5. See how dearly God loves the righteous—and how

    "excellent" carries <i>affection </i>in it. Things we prize we love. The 
    righteous are "His treasured possession" Psalm 135:4. And where His treasure 
    is—there is His heart. They are God's delicious garden where He plants the 
    flower of His love! They are dearly beloved by Him. They are His darling! He 
    engraves them upon the palms of His hands—that they may be never out of His 
    eye. He rejoices over them with joy, and rests in His love. 
<p align="justify">"The Father himself loves you dearly." John 16:27 It is 
    no common affection, which God bears to the righteous. The sun shining 
    through the magnifying glass—only sets on fire the object that is near the 
    glass. The beams of God's love are more intensely inflamed towards those who 
    are near Him by grace; these have the epitome of His love—He loves them as 
    He loves Christ! "You have loved them as You have loved Me." John 17:23. 
    Indeed, in one sense, God's love to Christ and believers is not alike, for 
    Christ is loved purely for His own sake—but believers are loved for Christ's 
    sake. Yet, in another sense, God the Father loves believers—just as He loves

<p align="justify">USE 6. See from hence what a venerable opinion we should

    others. "He honors those who fear the Lord," Psalm 15:4. A saint in rags—is 
    better than a sinner in scarlet! We prize things that have excellency in 
    them. Why do we value gold and diamonds—but because they excel glass beads? 
    Oh, then, esteem the righteous as most worthy because of intrinsic holiness 
    whereby they outshine their neighbors! 
<p align="justify">The righteous carry Christ about them. "Christ lives in 
    me," Galatians 2:20. Queen Cleopatra carried a jewel in her purse, which 
    contained the price of a kingdom. How rich are they who carry Christ, the 
    Pearl of price, with them! Do not despise the saints for their worldly 
    poverty—but honor them for their spiritual virtue. We esteem a 
    diamond—though it is in the dust. John Baptist wore but a leather belt, yet 
    he was more than a prophet. He was honored to usher in the King of Glory 
    into the world. John was so eminent a person, that Herod swore to the damsel 
    to give her what she asked—up to half of the kingdom. But John Baptist was 
    worth more than all his kingdom. A saint's exterior may be poor—but he has a 
    rich lining. The outside of the Tabernacle was goat's hair—but within it was 
    embellished with gold. "The king's daughter is all glorious <i>within</i>," 
    Psalm 45:13. Jesus Christ Himself was outwardly poor—yet in Him are 
    "unsearchable riches!" Ephesians 3:8. A soul inspired by the Almighty and

    the light of a candle.</p>

<p align="justify">USE 7. If the righteous are more excellent than others, 
    then how severe will God be against those who wrong or harm them! </p></b>
</font>The wicked are <i>thorns </i>in the sides of the godly. Paul was 
    scourged by cruel hands. "Thrice was I beaten with rods," 2 Corinthians 
    11:25. This was as if you should see a slave whip the king's son! But shall 
    not God avenge His elect? Surely He will. "The sword of the Lord is drenched 
    with blood. For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance," Isaiah 34:6, 8. It 
    is as if the prophet had said, "The time appointed has now come for God to 
    avenge Zion for the wrongs done to her." 
<p align="justify">Jeremiah 50:10-11 says, "Babylonia will be plundered 
    until the attackers are glutted with plunder, says the Lord, because you 
    rejoice and are glad, you who pillage my inheritance." And Jeremiah 30:16, 
    "But in that coming day, all who destroy you will be destroyed." The saints 
    are people of honor; they are God's first-born. Oh, how enraged will the 
    Lord be against such as harm them! They trample <i>God's pearls </i>in the 
    dust! They strike at the apple of His eye! The righteous are God's diadem. 
    Will a king endure to have His robes spit upon—and his crown thrown in the 
    dirt? What is done to the righteous is done to God Himself. When the king's 
    favorite is struck—the king himself is struck at. "I know your rage against 
    Me," 2 Kings 19:27. The rage of Sennacherib was against Hezekiah, but, there 
    being a league between God and His people, the Lord took it as done to 
    Himself. "I know Your rage against Me!" Certainly it shall not go

    The MARKS of a righteous man</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Let us try whether we are in the number of these 
    righteous ones; whether we are indeed more excellent than others.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A righteous man is a HUMBLE man.</p></b></font> He who is 
    proud of his righteousness, is unrighteous. "God I thank You that I am not 
    as other men are. . . . I fast. . . I give tithes. . ." Luke 18:11-12. Here 
    was a <i>triple crown of pride,</i> which the Pharisee wore. Righteousness, 
    though it raises the name, humbles the heart. "If I am righteous, I will not 
    lift up my head," Job 10:15. The <i>violet </i>is a sweet flower—yet hangs 
    down the head; such a flower was Job. The righteous are like the silkworm. 
    While she weaves her skillful works, she hides herself in the silk. The 
    righteous man is more likely to judge himself—than to play the critic on 
    another. He shrinks into nothing in his own thoughts. David cried out, "I am 
    a worm and no man"; though a <i>saint</i>, though a <i>king</i>—yet a <i>
    worm</i>.
<p align="justify">Augustine said, "Lord, I am not worthy of Your love." 
    Hooper said, "Lord I am hell—but You are heaven " Bradford the martyr, 
    subscribed his letter, "The most hard-hearted sinner, John Bradford." He who 
    is righteous puts a greater value upon others than upon himself. "Let each 
    esteem others better than themselves," Philippians 2:3. <i>The higher grace 
    is—the lower the heart is! </i>The more gold you put into the scale, the 
    lower it descends. The richer the ship is laden, the lower it sails! When 
    the soul looks black in its own eye—it is most lovely. "I dwell in the high 
    and holy place; with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit." 
    Isaiah 57:15. <i>God has two heavens—and the humble heart is one of them!</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A righteous man is devoted to HOLINESS.</p></b></font> The 
    priests under the law were not only <i>washed </i>in the great laver—but 
    also <i>adorned </i>with glorious apparel, Exodus 28:2, the emblem of a 
    righteous man who is not only washed from gross sin—but adorned with inward 
    sanctity. The godly man <i>is </i>what he appears to be. He does not have 
    holiness <i>painted </i>on him—but <i>living </i>in him. It is said of 
    Zachariah and Elizabeth that "Both were righteous in God’s sight, living 
    without blame according to all the commandments and requirements of the 
    Lord," Luke 1:6. A godly Christian is <i>God's temple</i>. His <i>body </i>
    is the outward court of the temple—and his <i>soul </i>the holy of holies. 
    He is pure in heart, Matthew 5:8. His work is to <i>serve </i>God—and his 
    end is to <i>enjoy </i>Him. Man, having a principle of <i>reason</i>—must 
    not live as a beast; and, having a principle of <i>righteousness</i>—he must 
    not live as a sinner. "For the grace of God has appeared, with salvation for 
    all people, instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live 
    in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age." Titus 2:11-12. 
    Christ is not only his <i>Priest</i>—but his <i>Pattern</i>. As he makes use 
    of Christ's death for his <i>salvation</i>, so of Christ's life for his <i>
    imitation</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A righteous man is JUST in his dealings</p></b></font>. 
    "Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in His holy place? 
    The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not set his mind on 
    what is false, and who has not sworn deceitfully." Psalm 24:3-4. He who is 
    righteous has not only his <i>heart </i>purged from unholiness—but his <i>
    hands </i>from injustice. He abhors all false ways; he will not defraud to 
    grow rich. He will not sell his conscience for a wedge of gold. A godly 
    Christian is zealous for duties of both tables; he makes <i>piety </i>and <i>
    justice </i>kiss each other.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A Righteous man serves God out of a principle of LOVE.
    </p></b></font>Grace now biases the heart and carries it strongly towards God in 
    ardent affection. A righteous man's serving God is not by <i>constraint</i>—but
    <i>consent</i>. It is heaven to him to serve God! He mounts up in the fiery 
    chariot of <i>love—</i>and breathes forth his soul into his Savior's bosom. 
    Love is the shibboleth which differentiates a righteous man from others. The 
    carnal man says, "What a weariness is it to serve the Lord!" Malachi 1:13. 
    The righteous man says, 'What a pleasure is it!" "I delight in the law of 
    God in the inner man," Romans 7:22. As the bee delights to suck the 
    flower—so a holy person delights to obey God. He does duty out of love to 
    duty; he prays out of love to prayer. When he sings, he makes melody in his 
    heart to the Lord. Love lines the yoke of religion and makes it easy. As a 
    bride delights in putting on her jewels, as a musician delights in playing 
    on his violin—so a gracious soul delights in obeying God. <i>Love to duty
    </i>is better than duty; serving God with delight is angelic. The seraphim 
    are described as having wings, Isaiah 6:2, to show their cheerfulness as 
    well as their ability in God's service.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A righteous man PERSEVERES in piety. </p></b></font>He who 
    quits his work before he has finished it—is but half a workman; and he who 
    quits his religion before he has finished his faith—is but half a Christian 
    The promise is to him who <i>overcomes</i>. Who makes reckoning of grain 
    which withers before harvest? It was the glory of the church of Thyatira 
    that her last works were more than her first. Perseverance carries away the 
    garland. A true Christian not only <i>sets </i>out in the race, but <i>holds
    </i>out. "The righteous also shall hold on his way," Job 17:9, be that way 
    what it will. Though strewn with <i>thorns</i>, though there is a <i>lion
    </i>in the way—he is resolved to hold on his way. "Bonds and afflictions 
    await me—but none of these things move me," Acts 20:23-24 The troubles a 
    godly man meets with for conscience sake, inflame his zeal all the more. 
    Sufferings cannot make Christ stop loving the saints—nor make the saints 
    stop loving Christ. Though Job lost all, he held fast his integrity. 
<p align="justify">Unsound hearts, when they see persecution coming, leave 
    Christ and shift for themselves. A right-spirited saint is made of mettle 
    that will not wear out. Athanasius was the glory of his age; he kept his 
    piety when the world turned Arian. Melancthon, who was called the phoenix of 
    Germany, was, as Ambrose said, like the cypress tree which keeps its 
    greenness in the winter season. The church of Pergamus held fast to Christ's 
    name though she dwelt where Satan's seat was. This is to be righteous: to be 
    faithful until death—and not allow the breastplate of holiness to be shot 
    through. "For I have stayed in God's paths; I have followed His ways and not 
    turned aside. I have not departed from His commands but have treasured His 
    Word in my heart." Job 23:11-12. </p>

    encourage us all to true piety. </p></b></font>No sooner do we become <i>
    gracious</i>—than we become <i>precious </i>to God. This day have "I rolled 
    away the reproach of Egypt from off you," Joshua 5:9. That day we become 
    righteous, our reproach is rolled away from us. Faith raises our honor; 
    righteousness exchanges our fetters for a crown. A crown of glory shall she 
    deliver to you. By espousing godliness, we are better and richer than 
    others, being possessed of a gold mine—the unsearchable riches of Christ! We 
    have from Christ the riches of <i>justification</i>, <i>consolation</i>, and
    <i>glorification</i>. We are richer than the angels! Oh, then, let this 
    excite everyone to be godly! Righteousness puts a splendid excellence upon a 
    man—as if you should see a <i>clod of dust </i>turned into a star!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. If the righteous are so excellent in God's eye—then 
    let God be excellent in their eye.</p></b></font> If they are high in God's 
    thoughts, let God be high in theirs. Let the saints have adoring thoughts of 
    God. "Your righteousness, O God, is very high. You whose name is Jehovah, 
    are the Most High over all the earth!" Psalm 83.18. God is the most 
    super-eminent blessing; who can show forth all His praise? God surpasses the 
    praises of the archangels! He is encircled with glory and majesty. He 
    infinitely outvies all the powers of the earth. Princes hold their crowns by 
    immediate tenure from Him; His <i>dominions </i>are largest, His <i>
    possession </i>longest. "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever," Psalm 
    45:6. Those excellencies which lie scattered in the creature, are infinitely 
    united in God. Augustine complains that man can admire the magnitude of the 
    stars—but not admire Him who is the Father of lights. Oh, esteem God most 
    excellent!
<p align="justify">God's <b>wisdom </b>is excellent. He is wise in heart. He 
    knows the causes of things; yes, at one instant! Angels light their lamps at 
    this sun.</p>
<p align="justify">God's <b>power </b>is excellent. He is Almighty. His 
    power is as large as His will. What His soul desires—that He does! He 
    bridles the proud waves. "Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; 
    they are regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though 
    they were fine dust." Isaiah 40:15.</p>
<p align="justify">God's <b>holiness </b>is excellent. This is the most 
    sparkling jewel of His crown. "Glorious in holiness." Exodus 15:11. </p>
<p align="justify">God is first <i>transcendently </i>holy: "There is none 
    holy as the Lord," 1 Samuel 2:2. The blessed seraphim cover their faces and 
    cry "Holy, holy, holy!" But what angels can take the just dimensions of His 
    holiness? They are too low in stature, to measure these <i>pyramids</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">God <i>communicates </i>His holiness: "I am the Lord who 
    sanctifies you," Leviticus 20:8. He is not only a <i>pattern </i>of 
    holiness—but a <i>fountain</i>. He empties His golden oil through the pipes 
    of the sanctuary. His holiness is <i>imparted</i>—yet never <i>impaired</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">God is <i>unchangeably </i>holy. His holiness can no more 
    cease than His godhead. He never lost a drop of His holiness. As He cannot 
    have more holiness, because He is perfectly holy, so He cannot have less 
    holiness, because He is unchangeably holy.</p>
<p align="justify">God's <b>love </b>is excellent. "How excellent is Your 
    loving-kindness, O God!" Psalm 36:7. This drops as the honeycomb; and 
    sweetens the waters of Marah. His love is better than life; it has a 
    hyper-hyperbole in it. "It surpasses knowledge," Ephesians 3:19. God's love 
    may be <i>felt—</i>but not <i>fathomed</i>. Oh, then, let the saints have 
    God-admiring thoughts! The psalmist esteemed Him above the glory of heaven 
    and the comforts of the earth, Psalm 73:25. God is the marrow and 
    quintessence of all good. His beauty is amazing; His love is ravishing. All 
    divine perfections meet in God as the lines in the center. Let us, then, 
    with Paul, count all things loss for Him. If God puts such a value and 
    appreciation upon the righteous, that they are highest in His esteem—let Him 
    be highest in their esteem!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If God has so honored the righteous and made them 
    better than others—let not the righteous debase themselves or lose any of 
    their excellency.</p></b></font> Has God made them precious? Let not them make 
    themselves vile!
<p align="justify">(1) Let them not debase themselves with the world. A <i>
    worldly saint </i>is as great a contradiction as an <i>orthodox heretic</i>. 
    Money is called filthy lucre, because it makes a person so filthy. 
    Worldliness is an enemy to grace. It is Aristotle's observation that dogs 
    cannot hunt among sweet flowers because the smell of the flowers diverts the 
    scent of the hare. Those can scarcely run after Christ in the fragrance of 
    His ointments, who are diverted by the smell of earthly delights. Whom the 
    Helena of the world kisses—she betrays. It is below a Christian—and too much 
    resembles Satan—to be always compassing the earth. </p>
<p align="justify">"Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don't do it!" 
    Jeremiah 45:5. As if God had asked Baruch, "Baruch, who are by your new 
    birth excellent—akin to angels; by your office excellent—a Levite; do you 
    now seek earthly things? I am going to pluck up, and are you planting? The 
    ship is sinking, and are you decorating your cabin? Oh, Baruch, do not so 
    degrade yourself of your honor! Are you seeking great things for yourself? 
    Don't do it!" Though the wicked, like eels, wrap themselves in the mud, yet 
    let the <i>birds of paradise </i>fly aloft! The higher grace is—the less 
    earthly-minded we are; the higher the sun is—the shorter the shadow.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) Let not the righteous debase themselves by sinful 
    compliance.</p></b></font> Such as profess themselves to be regenerate, should 
    not be yielding to every opinion and temper. Shall the excellent cedar bend 
    like the pliant willow? "Issachar is a strong donkey, couching down between 
    two burdens," Genesis 49:14. Issachar was a strong tribe, but lacked 
    courage. You who are righteous, be not too pliant. Do not choose iniquity, 
    rather than affliction, Job 36:21. Do not so value your liberty—as to wound 
    your integrity. God is a <i>great </i>God—dare not to offend Him! He is a <i>
    good </i>God—venture not to lose Him!
<p align="justify">Do not be swayed by the evil <i>examples </i>of others. 
    Dead fish only swim downstream. The righteous greatly lessen both their 
    honor and reward, by fraternizing with sinners. Let not the godly violate 
    their conscience. The dust will be wiped off this glass, and then it will 
    reveal guilt. When Cranmer had, with some reticence of mind, subscribed to 
    the popish articles, he was afterwards in great horror; his conscience was 
    like Moses' rod turned into a serpent. He could have no peace until he had 
    recanted his subscription. By sordid, unworthy actions—the Holy Spirit will 
    be grieved, the godly will be offended, the wicked will insult, and 
    conscience will accuse. Conscience is like a <i>bee</i>: If a man does 
    well—it gives honey; if ill—it puts forth a sting!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) If the righteous are more excellent than others, let 
    not them ENVY the prosperity of the wicked. </p></b></font>"Let not your heart 
    envy sinners," Proverbs 23:17. God has made you better than they. He has 
    given you His Son to save you—and His Spirit to sanctify you! Envy is an ill 
    humor. It hurts the envious man himself the most. Envy drinks its own venom; 
    it corrodes the body as rust does iron.
<p align="justify">The first man born in the world was envious. One observes 
    that it was not so much Cain's own sin that troubled him—as to see his 
    brother's offering accepted. It is unfitting for God's people to feed this 
    fretting disease; it is bad to feed an envy. What if God wrings out the 
    water of a <i>full cup </i>to the wicked? It is but a <i>sugared poison</i>. 
    Prosperity, like Circe (the mythological witch), with its enchantments, 
    turns men into swine; it makes them grow worse. The moon never suffers an <i>
    eclipse</i>, but when it is at the full. Worldly prosperity is given to the 
    wicked in anger. When Belshazzar was in the midst of his jollity—the hand of 
    God was writing bitter things against him. The hot day of prosperity, 
    presages thunder at night. Haman's banquet, was but a preface to the 
    hangman's noose. Oh, Christian, shake off envy as Paul did the viper! God 
    has made more excellent than others, He has given you better riches and 
    preferment. They have a golden <i>apple</i>, you have a crown, 2 Timothy 
    4:8. God keeps the best wine until last. Let this divine harp drive away the 
    evil spirit of envy and discontent.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4) If the righteous are so excellent, let it persuade 
    others to get into their company and choose to be of their acquaintance.</p></b></font> 
    Next to being good, it is wisdom to converse with those who are so. "The 
    excellent in whom is all My delight," Psalm 16:3. Be not like swine, which 
    would rather lie in the dung, than in a fair meadow. The righteous are the 
    light of the world, and it is prudence to follow those who carry the light. 
    Seek for the <i>olive tree</i>; but if the <i>bramble </i>takes hold of you, 
    cast it away. There is much good to be gotten in the society of the godly. 
    Their <i>speech </i>edifies; their <i>prayers </i>quicken; their <i>examples
    </i>teach. Graft among the saints. A <i>slip </i>grafted into a good stock, 
    partakes of the virtue and influence of the root. The righteous are more 
    excellent. Be often among these <i>spices—</i>and you will begin to smell 
    like them. "He who walks with wise men, shall be wise," Proverbs 13:20.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5) It exhorts the righteous to walk worthy of the high 
    honor which God has raised them to.</p></b></font> "In order that you may live a 
    life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in 
    every good work, growing in the knowledge of God." Colossians 1:10. "I urge 
    you to walk worthy of the calling you have received." Ephesians 4:1. As you 
    are more excellent by your <i>high calling</i>, so be more excellent in your
    <i>worthy walking</i>. Adorn your religion by your prudent holy life. "You 
    are to live clean, innocent lives as children of God in a dark world full of 
    crooked and perverse people. Let your lives shine brightly before them!" 
    Philippians 2:15. 
<p align="justify">Some <i>Antinomians </i>of old taught that whatever a 
    man's <i>life </i>was—yet he was justified. So they believed the false 
    gospel which Luther confuted. Such as are a royal priesthood, should be a 
    peculiar people. The Lord has dignified the righteous above the rest of the 
    world, and they must not take the same latitude others do. For example, "It 
    is not for <i>kings</i> to drink wine, not for rulers to crave strong 
    drink," Proverbs 31:4. It is not befitting for those who are high-born, to 
    be intemperate. So it is not for you who are of a sacred pedigree—whom God 
    has made superior to others—to be vain and loose in your behavior! Alexander 
    would have the Grecians known not only by their <i>garments</i>—but also by 
    their <i>virtues</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">A child of God should be known by the exemplary nature of 
    his life. "You must be holy in everything you do, just as God—who chose you 
    to be his children—is holy." 1 Peter 1:15. Christ has anointed His people 
    with the graces—as those virgins were purified with sweet perfumes, Esther 
    2:12, and He expects that they should send abroad a <i>sweet perfume of 
    holiness</i>. Christians must observe that which is lovely and of good 
    report, Philippians 4:8. They need to walk accurately, Ephesians 5:15, 
    because so many watch for their halting. If the wicked find anything in the 
    people of God dishonorable to their profession, they lay the blame upon 
    religion. It is noted by the fifth-century Christian writer, "What will the 
    pagans say, when they see Christians loose and worldly? <i>The Christians 
    live so bad—because Christ taught them no better.</i>" Daniel's piety sealed 
    up the lips of his enemies, Daniel 6:4. Martin Bucer was so unblamable in 
    his life—that those who most maligned had nothing justly to lay to his 
    charge.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, Christians, look to your steps! When you have <i>
    prayed against sin</i>, then <i>watch against temptation!</i> A <i>spot </i>
    in a royal robe cannot be hidden; a blot of ink would quickly have been 
    spied in Aaron's white linen. If there is a blemish in a professor, 
    everyone's eye is upon it! The sin of such a person causes blushing among 
    the saints, as the patriarchs could not help but be ashamed when the cup was 
    found in Benjamin's sack. Oh, that all who profess the name of Christ, would 
    depart from iniquity! 2 Timothy 2:19. Dare not slander the noble name of Him 
    to whom you belong, James 2:7. Such as are more excellent others, God 
    expects superior living from them. They should bring more glory to God and, 
    by exemplary piety, make proselytes to piety. Better fruit is expected from 
    a <i>vineyard—</i>than from a <i>wild forest.</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(6) Has God so enabled the righteous and given them a 
    super-excellency above others?</p></b></font> <font color="#008000"><b>Then let 
    the righteous be THANKFUL.</b></font> "He raises the poor out of the dust, 
    that He may set him with princes!" Psalm 113:7-8. God has raised you out of 
    the low estate in which you were by nature—and has made you more illustrious 
    than others—that He may set you with angels, those princes above. "O let the 
    high praises of God be in your mouth!" Psalm 149:6. God has done more for 
    believers than for all the world besides. He has given them the "holy 
    anointing", the "new name", the "white stone", which is "the pledge of the 
    heavenly inheritance." At the day of judgment, Jesus Christ will confess 
    their names before His Father and the holy angels, Revelation 3:5. And their 
    souls and bodies, being re-united, shall be fully invested with glory! It 
    shall be proclaimed, "Thus shall it be done to the persons whom the King of 
    heaven will honor."
<p align="justify">Does not all this deserve thankfulness? "Make a joyful 
    noise unto the Lord!" Psalm 100:1. In the Hebrew it is, "Sound for His 
    praise as with a trumpet," Praise God with the best instrument, the heart, 
    and let it be up to the highest pitch! Do it with the <i>whole </i>heart. 
    You who are righteous, speak well of God and tell others what He has done 
    for you. Praise is glorifying God, Psalm 50:23, and will not you cheerfully 
    pay this debt? Will you not do it constantly? "I will sing praises unto my 
    God while I have any being," Psalm 146:2. </p>
<p align="justify">The people of Carthage at first used to send a tenth of 
    their yearly revenue to Hercules—but by degrees they grew weary and stopped 
    sending. Just so, Christians fail much in their thank-offerings. Do not be 
    like those who play a song or two of music in a year—and then the violin 
    must be hung up. Be often upon Mount Gerizim blessing God. Consider that <i>
    thankfulness </i>is the work of heaven; you who shall have angels' reward—do 
    angels' work! Sound forth the memorial of God's holiness and celebrate His 
    fame. Praise is <i>the music of heaven</i>; do not let God lack His music. 
    While others murmur—you must praise God. Wait and long for that time, when 
    you shall be called up to the heavenly mount and placed among the glorious 
    cherubim, where your employment to all eternity will be to breathe forth 
    love, and sound forth praise!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 9. CONSOLATION to the righteous who are under 
    dejection of spirit.</p></b></font> God esteems them more excellent than others. 
    It is comfort:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. This is comfort when the righteous are humbled by SIN.
    </p></b></font>They have low thoughts of themselves, and see so much corruption— 
    that they think they have no grace. Yes—but here is comfort; God sees an 
    excellency in them—though they can see none in themselves. He can 
    distinguish between the <i>grace </i>in them—and the <i>infirmity</i>. And 
    He judges them not by their worst part—but by their best. God prizes His 
    people, notwithstanding their failings. A man values his <i>grain</i>, 
    though it is mingled with <i>chaff</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. This is comfort when the righteous are humbled by 
    AFFLICTION.</p></b></font> "He has covered me with ashes," Lamentations 3:16. My 
    outward comforts are, as it were, in the grave and have ashes thrown upon 
    them. The godly are apt to mistake and think God does not care for 
    them—because He afflicts them. "If the Lord is with us, why then is all this 
    befallen us?" Judges 6:13.
<p align="justify">But let not the righteous be troubled or cast away their 
    anchor. God still makes great account of them. Though they are more <i>
    afflicted </i>than others—yet they are more <i>excellent</i>. God highly 
    esteemed Hezekiah on his sickbed. He heard his prayer and bottled his tears, 
    Isaiah 38:5. Job, when full of ulcers and sores, was dear to God.<i> Job on 
    the dunghill</i>—was more excellent than <i>Pharaoh on the throne! </i>God 
    boasted of Job to Satan, "There is none like him in the earth," Job 2:3. A 
    goldsmith esteems his gold—though it is in the <i>furnace</i>. God sees an 
    excellence in the saints when they are bleeding under their sufferings. A 
    piece of gold is of great value, though it is battered. Grapes are precious, 
    though they are in the winepress. Jesus Christ was on the cross, yet He had 
    been proclaimed to be God's beloved Son by a voice from heaven. Matthew 3:1.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. This is comfort when the righteous are humbled by 
    spiritual DESERTION. </p></b></font>"The arrows of the Almighty are within me," 
    Job 6:4. The Hebrew word for arrow comes from a root that signifies "to 
    cut", to show that the <i>poisoned arrow of desertion </i>cuts to the heart! 
    The Psalmist cries out, "Your wrath lies heavily upon me," Psalm 88:7; which 
    is to say, "Like a mountain of lead, it even sinks my spirits." In this 
    forlorn state, the saints think God esteems them to be vile, and has cast 
    them off. "O Lord, why do You reject me? Why do You turn Your face away from 
    me?" Psalm 88:14. God holds His deserted ones, as it were, over the fire of 
    hell—and they think they are ready to drop in! But, Christian, you may be 
    sorely deserted, yet God may judge you excellent! 
<p align="justify">Zion thought she was quite forsaken. Zion said, "The Lord 
    has forsaken me," Isaiah 49:14. But, at that time, God had a dear respect 
    for her. "I have engraved you upon the palms of My hands!" Isaiah 49:16. God 
    may have the <i>face of an enemy</i>—yet the <i>heart of a loving father</i>. 
    The Lord deserts His people for their profit, Hebrews 12:10. While He is <i>
    humbling </i>them, He is <i>healing </i>them. He <i>seems </i>to put them 
    away from Him—but it is to draw them nearer to Him. He would exercise their
    <i>faith </i>and <i>prayers </i>the more. God is all this while preparing 
    the saints for the sweet embraces of His love. Desertion is like a purging 
    medicine. The Lord will purge out some ill humor of sin and, afterwards, 
    will manifest His love to His children. The <i>cordial </i>is kept until the 
    working of the <i>bitter medicine </i>is completed.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">CONCLUSION. </p></b></font>Thus, good reader, I have 
    endeavored to vindicate the true saint, and elucidate his blessed state. I 
    have set before your eyes a child of light. "Mark the perfect man," Psalm 
    37:37, and imitate him. If, notwithstanding all this surpassing excellency 
    of the righteous, any shall be so wicked as to persist in unrighteousness, 
    they love their own destruction! If they shall glory in their 
    unrighteousness, it is as if beggars should boast of their sores! If they 
    shall disparage holiness, it is like a blind man reproaching the sun. Let 
    the righteous bind such reproaches, as a crown about their head and be no 
    more troubled than they would be to have mad men laugh at them. "Rest in the 
    Lord, and wait patiently for Him," Psalm 37:7. The time is shortly coming 
    when God will clear the innocence of His servants, after He has wiped away 
    all tears from their eyes. He will wipe off reproach from their name and, 
    then, this text shall he universally subscribed to, <i>"The righteous is 
    more excellent than his neighbor!"
</i>
