    Happiness of Drawing Near to God</font></b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="center"><b>"It is good for me to draw near to God."<br/>
</b>Psalm 73:28<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">This psalm is no less elegant than sacred; it is 
    calculated for the meridian of God's church in all times; but it is 
    especially fit for the godly to meditate upon in times of calamity. It is 
    entitled a psalm of Asaph. Asaph was a man divinely inspired, a prophet; as 
    well as one of the masters of music. It is called a psalm of Asaph, either 
    because he composed it, or because it was committed to him to sing. This 
    holy man seems here to have a dialogue with himself concerning providence. 
    He was ready to call God's providences to the bar of reason, and enquire 
    concerning the equity of them. How is it just, that those who are evil 
    should enjoy so much good; and those who are good should endure so much 
    evil? While Asaph was debating the case with himself, at last his faith got 
    above his sense; he considered that the wicked were set in slippery places. 
    And like such as go upon the ice, their feet would soon slide; or like such 
    as walk on mines of powder, they would soon be blown up, verse 18. This did 
    both resolve his doubt, and compose his spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">The entrance into the psalm is not to be forgotten, 
    ‘Truly God is good to Israel:’ so the Hebrew renders it certainly. Without 
    dispute, this is a golden maxim that must be held. In the Septuagint it is 
    set out by way of admiration, Oh, how good God is to Israel! What angel in 
    Heaven can express it; the vulgate reads it, yet God is good; as if the 
    Psalmist had said, though the candle of prosperity shines on the wicked, 
    they have not only what their hearts can wish, but more than their hearts 
    can wish,’ verse 7. And though the godly are sorely afflicted, mingling 
    their drink with weeping; yet for all this, ‘God is good to Israel.’ Here is 
    the fountain, the stream, the cistern: the fountain is God; the stream, 
    goodness; the cistern into which it runs, Israel. Indeed, God is good ‘to 
    all,’ Psalm clxv. 9. The sweet dew falls upon the thistle as well as the 
    rose. But though God be good to all, yet not alike good to all. He is good 
    to Israel in a special manner. The wicked have sparing mercy, but the godly 
    have saving mercy. And if God be good to his people, then it is good for his 
    people to draw near to him. So it is in the text, ‘It is good for me to draw 
    near to God.’ </p>
<p align="justify"><b>1. Here is something implied--that is, that by nature 
    we are far from God. </b>Drawing near implies a strangeness and distance. In 
    our lapsed estate we lost two things, the image of God, and communion with 
    God, Psalm lviii.3. ‘The wicked are estranged from the womb.’ Every step a 
    sinner takes, is going further from God. The prodigal's going into a ‘far 
    country,’ was an emblem of the sinner's going afar off from God. How far are 
    they distant from God, who have been traveling forty or fifty years from 
    their father's house! and what is worse, sinners are not only far from God, 
    but they do not desire to be near him, Jer. iv. 10. ‘They have loved to 
    wander.’ Sin does not care to be near holiness. The wicked get as far as 
    they can from God, like Cain, who ‘went out from the presence of the Lord,’ 
    Gen. iv. 16. That is, the church of God, where were the visible signs of 
    God's presence: he estranged himself from God as much as he could: he fell 
    to building, thereby thinking to drown the noise of his conscience, as the 
    Italians of old were wont to drown the noise of thunder by ringing their 
    bells. Sinners think God's company may be best spared, Isaiah xxx.11. ‘Cause 
    the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.’ Let us shut God out of our 
    company; let him be no more named among us. A bad eye loves not to be near 
    the sun. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us be deeply humbled for our fall in Adam, which has 
    set us at such a distance from the blessed God. Heaven and earth are not so 
    far asunder as God and the sinner. The further we are from God, the nearer 
    we are to hell. The farther a man sails from the east, the nearer he is to 
    the west. Let us of returning to God by repentance. Say as the church, Hosea 
    ii. 7. ‘I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it better 
    with me than now.’ </p>
<p align="justify"><b>2. ‘It is good for me to draw near to God.’ </b></p>
<p align="justify">The <b>text</b> falls into these parts. <br/>
    1. The person, me. <br/>
    2. The act, draw near. <br/>
    3. The object, God. <br/>
    4. The excellency of the act, it is good. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>proposition</b> is this: That it is a great duty 
    incumbent upon Christians to draw near to God, Heb. x. 22. ‘Let us draw near 
    with a true heart.’ For the illustration of the proposition, four things are 
    to be inquired into. </p>
<p align="justify">1. <b>How </b>we are capable of drawing near to God. </p>
<p align="justify">2. <b>Where </b>we draw near to God. </p>
<p align="justify">3. The <b>manner </b>of our drawing near to God. </p>
<p align="justify">4. <b>Why </b>we must draw near to God. </p>
<font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">1. HOW we are capable of drawing near to God.</p></b></font><font face="Verdana">

<p align="justify">By nature we stand in opposition to God, Col. i. 21. 
    alienated and enemies. How then can we approach near to God? – Ans. It is 
    through a mediator. But Jesus Christ is the screen between us and divine 
    justice. Christ as our High Priest assumes our flesh. Christ's flesh is 
    called a ‘veil,’ Heb. x. 20. As Moses when his face shone so exceedingly 
    bright put a veil upon it, and then Israel might approach near to him and 
    look upon him: so Christ having veiled himself with our human nature, we may 
    now draw near to God and behold him. </p>
<p align="justify">And as Christ makes way for us into the Holy of Holies by 
    his incarnation: so by his crucifixion, he died to make God and us friends. 
    The divine law being infringed, God's justice was provoked, and satisfaction 
    demanded, before we could approach to God in an amicable way. Now here 
    Christ as our Priest shed his blood for our sins, and so made the atonement, 
    Col. i. 20. ‘Having made peace through the blood of his cross.’ As Joseph 
    being so great at court, made way for all his brethren to draw near into the 
    king's presence, Gen. xlvii. 2. so Jesus Christ is our Joseph, that does 
    make way for us by his blood, that we may now come near into God's presence. 
    Through Christ, God is pleased with us; he holds forth the golden scepter, 
    that we may draw near, and touch the top of the scepter. </p>
</font><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">2. WHERE we draw near to God. </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Answer. In the use of his ordinances. In the word we draw 
    near to his Holy Oracle; in the sacrament we draw near to his table. In the 
    one we hear his voice; in the other we have his kiss. Besides, we also in a 
    special manner draw near to God in prayer. <i>Prayer is the soul's private 
    converse and communion with God. Prayer whispers in God's ears, Psalm xviii. 
    6. ‘My prayer came before him, even into his ears.’ </i>In prayer we draw so 
    near to God that we ‘take hold of him,’ Isaiah lxiv. 6. God draws near to us 
    by his Spirit, and we draw near to him in prayer. </p>
</font><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The MANNER of our drawing near to God.</p></b></font><font face="Verdana">

<p align="justify">God's special residence is in Heaven and we draw near to 
    God, not by the feet of our bodies, but with our souls. The affections are 
    the feet of the soul; by these we move towards God. David drew near to God 
    in his desires, Psalm. lxxiii. 25. ‘There is none upon earth that I desire 
    beside you.’ He did shoot his heart into Heaven by pious ejaculations. 
    Spirits may have communion at a distance. </p>
</font><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Why we must draw near to God. </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Because he is our maker, ‘in him we live.’ He has given 
    us bodies; they are his curious ‘needlework,’ Psalm. cxxxix. 15. And as he 
    has wrought the cabinet, so he has put the jewel in it, the precious soul; 
    and surely if we have our being from him, we cannot breathe without him. 
    There is good reason we should draw near to Him in a way of homage and 
    observance. </p>
<p align="justify">God is our benefactor; he crowns us with a variety of 
    blessings: he gives health and estate; every bite of bread we eat is reached 
    to us by the hand of Divine bounty. Is there not great reason we should draw 
    near to him who feeds us? Give a beast provender and he will follow you all 
    the field over. Not to draw near to Him who is our benefactor, is worse than 
    brutish. </p>
<p align="justify">God is the summum bonum, the chief good. There's enough 
    in God to satisfy the immense desire of the angels. He is the quintessence 
    of sweetness. In him perfections are centered, wisdom, holiness, goodness: 
    he has rivers of pleasure where the soul shall bathe itself forever with 
    infinite delight, Psalm xxxvi 36. So that here is ground sufficient for our 
    drawing near to God; he is the chief good. Everything desires to approach to 
    its happiness. </p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">See the right genius and temper of a gracious soul</p></b></font><font face="Verdana">; 
    it is ever drawing near to God; it loves to converse with him in private. A 
    person truly regenerate is not able to stay away long from God, Psalm lxiii. 
    8. ‘My soul follows hard after God.’ A pious soul cannot but draw near to 
    God. 
<p align="justify">Out of the entire love which he bears to God. It is the 
    nature of love to draw the heart to the object loved. </p>
</font>
<p align="justify"></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">He who loves his friend will often give him a visit; he 
    who loves God will visit him. The heart ascends to God in a ‘fiery chariot’ 
    of love. A gracious soul cannot but draw near to God, because of the 
    intimate relationship between God and him. God is a father, Isai lxiv. 8. 
    ‘Doubtless You are our father.’ Does not the child delight to draw near to 
    his father? There is no father like God for love; his children shall never 
    lack; he has land enough to give to all his heirs. He loves his children so 
    entirely, that he will never disinherit them. How then can believers keep 
    away from their father? they do not know how to be long out of his presence.
    </p>
<p align="justify">A gracious soul cannot but draw near to God, because he 
    has found so much sweetness and content in it. While he has drawn near to 
    God, he has drawn virtue from him. Never did Jonathan taste so much 
    sweetness when he dipped his rod in the honey-comb, 1 Sam. xiv. 27. as the 
    soul finds in communion with God. In drawing near to God a Christian's heart 
    has been warmed and melted; the Lord has kindled his sacrifice from Heaven. 
    In his approaches to God, he has had the drawings of the Spirit, the incomes 
    of God's love, the foretastes of glory: God has given him a ‘bunch of 
    grapes’ by the way; he has ‘tasted that the Lord is good;’ no wonder then he 
    is so frequent in his approaches to the divine majesty; he has found the 
    comfort of drawing near to God. </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">It reproves them, who, instead of drawing near to God, 
    draw near to the world. </p></b></font><font face="Verdana">The world engrosses 
    all their time and thoughts, Phil. iii. 19. ‘Who mind earthly things.’ A 
    good Christian uses the world for his necessity, but his main work is to 
    draw near to God. Whoever he deals with, and pays short, he will be sure God 
    shall not be a loser. He gives God a daily sacrifice; ‘he follows God 
    fully.’ Numb. xiv. 14. But covetous people make the world their treasure, 
    and what is their treasure, that does most command their hearts. Worldlings 
    live by sense; and to talk to them of drawing near to God is to speak 
    riddles and paradoxes to them. They can no more live above the earth, than 
    fish can live out of the water. They have the serpent's curse upon them, ‘to 
    lick the dust.’ Things of a worldly aspect draw away the heart from God. 
    They hinder our passage to the holy land. Had not 'the fall' beat off men's 
    head-piece of wisdom, they would think thus with themselves: if there be any 
    beauty in the world, what is there in God who made it? He gives the flower 
    its color and odor; he gives the diamond its luster; he gives food its 
    taste; and if there be such sweetness in creatures, what is there in God? He 
    is infinitely better than all. Shall these poor things draw our hearts away 
    from God? shall the drop draw us from the fountain? shall the light of the 
    candle draw us from the sun? shall we admire the gift, and forget the giver? 
    Solomon speaks of a generation of men, ‘madness is in their heart,’ Eccles. 
    ix. 3. Sure they who draw near the world, and leave God, ‘madness is in 
    their heart.’ O how empty and insignificant are all other things without 
    God! They are in their matter earthly, in their procuring painful, in their 
    fruition surfeiting, in their duration dying, in their operation damning.
    
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">It reproves them who draw near to God, but it is 
    hypocritically</p></b></font><font face="Verdana">; they draw near with their 
    lips, but not with their hearts, Isa. xxix.13. The Jews (says one) use great 
    shows of adoration, and in their synagogues burn lamps to the honor of God, 
    but no inward devotion can be perceived. What is pomp without piety? Sinners 
    give God the worship of their bodies, but keep their hearts for something 
    else they love better. The heart is a virgin that God himself is suitor to. 
    Prov. xxiii. 26. ‘My son, give me your heart.’ To draw near to God with the 
    body, but not the heart is to abuse God. It is as if one should come into an 
    apothecary's shop and ask for medicine, and he should give him an empty 
    glass. To draw near to God without a heart is to play a devotion, and <i>to 
    go to hell covered with religion’s mantle. 
</i></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">It reproves them who instead of drawing near to God, draw 
    back from God.</p></b></font><font face="Verdana"> These are renegades; they 
    once seemed to put forth fair blossoms and gave good hope of their 
    conversion; but their spring is changed to autumn. Either fear of 
    persecution or hope of preferment, has turned them away from the profession 
    of religion. Hos. viii. 3. ‘Israel has cast off the thing that is good.’ At 
    Augsburg the papists gave ten florins a year to such as revolt from the 
    Protestant faith. Men draw back from God because they never had the Spirit 
    of God to confirm them. Such as have the Spirit's indwelling never take 
    their final leave of God. The Spirit in the heart is called an earnest, not 
    a pawn. A pawn may be called for again, and taken away, but an earnest 
    remains and is part of the sum left behind. O how odious is it to draw back 
    from God! The name Judas is had in abomination at this day. Sure no 
    Protestant would baptize his child, Judas. And how dismal was his end! He 
    who had no affections for an innocent Christ, his inward parts gushed out. 
    If it be good to draw near to God, it must needs be evil to draw back from 
    Him, Psalm xxxvii. 27. ‘You have destroyed all those who go a whoring from 
    you.’ 
</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">It exhorts us all to draw near to God.</p></b></font><font face="Verdana"> 
    It is more ingenious to draw near to God voluntarily than to be drawn near 
    to him by affliction. Where should the soul go but to God? where can the bee 
    rest but in its hive? To draw near to God is both a privilege as a duty. 
<p align="justify">There are but </p></font>
<font color="#008000" face="Verdana"><b>two MOTIVES </b></font>
<font face="Verdana">I shall use to persuade you to this drawing near to 
    God. 
</font><font color="#b07050" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The first is in the text;</p></b> <b>to draw near to God 
    is a good thing</b></font><font face="Verdana">. ‘It is good for me.’ That 
    it is good appears in several ways. 
<p align="justify">To draw near to God, is our <b>wisdom</b>. ‘The price of 
    wisdom is above rubies.’ Job xxviii. 18. No jewel we wear does so much adorn 
    us as wisdom; and wherein is our wisdom seen more than in our nearness to 
    God? It is judged wisdom to keep in with great men, Prov. xix. 6. ‘Many will 
    entreat the favor of the Prince.’ But a prince's love is mutable. How often 
    does the sunshine of his royal favor set in a cloud. But it is wisdom to 
    draw near to God; <i>he is the sweetest friend, and the worst enemy. </i></p>

<p align="justify">To draw near to God is our <b>honor</b>. It is counted an 
    honor to converse with noble personages. What high dignity is it, that the 
    great God will allow sinful dust to draw near to him! Surely the apostle did 
    speak of it with an holy boasting, 2 John i. 3. ‘Our fellowship is with the 
    Father, and with his Son Jesus:’ As if he had said, we do not walk with 
    peasants of the world; we are of the blood-royal of Heaven; we live above 
    other men; 'our fellowship is with the Father.’ That the King of kings will 
    hold forth a golden scepter to us, invite and welcome us into his presence, 
    and bid us draw near; this is no small favor, 1 Sam. xxii. 2. ‘Every one 
    that was distressed and in debt drew near to David, and he became a captain 
    over them.’ So that we who are distressed and in debt, may draw near to God; 
    and that he will not only be our captain, but our husband, Isaiah liv. 5. 
    What transcendent dignity is this! It is a wonder God does not kick us out 
    of his presence; but that we should be admitted to see the king's face and 
    that he should send us dainties from his own table, is an honor more fit for 
    angels than men. </p>
<p align="justify">To draw near to God is our <b>safety</b>. God is a 
    ‘strong tower,’ Prov. xviii. 10. It is good in times of danger to draw near 
    to a fort or castle, Hab iii. 4. ‘He had horns coming out of his hand: and 
    there was the hiding of his power.’ The horns coming out of God's hands, are 
    to punish his enemies, and the hiding of his power is to safeguard his 
    people. God is an impregnable stronghold. Indeed there is no safety, but in 
    drawing near to God. If the sheep wanders from the fold, it is in danger of 
    the wolf; if we straggle and wander from God, we are in danger of Satan. </p>
<p align="justify">To draw near to God is our <b>peace</b>. The only thing 
    which breaks our peace is, when we do not keep close to God: but what 
    harmony, yes Heaven is in the soul, when it draws near to God! Psalm cxix. 
    165. ‘Great peace have they which love your law.’ This peace, like pearl in 
    broth, is cordial. David drew near to God, for he was ‘ever with him,’ Psalm 
    cxxxix. 17. And this made his pillow soft when he went to sleep, Psalm iv. 
    8. ‘I will lay me down in peace;’ as the honey-dew falls upon the leaf: O 
    that sweet serenity which drops as honey upon the soul while it is drawing 
    near to God! How comfortable it is to draw near to the sun! and how sweet is 
    it to approach near to the Sun of Righteousness. </p>
<p align="justify">To draw near to God is our <b>riches</b>. It is good 
    drawing near to a gold mine. If we draw near to God, he will enrich us with 
    promises, and divine consolations; he will enrich us with the ‘pearl of 
    great price,’ Ephes. iii. 8. He will reward us as a king, yes as a God! He 
    will make over his land and jewels to us; he will give us the spring flowers 
    of joy here, and the harvest of glory hereafter. </p>
<p align="justify">If we draw near to God, <b>he will draw near to us.</b> 
    If we draw near to him in <i>duty</i>, he will draw near to us in <i>mercy</i>. 
    When the prodigal approached to his father, his father drew near to him, and 
    fell on his neck, and kissed him, Luke xv. 20. If we draw near to God with 
    repenting hearts, he will draw near to us with a compassionate heart. David 
    prayed, Psalm lxix. 18. ‘Draw near unto my soul.’ It is good to have God 
    draw near to us. How sweet is his presence! he is light to the eye and joy 
    to the heart. How happy was it for Zaccheus, when Christ drew near to him! 
    ‘This day is salvation come your house,’ Luke xix. 9. When God draws near to 
    the soul, Heaven and salvation draw near. </p>
</font><font color="#b07050" face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There is a time coming, when we shall wish we had 
    drawn near to God. </p></b></font><font face="Verdana">We are shortly drawing 
    near to our grave, Psalm cvii. 18. ‘They draw near unto the gates of death.’ 
    The wicked who care not for God, yet at death they would desire to draw near 
    to him. Then they cry as Matt. viii. 25. ‘Lord, save or we perish;’ then 
    mercy, mercy. They run to God in distress, as in a storm men run to a tree 
    for shelter. But God will not shelter his enemies. The Lord gives the sinner 
    abundance of mercy in his lifetime, (as you have seen a loving father 
    bribing a prodigal son with money to see if he can reclaim him), but if the 
    sinner do not be wrought upon with mercy, then at death the sun of mercy 
    sets and a dark night of wrath overtakes the sinner. They who would not draw 
    near to God as a friend, will experience that God will draw near to them as 
    an enemy. 
<p align="justify"><b>HOW shall we do to draw near to God?</b></p>
<p align="justify"><u>Let us contemplate the excellencies of God</u>. He is 
    the ‘God of glory,’ Psalm xxix. 3. full of glorious beauty: in comparison of 
    whom both angels and men are but as the ‘small dust of the balance.’ He is 
    the ‘God of love,’ 2 Cor. xiii. 11. who triumphs in acts of mercy. Well may 
    this encourage us in our approaches to him who delights to display the 
    banner of free grace to sinners. If we should hear of a person of honor who 
    was of a lovely disposition, obliging all that came to him by acts of 
    kindness and civility, it would make us ambitiously desirous to ingratiate 
    ourselves with him and to obtain his acquaintance. God is the most sovereign 
    good, the wonder of love, ready to diffuse the silver streams of his bounty 
    to indigent creatures. This, if anything, will make us willing to draw near 
    to him and acquiesce in him as the center of felicity. </p>
<p align="justify">If we would draw near to God, <u>let us study our own 
    needs</u>. Let us consider in what need we stand for God and that we cannot 
    be happy without him. The prodigal never drew near to his father, until he 
    ‘began to be in need,’ Luke xv. A proud sinner, who was never convinced of 
    his need, minds not to come near God; he has a stock of his own to live 
    upon, Jer ii. 31. ‘We are Lords; we will come no more unto you.’ A full 
    stomach despises the honey-comb. It is the sense of need which brings us 
    near to God. Why did so many lame and paralytics resort to Christ, but 
    because they needed a cure. Why does the thirsty man draw near to a fountain 
    but because he needs water. Why does a condemned man draw near his prince 
    but because he needs a pardon. </p>
<p align="justify">When a poor soul reviews its needs; I need grace; I need 
    the favor of God, I am damned without Christ; this makes him draw near to 
    God, and be an earnest supplicant for mercy. </p>
<p align="justify">If we would draw near to God, let us be careful to clear 
    our interest in God, Heb. x. 22. ‘Let us draw near with a true heart in full 
    assurance of faith.’ When we know him to be our God, then we draw near to 
    him. The spouse, by virtue of the conjugal union, draws near to her husband, 
    Psalm xlviii. 14. ‘This God is our God.’ </p>
<p align="justify"><u>Let us beg the Holy Spirit</u>. The Spirit of God has 
    a magnetic virtue. <i>Corruption draws the heart from God; the Spirit draws 
    it to him</i>, Cant. i. 4. ‘Draw me, we will run after you.’ The Spirit, by 
    his omnipotent grace, draws the heart to God not only sweetly, but 
    powerfully. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us get our hearts fired with love to God: whichever 
    way love goes, that way the heart is drawn. If God is the treasure delighted 
    in--our hearts will be drawn to him. Servile fear makes the soul fly from 
    God; sacred love makes it fly to him!</p>
