<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Fiery Serpents</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">"And the Lord sent <i>fiery serpents </i>among the 
    people, and they bit the people, and many people of Israel died. Therefore, 
    the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken 
    against the Lord and against you; pray unto the Lord that He take away the 
    serpents from us! And Moses prayed for the people, and the Lord said unto 
    Moses, Make a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to 
    pass, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live. And 
    Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass 
    that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, 
    he lived." Numbers 21:6-9</p>
<p align="justify">In this portion of holy Scripture, there are two things 
    to be considered: The people of Israel's being stung, and the manner of 
    their cure.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Their being stung with the fiery serpents</p></b></font>, 
    where observe:
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The occasion of God's sending these fiery serpents.</p></b>
</font>There were two sins which provoked the Lord to inflict this 
    punishment:
<p align="justify">The first sin for which God sent serpents was their <b>
    murmuring</b>. "The people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you 
    brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, 
    neither is there any water," verse 5. Speaking against God and His prophets 
    go together. "They spoke against God and against Moses." The Chaldee reads 
    it, "They <i>murmured </i>before the Lord." Murmuring is speaking against 
    God, and it proceeds from distrust. "They believed not His Word—but 
    murmured," Psalm 106:24-25. Just so, in the text, "There is no bread or 
    water." They thought they would die in the wilderness, and then they spoke 
    against God. <i>Murmuring </i>is the daughter of <i>unbelief</i>. And 
    observe the time when they murmured; it was immediately after an eminent and 
    glorious deliverance. "The Lord hearkened to Israel and delivered up the 
    Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities," verse 3. And 
    behold the requital they make God for this signal mercy! They murmur against 
    Him. What! To find fault with God! And just after a deliverance! The Lord, 
    being highly provoked, sent fiery serpents among them, "and many people of 
    Israel died," verse 6.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, how suitable to their sin was this punishment! Israel 
    burned in the heat of passion—and God made their flesh burn with extreme 
    heat. Their speeches were venomous—and they were punished with venomous 
    serpents. Hence observe:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. Of all sins, God can least bear the sin of 
    ingratitude.</p></b> </font>To be delivered—yet murmur! God immediately sent 
    fiery serpents to avenge His quarrel. Israel not only <i>forgot </i>God's 
    mercies—but <i>abused </i>them, Psalm 106:13. To be ungrateful for mercy, is 
    like Absalom who, as soon as David kissed him and took him into favor—he 
    plotted treason against him! 2 Samuel 15:10. It is like the Athenians who, 
    in payment for the good service Aristides had done them, banished him out of 
    their city. "Ingratitude," said Cicero, "has nothing of evil lacking in it."
<p align="justify">Ingratitude is a sin which leaves people without excuse. 
    If God lets loose His judgments and sends fiery serpents, they have nothing 
    to say. Ezra 9:10, "And now, O our God, what shall we say after this?" After 
    what? "Mercy has been extended to us in the sight of the kings of Persia—yet 
    we have forsaken Your commandments," verse 9. What shall we say after this?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE. Let our ingratitude be deeply laid to heart.</p></b></font> 
    This puts an accent upon sin, and makes it sinful out of measure. How many 
    are the worse for God's mercies? They make a dart of God's mercies—and shoot 
    it at Him! He gives them <i>understanding </i>and they serve the devil with 
    it; He gives them an <i>estate </i>and they feast their lusts with it. Are 
    these worthy to be guests at the Lord's Table—who lift up the heel against 
    Him? Will God welcome such into His presence, as do not know how to use His 
    kindness? Oh, that this sin may fill our faces with blushing! Let us take 
    heed for the future, that we do not follow this bad example in the text. Let 
    us turn all our <i>murmurings </i>into <i>hosannas</i>. Let us <i>praise </i>
    God for His mercies—and <i>serve </i>God with His mercies.
<p align="justify">The second cause of God's sending the fiery serpents was 
    their <b>slighting of the manna</b>. "Our soul loathed this light bread," 
    verse 5. The Septuagint renders it "this empty bread." It is spoken of with 
    contempt. Israel counted manna vile, in respect of other food. Manna is 
    called "angel's food"—but they call it in disdain "light bread." This manna 
    was miraculous; it came from heaven in an extra-ordinary way. It was 
    mystical; it was a type and figure of the Lord Jesus who is called "the 
    Bread of Life," John 6:48, and "the hidden manna," Revelation 2:17. The 
    contempt, therefore, of manna was a contempt of Christ. For this God sent 
    fiery serpents.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 2. Slighting and despising the Lord Jesus is a 
    God-provoking sin.</p></b></font> This was Israel's crime, despising manna; 
    which was not only physical food but a type of Christ, their spiritual food. 
    This greatly incensed the Lord and made Him send fiery serpents among them. 
    Thus, when we despise Christ and prefer our lusts before Him, as Israel did 
    leeks and onions before manna—then come the fiery serpents.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE. </p></b></font>Let us take heed of growing weary of 
    Christ, this blessed manna. At first, Israel highly esteemed manna; they ran 
    out to gather it. Happy was he who could get manna. But this food from 
    heaven, which at first was so sweet to their palate, within awhile was 
    loathed and condemned. Our nature is such that we are apt to disesteem the 
    richest blessings, when they are common. If diamonds were plentiful, none 
    would value them. If the sun shone but once a year—how would it be prized! 
    But because it shines every day—few admire this <i>lamp of heaven</i>. Take 
    heed of despising Jesus Christ, Matthew 22:5. If God was so angry with 
    Israel for slighting Christ when He was hidden under a type—how angry will 
    He be with those who slight Christ after He has been visibly revealed! "Of 
    how much more severe punishment shall they be thought worthy, who have 
    trodden under foot the Son of God," Hebrews 10:29. Jesus Christ is a 
    supereminent blessing, a treasury and storehouse of all good things. The 
    love of God was never so much seen in giving Christ. Therefore, to slight 
    Christ is to slight the love of God.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <i>But who dares to slight Christ?</i></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is a slighting of Christ to slight His gospel 
    and offer of grace. Has this not been England's sin? Have we not formerly 
    been nauseated on gospel manna? Did we not grow curious and wanton, and 
    esteemed the manna of the gospel as <i>light bread</i>, and was not the Lord 
    provoked with us? Did He not send, though not fiery <i>serpents—</i>yet a 
    fiery <i>rod </i>among us in this city, which has burnt down our dwellings! 
    (Watson here refers to the <i>great fire of London</i>). Christians, I 
    beseech you to take heed of this for the future. If God indulges with manna 
    again, beware of surfeiting on the Bread of Life. The <i>loathing </i>of 
    manna is the next step to <i>losing </i>manna. God will take away His 
    mercies, if they are undervalued. If you <i>play </i>with the light, God 
    will <i>put out </i>the light.</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">2. The punishment itself, which was fiery serpents.</p></font>
</b>These may be understood literally; they were called fiery serpents 
    because they were of a fiery color; or from the effect. They were seraphim,
    <i>burners</i>, for when they bit the people they burned with extreme heat 
    and thirst. The Septuagint translates them "killing serpents." "Many of the 
    people died," verse 6.
<p align="justify">Also, these fiery serpents may be understood mystically. 
    Just so, these serpents were first a type of <b>Satan</b>, called "the old 
    serpent" in Revelation 12:9. He is indeed a serpent for his subtlety. The 
    Hebrew word for "serpent" comes from a verb which signifies to use subtlety, 
    Genesis 3:1. Just so, Satan is a serpent who is very subtle in his 
    temptations. He has his <i>depths</i>, Revelation 2:24, and his <i>devices</i>, 
    2 Corinthians 2:11. The devil, with his artificial varnish, puts a fine 
    gloss upon his temptations so that he may better draw men to his lure. He 
    either hides his malicious designs—or colors them.</p>
<p align="justify">These fiery serpents were also a type of <b>sin</b>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 3. SIN is a fiery serpent.</p></b> </font>This 
    serpent is bred in our nature; it is within us. We would think it sad to 
    have spiders and serpents in our bodies. As it is said of Maximus the 
    Emperor, his body bred vermin; but it is worse to have the serpent of sin in 
    our souls! Sin is a serpent:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Sin is poison. </p></b></font>Sin has envenomed us—and 
    that is the reason we swell. Why does one man swell with <i>pride</i>, 
    another with <i>passion</i>, and another with <i>lust! </i>Man is poisoned. 
    If one had a child whom he dearly loved mortally poisoned, how would he 
    grieve for it! Our souls are poisoned—yet we grieve not!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Sin is a serpent for the sting of it. </p></b></font>Sin 
    at first shows its colors in the glass; afterwards it "bites as a serpent," 
    Proverbs 23:32. Sin is a serpent with four stings:
<p align="justify">It stings with <font color="#b07050"><b>guilt</b></font>, 
    Romans 3:19.</p>
<p align="justify">It stings with <font color="#b07050"><b>horror of 
    conscience</b></font>, which is a picture of hell. Judas felt this. All the 
    racks and tortures in the world are but trifles, in comparison with this 
    deadly sting. No outward comforts can ease a conscience stung with sin—any 
    more than a crown of gold can cure a headache.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin stings with <font color="#b07050"><b>death</b></font>, 
    and death by <font color="#b07050"><b>sin</b></font>, Romans 5:12. Sin is 
    the wild gourd which Adam gathered and ate, and the next news was that there 
    is death in the pot.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin without repentance stings the soul with damnation. 
    This fiery serpent brings to the fiery furnace!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE.</p></b></font> Sec the sad condition of wicked men! They 
    make light of sin—but sin is a fiery serpent which has crept into their 
    bosom. "When the serpent has bitten one," said Pliny, "the venom and 
    contagion of it spreads all over his body." Sin has envenomed men all over; 
    their hearts are full of poison. "Being filled with all unrighteousness," 
    Romans 1:29. Their tongues cast forth the poison of the serpent in oaths and 
    curses. "The poison of asps is under their tongue," Psalm 140:3.
<p align="justify">This may serve to humble God's own people. Though they 
    have the <i>meekness </i>of the <i>dove</i>—yet they have something of the
    <i>evil </i>of the serpent in them. Though the curse due to sin is taken 
    away—yet the venom of this serpent in part remains. They have much love of 
    the world, much unbelief, much unmortified passion. Among Christ's 
    disciples, there was pride and disputation. Though Christians have something 
    of God's <i>Spirit </i>in them—yet they have something which is <i>
    serpentine</i>. This <i>viper of sin </i>will not be shaken off, until 
    death. Oh, how may this humble the best of God's saints! God does not allow 
    sin to be perfectly abolished in this life. He leaves some corruption in the 
    heart, something of the serpent, that His people may loathe themselves in 
    the dust. What need believers have to drink Christ's blood, which is the 
    best antidote against the poison of the soul!</p>
<p align="justify">See that which may raise in us, abhorring thoughts of 
    sin. Sin is a venomous, fiery serpent. Will any man hug a serpent? Oh, look 
    not on the fine coat of the serpent—but the sting. It stings with the wrath 
    of God. Pursue sin with a holy malice. "Mortify the deeds of the flesh," 
    Romans 8:13. It is a happy thing when a Christian can say, "Though the 
    serpent is not dead—yet it is dying." Kill this serpent—or it will kill you!</p>
<p align="justify">If sin is a fiery serpent—then be sensible of the 
    malignity and virulence of this serpent; feel yourselves stung. We are ready 
    to think what a fearful thing it is to be bitten by the fiery serpents. We 
    have a worse serpent that is biting us—and the misery of all is that we are 
    stung and are asleep! Ephesians 4:19. Oh, that God would, by His Spirit, 
    awaken us that we may not sleep the sleep of death!</p>
<p align="justify">If sin is a fiery serpent with so many stings—then let us 
    labor that these deadly stings fastened in our consciences may he healed. 
    And that brings me to the second thing.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The manner of Israel's cure. </p></b></font>"Make a fiery 
    serpent, or "a serpent of brass," and set it upon a pole; and it shall come 
    to pass that everyone that is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live. And 
    Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole," verse 8. In these 
    words there is the sign—a bronze serpent; and the thing signified—Christ the 
    Healer of souls. Just so, it is interpreted by Christ Himself: "As Moses 
    lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be 
    lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish," John 3:14.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 4. The Lord Jesus is the bronze Serpent that 
    heals sinners stung with sin.</p></b></font> For the further illustrating of 
    this, I shall show you firstly—the fit analogies and resemblances between 
    Christ and the bronze serpent. Secondly, I shall show the transcendent 
    excellencies of Christ, the spiritual bronze serpent above that bronze 
    serpent in the wilderness.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">A. Resemblances between Christ and the bronze serpent</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The serpent in the wilderness resembled Christ in its 
    material.</p></b></font> The serpent was of <i>brass</i>, not <i>marble </i>or
    <i>gold</i>. This being made of brass, it typified Christ three ways:
<b>
<p align="justify">First</p></b>, brass is an <i>inferior </i>metal and unlikely 
    to produce such a noble effect. What! Was a serpent of brass to heal one 
    that was stung? If some sovereign medicine or antidote had been applied, if 
    the balm of Gilead had been brought, this would have been likely to have 
    wrought a cure; but what is there to heal—in a serpent made of brass? This 
    was a type of Christ; it resembled the lowliness of His person. He did not 
    affect outward pomp and state; He came into the world in a lowly condition. 
    "There was no beauty in Him, that He should be desired," Isaiah 53:2. Who 
    that had looked upon Christ with a carnal eye would ever have thought that 
    He would be the Messiah, the glorious Healer of the world?
<b>
<p align="justify">Second</p></b>, brass is a solid, firm metal which resembled 
    Christ's power. "If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong," Job 9:19. 
    Therefore, He is called "the mighty God," Isaiah 9:6. Of what invincible 
    fortitude was He who could bear the wrath of God—and the sins of the world! 
    He must be powerful, who could break the gates of hell and triumph over 
    Satan upon the cross!
<b>
<p align="justify">Third</p></b>, brass shines—but does not dazzle the eyes. So 
    Christ, though He shines in His Godhead—yet His human nature so allays the 
    splendor of His glory that we may look upon Him now and not be overwhelmed 
    with the immenseness and brightness of His majesty.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The bronze serpent resembled Christ in its figure and 
    shape.</p></b></font> Though the serpent was made like a serpent—yet it was no 
    real serpent. Thus Christ, as the Scripture said, was in the likeness of 
    sinful flesh, Romans 8:3—yet He was no sinner. He was made sin—but knew no 
    sin, 2 Corinthians 5:21. He knew sin in the weight—but not in the act. He 
    was purer than the sun. He had no more sin—than the bronze serpent had sting 
    or venom in it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The serpent in the wilderness resembled Christ in its 
    erection and elevation.</p></b></font> It was lifted up that all Israel might 
    see it. It must not only be framed—but lifted up. Just so, Christ must not 
    only be made a Savior—but He must be lifted up. There are four ways Christ 
    is said to be lifted up:
<b>
<p align="justify">First</p></b>, Christ was lifted up in the acclamation of the
    <i>angels</i>. "Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the 
    armies of heaven—praising God: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and 
    peace on earth to all whom God favors!" Luke 2:11-14. The angels adored 
    Christ and were the heralds to proclaim the joyful news of a Savior to the 
    world. Thus was Christ lifted up in the triumph of angels.
<b>
<p align="justify">Second</p></b>, Christ is lifted up in the preaching of the
    <i>gospel</i>. Just so, He is an ensign erected for all to look to, Isaiah 
    11:10. It is the minister's office to lift up Christ in the eyes of the 
    world, to hold Him forth in His glory and proclaim Him as the only Messiah, 
    and that there is no salvation in any other, Acts 4:12.
<b>
<p align="justify">Third</p></b>, Christ was lifted up upon the <i>cross</i>. 
    The pole was, undoubtedly, a type of the cross, and the lifting up of the 
    serpent on the pole was a type of Christ's being lifted up upon the cross. 
    This was a blessed lifting up. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, 
    will draw all men unto Me," John 12:32; that is, all who belong to the 
    election. Oh, how happy was it for us, that this spiritual bronze serpent 
    was erected! Christ's being lifted up upon the cross—is the cause of our 
    being lifted up to heaven. And, in the Sacrament, there is a solemn 
    commemoration of Christ's crucifixion.
<b>
<p align="justify">Fourth</p></b>, Christ is lifted up in our <i>hearts </i>by 
    our contemplating, admiring, and loving Him. Lifting up Christ on the cross 
    will not save us—unless He is lifted up in our hearts. When we prize Christ 
    and set Him highest in our thoughts and esteem, this is to lift Him up in 
    our souls. There are two chief things a Christian has to do: tread down 
    self, and exalt Christ!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The bronze serpent resembled Christ in the design of 
    its being lifted up, and that was sight, immediate knowledge.</p></b></font> 
    When the Israelites were stung, they had to look upon the bronze serpent, 
    which looking implied a secret hope they had of a cure. So Christ was, 
    therefore, lifted up on the cross that He may be looked upon by an eye of 
    faith. The people of Israel did not need to take down the serpent from the 
    pole and touch their sores with it; they were only to <i>look </i>on it and 
    they were healed. Just so, we do not need to go to fetch Christ down from 
    heaven (as the papists do who make Him to be corporally in the bread). No, 
    if we only look upon Him with faith, we shall be cured of our sting.
<p align="justify">Observe four things about the bronze serpent. There were 
    four cases in which the bronze serpent would have done the people of Israel 
    no good, though it was lifted up.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">First</p></b>, if the bronze serpent had been set up—yet they 
    had not fixed their eye upon it, it would not have cured them. So, though 
    Jesus Christ is lifted up as a Savior to the world—yet, if this bronze 
    serpent is not looked upon believingly, He will not save. "He who believes 
    not, is condemned already," John 3:18. The bronze serpent was made a type of 
    Christ; now, the bronze serpent did not cure all people—only those who 
    looked upon it. Just so, those who, either through ignorance or 
    stubbornness, do not look on Christ by faith, have no benefit by Him.
<b>
<p align="justify">Second</p></b>, in case the people of Israel had not looked 
    upon this serpent alone. If they had set up another bronze serpent by this 
    one and looked upon both, they would not have received a cure. So, after God 
    has set up Christ to be a Savior, if any shall presume to set up another 
    Savior by Him (as the papists who look partly to Christ and partly to their 
    merits), they can receive no healing virtue by Him. For us to look upon our 
    duties equally with Christ, our prayers and tears, as expecting they should 
    merit salvation, this is to make two bronze serpents, to set up two Christs, 
    and then we cannot be cured. We are to use duties—but to look beyond them to 
    Christ. They are good duties—but bad Christs. If we trust our duties for 
    salvation, they will be fiery serpents to sting us—not bronze serpents to 
    heal us!
<b>
<p align="justify">Third</p></b>, if the bronze serpent was set upon a pole; but 
    Israel had looked only upon their sting and not upon the serpent—they would 
    not have been cured. So, if we look only upon our sins and, through despair, 
    do not look up to Christ, we have no healing from Him. To keep away from 
    Christ because of our sins, is a disparagement to Christ—as if there were 
    more malignity and poison in sin than virtue in this bronze serpent. Indeed, 
    we must look with one eye upon sin—but with another eye upon Christ. Look on 
    sin with a <i>penitent </i>eye and on Christ with a <i>believing </i>eye. 
    Weep for that sin that slew Christ—but hope in the Lamb slain!
<b>
<p align="justify">Fourth</p></b>, if Israel had looked upon the bronze serpent; 
    yet, if it had been with an eye of scorn or contempt as despising that 
    remedy God had provided, they would not have been cured. Jesus Christ is 
    lifted up—but if He is looked upon as the Jews looked upon Him when He hung 
    on the cross, with an eye not of reverence but of disdain—He will not cure. 
    The blasphemous Socinians look upon Christ only as a mere man, and His blood 
    as not meritorious. These cannot be saved by Him. "He is despised of men," 
    Isaiah 53:3. To these, He is not a bronze serpent—but a consuming fire!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The bronze serpent resembled Christ in the outcome and 
    result of it. </p></b></font>He who looked upon the serpent had an infallible 
    cure. Just so, he who can but look wishfully on Christ by faith, is 
    certainly saved. "Whoever believes on Him shall not perish," John 3:16. Our 
    misery at first came in by the eye. Looking upon the forbidden fruit undid 
    us—but looking on Christ aright saves us!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">B. I shall show the transcendent excellencies of Christ</p></b></font>, 
    the spiritual bronze serpent, above that one in the wilderness. The bronze 
    serpent was inanimate; it could repair life, not infuse life. But Jesus 
    Christ gives life to the world, John 6:33. Yes, a never-dying life, John 
    3:15, eternal life. Life is sweet—but this word "eternal" makes it sweeter!
<p align="justify">The bronze serpent could only cure a sting in the body. 
    The Lord Jesus heals a more deadly sting in our souls, Psalm 103:3. So deep 
    were these wounds that they could only be healed by deeper wounds made in 
    Christ's side. He was willing to die to cure us.</p>
<p align="justify">The bronze serpent could cure only those who were within 
    sight of it. Such as were afar off and in remote parts of the wilderness did 
    not have their sting removed; but Jesus Christ cures none but those afar 
    off. "They are gone far from Me," Jeremiah 2:5. The east is not so far from 
    the west as the sinner is from God—but herein appears the virtue of our 
    spiritual bronze serpent. He heals none but those who are afar off. Such as 
    are not only aliens but rebels who live in the devil's territories, Christ 
    works a cure for them, and turns them from the power of Satan, Acts 26:18.</p>
<p align="justify">The bronze serpent cured those that looked on it; but if 
    they had lacked the organ of sight, there would have been no cure for them. 
    What would a poor, blind Israelite have done? But Christ, our bronze 
    serpent, not only cures us when we look upon Him but, if we lack our sight, 
    He <i>enables </i>us to look upon Him. Christ not only saves us when we 
    believe but gives us power to believe, Ephesians 2:8. Christ anoints us with 
    the eye salve of His Spirit that we may look up and, looking up, be cured.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. </p></b></font>Of information. In this mystery of the 
    bronze serpent, see by what improbable means God sometimes effects great 
    things. What was a bronze serpent? What likelihood was there that this 
    should heal one who was stung? It was a mere image, a shape—and this was not
    <i>applied </i>to the wound ,but only beheld and looked upon; yet it wrought 
    a cure! Reason would, with Sarah, have laughed at this. A bitter tree cast 
    into the waters made them sweet to drink. Clay and spit cured the blind man. 
    We would rather think it would blind one's eyes. What is there in the 
    rainbow to prevent a deluge? What is bread and wine in the Sacrament, that 
    these elements should be consecrated to such a high mystery as to be a 
    symbol of Christ's body and blood? What is more strange than that a <i>dead
    </i>man should <i>quicken </i>the world? But God loves to baffle human 
    wisdom, and bring great things to pass by weak, contemptible means, 1 
    Corinthians 1:27-28.
<p align="justify">This the Lord does—that His glory may shine forth the 
    more. The less appears in outward means—the more of God is seen. The less 
    beauty and splendor is in the loadstone, the more the virtues of it are 
    administered. And the less outward pomp is in the instrument, the more God's 
    wisdom and energy is manifested.</p>
<p align="justify">God would have the world see what power is in His 
    institution. God appointed the bronze serpent; therefore a word of blessing 
    went along with it to heal. "He sent forth His Word and healed them," Psalm 
    107:20. In the blessed Sacrament, we are to look above the elements. A word 
    of blessing goes along with God's institution to make this ordinance 
    effectual for the scaling up of Christ and all His benefits to us.</p>
<p align="justify">In this mystery of the bronze serpent, see what infinite 
    need we stand in of Christ. What would a stung Israelite have done without a 
    bronze serpent? If balm is needful for one who is wounded, if an antidote is 
    needful for one who is poisoned—then Christ, the bronze serpent, is needful 
    for a soul stung with sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Yes, and what need we have to look upon Christ in the 
    frequent celebration of the Lord's Supper, where Christ, in a special 
    manner, is lifted up. Though we have looked upon this bronze serpent 
    formerly—yet still we need to look upon Him. We are not perfectly healed. 
    Indeed, if Israel looked but once on the bronze serpent, they were perfectly 
    cured; but, though we have looked several times on Christ in the Sacrament, 
    and can say by experience that we have fetched virtue from Him—yet we are 
    not perfectly cured. Though the <i>guilt </i>of sin is taken away—yet not 
    the <i>presence </i>and <i>indwelling</i>. Our bloody issue is not quite 
    dried up; our wounds bleed afresh, our sins break out again.</p>
<p align="justify">I appeal to the best hearts alive. How often have they 
    been stung with sin and temptation since they looked last on Christ lifted 
    up in the Sacrament! Oh, what need then to come often to this ordinance! 
    Herein the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper differs from the Sacrament of 
    baptism, which is to be administered but once. This one is to be 
    administered often, 1 Corinthians 11:26. If we consider how strong our 
    corruptions are, how weak our graces, how numerous our needs, it may make us 
    come often to the Lord's table where we may have a healing sight of Christ. 
    He who lacks gold goes often to the Indies. Our spiritual indigence may 
    renew our addresses to the Lord's Supper for strength and comfort.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">See in this mystery, the cabinet of free grace opened, 
    and God's love sparkling forth</p></b></font>, three ways:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, God has provided Christ, this bronze serpent, as a 
    remedy for sin-stung sinners.</p></b></font> Oh, infinite goodness of God that, 
    when we had alienated from Him by apostasy, the Lord should take pity on us 
    and, instead of brandishing His flaming sword, should erect a bronze serpent 
    and make Christ known to us in His healing virtues! Malachi
<p align="justify">4:2! When the angels sinned, there was no bronze serpent 
    for them. God did not send them to the <i>hospital </i>to be healed—but to 
    the <i>jail </i>to be punished! "They are reserved in everlasting chains," 
    Jude 6. Oh, rich free grace—which has indulged us with a remedy and found 
    out a way of cure for all our desperate maladies!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, see God's free grace that <i>some </i>should be 
    healed of their sting—and not others. </p></b></font>There are but a few healed. 
    There is a time when sinners <i>will </i>not be healed. "We would have 
    healed Babylon—but she is not healed," Jeremiah 51:9; and there is a time 
    when sinners <i>can</i>not be healed, "There is no healing of your bruise," 
    Nahum 3:19. Now, Christian, when <i>most </i>die of their sin-wound, that 
    the bronze serpent should be sent to <i>you </i>to cure you! Oh, stupendous 
    grace! That God should lay His <i>left </i>hand upon many of the rich and 
    noble, and lay His <i>right </i>hand upon you; that heaven should fall to <i>
    your </i>lot; that you should be one of those <i>few </i>that are saved! Cry 
    out in admiration, "Lord, how is it that You should reveal Yourself to 
    me—and not unto the world!" John 14:22.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, see God's free grace, that He cures us upon such 
    cheap terms.</p></b></font> When we were wounded so deadly, God did not put us 
    to charges. We were not to bring money to purchase our cure, not rivers of 
    oil or drops of blood; no, only <i>look </i>upon the bronze serpent—and the 
    cure is effected! "Come without money and without price," Isaiah 55:1. We 
    are not to pay for our cure. Spiritual blessings are too costly for our 
    purse to reach. Christ made a purchase for us in His blood. All He requires 
    is to receive it and be thankful.
<p align="justify">See how justly all wicked men perish. God has provided a 
    bronze serpent, a glorious Savior, that whoever believes in His blood may 
    obtain mercy. God beseeches, yes, commands men to believe, 1 John 3:23. If, 
    therefore, through folly they neglect Christ, or in obstinancy refuse Him, 
    how righteous will God be in pronouncing that last and fatal sentence upon 
    them! Those who perish under the gospel must be double damned; hell's 
    furnace will be heated seven times hotter for them, because they put away 
    salvation from them, Acts 13:46. Pagans perish in the <i>lack </i>of a 
    bronze serpent, and professors perish in the <i>contempt </i>of it!</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ said, "Come unto Me, all you sinners who are 
    stung with guilt, and I will heal you. I conflicted with My Father's wrath. 
    I was wounded, and out of these bleeding wounds comes forth a sovereign 
    medicine to cure you!" But desperate sinners love their disease better than 
    their remedy. They would rather die than look up to Christ for life. "Israel 
    would have none of Me," Psalm 81:11. Oh, strange delirium! The old serpent, 
    after he has stung men—has bewitched them, that they do not want a cure. Who 
    will pity such as willfully cast away themselves? How will mercy slight 
    their tears at last, and God triumph in their deserved ruin!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. </p></b></font>Let us look in a right manner upon this 
    mystical bronze serpent. "Looking unto Jesus," Hebrews 12:2. The Greek word 
    signifies the <i>steadfast fixing of the eye </i>upon some lovely, beautiful 
    object. Faith will be of more use than any other grace; as an eye, though a 
    dim one, was of more use to a stung Israelite than any other member. Faith 
    discerns the Lord's body. To encourage faith, consider:
<b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ was lifted up upon the cross purposely to cure 
    us.</p></b> Christ had no other end in dying, but to heal. His blood is a 
    sovereign balm for a sin-sick soul. Such as feel the burden of their sins, 
    need not question Christ's willingness to save them when the very design of 
    His death was to cure. "He heals the broken heart," Psalm 147:3. Serpents, 
    as naturalists affirm, have a great love to their young and will hazard 
    their lives for them. So full of love was Christ, our mystical bronze 
    serpent, as to die for us. "By whose stripes we are healed," Isaiah 53:5.
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Such as do not look up to Christ's merits, necessitate 
    themselves to damnation. </p></b>"He who believes not, shall be damned," Mark 
    16:16. Had not the Israelites lifted up their eyes to the bronze serpent, 
    they would have died for it. If you do not look up as David did ("my eyes 
    are ever toward the Lord," Psalm 25:15)—then you must look up as Dives did 
    ("in hell he lifted up his eyes in torment," Luke 16:23). Oh, therefore, let 
    us fix our eye upon the bronze serpent, looking unto Jesus! Let us look up 
    to the sacrifice of Christ's blood, and to the cloud of incense which He 
    sends up by His glorious intercession.
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. "But I fear I have no faith alive in my soul 
    whereby I should look up. Though the Israelites were stung—yet they were 
    alive! But how dead do I find my heart!"</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. We must distinguish between one who is 
    lifeless—and one who is without life. A sick man is <i>lifeless </i>and has 
    no mind to stir—yet he is not without life. So, Christian, you may be 
    lifeless and your grace dormant—yet the seed of faith may be alive in your 
    heart. Did not David find his heart dull and lifeless? Though he was not 
    dead in sin—yet he was dead in duty. Why else did he pray, "Quicken me," 
    Psalm 119:25. But that deadness which is in a believer, he is sensible of, 
    and this argues life. He mourns for it and never leaves until he has, in the 
    use of means, recovered that agility and liveliness of soul which once he 
    had.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. "But if my faith is alive, it is so weak that 
    I fear I shall receive no benefit from the bronze serpent."</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. If it is a <i>true </i>faith, though it is <i>
    weak</i>—it will fetch virtue from Christ. Suppose an Israelite had but one 
    eye, and that eye had been sore; yet, looking on the bronze serpent, he 
    would have been immediately cured. Tender-eyed Leah might have been cured. 
    Though your faith is <i>weak</i>, it will justify. Say as Cruciger on his 
    deathbed, "Lord, I believe but with a weak faith; yet I believe."</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. "But my sins are of such magnitude that I am 
    discouraged from looking up to Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Captivate fear and advance faith, Mark 5:36. 
    Suppose an Israelite had been more stung and bitten than others—yet, by 
    looking on the bronze serpent, he might have been healed as well as those 
    who had but the least sting. Christ's blood believed in, cures the greatest 
    stings. What can the blood of God not do? It Cured Manasseh three deadly 
    stings—bloodshed, idolatry, and sorcery, 2 Chronicles 33:3-6.</p>
<p align="justify">The bronze serpent can cure the crimson sinner, Isaiah 
    1:18. I do not speak this that any should <i>presume</i>—but that no 
    broken-hearted sinner should <i>despair</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us acknowledge God's wonderful mercy in bestowing the 
    bronze serpent upon us! Oh, bless God cordially for Christ who was lifted up 
    upon the cross and is held forth for our consolation and salvation. How 
    joyful was an Israelite who lay burning with his sting—when he saw the 
    bronze serpent erected! We have infinitely more cause to be joyful for 
    Christ, whose blood delivers us from the wrath to come, 1 Thessalonians 
    1:10. What would have become of us—if Christ had not pitied us and come into 
    the world? If Christ had not been lifted up on the cross—we would have been 
    thrown down to hell forever!</p>
<p align="justify">Let us, then, bow the knee in all reverence and, with the 
    leper who was healed, return to give glory to God, Luke 17:15.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3. </p></b></font>Let this cheer up the hearts of all 
    true believers. You who now look upon Christ lifted up upon the <i>pole</i>—shall 
    shortly see Him lifted up upon the<i> throne! </i>You who have seen Christ 
    in His <i>crucifixion</i>, shall shortly see Him in His <i>coronation!</i> 
    In short, you who now behold Christ lifted up for you—shall shortly be 
    lifted up to Him! And there you shall behold the wonders of His love, the 
    riches of His glory, and shall be forever solacing yourselves in the light 
    of His blessed countenance!
