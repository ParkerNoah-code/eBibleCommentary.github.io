<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Heavenly Race</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify"><i>"Don't you know that in a race all the runners run, 
    but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize!"</i> 1 
    Corinthians 9:24</p>
<p align="justify">True religion is a business of the greatest importance. 
    The soul, which is the more noble and divine part, is concerned in it; and, 
    as we act our part here—so we shall be forever happy—or miserable. The 
    advice of Solomon in this case is most seasonable: "Whatever your hand finds 
    to do—do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, 
    there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom." 
    Ecclesiastes 9:10. The business of true religion, requires our utmost zeal 
    and intensity, Matthew 11:12.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes the work we are to do for heaven is set out by
    <b>striving</b>. Luke 13:24, "<i>Strive </i>to enter in at the strait gate." 
    Strive as in an agony—strive as for a matter of life and death. Though we 
    must be men of peace—yet, in matters of religion, we must be men of strife. 
    It is a <i>holy </i>strife—a <i>blessed </i>contention. Indeed, the Apostle 
    said, "Let nothing be done through strife"; but, though strife does not do 
    well <i>among </i>Christians—yet it does well <i>in </i>a Christian. He must 
    strive with his own heart—or he will never get to heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes our work for heaven is compared to <b>wrestling</b>. 
    Ephesians 6:12, "We <i>wrestle </i>not against flesh and blood—but against 
    principalities and powers." Our life is a continual wrestling. As Jacob 
    wrestled with the angel—so we must wrestle with our <i>corruptions</i>. We 
    must not lay our sins in our <i>bosom</i>—but set our feet upon their <i>
    necks! </i>If we beat our sins, and get them down—it is not baseness or 
    cowardice to strike them when they are down. And we must wrestle with <i>
    Satan</i>. Satan labors to get within us and give us a fall, as he did our 
    first parents. What the devil would have done to Christ, throw Him from the 
    pinnacle of the temple, Matthew 4, that he did to our first parents. He 
    threw them down from the pinnacle of happiness. Therefore, we must wrestle 
    with him. "Resist the devil and he will flee from you," James 4:7.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes the life of a Christian is compared to <b>
    fighting</b>. 1 Timothy 6:12, "<i>Fight </i>the good fight of faith." Christ 
    is the Captain of the saints' forces. He is called the Captain of their 
    salvation, Hebrews 2:10. We must all be military persons. Faith is our 
    shield; hope is our helmet; the Word of God is our sword. We come into the 
    world as into a battle. Lusts war against us, 1 Peter 2:11. Good reason, 
    therefore, that we should war against them. It is a day of battle, and it is 
    dangerous going abroad without our armor.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes a Christian's work for heaven is compared to 
    the <b>running of a race</b>; so in the text, "Don't you know that in a race 
    all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to 
    get the prize." In which words the Apostle seems to allude either to the 
    Olympic games, which were kept every fifth year in honor of Jupiter, or to 
    the Ithmian games celebrated near Corinth in the honor of Neptune, in which 
    games they put forth all their strength to win the prize. <i>Just so</i>, 
    said the Apostle, <i>run the race of Christianity which is set before you 
    with a winged swiftness that you may obtain the prize of salvation!</i></p>

<p align="justify">The words fall into two general parts:<br/>
    1. The race to be run, "so run."<br/>
    2. The end of running, "that you may obtain."</p>
<p align="justify">The observations out of the text are these two:<br/>
    1. Christianity is a race.<br/>
    2. Wise Christians should labor so to run as to win the prize: "that you may 
    obtain."<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE: Christianity is a race.</p></b> </font>The life of 
    a Christian is a race. Hebrews 12:1, "Let us run with patience the race that 
    is set before us." We must be <i>travelers, </i>before we are <i>possessors</i>. 
    Heaven is a place of rest. Hebrews 4:9, "There remains a rest for the people 
    of God." No more wrestling there, for then we have overcome the enemy. The 
    saints in glory are set forth with palms in their hands, Revelation 7:9, in 
    tokens of victory. No more running there for the prize being obtained, the 
    saints have thrones to sit and rest themselves upon, Revelation 3:21. But 
    this present life is a race, and it must be run—so run.
<p align="justify">For the illustration of the doctrine there are three 
    things to be opened:</p>
<p align="justify">I. How a Christian's life is compared to a race</p>
<p align="justify">II. How a Christian race differs from other races.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why this race must be run.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. How a Christian's life is compared to a race.</p></b></font> 
    That appears in four particulars:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In a race, there is the way or path to run in</p></b></font>; 
    so in Christianity there is the pathway in which we must run. Psalm 119:32, 
    "I will run the way of Your commandments." Jeremiah 6:16, "This is a good 
    old way." It is as <i>good </i>as it is <i>old. </i>The way of 
    sanctification and obedience is the way the saints have gone in, and the way 
    which God has been found in.
<p align="justify">This way we are to run in is a <b>pleasant </b>way. It is 
    sweetened with comfort. Proverbs 3:17, "All her ways are pleasantness." 
    Romans 15:13, "Joy in believing." The way of true religion is strewn with 
    roses. Oh, the bunches of grapes which God cuts down, the flagons of wine 
    which He gives to those who turn their feet into this way!</p>
<p align="justify">The way of God's commandments is a <b>clean</b> way—it is 
    a way paved with holiness, Isaiah 35:6. Christians may run in this way and 
    never wet the soles of their feet. The way of sin is defiling; such as walk 
    in this way, the filth of hell sticks upon them. In the ways of sin, there 
    are such deep slews, that men sink into perdition—but the way of the 
    Christian race is clean. Such as run this race cleanse themselves from all 
    pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 
    Corinthians 7:1.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A race is LABORIOUS. </p></b></font>The running of a race 
    is a strenuous exercise; men put forth all the strength of their bodies in 
    running. Thus, Christianity is a laborious race. We must put forth all our 
    strength in this race. "My soul follows <i>hard </i>after God," Psalm 63:8. 
    Philippians 2:13-14, "Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is 
    ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize." The word signifies, "I 
    stretch my neck forward;" and, said the Apostle, "I press toward the goal as 
    runners race with all swiftness, and stretch themselves forward to lay hold 
    on the prize." It is not an idle wish or a dead prayer which will win the 
    garland—but a Christian must put forward with all speed and vigor of 
    affection, that he may obtain what he runs for.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A race is SHORT</p></b></font>. A race is but a short 
    space of ground; it is soon run. Thus, our time being short, our race cannot 
    be long; and this may encourage us in the race of religion, and keep us from 
    being out of breath. Remember, it is but a short race. 1 Peter 5:10, "After 
    you have suffered <i>awhile</i>." So I may say, after you have run awhile, 
    you will be at the end of the race. It is but awhile, Christians, and you 
    shall be finished wrestling, weeping, and praying, and you shall reap the 
    fruit of all your prayers. It is but awhile, and you shall be finished 
    suffering and be among "the spirits of just men made perfect." It is but 
    awhile, and you shall be at the end of your race, and you shall receive, 
    "the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls." 1 Peter 1:9. How 
    should a child of God rejoice to think that he has gotten over a large part 
    of his race and is almost at the end! As Taylor, the martyr, once said, "I 
    have but two steps to go over, and then I shall be at my Father's house!" 
    You who have set out early for heaven and now are in your old age, comfort 
    yourselves with this—you have but a few steps more to take—and then you are 
    at the end of your race!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. In a race, there is a crown or PRIZE given to the 
    winner</p></b></font>. Just so in true religion, those who win the race shall 
    wear the crown, 2 Timothy 4:8. Such as <i>do </i>not run through sloth, or
    <i>will </i>not run through pride—miss the reward; but such as run the 
    heavenly race faithfully, shall have a crown, 2 Timothy 4:8. And this reward 
    is fitly resembled to a <i>crown </i>because of the splendor of it. A crown 
    hung full of jewels is bright and splendid; it gives an oriental luster. 
    Neither can pen describe, or pencil delineate, or tongue of angel 
    express—the glory and magnificence of this crown; nor can it be portrayed by 
    all the beauties of heaven, though every star were a sun!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The second thing to be illustrated is to show how the 
    Christian race DIFFERS from other races.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In other races, one only is crowned; but in the 
    spiritual race, many win the prize. </p></b></font>The saints shall come to 
    heaven from all the quarters of the world, east and west. Matthew 8:11, 
    "Many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and 
    Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven." Revelation 7:9, "After this I 
    saw a vast multitude, too great to count, from every nation and tribe and 
    people and language, standing in front of the throne and before the Lamb. 
    They were clothed in white and held palm branches in their hands." By this 
    multitude too great to count, are to be understood those who belong to the 
    election of grace. These as victors are crowned, and stand with palm 
    branches in their hands. Should but one receive the prize, there might be 
    room left for despair.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. In other races, some stand still and look on; but 
    here, in the heavenly race, ALL must run. </p></b></font>Those who are unfit to 
    run other races, like the lame and blind—must run this race. None are 
    excused from this race. <i>All have run from God by sin—and all must run to 
    Him by repentance! </i>Either run—or be damned! Either flee to heaven—or 
    fall to hell!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. In other races, the feet run but, in the Christian 
    race, the HEART runs. </p></b></font>Psalm 119:32, "I will run when You shall 
    enlarge my <i>heart</i>." In true religion—the heart is all; that which the 
    heart does not do—is not done. It is not lifting up the <i>eye </i>or <i>
    hand </i>towards heaven, which forwards us in the race—it is the out-going 
    of the heart. Many a man's <i>tongue </i>runs in religion—but not his <i>
    heart</i>. Do you <i>believe </i>with your <i>heart</i>? Romans 10:9. Do you
    <i>love God </i>with your heart? Matthew 22:37. This is to run the race of 
    religion; this brings a Christian speedily to the goal. When David's heart 
    was enlarged—then he ran.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. In other races, only the fastest runner gets the prize</p></b></font>; 
    but it is not so in this heavenly race. Though others may outrun us—yet, if 
    we hold on to the end of the race, we shall receive the reward. Some saints 
    are like Asahel, "as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle," 2 Samuel 2:18. They 
    run swifter in the race of obedience, as Ahimaaz outran Cushi, 2 Samuel 
    18:23. But this is the comfort of weak believers: though they cannot run as
    <i>fast </i>as others—yet, if they hold on to the end of the race without 
    fainting, they are crowned. He who worked for one hour had his pay, as well 
    as he who worked many hours, Matthew 20:9, to show that those who set out 
    later and may be outrun by other Christians—yet persevering, they are saved.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. In other races, men run for a temporal reward; in the 
    Christian race we run for an eternal reward. </p></b></font>Others run for a 
    corruptible crown, 1 Corinthians 9:25. Sometimes the crown bestowed upon the 
    victor was made of olive, sometimes of myrtle. The Egyptians had a crown of 
    cinnamon enclosed in gold—but still it was corruptible. But the crown the 
    saints run for is incorruptible; it is a never-fading crown, 1 Peter 5:4. 
    Other crowns are like a garland of flowers, which soon withers, Proverbs 
    27:4—but this crown given to the conquering Christian is imperishable. The
    <i>jewels </i>of this crown are never lost; the <i>flowers </i>of this crown 
    never fade.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. In other races, the garland is bestowed in a way of 
    merit; but, in the Christian race, it is bestowed as a legacy of free grace.</p></b></font> 
    Though we shall not obtain the prize unless we run—yet not <i>because </i>we 
    run. How can we merit the reward? Before we merit heaven, we must satisfy 
    God's justice—but we have nothing to pay. Besides, what proportion is there 
    between the race—and the recompense? Therefore, the crown bestowed is called 
    a <i>gratuitous </i>gift. Romans 6:23, "The <i>gift </i>of God is eternal 
    life." God will so bestow His rewards in such a way, that He Himself may be 
    no loser; though the saints have the <i>comfort </i>of their crown, God will 
    have the <i>glory</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. In other races, many times, one hinders another; but, 
    in the race to heaven, one Christian helps another.</p></b></font> 1 
    Thessalonians 5:11, "So encourage each other and build each other up, just 
    as you are already doing." One Christian helps by his prayer, advice, and 
    example—to confirm another. What is the fellowship of saints, but one 
    Christian helping forward another in the heavenly race?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. One may lose other races and not be miserable—but he 
    cannot lose this race in religion without being miserable. </p></b></font>In 
    other races, a man only loses his wager; but if he falls short of this 
    spiritual race—he loses his eternal soul. How seasonable, therefore, is that 
    Apostolic caution, Hebrews 4:1, "Let us fear, lest we should come short."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. The third thing to be explained, is why we must run 
    this Christian race.</p></b></font> There are three reasons:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Because God has set us on this race.</p></b></font> 
    Hebrews 12:1, "Let us run with endurance the race that God has set before 
    us." It is not arbitrary; it is not left to our choice whether we will run 
    or not. God has set us on the race. God's commands carry power and 
    sovereignty in them. If a general bids his army march—they must march. 
    There's no disputing any duty in the Word of God. The heavens drop down 
    their dew; the stars set themselves in battalion; the earth thrusts forth a 
    crop; the sea is bridled in and dares not go a step farther. If inanimate 
    creatures obey God's word of command, much more those who are endued with 
    reason. When God says to run the race—we must run.
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">2. There's no other way to get to heaven but by running 
    the race.</p></font><font color="#0000ff"> </font></b>By nature, we are distant 
    from the goal; and, if we would have heaven, we must run for it. A man can 
    no more get to heaven who does not run this race—than one can get to his 
    journey's end who never sets a step in the way. 2 Peter 1:10,11, "Make every 
    effort to confirm your calling and election. For in this way, entry into the 
    eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied 
    to you."
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>3. Our time allotted to us is 
    short.</b> </font>Job compares our life to a swift runner, Job 9:25, "My 
    life passes more swiftly than a runner." The poets painted time with <i>
    wings</i>. If time flies—we had need run! The night of death hastens—and 
    there is no running a race in the night!</p>
<p align="justify">This shows us that the business of true religion is no 
    idle thing; we must put forth all our strength and vigor. Religion is a 
    race; we must run and run. It is a hard thing to be a Christian. Alas, then, 
    what shall we say to those who stand all the day <i>idle</i>? If we look at 
    many professors—and we would think they had no race to run. They put their 
    hand "in their bosom," Proverbs 19:24. Is that a fit posture for him who is 
    to run to it? If salvation would drop as "a ripe fig into the mouth of the 
    eater," Nahum 3:12, men would like it well; but they are loathe to set upon 
    running a race. Never think to be favored upon such easy terms. </p>
<p align="justify">The life of a Christian is not like a nobleman's life. 
    The nobleman has his rents brought in by his steward, whether he wakes or 
    sleeps. Do not think that salvation will be brought to you—when you are 
    stretching yourselves on your beds of ivory. <i>If you would have the 
    prize—run the race. </i>The passenger in the ship, whether he sits on the 
    deck or lies on the couch, is brought safely to shore; but there is no 
    getting to the heavenly port without <i>towing hard</i>. "Zaccheus <i>ran
    </i>to see Jesus," Luke 19:4. If we would have a sight of God in glory, we 
    must run this race. We cannot have the world without labor, and would we 
    have heaven without labor?</p>
<p align="justify">If the life of Christianity is a race, this may justify 
    the godly in the haste which they make to heaven. Psalm 119:60, "I made 
    haste and delayed not to keep your commandments."</p>
<p align="justify">Carnal spirits say, "What need do you have to make such 
    haste? Why are you so strict and precise? Why do you run so fast? Fair and 
    softly—a more easy pace will serve."</p>
<p align="justify">Oh—but a Christian may reply, "Religion is a race. I 
    cannot run too fast, nor hard enough!" If any had asked Paul why he ran so 
    fast and pressed forward to the mark, he would have answered that he was in 
    a race.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is that which may justify the saints of God in their 
    zeal and activity for heaven: they are racers, and a race cannot be run too 
    fast. The blind world is ready to judge all zeal as madness; but have we not 
    cause to run with all speed—when it is a matter of life and death? If we do 
    not run—and run hard—we shall never obtain the prize. If a man were to run 
    for a wager of three or four million, would he not run with all celerity and 
    swiftness? 1 Samuel 21:8, "The kings business requires haste!"</p>
<p align="justify">If any should say to us, "Why so fast? Why so much 
    praying and weeping?" we may say as David, "The king's business requires 
    haste! God has given me a race to run, and I must not linger or loiter!" The 
    haste which Abigal made to the king, 1 Samuel 25:34, prevented her death and 
    the massacre of Nabal's family. Our haste in the heavenly race will prevent 
    damnation. This may plead for a Christian in his eager pursuit after 
    holiness against all the calumnies and censures of the wicked.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">This brings us to several REPROOFS:</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It reproves those who run a contrary race</p></b></font>—not 
    the race <i>God </i>has set them upon—but the race the <i>devil </i>has set 
    them upon—the race of iniquity. This reproves those who sacrifice their 
    lives to Bacchus and make haste—but not to heaven. They make haste to 
    fulfill their lusts! Proverbs 6:18. They make haste to swear, to be drunk. 
    They are swift to shed blood, Isaiah 59:7, "their feet run to evil." The 
    sinner, in regard of the haste he makes in sin, is compared to a swift 
    dromedary, Jeremiah 2:23. A wicked man's swiftness in sin, is like Absaloms' 
    riding on his mule, 2 Samuel 18:9, "as the mule went under the thick 
    branches of a large oak, Absalom's head got caught in the tree. He was left 
    hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going." Sinners make 
    haste to sin—as the bird hastens to the snare! They run as the swine 
    possessed with the devils ran into the sea and were drowned! Mark 5:13. <i>
    Oh, what haste do men make to hell—as if they feared the gates would be shut 
    before they could get there! </i>What need is there of this speed? Why do 
    they run so fast to prison? The sins men commit in haste—they will repent of 
    at leisure! Achan made haste to the wedge of gold—but now he has time enough 
    to repent of it. Sin is an unhappy race, a damnable race! "Will it not be 
    bitterness in the end?" 2 Samuel 2:26, when men come to the end of that 
    race, instead of a crown "behold chains of darkness!" Jude 6.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It reproves those who, instead of running the race of 
    God's commandments, spend all their time in joviality and mirth—as if their 
    life were rather a <i>dance </i>than a <i>race</i>.</p></b> </font>Job 21:12-13, 
    "They sing with tambourine and harp. They make merry to the sound of the 
    flute. They spend their days in mirth." They are at their <i>music—</i>when 
    they should be at their race! Amos 6:4, "They sprawl on ivory beds 
    surrounded with luxury, eating the meat of tender lambs and choice calves. 
    You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp." It is hard to have <i>two 
    heavens</i>. Some are all for pleasure; they are like those hunting-dogs 
    which Diodorus Siculus speaks of. While they run among the sweet flowers, 
    they smell the flowers, lose scent of the hare—and leave off their hunt. So, 
    while many are among the sweet flowers—the delights and pleasures of the 
    world—they fall to smelling these flowers, and leave off their race. 
    Therefore,<i> they go merrily to hell. </i>I may say, as Solomon, Proverbs 
    14:13, "the end of that mirth is heaviness!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If true religion is a race, it reproves those who are 
    slow-paced in religion—who <i>creep </i>but do not <i>run</i>.</p></b></font> 
    Their motion is slow and dull. They should be like the sun in the sky, which 
    is swift—when they are like the sun of the dial, which moves very slow. Many 
    Christians move so heavily in the ways of God that it is hard for bystanders 
    to judge whether they are making any progress or not. They are hasty in 
    their passion—but slow of heart to believe, Luke 24:25. What haste did 
    Israel make in their march—when Pharaoh was pursuing them! What need do 
    Christians have to expedite their race—when the devil is behind pursuing, 
    ready to overtake them, and make them lose the prize! We read in the law 
    that God would not have the donkey offered in sacrifice. He hates a dull 
    temper of soul. The <i>snail </i>was accounted unclean, Leviticus 11:30, and 
    the slow-paced professor will be tardy at last, and miss the prize.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. It reproves those who <i>begin </i>the race of 
    Christianity—but do not <i>persevere </i>to the end of the race. </p></b></font>
    They faint by the way: "You did run well—who hindered you, that you should 
    not obey the truth?" Galatians 5:7. The crown is set upon the head of <i>
    perseverance</i>. He who runs halfway and then faints, loses the garland. It 
    is sad for a man to come near to heaven and then tire in the race—as it is 
    to see a ship cast away in sight of the shore.
<p align="justify">Nay, what shall we say to those who do worse than tire in 
    the race, who run <i>backward </i>into the way of wickedness, like Julian, 
    Gardner, and others. There is no going to heaven <i>backwards</i>. Such cast 
    reproaches upon the ways of God. Better never begin the race—than run back. 
    2 Peter 2:21, "For it had been better for them not to have known the way of 
    righteousness—then after they have known it to turn from the holy 
    commandment." A soldier who runs from his colors, and lists himself in the 
    enemy's regiment, if he is taken, must expect martial law. Hebrews 10:38, 
    "If any man draws back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him." God will 
    bear with<i> infirmity</i>—but He will punish <i>treachery</i>. Wrath shall 
    smoke against the apostate; fury will display itself in its bloody colors. 
    Indeed, in war, there is a retreating sometimes which, if it is done 
    politically and to the enemy's disadvantage, is called an honorable retreat; 
    but, in a race to heaven, there must be no retreats. These are not honorable 
    retreats but damnable retreats; whoever draws back, it is to perdition, 
    Hebrews 10.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all Christians be exhorted to run this heavenly and 
    blessed race of piety. What arguments shall I use to persuade? Look upon 
    other creatures winged with activity, and then, Christian, shame yourself. 
    Look into the sky and see the sun as a giant running his race, Psalm 19:5, 
    and do you stand still? Look into the air and see the birds soaring aloft 
    and mounting towards heaven. Look into the earth and see the bees working in 
    the hive. Look upon the angels, they are swift in obedience. Look upon other 
    Christians near you; you shall find them in their race—reading, praying, and 
    weeping. And have <i>you </i>nothing to do? Look upon your precious <i>time</i>; 
    time runs, and do you stand still? Look upon the wicked, how quick are they 
    in sin? And shall they run faster to hell—than you do to heaven! Nay, look 
    upon yourself; how industrious are you for the world, rising early, 
    compassing sea and land, and yet how sluggish and heartless in matters of 
    salvation? Will you run for a feather, a bubble—and not run for a kingdom!</p>
<p align="justify">To quicken your pace in godliness, consider what the <b>
    prize </b>is, that we run for. It is a crown of glory! This encircles all 
    blessedness within it; there will soon be an end of our <i>race</i>—but 
    there will be no end of our <i>crown</i>. This blessed reward should quicken 
    us in the race; but how shall we run the race so as to obtain? It is sad to 
    run in vain, Philippians 2:16. This brings us to the next point.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall prescribe some <b><font color="#0000ff">
    DIRECTIONS about this heavenly race:</font></b></p>
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">1. Take heed of those things which will hinder you in 
    your race.</p></font> Shake off sloth; idleness is the <i>pace </i>of the 
    devil. The sluggish professor will never win the race; he is sleeping when 
    he should he running. Sloth is the <i>rust </i>of the soul, it is the <i>
    disease </i>of the soul. A sick man cannot run a race. Proverbs 12:27, "Lazy 
    people don't even cook the game they catch." Oh, shake off sloth! Abandon 
    this <i>idle devil—</i>if you intend to run a race!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Throw off all weights. </p></b></font>There are two sorts 
    of weights we must throw off:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The weight of SIN. </p></b></font>Hebrews 12:1, "Let us lay 
    aside every weight and the <i>sin </i>that so easily ensnares us, and run 
    with endurance the race that lies before us." The prophet David felt this 
    weight, Psalm 38:4, "My iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy 
    burden, they are too heavy for me!" If we do not throw off this weight of 
    sin by sincere repentance—it will sink us into hell. A man cannot run a race 
    with a heavy burden upon his back. An <i>immoral </i>person cannot run the 
    race of holiness; a <i>proud </i>man cannot run the race of humility; a <i>
    self-willed </i>man cannot run the race of obedience. Oh, Christian, 
    unburden your soul of sin! Throw off this weight—if you intend to lay hold 
    on the crown!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The weight of the WORLD. </p></b></font>This is a golden 
    weight which has hindered many and made them lose their race. "Demas has 
    deserted me, because he loved this present world!" 2 Timothy 4:10. So far as 
    the world is a weight, throw it off. I do not say lay aside the <i>use </i>
    of the world—but the <i>love </i>of the world, 1 John 2:15. When the golden 
    dust of the world is blown in men's eyes, it blinds them so that they cannot 
    see their race. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Discard false opinions about this race. </p></b></font>
    Such as, <i>"The race is easy." </i>Many a man thinks he can run the race 
    from earth to heaven on his deathbed. Oh sinner, you who say that the race 
    is easy—you are a stranger to the Christian race! You are dead in sin until 
    a supernatural principle of grace is infused, Ephesians 2:1.
<p align="justify">Is it easy for a dead man to run a race? To run the way 
    of God's commandments is against nature, and is it easy for a man to act 
    contrary to himself? Is it easy for the water to run upward in its own 
    channel? Is it easy for a man to deny himself, to crucify the flesh, to 
    behead his beloved sin? Oh, take heed of this mistake, that the Christian 
    race is easy! Do you know what true religion <i>must </i>cost you—and what 
    it <i>may </i>cost you?</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"The race to heaven is impossible." </p></i>There is so much 
    work to do that surely we shall never win the race. Cyprian confesses that, 
    before his conversion, he had many thoughts tending to despair. He imagined 
    that he would never get the mastery of some of his corruptions. The thoughts 
    of <i>impossibility</i>, cut the sinews of all endeavors. God has encouraged 
    us to run not only by promising rewards when we win—but by promising 
    strength to enable us to run. Has He not said He will put His Spirit within 
    us, Ezekiel 36, and then we can run and not be weary? 
<p align="justify">How many has Satan disheartened through despair? 
    "Surely," says the despairing soul, "I may run—but I shall never <i>so run 
    as to obtain</i>. There is no hope." "So," says the despairer, "I might as 
    well go on in my sins; I might as well keep the old road. There's no hope; 
    all help is cut off." This is a dangerous precipice. Despair takes a man off 
    his legs—and then, how can he run? Despair is the great devourer of souls; 
    he who is under the power of this sin—<i>disputes </i>himself into hell!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Take heed that company does not hinder you from 
    running the race.</p></b></font> If a man should be running a race, and he 
    should have a friend come and take him by the hand and desire to speak with 
    him while he is running—this might make him lose the race. So stands the 
    case here. Many will be ready to meet with us, and stop us in our race to 
    heaven. <i>"Why do you need to set out so soon? Why do you need to run so 
    fast? Stay and bathe yourselves a while in the luscious delights of the 
    world!" </i>Thus have many been stopped in the middle of their race—and lost 
    the prize! To him who would hinder us in our race, we must say with a holy 
    indignation, as Christ, "Get behind Me, Satan!" Matthew 4:10.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Lastly, you must use all MEANS to help you in the 
    heavenly race.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">Run the right race. The Apostle calls it "the race which 
    is set before us," Hebrews 12:1, that is, <i>the race chalked out in the 
    Word of God</i>, the race of self-denial and sanctity. It is not any 
    race—but the race set before us—which we must run; which confutes the 
    opinion that a man must be saved in any religion.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Fit yourselves for the heavenly race!</p>
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">1. Diet yourselves. </p></font></b>The racers in ancient 
    times dieted themselves; they would not eat any fatty meat, nor yet a full 
    meal, that they might be the more prepared for the race. Thus must 
    Christians diet themselves by sobriety and mortification, that they may, by 
    a well ordering of themselves, be more fit to run the race which is set 
    before them. Paul beat down his body, 1 Corinthians 9:27, that he might be 
    more fit for his race.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Strip yourselves for the race. </p></b></font>The runner 
    in a race used to strip himself of all unnecessary clothing, and wear only a
    <i>white garment</i>, that he might be light and nimble. Just so, should 
    Christians strip themselves of all conceits of merit—and only wear the white 
    garment of Christ's righteousness!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Begin the race early. </p></b></font>Ecclesiastes 12:1, 
    "Remember your Creator in the days of your <i>youth</i>." Young ones think 
    they may set upon the race too soon. Can a man be godly too soon? Can he run 
    the race of repentance too soon? But suppose he might—it is still better to 
    repent a year too soon—than an hour too late! Esau's tears as well as his 
    venison—came too late, Genesis 27:33-34. David would seek after God early, 
    Psalm 36:1. Augustine, in his confessions, complained that he knew God no 
    sooner. They will hardly be able to run the heavenly race—who have <i>old 
    age </i>and <i>old sins </i>upon them!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Run the <i>pathway</i>, not the <i>roadway</i>.</p></b></font>
<i>Hell's road </i>is full of travelers; most go wrong. Exodus 23:2, "You 
    shall not follow a multitude to do evil." The multitude does not consider 
    what is <i>best</i>—but what is <i>fastest</i>. Our Savior has told us, "<i>Narrow
    </i>is the way which leads unto life," Matthew 7:14. Run in the narrow way 
    of self-denial and mortification!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Resolve to hold on in the race, notwithstanding 
    dangers and difficulties.</p></b></font> A godly man must be steeled with <i>
    courage</i>, and fired with <i>zeal</i>. It is probable there will be thorns 
    and stones in the way of our race—therefore, we need to be well-shod. We 
    must be shod with the <i>gospel of peace</i>, Ephesians 6:15. He whose heart 
    is filled with that peace which the Gospel brings, will be able to run over 
    the hardest piece of religion, with ease.
<p align="justify">We must he shod with endurance. Hebrews 12:1, "Let us run 
    with endurance, the race set before us." Endurance bears up the heart of a 
    Christian and keeps him from tiring in the race. If this <i>shoe of 
    endurance </i>is off, we shall soon halt and give up running.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Always keep you eye upon the right mark.</p></b></font> 
    The Grecians had a <i>white line </i>drawn at the end of the race—and the 
    racer's eye was always upon it. <i>Looking upon the prize </i>quickens 
    Christians in their race! Paul looked towards the mark, Philippians 3:14, as 
    archers look at the bulls-eye, and racers at the prize. And Moses, Hebrews 
    11:26, "looked ahead to the great reward that God would give him!" He looked 
    with one eye at God's glory—and with the other eye, at the prize!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Oh, run with delight! </p></b></font>Psalm 119:47, "I will 
    delight myself in Your commandments." <i>Oil </i>supples the joints and 
    makes them agile and nimble. The <i>oil of gladness </i>makes Christians 
    lively and fit to run the heavenly race! "The joy of the Lord is your 
    strength," Nehemiah 8:10.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Run in the strength of Christ.</p></b></font> Do not think 
    you can, of yourselves, run the race. The Arminians talk of freewill, "but 
    it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs," Romans 9:16. By nature we 
    are blind, and lame; therefore, unfit to run a race. We run fastest when 
    Christ takes us by the hand!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Be often in the exercise of grace.</p></b></font> It is 
    not enough to have grace in the <i>heart</i>—but it must be in the <i>
    exercise</i>. Such as run the heavenly race, must not only be living—but 
    lively. They must have a flourishing faith and a flaming love! What is the 
    meaning of the <i>loins girt </i>and the <i>lamps burning</i>, Luke 
    12:23—but grace in its activity? Without this, there can be no speed in the 
    heavenly race!
<p align="justify">If you would <i>run hard</i>—pray hard. Prayer helps us 
    on in the race. Pray over that prayer, Song of Solomon 1:4, "Draw me—and I 
    will run after You."</p>
<p align="justify">Pray that you may not mistake your way through <i>error</i>—nor 
    stumble in it through <i>offenses</i>. In a word, let us pray for the Holy 
    Spirit, who animates us in the race, and carries us above our own strength. 
    God's Spirit breathed in us—keeps us in full breath for running the race!</p>
