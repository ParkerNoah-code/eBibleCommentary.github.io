<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Spiritual Vine</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
<i>"I am the true vine." </i>John 15:1</p>
<p align="justify">"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth—for Your 
    love is more delightful than wine. Pleasing is the fragrance of Your 
    perfumes; Your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love 
    You!" Song of Songs 1:2-3. Jesus Christ is the beauty of heaven—and the joy 
    of the heart, Revelation 21:23. In Him all the fullness dwells, Colossians 
    1:19. In this flower, is all sweetness. If the gospel is the field, Christ 
    is the <i>treasure </i>hidden in it. The knowledge of Christ is so precious 
    and delectable that, though Paul knew Him before—yet he desired to know more 
    of Him. He would have more light from this sun. "That I may know Him," 
    Philippians 3:10, as he who has found a gold mine desires to dig out still 
    more gold. </p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ in Scripture is set out by several <i>
    metaphors</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">He is compared to the "rose of Sharon," Song of Solomon 
    2:1. The rose is the queen of flowers. So sweet is this rose of the heavenly 
    paradise, that it makes us a sweet savor to God, Ephesians 1:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is compared to "a pearl of great price," Matthew 
    13:46. Other pearls add no real worth to those who wear them; but Christ, 
    this illustrious pearl, does! He makes us worthy through His worthiness, 
    Ezekiel 16:14.</p>
<p align="justify">But among all the metaphors and allegories in Scripture, 
    none are more lively reveals and sets out the beauty of Christ, than this 
    one of "the vine." He calls Himself here "the <i>true </i>vine." The vine, 
    said Pliny, is to be ranked the highest among all the plants that grow.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. Jesus Christ is a spiritual vine.</p></b></font> 
    The analogies are these:
<p align="justify">The vine is, of itself, weak and must be supported and 
    borne up. Just so, the human nature of Christ was, of itself, weak and 
    needed to be supported and under-propped with the Divine nature.</p>
<p align="justify">The vine grows in the garden not in the forest; so 
    Christ, this blessed Vine, grows in the garden of the church. He is not 
    known among the heathen; they, being forest ground, are not the better for 
    this vine.</p>
<p align="justify">The vine communicates to the branches. Believers are 
    called "branches of the vine," verse 5. Christ shoots up His sap of grace 
    into these branches. "From the fullness of his grace we have all received 
    one blessing after another," John 1:16. Then let not the branches grow 
    proud; all comes from the root of the vine. The saints' gifts and graces are 
    derived from Christ; therefore, He calls the spouse's graces His graces. "I 
    have gathered <i>my </i>myrrh," not <i>your </i>myrrh, Song of Solomon 5:1. 
    The branch has nothing, but what it receives from the root.</p>
<p align="justify">The vine has rare delicious fruit growing on it; it bears 
    sweet clusters. The promises are the clusters of grapes growing on Christ, 
    the true Vine. The promises are said to be in Him, 2 Corinthians 1:20. The 
    promises are made in Christ, and grow upon Him as fruit on the tree.</p>
<p align="justify">There are many things about the vine useful besides the 
    fruit. The <i>leaves </i>which grow on it, said Pliny, have a physical 
    virtue to allay fevers and inflamations; the <i>gum </i>that distills from 
    it is good against leprosy. So it is with this spiritual Vine, the Lord 
    Jesus. He is exceedingly useful and full of virtue. There is virtue in His 
    sufferings, resurrection, and intercession. He pleads for us, as the 
    advocate for the client. He perfumes our holy things with His incense. 
    Christ's prayer is the cause why our prayers are accepted. Such various 
    excellency is in this Vine.</p>
<p align="justify">See the different virtues in Christ to the godly and the 
    wicked. To the godly, He is a Vine full of comfort; to the wicked, he is not 
    a Vine—but a Rock of offense. The godly feed on Him; the wicked stumble on 
    Him. The wicked are offended at the baseness of Christ's person, the 
    spirituality of His doctrine, and the strictness of His laws; but to the 
    godly, He is a Vine yielding most fragrant, delicious fruit.</p>
<p align="justify">See the misery of men living and dying in sin. They are 
    not implanted into Christ; therefore, they do not at all partake of His 
    various fullness. The vine communicates influence only to its own <i>
    branches</i>. The wild olive tree has no fruit from the vine. Such as abide 
    in the old stock of nature, branches of the wild olive, have no benefit from 
    Christ. It is <i>cold comfort </i>to the reprobate part of the world, that 
    there is a Vine growing which bears the fruit of salvation. As long as they 
    remain strangers to Christ and hate to be united with Him—fire will come out 
    of this Vine to devour them!</p>
<p align="justify">See the goodness of God! When we had forfeited the fruit 
    of paradise, He gave us a better tree than any which grew there. He has 
    enriched us with a pleasant Vine. When Christ suffered, now was this blessed 
    Vine nailed to the cross; now it was cut and bled; and salvation comes to us 
    in the blood of this Vine. The <i>gleaning grapes </i>here—are better than 
    the world's vintage. This spiritual Vine cheers the heart, Psalm 104:15. Are 
    we sad in the sense of our sins, and think ourselves unworthy to the Lord's 
    table? This wine of Christ's blood is a cordial. It is both the <i>price </i>
    and <i>seal </i>of our pardon.</p>
<p align="justify">Also, the vine has a <i>strengthening </i>virtue. So, by 
    tasting the fruit of this Vine—we renew our strength. In the holy 
    celebration of the Lord's Supper, fresh influence and nourishment is 
    communicated to us. This spiritual Vine invigorated the saints and martyrs 
    of old, and infused a spirit of magnanimity into them.</p>
<p align="justify">That I may raise the saints' esteem of Christ, and that 
    they may come to the sacred supper with more eagerness to drink His blood,
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>I shall show wherein this true Vine surpasses in 
    glory all other vine trees.</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In the vine, there is something not useful. </p></b>
</font>Though the fruit of the vine is sweet—yet the wood of the vine is not 
    useful; it is good for nothing. "Is wood ever taken from it to make anything 
    useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?" Ezekiel 15:3. But it 
    is not so with Christ; there is nothing in this Vine which is not useful. We 
    have need of Christ's human nature to suffer—and His Divine nature to 
    satisfy. We have need of all of His offices, influences, and privileges. 
    There is nothing in Christ we can be without.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There are varieties of vine trees—but there is one 
    true Vine that brings redemption to mankind.</p></b></font> The papists would 
    fetch comfort from more besides Christ—from the angels and the virgin Mary. 
    The angels themselves are indebted to this Vine, the Lord Jesus. They are by 
    Christ confirmed in their obedience, so that they cannot fall; and as for 
    the virgin Mary, though she was Christ's <i>mother</i>—yet she calls Christ 
    her <i>Savior</i>, Luke 1:47. The virgin Mary is saved not by bearing the 
    Vine—but by being engrafted into the Vine!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The vine bears but one sort of fruit—only grapes; but 
    the Lord Jesus bears several sorts of fruit.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">This Vine bears the fruit of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    justification</b></font>. "Being justified through His blood," Romans 5:9. 
    In justification, there is remission of sin and imputation of righteousness. 
    A believer triumphs more in the imputed righteousness of Christ—than if he 
    had Adam's righteousness in innocence; nay, than if he had the angels' 
    righteousness, for now he has the righteousness of God! 2 Corinthians 5:21. 
    Without this, a sinner is put into a continual fever of conscience; but, by 
    virtue of justification, he arrives at a holy serenity. "Being, justified by 
    faith, we have peace with God," Romans 5:1.</p>
<p align="justify">This Vine bears the fruit of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    sanctification</b></font>. "He is made to us sanctification," 1 Corinthians 
    1:30. A man may have pleasant fruits growing in his orchard—and others be 
    never the better for it; but holiness in Christ is diffusive. This fruit is 
    for all the elect; they are made holy with Christ's holiness.</p>
<p align="justify">This spiritual Vine bears the fruit of
    <font color="#b07050"><b>consolation</b></font>. "His fruit was sweet to my 
    taste," Song of Solomon 2:3. When a believer has tasted some of this fruit 
    from Christ, he has had such transfigurations of soul and been filled with 
    such rapturous delight that he could be ready to say as Paul, "Whether in 
    the body I cannot tell." He has been put in heaven before his time.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A branch may be cut off and separated from the 
    vine—but no branch shall ever be separated from Christ, this heavenly Vine.</p></b></font> 
    Some tell us that a justified person may fall away finally. Is not Christ a 
    perfect Vine? He is not perfect if a living branch may be plucked off from 
    Him. Has not Christ said of His elect, "I give them eternal life, and they 
    will never perish—ever! No one will snatch them out of My hand!" John 10:28. 
    If any branch is plucked away from Christ, it is either because Christ is 
    not <i>able </i>to keep it—or because He is <i>willing </i>to lose it. He is 
    surely <i>able </i>to keep it, for He is strengthened with the Godhead; and 
    He is not <i>willing </i>to lose it, for why, then, would He have shed His 
    blood for it? So that no branch shall ever be separated from the celestial 
    Vine. You may sooner pluck a star out of the sky—than a true believer from 
    Christ. Indeed, hypocrites who look like branches, fall off—but they were 
    never really in the Vine. They were in Christ by <i>profession</i>, not by
    <i>union</i>. They were <i>tied </i>on to the vine but not <i>engrafted</i>. 
    An elect branch can no more perish than the root!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The wine that comes from the true Vine, is better than 
    any other.</p></b></font> Wine from the grape delights the palate; but Christ's 
    blood cheers the conscience.
<p align="justify">One may take too great a quantity of wine—and then it 
    bites as an adder! But it is otherwise with the wine which Christ gives; we 
    cannot have too much of it, as a man cannot have too much health. Christ's 
    blood is pardoning and pacifying, and the more we drink of it, the better; 
    the deeper it is, the sweeter, Song of Solomon 5:1. The death of the soul is 
    not by drinking too much of Christ's blood—but by refusing to drink.</p>
<p align="justify">Wine will cheer a man when he is living, not when he is 
    dead. Wine in a dead man's mouth loses its virtue—but Christ's blood has 
    such a life-giving virtue in it. It so sparkles, and is so full of spirits, 
    that it will fetch life in those that are dead. If they are dead in sin, the 
    blood of Christ makes them revive. "He who drinks My blood has eternal 
    life," John 6:54.</p>
<p align="justify">The wine which comes from the grape only cheers <i>man's
    </i>heart—but that wine that is distilled from Christ, the heavenly Vine, 
    cheers <i>God's </i>heart. The Lord smelled a sweet savor in the wine of 
    God's blood, and was so infinitely pleased and delighted with it—that for 
    this He spared all His people.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE. </p></b></font>Labor to be real branches of this 
    spiritual Vine. What was the old world the better—to <i>hear </i>of an ark 
    unless they got <i>into </i>the ark? So, what are we the better to <i>hear
    </i>of a Vine unless we are <i>in </i>this Vine?
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <i>How shall we know that we are in this Vine?</i></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. By being engrafted into the Vine. Faith is the
    <i>engrafting </i>grace. And herein, faith has a peculiar excellency above 
    other graces. Other graces make us <i>like </i>Christ—but faith makes us <i>
    one with </i>Christ. Other graces make us living <i>pictures </i>of 
    Christ—but faith makes us living <i>branches </i>of Christ. By love and 
    humility we <i>imitate </i>Christ—but by faith we are <i>implanted </i>into 
    Him, as the scion is engrafted into the tree. Let us, therefore, examine 
    whether we have this engrafting grace. Faith admires Christ's beauty, 
    confides in His merits, and submits to His laws. Faith gives up its will, 
    its love, and its life to Christ. Faith has <i>two hands</i>; with one it 
    takes Christ for its sin-offering, with the other it gives up itself to 
    Christ as a burnt-offering.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. We may know we are in the Vine by receiving <b>
    influence </b>from the Vine.</p>
<p align="justify">A <b>vital </b>influence. "The Son gives <i>life </i>to 
    whom He is pleased to give it," John 5:21. And this life from Christ is 
    evidenced by feeling. We are sensible of the first ebullitions and risings 
    of corruption, Romans 7:23, and of the least ebbings of grace. "Who have 
    their senses exercised to discern both good and evil," Hebrews 5:14.</p>
<p align="justify">A <b>sanctifying </b>influence. The root of this Vine, 
    being holy, makes all the branches holy. Has Christ diffused some of His 
    divine unction into us? Are our hearts consecrated? Do we set ourselves 
    against every evil—as against poison? Do we forsake sin not only out of 
    policy—but antipathy? Are we, by the power of grace, transformed and made 
    partakers of the Divine nature? Are we meek, humble, and zealous? Is the 
    frame of our heart spiritual? Does our pulse still beat after God? Is our 
    aim sincere? Do we not only <i>advance </i>God's glory—but <i>aim </i>at 
    God's glory? Behold here, a sanctifying virtue derived from Christ into us! 
    We need not doubt but we are branches of the true Vine—and shall grow and 
    flourish in Him to eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">Also, you who are believers stand and wonder that, when 
    you were by nature the <i>vine of Sodom</i>, Deuteronomy 32:32, a vine 
    wallowing in your blood, Ezekiel 19:10, a <i>wild vine </i>which not only <i>
    cumbered </i>the ground, but <i>poisoned </i>it—that God should take such 
    degenerate branches and plant you into Christ, and make you partake of the 
    spiritual juice and fat of this Vine! Oh, the unfathomable depth of God's 
    love! </p>
<p align="justify">You who are the branches of this Vine, let me beseech you 
    to love the Vine which bears you—kiss and embrace Christ! Let your souls 
    sound forth hallelujahs to the whole <i>Trinity</i>. Admire God the <i>
    Father </i>in sending a Vine from heaven; admire God the <i>Son </i>who was 
    a bleeding Vine for you; admire God the <i>Holy Spirit </i>who has, by His 
    mighty power, implanted you into this Vine. Turn all your sullen 
    discontentments, into triumphant songs! You who were once dead—are now made 
    living branches! You who were once unclean—are now made holy branches! You 
    who once brought forth thistles—you now bear luscious grapes! Oh, make 
    melody in your hearts to the Lord! Admire and celebrate free grace! It is 
    well that there is an eternity coming—and that will be little enough time to 
    praise God!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE.</p></b></font> Here is <b>consolation </b>to all who are 
    implanted into Christ, this spiritual Vine. Let the times be what they will, 
    you have never so much cause to be sad—as you have to rejoice. "As 
    sorrowful—yet always rejoicing," 2 Corinthians 6:10. Hearken to me, you 
    branch of Christ. What if you have little in the world, seeing you partake 
    of the blessing of the Vine, even of all the fullness of God, Ephesians 
    3:19.
<p align="justify">What if you are reproached? It is honor enough that you 
    are in Christ. This Vine, being a plant of renown, casts a glory upon all 
    the branches, Isaiah 28:5. What if you are told by the tempter, that Christ 
    does not love you? You may reply, "I am engrafted into Christ! The holy sap 
    of His grace is infused into me!"</p>
<p align="justify">What if you are are persecuted? Be of good cheer; you 
    have a life hidden in the Vine. "Your life is hidden with Christ," 
    Colossians 3:3. Fear not. If you cannot live without molestation in this 
    earthly wilderness, you shall grow in paradise! When Basil was threatened 
    with banishment, he comforted himself with this, "Either I shall be <i>under
    </i>heaven or <i>in </i>heaven." Oh, how may all the branches of the true 
    Vine flourish with joy! Let death come, they may triumph. <i>Death shall 
    destroy sin—and perfect grace!</i></p>

<p align="justify">In particular, there is <font color="#0000ff"><b>COMFORT
    </b></font>to all the real branches of Christ in these four cases:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It is comfort under fear of spiritual barrenness.</p></b></font> 
    "I am
<p align="justify">afraid," says the saint, "that I shall grow dead at last 
    and be like that barren fig tree in the gospel, which was cursed." But, for 
    your comfort, know that the branches of this spiritual Vine never cease 
    yielding fruit. Indeed, ordinary vine trees, though they are, for a time, 
    fruitful—yet, when they grow old, they grow barren; but the branches of the 
    true Vine are never so old as to be past bearing fruit. "They shall still 
    bring forth fruit in old age," Psalm 92:14. Believers, the longer they 
    live—the more they live of faith, 2 Thessalonians 1:3, the more they are 
    perfumed with Christ's love. The church of Thyatira, the <i>older </i>she 
    grew, the <i>better </i>she grew. Her <i>last </i>works were more than her 
    first, Revelation 2:19. What a great deal of fruit, did <i>Paul </i>bring 
    forth not long before his death! This light shone brighter before his 
    setting. "I labored more abundantly than they all," 1 Corinthians 15:10.<i> 
    As long as there is a fullness in Christ, believers shall not lack. </i>This 
    holy Vine, being replenished with sap, the branches cannot fail to be 
    fertile. "Because I live—you shall live also," John 14:19. Because the <i>
    root </i>lives, therefore the <i>branches </i>shall flourish with fruit!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is comfort in wrongs and injuries, especially when 
    endured for Christ's sake.</p></b></font> The Lord Jesus is sensible of this, 
    and will one day vindicate His people. The Vine is sensible of all the 
    injury done to the branches. "I have seen, I have seen the affliction of My 
    people," Acts 7:34. Not only have I seen them with an eye of <i>inspection</i>—but
    <i>affection</i>. Christ bleeds in the saints' wounds. He who knows their 
    sufferings, feelingly will avenge them speedily.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. It is comfort under fear of falling away.</p></b></font> 
    "I am afraid," said a Christian, "that I shall tire before I get to heaven. 
    Either I shall be blown down by Satan's temptations—or faint under 
    sufferings." Oh, remember you are a branch in Christ, and you cannot be 
    broken off! Adam, when he grew upon his <i>own root of innocence</i>, 
    withered; but you grow upon <i>Christ's root</i>. Therefore, your grace 
    shall flourish into perseverance. Though you are but as a branch which hangs 
    on a tree—you will never drop off because Christ holds you! It is not your 
    holding Christ—but His holding you, which preserves you. He repels the force 
    of temptation, overpowers the remains of indwelling corruption, and 
    increases the spark of grace. "We are kept by the power of God," 1 Peter 
    1:5. The Greek word means "kept as in a garrison."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. It is comfort when the world hates us. </p></b></font>
    Jerome blessed God that he was counted worthy, to be one whom the world 
    hated. What if you are maligned and hated? God loves all the branches of the 
    true Vine; nay, He loves them as He loves the root. "That the world may know 
    that You have loved them—<i>as</i> You have loved Me," John 17:23. It is the 
    same love for kind, though not degree.
<p align="justify">God the Father loved Christ from eternity. "You love Me 
    before the foundation of the world," John 17:24. And so He loves believers. 
    "He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world," Ephesians 1:4. 
    Our love to God began late. We may remember the time when we had no love in 
    our hearts sparkling towards God. But God's love to us, bears date from 
    eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">God's love to Christ is a love of immutability, and so it 
    is to believers. The sun of electing love, having risen upon them—never 
    sets. Death may take away their life—but not God's love. "Though the 
    mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet My unfailing love for you 
    will not be shaken nor My covenant of peace be removed," says the Lord, who 
    has compassion on you." Isaiah 54:10. The Lord may change His love into a<i> 
    frown</i>—but He will never change His love into <i>hatred</i>. God can no 
    more hate a believer than He can Christ, for a believer is part of Christ. 
    He is Christ-mystical. What a comfort is this! God loves the branches as 
    much as He loves the Root, and the <font color="#008000"><b>fruit of God's 
    love to the elect branches, appears in two things:</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">In <b>pruning </b>them. "I am the true vine, and my 
    Father is the gardener. Every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes so that 
    it will be even more fruitful." John 15:1-2. He prunes them by affliction. 
    We are apt to think that, when God afflicts us, He does not love us. A 
    farmer loves his vine never a whit less, because he prunes it. Affliction is 
    God's pruning knife. He prunes us to make us bring forth the peaceable fruit 
    of righteousness, Hebrews 12:11. God would rather have the branches bleed, 
    than be barren. All this is love. It is God's love, that He will rather lop 
    and prune the branches than let them grow wild.</p>
<p align="justify">In <b>transplanting </b>them to heaven. The branches of 
    Christ will thrive best when they are transplanted; and good reason, because 
    then they will grow in a better soil. Christ desires to have all His 
    branches, which are scattered up and down in the world, to be with Him. 
    "Father, I desire those You have given Me to be with Me where I am." John 
    17:24. The elect will never be happy—until they are transplanted to the 
    heavenly garden; then they will grow quietly. In heaven, there will be no 
    bramble to tear the vine branches; none of the red dragon's race. Then all 
    the branches will be sweetly united in love. Then they shall grow in the 
    sunshine. God's countenance will be ever shining upon them. In this life, 
    they partake of God's <i>grace</i>; hereafter, they shall partake of His <i>
    glory!</i></p>
