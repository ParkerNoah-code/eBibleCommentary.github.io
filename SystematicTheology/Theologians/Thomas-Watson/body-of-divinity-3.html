<font size="4">7. The HOLINESS of God</font></p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's holiness. "Glorious in 
    holiness." Holiness is the most sparkling jewel of his crown; it is the name 
    by which God is known. "Holy and reverend is his name." He is "the holy 
    One." Seraphim cry, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty, the whole earth 
    is full of his glory." His <i>power </i>makes him mighty; his <i>holiness
    </i>makes him glorious. God's holiness consists in his perfect love of 
    righteousness, and perfect abhorrence of evil. He is "of purer eyes than to 
    behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. God is holy INTRINSICALLY.</p></b></font> He is holy in 
    his <b>nature</b>; his very being is made up of holiness, as light is of the 
    essence of the sun. He is holy in his <b>Word</b>. The Word bears a stamp of 
    his holiness upon it, as the wax bears an impression of the seal. "Your Word 
    is very pure." It is compared to silver refined seven times. Every line in 
    the Word breathes sanctity, it encourages nothing but holiness. God is holy 
    in his <b>works</b>. All he does is holy; he cannot act but like himself; he 
    can no more do an unrighteous action, than the sun can darken. "The Lord is 
    holy in all his works."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. God is holy PRIMARILY.</p></b></font> He is the original 
    and pattern of holiness. Holiness began with him who is the Ancient of Days.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. God is holy EFFICIENTLY.</p></b></font> He is the cause 
    of all that is holiness in others. "Every good and perfect gift comes from 
    above." He made the <i>angels </i>holy. He infused all holiness into 
    Christ's human nature. All the holiness <i>we </i>have, is but a crystal 
    stream from this fountain. We borrow all our holiness from God. As the 
    lights of the sanctuary were lighted from the middle lamp, so all the 
    holiness of others is a lamp lighted from heaven. "I am the Lord who makes 
    you holy." God is not only a <i>pattern </i>of holiness—but he is a <i>
    principle </i>of holiness. His spring feeds all our cisterns; he drops his 
    holy oil of grace upon us.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">IV. God is holy TRANSCENDENTLY. </p></b></font>"There is none 
    as holy as the Lord." No angel in heaven can measure the dimensions of God's 
    holiness. The highest seraphim is too low of stature to measure these 
    pyramids; holiness in God is far above holiness in saints or angels.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The holiness of God is above holiness in SAINTS.</p></b></font> 
    It is a pure holiness. The saints' holiness is like gold in the ore, 
    imperfect; their humility is stained with pride; he who has most faith needs 
    pray, "Lord, help my unbelief!" But the holiness of God is pure, like wine 
    from the grape; it has not the least dash or tincture of impurity mixed with 
    it. It is an unchangeable holiness. Though the saints cannot lose the <i>
    principle </i>of holiness (for the seed of God remains in them)—yet they may 
    lose some <i>degrees </i>of their holiness. "You have left your first love." 
    Grace cannot die—yet the flame of it may burn very dim. Holiness in the 
    saints is subject to ebbing—but holiness in God is unchangeable; he never 
    lost a drop of his holiness. As he cannot have <i>more </i>holiness, because 
    he is perfectly holy; so he cannot have <i>less </i>holiness, because he is 
    unchangeably holy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The holiness of God is above the holiness of ANGELS.</p></b></font> 
    Holiness in the angels is only a quality, which may be lost, as we see in 
    the fallen angels; but holiness in God is his essence, he is all over holy, 
    and he can as well lose his Godhead as his holiness.
<p align="justify">But is he not privy to all the sins of men? How can he 
    behold their impurities, and not be defiled?</p>
<p align="justify">God sees all the sins of men—but is no more defiled with 
    them than the sun is defiled with the vapors which rise from the earth. God 
    sees sin, not as a <i>patron </i>to approve it—but as a <i>judge </i>to 
    punish it.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one:</p></b></font> Is God so infinitely holy?
    <font color="#b07050"><b>Then see how unlike to God, sin is. </b></font>Sin 
    is an unclean thing, it is hyperbolically evil. Sin is called an 
    abomination. <i>God </i>has no mixture of evil in him; <i>sin </i>has no 
    mixture of good. Sin is the quintessence of evil, it turns good into evil. 
    Sin has deflowered the virgin soul, made it red with guilt, and black with 
    filth. Sin is called the accursed thing. No wonder, therefore, that God 
    hates sin, being so unlike to him; nay, so contrary to him. Sin strikes at 
    his holiness; it does all it can to spite God; if sin could help it—God 
    would be God no longer.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: </p></b></font>Is God the Holy One, and is holiness 
    his glory?<font color="#b07050"> <b>How impious are those who are HATERS of 
    holiness! </b></font>As the vulture hates perfumes, so they hate the sweet 
    perfume of holiness in the saints; their hearts rise in antipathy against 
    holiness. There is not a greater sign of a person devoted to hell, than to 
    hate one for the thing wherein he is most like God. 
<p align="justify">Others are <b>despisers </b>of holiness. They despise the 
    glory of the Godhead. "Glorious in holiness." The despising holiness is seen 
    in deriding it; and is it not sad that men should deride that which should 
    save them? Surely, that patient will die who derides the only remedy. 
    Deriding the grace of the Spirit comes near to despising the Spirit of 
    grace. Scoffing Ishmael was cast out of Abraham's house. Such as scoff at 
    holiness, shall be cast out of heaven.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: </p></b></font>Is God so infinitely holy?
    <font color="#b07050"><b>Then let us endeavor to imitate God in holiness.
    </b></font>"Be holy, for I am holy." There is a twofold holiness; a holiness 
    of <i>equality</i>, and a holiness of <i>similitude</i>. A holiness of <i>
    equality, </i>no man or angel can reach to. Who can be equally holy with 
    God? Who can parallel him in sanctity? But there is a holiness of 
    similitude, and that we must aspire after—to have some analogy and 
    resemblance of God's holiness in us—to be as like him in holiness as much as 
    we can. Though a candle does not give so much light as the sun—yet it 
    resembles it. We must imitate God in holiness.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">If we must be like God in holiness, wherein does our 
    holiness consist?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">In two things. In our suitableness to God's nature, and 
    in our subjection to his will.</p>
<p align="justify">Our holiness consists in our <b>suitableness to the 
    nature of God</b>. Hence the saints are said to partake of the divine 
    nature, which is not partaking of his essence—but his image. Herein is the 
    saints' holiness, when they are the lively pictures of God. That is—when 
    they bear the image of God's meekness, mercifulness, heavenliness; when they 
    are of the same judgment with God, of the same disposition; when they love 
    what he loves, and hate what he hates.</p>
<p align="justify">Our holiness consists also in our <b>subjection to the 
    will of God</b>. As God's <i>nature </i>is the pattern of holiness; so his
    <i>will </i>is the rule of holiness. It is our holiness, when we do his 
    will; when we bear his will; when what he inflicts wisely we suffer 
    willingly. Our great care should be, to be like God in holiness. Our 
    holiness should be like God's; as his is a <i>real </i>holiness, ours should 
    be. "Righteousness and <i>true </i>holiness." It should not be the <i>paint
    </i>of holiness—but the <i>reality </i>of holiness. It should not be like 
    the Egyptian temples, beautified on the outside merely—but like Solomon's 
    temple, gold within, Psalm 45:13. "The king's daughter is all glorious 
    within." That I may press you to resemble God in holiness consider,</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) How illustrious every holy person is.</p></b></font> He 
    is a mirror in which some of the beams of God's holiness shine forth. We 
    read that Aaron put on his garments for glory and beauty. When we wear the
    <i>embroidered garment of holiness</i>, it is for glory and beauty. A good 
    Christian is ruddy, being sprinkled with Christ's blood; and white, being 
    adorned with holiness. As the diamond to a ring, so is holiness to the soul. 
    Those who oppose our holiness, cannot but admire it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is the great design God carries on in the world, 
    to make a people like himself in holiness.</p></b></font> What are all the 
    showers of <i>ordinances </i>for—but to rain down righteousness upon us, and 
    make us holy? What are the <i>promises </i>for—but to encourage holiness? 
    What is the sending of the <i>Holy Spirit </i>into the world for—but to 
    anoint us with the holy unction? What are all <i>afflictions </i>for—but to 
    make us partakers of God's holiness? What are <i>mercies </i>for—but magnets 
    to draw us to holiness? What is the end of Christ's dying—but that his blood 
    might wash away our unholiness? "Who gave himself for us—to purify unto 
    himself a peculiar people." So that if we are not holy—we cross God's great 
    design in the world.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Our holiness draws God's heart to us. </p></b></font>
    Holiness is God's image; and God cannot choose but love his image where he 
    sees it. A king loves to see his effigies upon coins. "You love 
    righteousness." And where does righteousness grow—but in a holy heart? "You 
    shall be called Hephzibah, for the Lord delights in you." It was her 
    holiness that drew God's love to her. "They shall call them the holy 
    people." God does not value any for their high birth—but only for their 
    holiness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Holiness is the only thing that distinguishes us 
    from the reprobate part of the world. </p></b></font>God's people have his seal 
    upon them. "The foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, the Lord 
    knows those who are his. And let all who name the name of Christ depart from 
    iniquity." The people of God are sealed with a double seal. Election, "The 
    Lord knows who are his;" and Sanctification, "Let every one depart from 
    iniquity." As a virtuous woman is distinguished from a harlot by her 
    chastity; so holiness distinguishes between the believer and the unbeliever. 
    All who are of God, have Christ for their captain, and holiness is the white 
    color they wear. Heb 2:20.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Holiness is our honor. </p></b></font>Holiness and honor 
    are put together. I Thess 4:4. Dignity goes along with sanctification. "He 
    has <i>washed </i>us from our sins in his blood, and has made us <i>kings
    </i>unto God." When we are washed and made holy, then we are kings and 
    priests to God. The saints are called vessels of honor; they are called 
    jewels, for the sparkling of their holiness, because filled with wine of the 
    Spirit. This makes them earthly angels.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Holiness gives us boldness with God.</p></b></font> "You 
    shall put away iniquity far from your tabernacles, and shall lift up your 
    face unto God." Lifting up the face is an emblem of boldness. Nothing can 
    make us so ashamed to go to God, as sin. A wicked man in prayer may lift up 
    his hands—but he cannot lift up his face. When Adam had lost his holiness, 
    he lost his confidence with God; he hid himself. But the holy person goes to 
    God as a child to its father; his conscience does not upbraid him with 
    allowing any sin, therefore he can go boldly to the throne of grace, and 
    have mercy to help in time of need.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Holiness gives peace.</p></b></font> Sin raises a storm 
    in the conscience; where there is sin, there is tumult. "There is no peace 
    to the wicked." Righteousness and peace are put together. Holiness is the 
    root which bears this sweet fruit of peace; righteousness and peace kiss 
    each other.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(8.) Holiness leads to heaven.</p></b></font> It is the King 
    of heaven's highway. "An highway shall be there, and it shall be called the 
    way of holiness." At Rome there were temples of virtue and honor, and all 
    were to go through the temple of <i>virtue—</i>to the temple of honor. Just 
    so, we must go through the temple of <i>holiness </i>to the temple of <i>
    heaven</i>. Glory begins in virtue. "Who has called us to glory and virtue." 
    Happiness is nothing else but the quintessence of holiness; holiness is 
    glory militant, and happiness holiness triumphant.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What shall we do to resemble God in holiness?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Have recourse to Christ's blood by faith. </p></b>
</font>This is the washing of the soul. Legal purifications were types and 
    emblems of it.<i> The Scripture is a mirror to show us our sins; Christ's 
    blood is a fountain to wash them away.
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Pray for a holy heart.</p></b></font> "Create in me a 
    clean heart, O God." Lay your heart before the Lord, and say, "Lord, my 
    heart is full of leprosy; it defiles all that it touches! Lord, I am not fit 
    to live with such a heart, for I cannot honor you; nor die with such a 
    heart, for I cannot see you. Oh create in me a clean heart; send your Spirit 
    into me, to refine and purify me, that I may be a temple fit for you, the 
    holy God to inhabit!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Walk with those who are holy.</p></b></font> "He who 
    walks with the wise shall be wise." Be among the spices—and you will absorb 
    their fragrance. Association begets assimilation. Nothing has a greater 
    power and energy to effect holiness, than the communion of saints.
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">8. The JUSTICE of God</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's justice. All God's attributes 
    are in unity, and are the same with his essence. Though he has several 
    attributes whereby he is made known to us—yet he has but one essence. A 
    cedar tree may have several branches—yet it is but one cedar. So there are 
    several attributes of God whereby we conceive of him—but only one entire 
    essence. Well, then, concerning God's justice. "Just and righteous is he." 
    "His justice and great righteousness." God is said to dwell in justice. 
    "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne." Psalm 89:14. 
    In God, <i>power </i>and <i>justice </i>meet. Power holds the scepter, and 
    justice holds the balance.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. What is God's justice?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Justice is to give everyone his due." God's justice is 
    the rectitude of his nature, whereby he is carried to the doing of that 
    which is righteous and equal. "Shall not he render to every man according to 
    his works?" God is an impartial judge. He judges the cause. Men often judge 
    the person—but not the cause; which is not justice—but malice. "I will go 
    down and <i>see </i>whether they have done according to the cry which is 
    come up unto me." When the Lord is upon a punitive act, he weighs things in 
    the balance; he does not punish rashly. Concerning God's justice, I shall 
    lay down these six positions:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] God cannot but be just.</p></b></font> His holiness is 
    the cause of his justice. Holiness will not allow him to do anything but 
    what is righteous. He can no more be unjust, than he can be unholy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] God's will is the supreme rule of justice</p></b></font>; 
    it is the standard of equity. His will is <i>wise </i>and <i>good</i>. God 
    wills nothing but what is <i>just</i>; and therefore <i>it is just, because 
    he wills it.
</i><b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[3] God does justice, <i>naturally</i>.</p></font> </b>
    Justice flows from his nature. Men may act unjustly, because they are bribed 
    or forced to. But God will not be <i>bribed</i>, because of his justice; he 
    cannot be <i>forced</i>, because of his power. He does justice out of love 
    to justice. "You love righteousness."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Justice is the perfection of the divine nature.</p></b></font> 
    Aristotle says, "Justice comprehends in it all virtues." To say God is just, 
    is to say, he is all that is excellent; all perfections meet in him, as 
    lines in a center. He is not only just—but justice itself.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] God never did nor can do the least wrong to his 
    creatures.</p></b></font> God's justice has been wronged—but his justice never 
    did any wrong. God may not act according to the rigor of the law; he abates 
    something of his severity. He might inflict heavier penalties than he does. 
    "You have punished us less than our iniquities deserve." <i>Our mercies are 
    more than we deserve, and our punishments less.
</i><b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[6] God's justice is such that it is not fit for any man 
    or angel to expostulate with him, or demand a reason of his actions.</p></font>
</b>God has not only authority on his side—but equity. "I will make justice 
    the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line." Isa 28:17. It is below 
    him to give an account to us, of his proceedings. Which of these two should 
    prevail—God's justice or man's reason? "Who are you, O man, to talk back to 
    God? Shall what is formed say to him who formed it—Why did you make me like 
    this?" Romans 9:20. The plumb line of our reason is too short—to fathom the 
    depth of God's justice. Rom 11:33. "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the 
    wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments and 
    untraceable His ways!" We are to adore God's justice, where we cannot see 
    the reason of it.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. God's justice runs in two channels.</p></b></font> It is 
    seen in two things, the distribution of rewards and punishments.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] In rewarding the virtuous.</p></b></font> "Truly there is 
    a reward for the righteous." The saints shall not serve him for nothing; 
    though they may be losers <i>for </i>him, they shall not be losers <i>by </i>
    him. "God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love, which you 
    have showed to his name." He gives a reward, not because we have <i>deserved
    </i>it—but because he has <i>promised </i>it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] He is just in punishing offenders. </p></b></font>He is 
    just. (1.) Because he punishes sinners by a law. "Where there is no law, 
    there is no transgression." But God has given men a law, and they break it, 
    therefore he punishes them justly. (2.) God is just in punishing the wicked, 
    because he never punished them, but upon full proof and evidence. What 
    greater evidence than for a man's own conscience to be witness against him! 
    There is nothing God charges upon a sinner but conscience sets its seal to 
    the truth of it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See here another flower of God's crown—he is 
    just and righteous.</p></b></font> He is the exemplar and pattern of justice.
<b>
<p align="justify">How can it be consistent with God's justice, that the 
    wicked should prosper in the world? </p></b>"Why does the way of the wicked 
    prosper? Why do the treacherous live at ease?" Jeremiah 12:1. Such as are 
    highest in sin--are often highest in prosperity. This has led many to 
    question God's justice. Diogenes seeing a thief live on affluently, said, 
    "Surely God has cast off the government of the world, and does not care how 
    things go on here below."
<p align="justify">(1.) The wicked may be sometimes instruments to do God's 
    work. Though they do not <i>design </i>his glory—yet they may <i>promote </i>
    it. Cyrus was instrumental in the building of God's temple in Jerusalem. 
    There is some kind of justice, that they should have a temporal reward. God 
    lets those prosper under whose wing his people are sheltered. <i>God will 
    not be in any man's debt. </i>"Who has kindled a fire on my altar for 
    nothing?"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God lets men go on in sin, and prosper, that he may 
    leave them more inexcusable. "I gave her space to repent of her 
    fornication." God adjourns the sessions, spins out his mercies towards 
    sinners; and if they repent not, his patience will be a witness against 
    them, and his justice will be more cleared in their condemnation. "That you 
    might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) God does not always let the wicked prosper in their 
    sin. Some he punishes openly, that his justice may be taken notice of. "The 
    Lord is known by the judgment which he executes;" that is, his justice is 
    seen by striking men dead in the very act of sin. Thus he struck Zimri and 
    Cozbi in the act of uncleanness.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) If God lets men prosper a while in their sin, his 
    vial of wrath is all this while filling; his sword is all this time 
    sharpening. Though God may forbear with men a while—yet long forbearance is 
    no forgiveness. <i>The longer God is in taking his blow, the heavier it will 
    be at last! As long as there is eternity, God has time enough to reckon with 
    his enemies!</i></p>

<p align="justify">God's justice may be as a sleeping lion—but the lion will 
    awake at last, and roar upon the sinner! Do not Nero, and Julian, and Cain, 
    now meet with God's justice?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">But God's own people often suffer great afflictions</p></b></font>; 
    they are injured and persecuted. "This is what the wicked are like—always 
    carefree, they increase in wealth. Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; 
    in vain have I washed my hands in innocence. For I am afflicted all day 
    long, and punished every morning." Psalm 73:12-14. How can this be 
    consistent with God's justice?
<p align="justify">(I,) That is a true rule of Austin, <i>"God's ways of 
    judgment are sometimes <b>secret</b>—but never <b>unjust</b>!" </i>The Lord 
    never afflicts his people without a cause; he cannot be unjust towards them. 
    There is some good in the godly, therefore the wicked afflict them; there is 
    some evil in them, therefore God afflicts them. God's own children have 
    their blemishes. "But aren't you also guilty of sins against the Lord your 
    God?" 2 Chronicles 28:10. These spiritual diamonds—have they no <i>flaws</i>? 
    Do we not read of the <i>spots </i>of God's children? Are not they guilty of 
    much pride, censoriousness, passion, worldliness? Though, by their 
    profession, they should resemble the birds of paradise, to fly above, and 
    feed upon the dew of heaven; yet, as the serpent, they lick the dust. These 
    sins of God's people, do more provoke God than the sins of others. "The Lord 
    saw this and was filled with loathing. He was provoked to anger by his own 
    sons and daughters." Deut 32:19. The sins of others pierce Christ's side; 
    the sins of His people wound his heart. Therefore is not God just in all the 
    afflictions which befall them? "You only have I chosen of all the families 
    of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins." Amos 3:2. I 
    will punish you sooner, surer, sorer, than others.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The trials and sufferings of the godly, are to 
    refine and purify them. God's furnace is in Zion. Is it any injustice in God 
    to put his gold into the furnace to purify it? Is it any injustice in God, 
    by afflicting his people, to make them partakers of his holiness? What more 
    proclaims God's faithfulness, than to take such a course with them as may 
    make them better? "In faithfulness you have afflicted me."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) What injustice is it in God to inflict a less 
    punishment; in order to prevent a greater punishment? The best of God's 
    children have that in them which is meritorious of hell. Does God do them 
    any wrong, if he uses only the <i>rod</i>, where they have deserved the <i>
    scorpion</i>? Is the father unjust, if he only <i>corrects </i>his child, 
    who has deserved to be <i>disinherited</i>? If God deals so favorably with 
    his children, he only puts <i>wormwood </i>in their cup, whereas he might 
    put <i>fire </i>and <i>brimstone! </i>They should rather admire his mercy 
    than complain of his injustice.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How can it stand with God's justice, that all men being 
    equally guilty by nature, he does pass by one and save another? Why does he 
    not deal with all alike?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid." "Does 
    the Almighty pervert justice?"</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) God is not bound to give an account of his actions 
    to his creatures. If none may question a king, much less God. It is 
    sufficient that God is Lord paramount; he has a sovereign power over his 
    creatures, therefore can do no injustice. "Has not the potter power over the 
    clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to 
    dishonor?" God has liberty in his own bosom, to save one, and not another; 
    and his justice is not at all impeached or blemished. If two men owe you 
    money, you may, without any injustice, remit the debt to one, and exact it 
    of the other. If two malefactors are condemned to die, the king may pardon 
    the one and not the other: he is not unjust if he lets one suffer, because 
    he offended the law; nor if he saves the other, because he will make use of 
    his prerogative as he is king.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Though some are saved and others perish—yet there is 
    no unrighteousness in God; because, whoever perishes, his destruction is of 
    himself. "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself." God offers grace— and the 
    sinner refuses it. Is God bound to give grace? If a surgeon comes to heal a 
    man's wound, and he will not be healed—is the surgeon bound to heal him? "I 
    have called—and you refused." "Israel would not submit to me." Psalm 81:11. 
    God is not bound to <i>force </i>his mercies upon men. If they willfully 
    oppose the offer of grace, their sin is to be regarded as the cause of their 
    perishing, and not God's justice.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: See the difference between God and a great part 
    of the world.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">(1.) They are unjust in their courts of law—they pervert 
    justice. "They decree unrighteous decrees." The Hebrew word for a judge's <i>
    robe </i>signifies prevarication, deceit, or injustice, which is more often 
    true of the judge than of the robe. What is a good law without a good judge?
    <i>Injustice </i>lies in two things—either not to punish where there is a 
    fault, or, to punish where there is no fault. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Men are unjust in their dealings. This is, [1] In 
    using false weights. "The balances of deceit are in his hand." It is sad to 
    have the Bible in one hand, and false weights in the other. Or, [2] In 
    adulterating commodities. "Your wine is <i>mixed </i>with water," or when 
    bad grain is mixed with good, and sold for pure grain. I can never believe 
    he is good in the first table of the law—who is not good in the second. He 
    cannot be godly, who is not just. Though God does not bid you be as 
    omnipotent as he is—yet he bids you be as just as he is.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Imitate God in justice. </p></b></font>Let 
    Christ's golden maxim be observed, "in everything, do to others what you 
    would have them do to you." Matt 7:12. You would not have them wrong 
    you—neither must you wrong them; rather <i>suffer </i>wrong—than <i>do </i>
    wrong. "Why do you not rather <i>be </i>wronged?" Oh be exemplary for 
    justice! Let justice be your ornament. "I put on righteousness (namely, 
    justice) as a robe and a diadem." A robe for its graceful beauty; and I put 
    it on, [and I was clothed in righteousness]. A judge puts on his robe, and 
    takes it off again at <i>night</i>; but Job did so put on justice, as he did 
    not take it off until <i>death</i>. We must not lay off this robe of justice 
    until we lay down our bodies in the grave. If you have anything of God in 
    you, you will be like him. By every <i>unjust </i>action, you deny 
    yourselves to be Christians, you stain the glory of your profession. Heathen 
    will rise up in judgement against you. The sun might sooner alter his 
    course, than God could be turned from doing justice.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: If God is just, there will be a day of 
    judgement. </p></b></font>Now things are out of course; sin is rampant, saints 
    are wronged, they are often defeated in a righteous cause, they can meet 
    with no justice here, justice is turned into wormwood. But there is a day 
    coming, when God will set things right; he will do every man justice; he 
    will crown the righteous, and condemn the wicked. "He has appointed a day in 
    which he will judge the world" If God is a just God, he will take vengeance. 
    God has given men a law to live by, and they break it. There must be a day 
    for the execution of offenders. A law not executed is but like a wooden 
    dagger—for a show. At the last day, God's sword shall be drawn out against 
    offenders; then his justice shall be revealed before all the world. "God 
    will judge the world in righteousness." "Shall not the Judge of all the 
    earth do right?"<b> The wicked shall drink a sea of wrath—but not sip one 
    drop of injustice!</b> At that day shall all mouths be stopped, and God's 
    justice shall be fully vindicated from all the cavils and clamors of unjust 
    men.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: Comfort to the true penitent. </p></b></font>As God 
    is a just God, he will pardon him. If man acknowledges his sin—God spares 
    him. "If we confess our sins (that is confess and forsake), he is <i>just
    </i>to forgive us our sins." God is not only <i>merciful, </i>but <i>just</i>. 
    Why just? Because he has promised to forgive such. "He who conceals his sins 
    does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy." 
    Proverbs 28:13. If your heart has been broken <i>for </i>and <i>from </i>
    sin—you may not only plead God's <i>mercy</i>—but his <i>justice </i>for the 
    pardoning of your sin. Show him his promise, and he cannot deny himself.

<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">9. The MERCY of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's goodness or mercy. <i>Mercy
    </i>is the result and effect—of God's <i>goodness</i>. So then this is the 
    next attribute, God's goodness or mercy. The most learned of the heathens 
    thought they gave their God Jupiter two golden characters when they styled 
    him <i>good </i>and <i>great</i>. Both these meet in God, <i>goodness </i>
    and <i>greatness</i>; <i>mercy </i>and <i>majesty</i>. God is essentially 
    good <i>in </i>himself, and relatively good <i>to </i>us. "You <i>are </i>
    good, and <i>do </i>good." This relative goodness is nothing else but his 
    mercy, which is an innate propensity in God to pity and support such as are 
    in misery.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Concerning God's mercy, I shall lay down these twelve 
    positions.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] It is the great design of the Scripture to represent 
    God as merciful.</p></b></font> This is a loadstone to draw sinners to him. "I 
    am the Lord, I am the Lord, the merciful and gracious God. I am slow to 
    anger and rich in unfailing love and faithfulness. I show this unfailing 
    love to many thousands by forgiving every kind of sin and rebellion. Even so 
    I do not leave sin unpunished." Exodus 34:6-7. Here are six expressions to 
    set forth God's mercy, and but one to set forth his justice. "God's mercy is 
    far above the heavens." God is represented as a king, with a <i>rainbow </i>
    about his throne. Rev 4:4. The rainbow was an emblem of mercy. The Scripture 
    represents God in <i>white robes of mercy—</i>more often than with garments 
    rolled in blood; with his <i>golden scepter—</i>more often than his iron 
    rod.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] God is more inclined to mercy, than wrath.</p></b></font> 
    Mercy is his <i>darling </i>attribute, which he most delights in. "Who is a 
    God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant 
    of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show 
    mercy." Micah 7:18. Mercy pleases him. "It is delightful to the mother," 
    says Chrysostom, "to have her breasts drawn; so it is to God to have the 
    breasts of his mercy drawn." "Fury is not in me," that is, I do not delight 
    in it. Acts of severity are rather <i>forced </i>from God; he does not 
    afflict willingly. "For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to 
    the children of men." Lamentations 3:33. 
<p align="justify">The bee naturally gives honey, it stings only when it is 
    provoked. Just so, God does not punish until he can bear no longer. "So that 
    the Lord could bear no longer, because of the evil of your doings." Mercy is 
    God's right hand that he is most used to; inflicting punishment is called 
    his "strange work." He is not used to it. When the Lord would shave off the 
    pride of a nation, he is said to use a <i>hired </i>razor, as if he had none 
    of his own. "On that day the Lord will use a <i>razor hired </i>from beyond 
    the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave the head, the hair on the 
    legs, and to remove the beard as well." Isaiah 7:20. "He is <i>slow </i>to 
    anger," but "<i>ready </i>to forgive."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] There is no condition—but we may spy mercy in it. </p></b>
</font>When the church was in captivity, she cried out, "It is of the Lord's 
    mercies that we are not consumed." Geographers write of Syracuse in Sicily, 
    that it is so situated that the sun is never out of sight. In all 
    afflictions we may see some <i>sunshine of mercy</i>. That <i>outward </i>
    and <i>inward </i>troubles do not come together is mercy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Mercy sweetens all God's other attributes.</p></b></font> 
    God's holiness without mercy, and his justice without mercy—would be 
    dreadful. When the water was bitter, and Israel could not drink, Moses cast 
    a tree into the waters, and then they were made sweet. How bitter and 
    dreadful were the other attributes of God—did not mercy sweeten them! Mercy 
    sets God's power on work to help us; it makes his justice become our friend.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] God's mercy is one of the most orient pearls of his 
    crown; it makes his Godhead appear amiable and lovely.</p></b></font> When Moses 
    said to God, "I beseech you—show me your <i>glory</i>;" the Lord answered 
    him, "I will make all my <i>goodness </i>pass before you, and I will show 
    you <i>mercy</i>." God's mercy is his glory. His holiness makes him 
    illustrious; his mercy makes him endearing.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] Even the worst people taste God's mercy</p></b></font>. 
    Such as fight against God's mercy, taste of it; the wicked have some <i>
    crumbs </i>from <i>mercy's table</i>. "The Lord is good to <i>all</i>." 
    Sweet dewdrops are on the <i>thistle</i>, as well as on the <i>rose</i>. The 
    diocese where mercy visits is very large. Pharaoh's <i>head </i>was crowned, 
    though his <i>heart </i>was hardened.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] Mercy coming to us in salvation, is sweetest. </p></b>
</font>It was mercy that God would give Israel rain, and bread to the full, 
    and peace, and victory over their enemies—but it was a greater mercy that 
    God would be their God. To have <i>health </i>is a mercy—but to have <i>
    Christ </i>and salvation is a greater mercy. Saving mercy, is like the 
    diamond in the ring, which casts a more sparkling luster.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[8] One act of mercy engages God to another.</p></b></font> 
    Men argue thus, "I have shown you kindness already, therefore trouble me no 
    more." But, because God has shown saving mercy, he is more ready still to 
    show mercy. His mercy in election makes him justify, adopt, glorify; one act 
    of mercy engages God to more. A parent's love to his child makes him always 
    giving.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[9] All the mercy in the creature is derived from God, 
    and is but a drop from this ocean. </p></b></font>The mercy and pity a mother 
    has to her child, is from God; he who puts the milk in her breast puts the 
    compassion in her heart. God is called, "The <i>Father </i>of mercies," 
    because he begets all the mercies in the world. If God has put any kindness 
    into the creature, how much kindness is in him who is the Father of mercy!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[10] As God's mercy makes the saints <i>happy</i>—so it 
    should make them <i>humble</i>.</p></b></font> Mercy is not the fruit of <i>our
    </i>goodness—but the fruit of <i>God's </i>goodness. Mercy is a gift which 
    God bestows. They have no cause to be proud, who live upon the alms of God's 
    mercy. "If I am righteous—yet will I not lift up my head." That is, all my 
    righteousness is the effect of God's mercy, therefore I will be humble and 
    will not lift up my head.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[11] Mercy <i>stays </i>the speedy execution of God's 
    justice.</p></b></font> Sinners continually provoke God, and make "the fury come 
    up in his face." Why is it, that God does not immediately arrest and condemn 
    them? It is not that God <i>cannot </i>do it, for he is armed with 
    omnipotence—but it is from his mercy. Mercy gets a reprieve for the 
    sinner—and stops the speedy process of justice. God would, by his goodness, 
    lead sinners to repentance.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[12] It is dreadful to have mercy as a witness against 
    any one.</p></b></font> It was sad with Haman, when the <i>queen </i>herself 
    accused him. So will it be when this <i>queen of mercy </i>shall stand up 
    against a person and accuse him! It is only mercy that saves a sinner; how 
    sad then to have mercy become an enemy! If mercy is an accuser, who shall be 
    our advocate? The sinner never escapes hell, when <i>mercy </i>draws up the 
    indictment.
<p align="justify">I might show you several <b>kinds </b>of mercy—as 
    preventing mercy, sparing mercy, supplying mercy, guiding mercy, accepting 
    mercy, healing mercy, quickening mercy, supporting mercy, forgiving mercy, 
    correcting mercy, comforting mercy, delivering mercy, crowning mercy; but I 
    shall speak of,</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The qualifications or PROPERTIES of God's mercy.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] God's mercy is FREE. </p></b></font>To set up <i>merit—</i>is 
    to destroy mercy. We cannot <i>deserve </i>mercy, because we are polluted in 
    our blood; nor can we <i>force </i>God to show mercy—for then it would not 
    be mercy. We may force God to <i>punish </i>us—but not to <i>love </i>us. "I 
    will love them <i>freely</i>." Every link in the chain of salvation is 
    wrought and interwoven with free grace. Election is free. "He has <i>chosen
    </i>us in him, according to the good pleasure of his will." Justification is 
    free. "Being <i>justified </i>freely by his grace." Salvation is free. 
    "According to his mercy he <i>saved </i>us." Do not say, "I am <i>unworthy</i>, 
    therefore I cannot be saved;" for mercy is <i>free</i>. If God would show 
    mercy to such only as are worthy—he would show no mercy at all.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] God's mercy is an overflowing mercy; it is INFINITE.</p></b></font> 
    "Plenteous in mercy." "Rich in mercy." "Multitude of mercies." The vial of 
    wrath <i>drops</i>—but the fountain of mercy runs in <i>streams</i>. The sun 
    is not so full of light—as God is of mercy. God has <i>morning </i>mercies. 
    "His mercies are new every morning." He has <i>night </i>mercies. "In the 
    night his song shall be with me." God has mercies <i>under </i>heaven, which 
    we taste; and <i>in </i>heaven, which we hope for.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] God's mercy is ETERNAL.</p></b></font> "The mercy of the 
    Lord is from eternity to eternity." Psalm 103:17. "His mercy endures 
    forever," is repeated twenty-six times in Psalm 136. The souls of the 
    blessed shall be ever bathing themselves in this sweet and pleasant ocean of 
    God's mercy! God's anger to his children lasts but a while, "but his mercy 
    lasts forever." As long as he is God, he will be showing mercy. As his mercy 
    is <i>over</i>flowing, so it is <i>ever</i>-flowing.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: We are to look upon God in PRAYER, not in his 
    judgment robes—but clothed with a rainbow full of mercy and clemency.</p></b></font> 
    Add wings to prayer. When Jesus Christ ascended up to heaven, that which 
    made him go up there with joy was, "I go to my <i>Father!"</i> Just so, that 
    which should make our hearts ascend with joy in prayer, is, "We are going to 
    the <i>Father </i>of mercy, who sits upon the throne of grace!" Go to prayer 
    with confidence in God's mercy; as a cold person goes to a fire, saying, "it 
    will <i>warm </i>me, not <i>burn </i>me."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: BELIEVE in his mercy. </p></b></font>"I will trust 
    in the mercy of God forever." God's mercy is an <i>open fountain</i>. Let 
    down the <i>bucket of faith</i>—and you may drink of this fountain of 
    salvation. What greater encouragement to believe—than God's mercy? God 
    counts it his glory to be <i>scattering pardons</i>; he is desirous that 
    sinners should touch the golden scepter of his mercy, and live. <b>This 
    willingness in God to show mercy appears two ways:
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By <i>entreating </i>sinners to come and lay hold on 
    his mercy. "Whoever will, let him come, and take the water of life freely." 
    Mercy woos sinners, it even kneels down to beg them. It would be strange for 
    a prince to beg a condemned man to accept of pardon. God says, "Poor sinner, 
    allow me to love you, be willing to let me save you."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By his joyfulness when sinners lay hold on his 
    mercy. What is God the better, whether we receive his mercy or not? What is 
    the <i>fountain </i>profited that others drink of it? Yet such is God's 
    goodness, that he rejoices at the salvation of sinners, and is glad when his 
    mercy is accepted! When the prodigal son came home the father was glad, and 
    made a feast to express his joy; so, God rejoices when a poor sinner comes 
    in, and lays hold of his mercy. What an encouragement is here to believe in 
    God! He is a God of pardons. "You are a God of forgiveness, gracious and 
    merciful, slow to become angry, and <i>full of unfailing love and mercy</i>." 
    Neh 9:17. Mercy pleases him. "Where is another God like you, who pardons the 
    sins of the survivors among his people? You cannot stay angry with your 
    people forever, because you delight in showing mercy." Micah 7:18. </p>
<p align="justify">Nothing harms us but unbelief. Unbelief stops the current 
    of God's mercy from running. It shuts up God's affections, closes the 
    orifice of Christ's wounds, so that no healing virtue will come out. "He did 
    not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief." Why do you not 
    believe in God's mercy? Do your <i>sins </i>discourage you? God's mercy can 
    pardon great sins, nay, because they are great. "For the sake of your name, 
    O Lord, forgive my iniquity, though it is <i>great</i>." Psalm 25:11. The 
    sea covers the <i>rocks </i>as well as the <i>sands</i>. Some who had a hand 
    in crucifying Christ, found mercy. As far as the heavens are above the 
    earth, so far is God's mercy above our sins! What will entice us to believe, 
    if not the <i>mercy </i>of God?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Take heed of ABUSING the mercy of God. </p></b>
</font>Do not suck poison, out of the sweet flower of God's mercy. Do not 
    think that because God is merciful, you may go on in sin; this is to make 
    God's mercy your enemy. None might touch the ark but the <i>priests</i>, who 
    by their office were more holy. Just so, none may touch the ark of God's 
    mercy, but such as are resolved to be holy. To sin because God's mercy 
    abounds—is the devil's logic! He who sins because of God's mercy—is like one 
    who wounds his head because he has a plaster. He who sins because of God's 
    mercy—shall have judgement without mercy. Mercy <i>abused, </i>turns to <i>
    fury</i>. "Let none of those who hear the warnings of this curse consider 
    themselves immune, thinking, 'I am safe, even though I am walking in my own 
    stubborn way.' This would lead to utter ruin! The Lord will not pardon such 
    people. His anger and jealousy will burn against them. All the curses 
    written in this book will come down on them!" Deuteronomy 29:19-20. 
<p align="justify">Nothing is colder than <i>lead </i>when taken out of the 
    mine; and nothing more scalding when it is heated. Nothing is blunter than
    <i>iron</i>—yet nothing is sharper when it is whetted. Just so, nothing is 
    sweeter than mercy—when it is <i>improved</i>; yet nothing is fiercer than 
    mercy—when it is <i>abused! </i>"The mercy of the Lord is upon those who <i>
    fear </i>him." Mercy is not for those who sin and fear not—but for those who 
    fear and sin not. God's mercy is a <i>holy </i>mercy; where it pardons it 
    sanctifies.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What shall we do to be savingly interested in God's 
    mercy?</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Be sensible of your needs. </p></b>See how much you 
    stand in need of pardoning, saving mercy. See yourselves as <i>orphans</i>. 
    "In you, the fatherless find mercy." God bestows the <i>alms of mercy</i> 
    only on such as are <i>indigent</i>. Be emptied of all opinion of 
    self-worthiness. God pours the golden <i>oil of mercy </i>into <i>empty </i>
    vessels.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Go to God for mercy. </p></b>"Have mercy upon me, O 
    God!" "Do not put me off with <i>common </i>mercy, which reprobates may 
    have! Give me not only <i>acorns </i>but pearls! Give me not only mercy to 
    feed and clothe me—but mercy to <i>save </i>me! Give me the cream of your 
    mercies! Lord! let me have <i>saving </i>mercy and loving-kindness. Give me 
    such mercy as speaks your electing love to my soul."
<p align="justify">"Who <i>crowns </i>you with loving-kindness and tender 
    mercies." Oh pray for mercy! God has <i>treasures </i>of mercy! Prayer is 
    the key which opens these treasures; and in prayer, <i>be sure to carry 
    Christ in your arms</i>, for all the mercy comes through Christ! "So Samuel 
    took a young <i>lamb </i>and offered it to the Lord as a whole burnt 
    offering. He pleaded with the Lord to help Israel—and the Lord answered." 1 
    Samuel 7:9. Carry the <i>lamb Christ </i>in your arms, go in his name, 
    present his merits; say, "Lord! here is Christ's blood, which is the price 
    of my pardon! Lord! show me mercy, because Christ has purchased it!" Though 
    God may refuse us when we come for mercy in our <i>own </i>name—yet he will 
    not when we come in <i>Christ's </i>name. Plead Christ's atonement; this is 
    an argument which God cannot deny.</p>

<p align="justify">Use four: Such as have found mercy are exhorted to three 
    things—</p>
</font>
<p align="justify">(1.) To be upon Gerizim—the mount of blessing and 
    praising. </p></b>They have not only <i>heard </i>the King of heaven is 
    merciful—but they have <i>found </i>it so! The honeycomb of God's mercy has 
    dropped upon them! When in needs, mercy supplied them; when they were near 
    unto death, mercy raised them from the sick-bed; when covered with guilt, 
    mercy pardoned them. "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, 
    bless his holy name!" Oh, how should the vessels of mercy run over with 
    praise! "I used to scoff at the name of Christ. I hunted down his people, 
    harming them in every way I could. But God had mercy on me." 1 Timothy 1:13. 
    "I am a miracle of mercy! As the sea overflows and breaks down the banks, so 
    the mercy of God broke down the banks of my sin, and mercy sweetly flowed 
    into my soul!"
<p align="justify">You who have been <i>monuments of God's mercy</i>—should 
    be <i>trumpets of praise!</i> You who have tasted the Lord is gracious, tell 
    others what experiences you have had of God's mercy, that you may encourage 
    them to seek to him, for mercy. "I will tell you what God has done for my 
    soul." "When I found my heart dead, God's Spirit came upon me mightily, and 
    the blowing of that wind made the withering flowers of my grace revive!" Oh 
    tell others of God's goodness, that you may set others blessing him, and 
    that you may make God's praises live when you are dead.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) To love God. </p></b>Mercy should be the attraction of 
    love. "I will love you, O Lord, my strength." The Hebrew word for love 
    signifies, <i>to love out of the inward affections</i>. God's <i>justice </i>
    may make us fear him, his <i>mercy </i>makes us love him. If God's mercy 
    will not produce love, what will? We are to love God for giving us our <i>
    food</i>, much more for giving us <i>grace</i>. We are to love God for <i>
    sparing </i>mercy, much more for <i>saving </i>mercy. Surely, that heart is 
    made of marble, which the mercy of God will not dissolve into love. "I would 
    hate my own soul," says Augustine, "if I did not find it loving God."
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) To imitate God in showing mercy.</p></b> As God is the 
    Father of mercy, show yourselves to be his children—by being like him. 
    Ambrose says, "The sum and definition of true religion is—Be rich in works 
    of mercy, be helpful to the bodies and souls of others. Scatter your golden 
    seeds; let the lamp of your profession be filled with the <i>oil of love</i>. 
    Be merciful in giving and forgiving." "Be merciful—as your heavenly Father 
    is merciful."
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">10. The TRUTH of God.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The next attribute is God's truth. "A God of truth and 
    without iniquity; just and righteous is he." "For your mercy is great unto 
    the heavens, and your truth unto the clouds." "Plenteous in truth."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">God is the truth.</p></b> He is true in a physical sense; 
    true in his being: he has a real subsistence, and gives a being to others. 
    He is true in a moral sense; he is truth without error; truth without 
    deceit. God is<i> prima veritas</i>, the pattern and prototype of truth. 
    There is nothing true but what is <i>in </i>God—or comes <i>from </i>God.
<p align="justify">I shall speak of God's truth, as it is taken from his 
    veracity in making good his promises. "There has not failed one word of all 
    his good promise." The promise is God's pledge; God's truth is the seal set 
    to his pledge.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">There are two things to be observed in the promises of 
    God to comfort us. </p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Observe he POWER of God, whereby he is <i>able </i>to 
    fulfill the promise.</p></b></font> God has promised to subdue our corruption. 
    "He will subdue our iniquities." Oh, says a believer, my corruption is so 
    strong, that I am sure I shall never get the mastery of it. Abraham looked 
    at God's power. "Being fully persuaded that what God had promised he was <i>
    able </i>to perform." He believed that God, who could make a world, could 
    make Sarah's dry breasts give suck. It is faith's support—that there is 
    nothing too hard for God. He who could bring water out of a rock, is able to 
    bring to pass his promises.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Observe the TRUTH of God, in the promises. </p></b>
</font>God's truth is the seal set to the promise. "In hope of eternal life, 
    which God, <i>who cannot lie </i>has promised." 'Eternal life'—there is the
    <i>sweetness </i>of the promise. 'God which cannot lie'—there is the <i>
    certainty </i>of it. Mercy <i>makes </i>the promise; truth <i>fulfills </i>
    the promise. God's <i>providences </i>are uncertain—but his <i>promises </i>
    are the 'sure mercies of David." "God is not a man who he should change." 
    The word of a <i>prince </i>cannot always be taken—but <i>God's </i>promise 
    is inviolable. God's truth is one of the richest jewels of his crown, and he 
    has pawned it in a promise. "Although my house be not so with God—yet he has 
    made with me an <i>everlasting </i>covenant, ordered in all things and <i>
    sure</i>." 'Although my house be not so,' that is, though I fail much of 
    that exact purity the Lord requires—yet he has made with me an everlasting 
    covenant, that he will pardon, adopt, and glorify me; and this covenant is 
    ordered in all things and sure. 
<p align="justify">"The elements shall melt with fervent heat;" but God's 
    covenant abides firm and inviolable, being sealed with the <i>truth </i>of 
    God. Nay, God has added to his word his <i>oath</i>—wherein he pawns his 
    being, life, and righteousness to make good the promise. If as often as we 
    break <i>our </i>vows with God, he would break promise with us, it would be 
    very deplorable. But his truth is engaged in his promise, therefore it is 
    like the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered. "We are 
    not," says Chrysostom, "to believe our <i>senses </i>so much as we are to 
    believe the <i>promises</i>." Our senses may fail us—but the promise cannot, 
    being built upon the truth of God. God <i>will </i>not deceive the faith of 
    his people; nay, he <i>can</i>not. "God, who cannot lie, has promised." He 
    can as well part with his <i>Deity</i>—as his <i>verity</i>. God is said to 
    be <i>abundant in truth</i>. Exod 34:6. What does that signify? If God has 
    made a promise of mercy to his people, he will be so far from coming <i>
    short </i>of his word—that he will be <i>better </i>than his word. He often 
    does <i>more </i>than he has said—but never <i>less</i>. He is <i>abundant
    </i>in truth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The Lord may sometimes delay a promise—but he will 
    never <i>deny</i> a promise.</p></b> He may <i>delay </i>a promise. God's 
    promise may lie a good while, as seed under ground—but at last it will 
    spring up into a crop. He promised to deliver Israel from the iron 
    furnace—but this promise was over four hundred years in travail, before it 
    gave birth. Simeon had a promise that he should not depart, "until he had 
    seen the Lord's Christ." But it was a long time coming. But a little before 
    his death—he did see Christ. Though God <i>delays </i>the promise—he will 
    never <i>deny</i> a promise. Having given his bond—in due time the money 
    will be paid.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) God may change his promise—but he will not <i>break
    </i>it.</p></b> Sometimes God changes a temporal promise, into a spiritual 
    promise. "The Lord shall give that which is <i>good</i>." This may not be 
    fulfilled in a <i>temporal </i>sense—but a <i>spiritual </i>sense. God may 
    let a Christian be cut short in temporals—but he makes it up in spirituals. 
    If he does not increase the basket and the store, he gives increase of 
    faith, and inward peace. Here he <i>changes </i>his promise—but he does not
    <i>break </i>it; he gives that which is <i>better</i>. If a man promises to 
    pay me in farthings, and he pays me in a better coin, as in gold, he does 
    not break his promise. "I will not allow my faithfulness to <i>fail</i>." In 
    the Hebrew it is, "I will not allow my faithfulness to <i>lie</i>." 
<b>
<p align="justify">How does it consist with the truth of God, that he "wants 
    all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth"—and yet some 
    still perish?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Augustine understands it, not of every <i>individual </i>
    person—but some of all kinds of people shall be saved. As in the ark, God 
    saved all the living creatures; not every <i>individual</i> bird or fish was 
    saved, for many perished in the flood; but <i>all</i>, that is, <i>some of 
    every kind </i>were saved. In this sense, God will have <i>all </i>to be 
    saved, that is—some out of each of nations.</p>
<p align="justify">It is said, <b>Christ died for all.</b> "He is the Lamb 
    of God who takes away the sins of the <i>world</i>." How does this consist 
    with God's truth, when some are vessels of wrath? Rom 9:92.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) We must qualify the term <b>world</b>. The world is 
    taken either in a limited sense, for the world of the elect; or in a larger 
    sense, for both elect and reprobates. "Christ takes away the sins of the 
    world," that is, the world of the elect.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We must qualify also Christ's dying for the world. 
    Christ died <i>sufficiently </i>for all, not <i>effectually</i>. There is 
    the <i>value </i>of Christ's blood, and the <i>virtue </i>of Christ's blood. 
    Christ's blood has <b>value </b>enough to redeem the whole world—but the <b>
    virtue </b>of it is applied only to such as believe. Christ's blood has the 
    value to save all, but it is not efficacious for all. All are not saved, 
    because some put away salvation from them, "We had to speak the word of God 
    to you first. Since you <i>reject </i>it and do not consider yourselves 
    worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles." Acts 13:46. Others <i>
    vilify </i>Christ's blood, counting it an unholy thing.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: The truth of God, is a great pillar for our 
    faith.</p></b></font> Were he not a God of truth—we could not believe him—our 
    faith would be an empty dream. But he is truth itself, and not a word which 
    he has spoken shall fall to the ground. 
<p align="justify">The truth of God, is the object of trust. The truth of 
    God is an immovable rock, on which we may venture our salvation. Isa 59:15, 
    "Truth fails," that is—truth on earth fails—but not truth in heaven. God can 
    as well cease to be God, as cease to be true. Has God said, he "will do good 
    to the soul who seeks him," and he will "give rest to the weary." Here is a 
    safe anchor-hold, he will not alter the thing which has gone out of his 
    lips. The truth of the God of heaven is engaged for believers. Can we have 
    better security? The whole earth hangs upon the word of God's power—and 
    shall not our faith hang upon the word of God's truth? Where can we rest our 
    faith, but upon God's faithfulness? There is nothing else we can securely 
    believe in, but the truth of God. To trust in <i>ourselves </i>is to build 
    upon quick sands; but the truth of God is a golden pillar for faith to rest 
    upon. God cannot deny himself. "If we believe not—yet he abides faithful; he 
    cannot deny himself." Not to believe God's veracity, is to affront God. "He 
    who believes not, has made God a liar." A person of honor cannot be more 
    affronted or provoked, than when he is not believed, and called a liar. He 
    who denies God's truth, says that God's promise is no better than a forged 
    deed. Can there be a greater affront offered to God?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If God is a God of truth, he is true to his 
    THREATENINGS. </p></b></font>The threatenings are a <i>flying scroll</i> against 
    sinners. God has threatened, "<i>Surely </i>God will crush the heads of his 
    enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins." Psalm 68:21. He 
    has threatened to judge adulterers. Heb 13:3. To be avenged upon the 
    malicious. Psalm 10:14, "You behold mischief and spite, to requite it with 
    your own hand;" and to "rain fire and brimstone upon the sinner." God is as 
    true to his <i>threatenings </i>as to his <i>promises</i>. To show his 
    truth, he has executed his threatenings, and let his thunderbolts of 
    judgment fall upon sinners in <i>this </i>life. He struck <i>Herod </i>in 
    the act of his pride. He has punished blasphemers. Olympius, an Arian 
    bishop, reproached and blasphemed the blessed Trinity, and immediately 
    lightning fell down from the heaven upon him and consumed him. Let us fear 
    the threatening that we may not feel it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Is God a God of truth? Let us be like God in 
    truth. </p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) We must be true in our WORDS.</p></b> Pythagoras being 
    asked what made men like God, answered, "When they speak truth." It is the 
    distinction of a man who shall go to heaven, that "He speaks the truth in 
    his heart."
<b>
<p align="justify">Truth in our words, is opposed to all LYING.</p></b> "Putting 
    away lying, speak everyone truth to his neighbor." Lying is when one speaks 
    that as truth, which he knows to be false. A liar is most opposite to the 
    God of truth. There are, as Augustine says, two sorts of lies. There is an
    <b>officious </b>lie—when a man tells a lie for his profit; as, when a 
    tradesman says his commodity cost him so much, when perhaps it did not cost 
    him half so much. He who will lie in his trade—shall lie in hell. There is a
    <i>jesting </i>lie—when a man tells a lie in sport, to make others merry—and 
    goes laughing to hell. He who tells a lie makes himself like the devil. "The 
    devil is a liar, and the father of lies." John 8:44. He deceived our first 
    parents by a lie. Some are so wicked, that they will not only speak an 
    untruth—but will swear to it; nay, they will wish a curse upon themselves, 
    if that untruth is not true. 
<p align="justify">I have read of a woman, one Anne Avarie, who in 1575, 
    being in a shop, wished that she might die, if she had not paid for the 
    wares she took, and fell down speechless immediately and died. A liar is not 
    fit to live in a commonwealth. Lying takes away all society and converse 
    with men. How can you converse with a man—when you cannot believe what he 
    says? Lying shuts men out of heaven. "Outside are dogs, and whoever loves 
    and makes a lie." </p>
<p align="justify">As it is a great sin to <i>tell </i>a lie—so it is a 
    worse sin to <i>teach </i>a lie. "The prophet that <i>teaches </i>lies." He 
    who teaches error, teaches lies. He spreads the plague; he not only damns 
    himself—but helps to damn others!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Truth in our words, is opposed to all DECEIT.</p></b> The 
    heart and tongue should go together, as the dial goes exactly with the sun. 
    To speak fair to one's face, and not to mean what one speaks, is no better 
    than a lie. "His words were smoother than oil—but war was in his heart." 
    Some have an art to flatter and deceive. Jerome, speaking of the Arians, 
    says, "they pretended friendship, they kissed my hands—but plotted mischief 
    against me." "A man who flatters his neighbor, spreads a net for his feet." 
    Deadly poison can be hidden under sweet honey. Falsehood in friendship, is a 
    lie. Counterfeiting friendship, is worse than counterfeiting money.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) We must be true in our PROFESSION of religion</p></b>. 
    Let <i>practice </i>go along with <i>profession</i>. "Righteousness and true 
    holiness." Hypocrisy in religion is a lie. The hypocrite is like a face in a 
    mirror, which is the 'show of a face'—but no true face. He makes <i>show </i>
    of holiness—but has no <i>truth </i>in it. Ephraim pretended to be that 
    which he was not; and what does God say of him? "Ephraim compasses me about 
    with <i>lies</i>." By a lie in our <i>words</i>, we deny the truth; by a lie 
    in our <i>profession</i>, we disgrace the truth. Not to be to God what we 
    profess to others—is telling a lie; and the Scripture makes it little better 
    than blasphemy. "I know the blasphemy of those who <i>say </i>they are 
    Jews—and are not." 
<p align="justify">Oh! I beseech you, labor to be like God. He is a God of 
    truth. He can as well part with his Deity—as his verity. Be like God, be 
    true in your <i>words</i>, be true in your <i>profession</i>. God's children 
    are children that will not lie. When God sees "truth in the inward parts," 
    and "lips in which is no deceit," he sees his own image—which draws his 
    heart towards us. <i>Likeness </i>produces <i>love</i>.</p>
