<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">God's Anatomy Upon Man's 
    Heart</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    "All things are naked and open unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to 
    do." Hebrews 4:13</p>
<p align="justify">We have met this day to humble our souls, and to bring 
    our censer, as once Aaron did, and step in—that the wrath of the great God 
    may be appeased. And was there ever more need to lie in sackcloth, than when 
    the kingdom almost lies in ashes? or to shed tears, than when this nation 
    has shed so much blood? These days are called in scripture, <i>
    Soul-afflicting days</i>, Lev. 23:9. "For whatever soul it be that shall not 
    be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people." 
    And certainly that may be one reason why there is so much state-affliction, 
    because there is so little soul-affliction. Our condition is low, but our 
    hearts are high in pride. God sees with what hearts we now come, what is our 
    spring, what our center; his eye is upon us. So says my text, "All things 
    are naked and open."</p>
<p align="justify">We have here a map of God's knowledge. But before I 
    extract anything, I will first open the terms. In the law, first the lamps 
    were lighted before the incense was burned: I may allude, first the <i>
    judgment </i>is to be enlightened by doctrine, before the <i>affections </i>
    are set on fire. Ministers must be first <i>shining—</i>and then <i>burning
    </i>lamps.</p>
<p align="justify">"All things are <b>naked</b>." It is a metaphor from the 
    taking off the skin of any beast, which does then appear naked. Thus our 
    hearts are said to be naked; they lie open to the eye of God, they have no 
    covering; there is no veil over the heart of a sinner, but the veil of 
    unbelief; and this covering makes him naked.</p>
<p align="justify">This is not all, the apostle goes higher: they are naked 
    and <b>open</b>. It alludes to the cutting up of the sacrifices under the 
    law, where the priest cut the beast in pieces, and so the inward parts, were 
    made visible. Or it may allude to an anatomy, where there is a dissection 
    and cutting up of every part, the mesentery, the liver, the arteries. Such a 
    kind of <i>anatomy, </i>does God make—a heart-anatomy. He cuts open and 
    dissects the thoughts and motives of the heart. He makes a dissection, as 
    the knife that divides between the flesh and the bones, the bones and the 
    marrow, the sinews and the veins. "All things are open;" they are cut open 
    for his inspection.</p>
<p align="justify">The next word is <b>all things</b>. There is nothing 
    which escapes his eye: and herein God's knowledge does infinitely differ 
    from ours. We cannot see in the dark, nor can we see many things at once. 
    But it is not so with him. There is nothing so deep, but God will bring it 
    above-board, "who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness." He 
    sees many things at once—just as if there were only one thing to view.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The eyes of Him.</p></b> Eyes are ascribed to God, not 
    properly, but metaphorically. Idols have eyes—"yet they see not." God has no 
    eyes—yet he sees. The <i>eye of God </i>is put in scripture for his <i>
    knowledge</i>; all things are naked to his eye, that is, they are obvious to 
    his knowledge. We cannot sin, but it must be in the face of our Judge!
<p align="justify">The last word is, <b>With whom we have to do. </b>That 
    is—to whom we must give an account. To whom we must be responsible. The 
    words thus opened fall into these parts</p>
<p align="justify">1. Here is the Judge— that is God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The matter of fact— All things.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The evidence given in— All things are naked.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The clearness of the evidence— Naked and open.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The witnesses— his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The persons to be adjudged either for life or death, 
    "we"—that is, every individual person. There are none excepted from this 
    general assize. With whom we have to do. </p>
<p align="justify">The proposition I shall dilate on is this:</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine. <font color="#0000ff"><b>That the most secret 
    designs of man's heart are all unlocked and clearly anatomized before the 
    Lord.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">I might produce a whole cloud of witnesses, giving in 
    their full vote and agreement to this truth. I shall rest in two or three, 
    that in the mouth of three witnesses this great truth may be established.</p>
<p align="justify">"He knows the <i>secrets </i>of the heart," Psalm 42.21. 
    in the original it is, the <i>hidden things </i>of the heart—those which are 
    most veiled and masked from human perception.</p>
<p align="justify">And Psalm 139.2. "You know my <i>thoughts </i>afar off." 
    Here are two words that set out the infiniteness of God's knowledge.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1. You know my thoughts</p></b>, there is nothing which can 
    be so secret—as a thought.
<p align="justify">First, For its <i>subtlety </i>(secrecy), it is called 
    "the imagination of the thought," Gen. 6:5. or, as the word may bear, the 
    first embryo and forming of the thought, that is, a thing very subtle, and 
    scarce discernable.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, For its <i>celerity </i>(quickness), our 
    thoughts are winged, like the cherubim, they will in an instant travel over 
    the world. They are 'swifter than eagles," 2 Sam. 1.23. But he who rides 
    upon the swift cloud can overtake them—he can out-march them.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, For its <i>complexity</i>: our thoughts are 
    snarled and tangled one with another; yet even these thoughts are known to 
    God, and set in their proper sphere. What David says of his members, may be 
    said of our thoughts, "Are they not all written in your book?"</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Afar off</p></b>, that is, 
<p align="justify">1. God knows our thoughts before we ourselves know them! 
    He knows what designs are in the heart, and which men would certainly 
    pursue—did not God turn the wheel another way. God knew what was in Herod's 
    mind before Herod himself knew it, namely, that he would have destroyed the 
    child Jesus. God knew his thoughts afar off—he sees what blood and venom is 
    in the heart of a sinner, though it never comes to have vent. He looks at 
    the <i>intention</i>—though it is never put in <i>execution</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Afar off; that is, God knows our thoughts when we have 
    forgotten them! They are afar off to us—but they are present with him. 
    "These things have you done, and I kept silence: you thought I was such an 
    one as yourself." That is, you thought that I had a weak memory, "but I will 
    reprove you, and set your sins in order before you," Psalm 50.21. <i>
    Millions of years </i>are but as a short parenthesis to God. That we may not 
    think God forgets—he keeps a book of records, Rev. 20.12. "I saw the dead, 
    small and great, stand before the Lord, and the books were opened:" God 
    writes down, "Item—such a sin." And if the sins on the book be not 
    discharged, there will be an heavy reckoning! To every believer, the 
    debt-book of sins is crossed out; the <i>black lines of sin</i> are crossed 
    out in the <i>red lines of Christ's blood!</i></p>

<p align="justify">To instance in one scripture more, "Even in darkness I 
    cannot hide from you. To you the night shines as bright as day. Darkness and 
    light are both alike to you," Psalm 139.12. The clouds are no canopy; the 
    night is no curtain to draw between, or to hide from his all-seeing eye. We 
    cannot write our sins in so small or strange a character, but God can read 
    them—he has a key to unravel them. He understands our hearts without our 
    permission; he is privy to all our treachery! We cannot climb so high—but he 
    sees us; we cannot dig so low—but he takes notice. The men of Babel were 
    climbing very high, they would make a city and tower, the top whereof should 
    reach to heaven, and so indeed it did, for God saw them all the while: and 
    what became of it? "He confused their language," Gen. 11.7,8. Achan digs 
    deep to hide his counsels, saying, "No eye shall see me!" He takes the 
    Babylonish garment, and hides it in the earth, with the wedge of gold; but 
    God unmasks his thievery! Josh. 7.12.</p>
<p align="justify">If there are any here, that when they should have been 
    doing God's work, have been by stealth <i>hiding the Babylonish garment</i>, 
    making themselves rich, feathering their own nests; who, instead of driving 
    in nails into God's temple to fasten it, have been driving a wedge of gold 
    into their chests—God sees it! Let me tell you—God has a window which looks 
    into your hearts! God is the great superintendent; we come into the world as 
    upon a theater, every man acts his part or scene; God is both the Spectator 
    and the Judge.</p>
<p align="justify">You have seen the Doctrine proved.</p>
<p align="justify">For the amplification, let us <b>consider what the 
    knowledge of God is</b>. It is a most pure act by which he does at one 
    instant know all things past, present, and to come—in a most perfect, 
    exquisite, and infallible manner.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How does God know all things?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Reason 1. From his creation. </p></b></font>God is the Father 
    of lights, therefore must needs see. It is his own argument, "He who planted 
    the ear, shall he not hear? he who formed the eye, shall he not see," Psalm 
    94.9. He who makes a watch, knows all the pins and wheels in it; and though 
    these wheels move contrary one to another, he knows the true and perfect 
    motion of the watch, and the spring which sets these wheels a going. "He who 
    formed the eye, shall he not see?" Man may be compared to a spiritual watch. 
    The affections are the wheels; the heart is the spring; the motion of this 
    watch is false; the heart is deceitful. But God who made this watch knows 
    the true motion of it (be it ever so false) and the springs which set the 
    wheels a going. God knows us better than we know ourselves! He is as 
    Ezekiel's wheels—full of eyes! Augustine says, "God is all eye!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Reason 2. From his Ubiquity.</p></b></font> He is omniscient, 
    because he is omnipresent, Jer. 23.24. "Do not I fill heaven and earth?" He 
    excluded from nowhere; yet he is not bound in any one place. His 
    circumference is everywhere. God has an eye in every council. He makes an 
    heart-anatomy; he sees what men's designs are, and where they are driving. 
    If <i>hatred </i>wears the livery of <i>friendship</i>; if <i>ambition </i>
    comes masked with <i>humility</i>; if religion is made a stirrup to get into 
    the saddle of advancement—God sees it. "And though they dig into hell, from 
    thence shall my hand take them," Amos 9.2. God can unlock hell.
<p align="justify">God observes all our actings, but he himself is not seen, 
    as the apostle argues, 1 Tim. 6.16. Man may be circumscribed, the angels may 
    be defined—but God is in every place. His center is everywhere, and his eye 
    is ever in his center.</p>
<p align="justify">Objection. 1. But is it not said, Gen. 18.21. "I will go 
    down and <i>see </i>whether it be done altogether according to the cry?"</p>
<p align="justify">Answer. It could not be that God was ignorant; because 
    there is mention made of a cry. This is spoken after the manner of a judge, 
    who will first examine the cause before he will pass the sentence. 
    Therefore, to answer that scripture, "I will go down and see," it implies 
    two things:</p>
<p align="justify">First, The close examination which God uses when he is 
    upon a work of justice; God does not make the sword the judge. He first 
    weighs things in the balance; he always lays judgment to the line, before he 
    draws the line of judgment. God, when he is upon a work of justice, is not 
    in a rush, as if he did not care where he hits, but goes in the way of close 
    examination against offenders. "I will go down and see;" he does not punish 
    rashly. This is a good hint to those who have power in their hand, they must 
    work by line and plummet, judging the cause rather than the person; they 
    must proceed in righteousness; else seeming zeal is no better than 
    wild-fire; it is not justice, but violence.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, "I will go down and see." This denotes God's 
    patience in waiting for sinners; he staid until the cry came up. God puts up 
    with a great deal of injury at our hands, before justice draws the sword. He 
    spins out mercy into patience, and ekes out patience into long-suffering. 
    Oh! had not God's patience been infinite, we would have exhausted it. But 
    let no sinner presume. Though God is long-suffering, he does not tell us how 
    long. When the cry comes up—God comes down. If pride, lust, oppression 
    abound, God will hear the cry, and will quench the fire of sin with a shower 
    of blood!</p>
<p align="justify">Objection. 2. Zeph. 2.1. "I will <i>search </i>Jerusalem 
    with candles." Implying, that something is hidden from his sight.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer. Not that God needs any candles to see by. This 
    candle is not for him to see by, but for us. Therefore this searching 
    implies two things:</p>
<p align="justify">First, The exactness of God's knowledge: he has such a 
    deep insight as usually men have upon search. (2.) God threatens to search, 
    because he would have us search. Lam. 3.40. "Let us test and examine our 
    ways. Let us turn again in repentance to the Lord." God's searchers are now 
    abroad, his judgments; let us find out our sins, or else our sins will find 
    us out.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1.</p></b></font> Information. And this has two branches.
<p align="justify">Branch 1. "What manner of people ought we to be?" Has God 
    a window which opens into our hearts? Does he make a close examination upon 
    our actions? Oh what holiness, what sincerity, what exemplary piety befits 
    us—being in such a presence! Were we to come before some great monarch, what 
    solemn preparations would we make? Shall the eye of a <i>king </i>do so 
    much, and not the eye of <i>God</i>? The king can only see the outside; 
    there may be a treason within, for anything he knows. But God has a key for 
    the heart, Jer. 17.10. "I the Lord search the heart!" Will not this command 
    reverence? </p>
<p align="justify">In these days of solemn humiliation, God's eye is 
    principally upon the heart. God looks there most, where we look least; some 
    have no heart at all; sin has stolen away their heart; others have a double 
    heart, Psalm 12.2. Others have hearts good for nothing, earthly hearts, like 
    "Saul that was hidden among the stuff," 1 Sam. 10.22. Some have angels 
    tongues, but, as Nebuchadnezzar he had the heart of a beast given to him. 
    Brethren, did our hearts stand where our faces do, open to everyone—this 
    would be a day of blushing, we would be ashamed to look one upon another! 
    Remember, God has a key for the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">When we come to these solemn duties, God asks that 
    question, as Jehu did Jehonadab, 2 Kings 10.15. He greeted him, and said to 
    him, "Is your heart one with mine?" "<i>Yes, it is</i>—Jehonadab replied." 
    "If you are," Jehu said, "then give me your hand." So Jehonadab put out his 
    hand, and Jehu helped him into the chariot."</p>
<p align="justify">This is God's question. You come this day to humble 
    yourselves and make atonement, but "Is your heart one with God's?" If we can 
    answer as he did, "Lord, you know it is; though I have much weakness, yet my 
    heart is right, I have no false bias upon it. Though I am not perfect, I 
    hope I am sincere;" then will God say, "Give me your prayers, give me your 
    tears, come up with me into the chariot."<b> A tear from a bleeding heart is 
    a precious perfume in heaven.</b> Oh did we consider this all-seeing eye, we 
    dared not bring so much strange fire into the Divine presence! We read of 
    Ezekiel's wheels, they had a wheel within a wheel. Thus God has a thought 
    within a thought: he comes between us and our thoughts.</p>
<p align="justify">The goddess Minerva, as the Poets feign, was drawn in 
    such lively colors, that which way soever one turned, still Minerva's eye 
    was upon him. Thus, turn which way you will—fall in love with any sin—still 
    God looks upon you! He has an eye in your heart. What kind of people ought 
    we to be?</p>
<p align="justify">Branch 2. Of how dangerous consequence is it to act 
    anything against God? He sees it, and his knowledge is armed with power! <b>
    He who has an eye to see—will find an hand to punish! </b>If there are any 
    designs against God, though carried on ever so subtlety, remember there is a 
    council of war which sits in heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">"Against God?" will some say. "By no means."</p>
<p align="justify">There are four things; and if we act either directly or 
    indirectly against any of these, we act against God, and he sees it; he 
    writes it down.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. First, if we act against his Truth, we act against 
    God.</p></b></font> Truth is a beam of God, it is his essence; it is the most 
    orient pearl of his crown. Take away his truth, and we ungod him. Truth is 
    the precious seed by which we are begotten to life; it is the pillar of our 
    salvation. Truth is not only the rule of faith, but it is the root out of 
    which faith grows. Take away truth, and what is faith, but fancy? We would 
    only be <i>believing ourselves into hell. </i>Truth is the great purchase of 
    Christ's blood, and it has been transmitted to us in the blood of many 
    saints and martyrs. If we strike at truth, we strike at God; and does not 
    God see this?
<p align="justify">Give me permission to plead in God's cause. Is not this 
    pure wine of truth, mixed with water, nay, with poison? How are the truths 
    of God, almost lost in the <i>crowd of errors</i>? Most truths of God's 
    Word, are now called in question? some denying the scriptures, others 
    denying the Lord who bought them; not only the foundations of the earth are 
    out of course, but even the foundations of scripture are shaken. We read 
    that, when the bottomless pit was opened, there arose a smoke as the smoke 
    of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened. The late errors 
    sprung out of the furnace of hell, have made such a smoke and mist in the 
    church of God, that <i>the bright sun of truth </i>is much eclipsed in our 
    horizon. How many religions are there now among us, and every day in a new 
    dress? They are but old heresies, newly vamped. Our Savior says, "If the son 
    of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?" Yes surely, he may now find 
    many faiths; so many men—almost so many faiths! These things are done, are 
    they not countenanced? God sees! <b>Silence, when truth is wounded, is a 
    great sin!</b></p>
<font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">2. Secondly, We act against God, when we act against his 
    Covenant.</p></font> The covenant is a serious thing. Let us look upon our 
    solemn league and covenant; I tremble when I read it: we covenanted not only 
    against <i>prelacy </i>but <i>popery</i>; not only against <i>hierarchy</i>, 
    but <i>heresy</i>; not only <i>sin</i>, but <i>schism</i>. And have we not 
    gone against the letter of it? how is the covenant slighted by some as an 
    almanac out of date? Those who once lifted up their hand to it, do now lift 
    up their heel against it. We have begun to play fast and loose with God, and 
    for a trifle will venture the curse of the covenant, "But they like <i>men
    </i>have transgressed the covenant," Hos. 6.7. Or as in the Hebrew, They 
    like <i>Adam</i>; how is that? for a poor apple; so for a trifle, a penny in 
    the shop, men will set their covenant and conscience to sale. God sees this; 
    hear what he says, "I will bring a sword, which shall avenge the quarrel of 
    my covenant!" Lev. 26.25. Covenant-violation is a high affronting sin, and 
    an affront will make God draw his sword! We set our hand and seal to the 
    covenant, and then to tore off the seal! If the covenant will not hold 
    us—God has chains which will!
<p align="justify">That which enhances the sin is, it must needs be against 
    light; it is to be presupposed no man would take a covenant blindfold: 
    either he was informed, or else might have been. This is that which dyes the 
    sin in grain! Take any sin, put it in the scales, and put in this weight 
    with it, that before, and when it was done—it was against clear knowledge. 
    This circumstance is as much as the sin itself; though it be but one sin, it 
    weighs as much as two.</p>
<p align="justify">The covenant is a marriage knot; for a woman to go away 
    from her husband after solemn contract, is sin of an high nature. The 
    covenant is a girdle or golden clasp, which binds us to God, and God to us. 
    The girdle in ancient times was an emblem of chastity. When the covenant is 
    broken, the church loses her virginity. Israel was a people espoused to God 
    in covenant; but having stained this federal relation by idolatry, (a sin 
    that directly cuts asunder the marriage-knot) God gives her a bill of 
    divorce. Says he, "she is not my wife!" Hosea 2.2.</p>
<p align="justify">The Scythians had a law, that if any man did bind two 
    sins together, a lie and an oath, he was to lose his head, because this was 
    the way to take away all faith and truth among men. If all liars and 
    perjurers in this age should come to trial, I think we should scarcely find 
    men enough to bring them to the bar!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. We act against God when we act against his 
    ambassadors. </p></b></font>I mean not such as have stolen into the priests' 
    office, such as are <i>gone </i>out, 1 John 4.1; not <i>sent </i>out—they 
    are gone without God's commission. But such as are in a scripture method 
    instituted into this holy ministry; he who acts against these, acts against 
    God! Remember God sees, he writes it down! Whatever injury is done to the 
    ambassador, the King takes as done to his own person! So says Christ, "He 
    who despises you, despises me." What a black veil is drawn over the face of 
    the ministry? Let me plead with you: God might have come in his own person, 
    and have preached to you in flames, as when he once delivered the law upon 
    mount Sinai; but then you would have said, "Oh let not God speak, lest we 
    die; let Moses speak!" God might have preached to you in the ministry of 
    angels, but you would not have been able to bear it: "God is not in the 
    fire, nor in the earthquake, but in the still small voice." 1 Kings 
    19.11,12. He is pleased, in a sweet kind of humility, to send his 
    ambassadors, and he puts an olive-branch in their mouth; they woo and 
    beseech, in all in the affections of Christ; will not love conquer?
<p align="justify">This nation has discarded the bread of life. When God 
    sees his mercies lying on the floor, it is just with him to call to the 
    enemy to take them away. I heartily pray that plenty of ordinances does not 
    as much hurt in this city, as famine has done in other places of the land; 
    and if we once say, "what is this manna?" it would be no wonder if we begin 
    to say, "who is this Moses?" Oh what a sad change is there in our days! 
    Those that once would have counted our feet beautiful, who would have been 
    ready to have pulled out their eyes for their minister, are now ready to 
    pull out their minister's eyes! And what is the quarrel? even this, "Have I 
    become your enemy because I tell you the truth?" </p>
<p align="justify">If ministers would preach smooth things, make the way to 
    heaven easier than ever Christ made it, then they would be admired. (You 
    have more people gaze at a <i>Comet </i>or <i>shooting star</i>, than at the
    <i>sun</i>.) But if they come to lay the ax of the law to the root of 
    conscience; if they fall a hewing and cutting down men's sins, "The land is 
    not able to bear their words." If the prophet goes to tell king Asa of his 
    great sin in joining with a wicked army; "Herein you have done foolishly." 
    if he goes about to imprison his sin, he himself shall be imprisoned. "Asa 
    became so angry with Hanani for saying this that he threw him into prison." 
    This was Jerusalem's sin, and it drew tears from Christ; "O Jerusalem, you 
    who stone the prophets!" Mat. 23. And she stoned them so long—until she had 
    not one stone left upon another.</p>
<p align="justify">Those that would annihilate the ministry—try to pull the
    <i>stars </i>out of Christ's hand; and they will find it a work not 
    feasible; it will fare with them as with the eagle, that going to fetch a 
    piece of flesh from the altar, a coal sticking to her feathers, she burnt 
    herself and the young ones in the nest. 2 Chron. 36.16, "They mocked the 
    messengers of God, and misused his prophets, until there was no remedy."</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. We act against God, when we act against that order and 
    government which he has set up in his church. </p></b></font>God is the God of 
    order, he has set everything in its proper sphere. The order and harmony of 
    the world does consist in degrees, one thing still above another. For there 
    can be no music, if all the sounds are alike. In nature, the sun is 
    commander in chief among the planets. Thus in the body politic, God has set 
    kings, nobles, judges, still in a descent; and this makes the harmony. And 
    these powers are of God, Romans 13.1. "The powers that be, are of God." 
    Magistracy is the hedge of a nation, "And he who breaks an hedge, a serpent 
    shall bite him."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Reproof. Here is a just impeachment against two 
    sorts of people.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 1. The LIBERTINE. </p></b></font>And there are two 
    kinds of them.
<p align="justify">First, The <b>profane </b>libertine, who fabricates a God 
    made up of mercy; and therefore he engulfs himself in sin, he is upon the 
    spur to go to hell, as if he were afraid hell would be full before he could 
    get there. He says, "God shall not see!"</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, The <b>religious </b>libertine, who sins 
    because grace abounds. He says, "God sees no sin in his people. After we are 
    in Christ, we cannot sin; therefore repentance is out of date." Whom I shall 
    refute in two ways.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There must be repentance after we are in Christ: for 
    though sin in a believer is <i>covered</i>, yet it is not perfectly <i>cured</i>. 
    There are still some remainders of corruption; and certainly, as long as 
    there is an issue of sin open, there must be an issue of sorrow kept open.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Every sin, after we are in Christ, is a sin of 
    unkindness, the sin of a spouse; and if anything will melt and break the 
    heart, this will. The sins of the regenerate wound Christ's heart deeper 
    than others. Has not Christ suffered enough already? Will you wound him whom 
    God has wounded? Will you give him more vinegar to drink? O rather "Give 
    wine to him that is of an heavy heart;" cheer him with your tears! Look on a 
    bleeding Christ with a bleeding heart.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 2. It impeaches the HYPOCRITE</p></b></font>, who is a 
    practical atheist—who says, "God shall not see!" The word in the Hebrew 
    signifies to dissemble. The Syriac word, a face-taker. The hypocrite wears a 
    mask of sanctity. Aquinas calls hypocrisy the counterfeiting of virtue. The 
    hypocrite is a charlatan, he pretends that which he is not. He is like those 
    angels that assumed the dead bodies, but there was no soul to animate them, 
    Gen. 19.1. He is an apparition, he is not really pious. The hypocrite is a 
    walking picture, a rotten post painted over. He is like the painted grapes 
    which deceived the living birds; or the beautiful apples of Sodom—touch 
    them, and they moulder to dust.
<p align="justify">In short, hypocrites are like turning pictures, which 
    have on one side the image of a lamb, on the other side a lion. Just so, 
    they are on their outside saints, but their inside devils. Hypocrites may be 
    compared to trumpets that make a great sound, but within they are hollow. Do 
    these believe the all-seeing eye? The hypocrite turns all religion into mere 
    externals; he walks with a dark lantern, saying, "No eye shall see!" He goes 
    about to juggle with God, as Jeroboam's wife did think to do with the 
    prophet, 1 Kings 14.6. But he pulled off her mask, "Come in you wife of 
    Jeroboam." The hypocrite knows God is of purer eyes than to behold sin; yet 
    for all this will <i>play </i>at devotion; he will venture to <i>abuse </i>
    God, that he may <i>delude </i>men. The hypocrite takes more care to <i>make
    </i>a covenant, than to <i>keep </i>it; and is more studious to enter into 
    religion, than that religion should enter into him. This text arraigns the 
    hypocrite: All things are naked, God sees our jugglings!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I shall give you two distinguishing characters whereby 
    you may know an hypocrite.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 1. He is one who is partial in his goodness.</p></b></font> 
    He is zealous in lesser things, but remiss in greater things. As our Savior 
    complained in his time, they "strain at a gnat and swallow a camel." He is 
    one who sweats only in some part, but is cool in all the rest, which is a 
    sign his zeal is distempered. He is zealous against a ceremony, a relic or 
    painted glass (not that I plead for these), but in the mean time lives in 
    known sin, lying, immorality, extortion, &amp;c. Just as the High Priests, "It 
    is not lawful, say they, to put the money into the treasury, because it is 
    the price of blood," Matt. 27.6. They speak like conscientious men. Oh do 
    not defile the treasury! But let me ask the question, "Why did they shed 
    that blood? it was innocent blood." They will not take the price of blood 
    into the treasury, but they never scruple to take the guilt of blood into 
    their souls! They were zealous for the purity of the temple, but were 
    murderers of the Son of God. 
<p align="justify">And we have a parallel scripture to this, Romans 2.22. 
    "You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you do it? You condemn 
    idolatry, but do you steal from pagan temples? You are so proud of knowing 
    the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it." Who at the first sight, would 
    not have taken these for very holy, devout men—who were zealous against 
    idolatry? But see a root of hypocrisy! They were partially good, they hated 
    one sin, but not another! They hated idolatry, but not sacrilege. Though it 
    was an abominable sin, and there was an express law of God against it; yet 
    these seeming zealots make no conscience of robbing God of his tithes.</p>
<p align="justify">And here as in a scripture looking-glass, we may see our 
    own faces! Have we not many now-a-days seemingly zealous against popery? If 
    they see a cross, (though it be in a coat of arms), they are much offended, 
    and are in a kind of convulsion: but in the mean time make no conscience of 
    sacrilege, starving out the ministry, they put out the fire on God's altar, 
    shut the doors of his temple; is not this visible hypocrisy? There are some, 
    it may be, will not be heard to swear, as it will not stand with their <i>
    saintship</i>; (this were to call the devil "father" aloud,) but they will 
    defraud and defame, and take away a man's name—which is no better than 
    murder. And if these are saints, there are as good saints in hell.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Character 2. The second character of an hypocrite is, he 
    makes religion a mask to cover his sin.</p>
</b></font><i>
<p align="justify">Herod </p></i>pretended to worship Christ, but his zeal was 
    no other than malice, for it was to have destroyed him. Thus, often bad 
    purposes lie hid under good pretenses. <i>Jezebel</i>, that she may cloak 
    her murderous intentions, proclaims a fast. <i>Absalom</i>, to color over 
    his treason, pretends a religious vow.<b> How cunning is the heart to go to 
    hell!</b> Judas hides his covetousness under a pretense of charity, "This 
    ointment might have been sold for three hundred pence, and given to the 
    poor," John 12.5. How charitable was Judas! But his charity began at 
    home—for he carried the money bag. Many make religion a cloak for their 
    ambition, "Come, see my zeal, says Jehu, for the Lord." 1 Kings 10.16. No! 
    Jehu—your zeal was for the kingdom! Jehu made religion hold the stirrup 
    until he got possession of the crown; here was double-dyed hypocrisy.
<p align="justify">The hypocrite sets himself against God.</p>
<p align="justify">First, He opposes him in his essence; God is a substance, 
    the hypocrite is only a shadow.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, In his unity; God is one, and made man one at 
    first; but the hypocrite has made himself a double hearted man; he gives God 
    the tenth, and leaves the rest for that which he loves better.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, In his goodness, God is good, and in him is no 
    mixture. The hypocrite is therefore good <i>in show</i>, that he may be <i>
    bad in deed</i>. He is a devil in Samuel's mantle. Pilate would make the 
    world believe he had a tender conscience: he washes his hands. But he could 
    not say as David, "I will wash my hands in innocency;" for then he would 
    never have given his vote for the shedding of innocent blood. </p>
<p align="justify">God sees our prevarications. How odious is the hypocrite? 
    We ourselves cannot endure treacherous dealing. Therefore in the 
    common-wealth, he who <i>poisons </i>another, has a greater punishment, than 
    he who kills with the <i>sword</i>, because he offers it hypocritically 
    under a pretense of friendship. "Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a 
    kiss?" We may as well betray Christ with a <i>tear</i>, as Judas did with a 
    kiss. You may see God's great dislike of this sin, in that he forbids his 
    people in the old law, the very resemblances of it, and by his 
    expostulation, Psalm 50.16. "What have you to do to take my covenant into 
    your mouth, seeing you hate to be reformed?" You hypocrite, what have you to 
    do to meddle with religion, to pretend saint-ship? You make religion odious, 
    and the offering of God to be abhorred? Hear that dreadful sentence, Isaiah 
    29.14. "They draw near to me with their lips." They have God in their 
    mouths, "but their heart is far from me;" therefore, verse 14. "I will take 
    away the wisdom of the wise men;" I will blast their proceedings, I will 
    confuse their counsels. They are hypocrites! </p>
<p align="justify">In one chapter, Christ pronounces seven woes against this 
    sin of hypocrisy! Matt. 23. "Woe to you hypocrites," Woe! Woe! Woe! etc. To 
    be a hypocritical nation, and to be the generation of God's wrath—are made 
    synonymous in scripture, Isa 10.6. And when the Holy Spirit would enhance 
    and aggravate the torments of hell, he sets them out under this notion, "The 
    place of hypocrites," as if hell were taken up on purpose for the hypocrite 
    to quarter in.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 3. A word of Exhortation. </p></b></font>If the secrets 
    of our hearts are unveiled and unmasked, walk as under the eye of God. 
    Methinks that saying of Hagar should be a Christian's motto, "You God see 
    me!" And David's prospect should be ever in our eye, Psalm 16.8. "I have set 
    the Lord always before me!" Some set their bags of money always before them, 
    others set the fear of men always before them; but a wise Christian will set 
    God, and judgment, and eternity always before him. If indeed <i>God's eye
    </i>were at any time off from us, we might take the more liberty; but if all 
    things are naked and open to his eye, we cannot sin but in the face of our 
    Judge. Oh then reverence this <i>eye of God.
</i>
<p align="justify">First, <i>God's eye </i>should be a bridle to keep us 
    from sin: "How shall I do this and sin against God?" Seneca gives his friend 
    Lucilius this counsel, "Whatever he was doing, he should imagine that some 
    of the Roman nobles were watching him, and then he would do nothing 
    dishonorable." The eye of God should be ever in our eye; this would be as a 
    counter poison against sin. Nor is it enough to prune sin, namely, to cut 
    off the external acts; but we must kill the root. Crucify darling sins; let 
    not your heart sit brooding upon sin. Again, let God's omniscience deter you 
    from <i>hiding </i>sin. Who would hide a traitor? Now it sucks your breast, 
    shortly it will suck your blood. Men think, that to sin in the dark, and to 
    carry their sins under a canopy—that no eye shall see them (like those who 
    have bad eyes think that the sky is ever cloudy, whereas the fault is not in 
    the sky, but in their eyes). So when the prince of the world has blinded 
    men's eyes, because there is darkness within, they think it is dark abroad 
    too, and now the sky is cloudy, and they imagine that God cannot see. But 
    remember, all things are naked and open to God! Do not go about to hide 
    sin—confess, confess! Confession does that to the soul, which the surgeon 
    does to the body; it opens a spiritual vein, and lets out the bad blood. The 
    only way to make God not see sin, is to see it ourselves, but not with dry 
    eyes; point every sin with a tear!</p>
<p align="justify">2. <i>God's eye </i>is a spur to virtue: are you zealous 
    for God? do you exhaust yourself in the cause of religion? God sees it! You 
    shall loose nothing. For the present you have a promise, which is God's bill 
    of exchange, and when God comes to make up your accounts, you shall be paid 
    with extra. The more any man has disbursed for God, the greater sums of 
    glory are still behind.</p>
<p align="justify">3. <i>God's eye </i>is a whetstone to duty. O you 
    Christian that are much in private, that set hours apart for God, (a sign he 
    has set you apart) you shed many tears in your closet: the world takes no 
    notice. But remember, God's eye is upon you, your prayers are registered, 
    your tears are bottled up, "and he who sees in secret will reward you 
    openly." How should this add wings to prayer, and oil to the flame of our 
    devotion? let us take heed of slacking our pace in religion, let not our 
    tears begin to freeze. If slackness does not lose our crown—yet it may 
    lessen our crown.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Use 4. </b></font>Here is a 
    breast of consolation to the saints of God (in these sad times), in the 
    midst of all those hard treatment that they meet with. Let the world frown, 
    let men persecute and calumniate, (and it may be, think they do God 
    service), here is sap in the vine, a strong cordial to take, "all things are 
    naked and open to God." They do nothing but what our Father sees! They make 
    wounds, and then pour in vinegar; God writes down their cruelty, he sees 
    what rods they use, and how hard they strike. <b>He who has an eye to 
    see—has also a hand to punish! </b>"I have seen, I have seen the affliction 
    of my people," not only with an eye of providence, but with an eye of pity.
    </p>
<p align="justify">This was a great comfort to David in his affliction, and 
    was like a golden shield in the hand of his faith, "My groaning is not 
    hidden from you," Psalm 38.6. When I weep, Christ weeps in my tears, he 
    bleeds in my wounds. There are two bloods which will cry: the blood of <i>
    souls</i>, when they have been starved or poisoned, and the blood of <i>
    saints</i>. I do not mean saints without sanctity, nominal saints, but such 
    as have Christ engraved in their hearts, and the word copied out into their 
    lives! It is dangerous meddling with their blood; if we spill their blood, 
    it is no better than spilling Christ's blood, for they are members of his 
    body, "In all their afflictions, he was afflicted." </p>
<p align="justify">The people of God are precious to him. There is blood 
    royal running in their souls, "they are his jewels," Mal. 3.17, and his 
    heart is exceedingly protective of them; it is wounded with love. "I am very 
    jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her!" Zech. 8.2. Jealousy, 
    we know, proceeds from love; I am very zealous for Zion; zeal is the flame 
    of love. Oh then you saints of God, be of good comfort; whatever your 
    treatment is, God sees it, Exod. 14.24. "In the morning-watch the Lord 
    looked through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of 
    the Egyptians." Remember, God has an eye in the cloud!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 5. Caution.</p></b></font> God being so infinite in 
    wisdom; if things go cross in church or state, take heed of charging God 
    with folly. Do not censure him—but admire hom. All things are naked and open 
    before him! There is not anything which stirs in the world—but God has a 
    design in it, for the good of his church! He carries on his designs by mens' 
    designs: all things are unveiled to the eye of providence. God is never 
    perplexed: he knows when to deliver, and how to deliver.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God knows when to deliver.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">David says, "My times are in your hand," Psalm 31.15. If 
    our times were in our own hand, we would have deliverance too soon; if they 
    were in our enemy's hand, we would have deliverance too late: But my times 
    are in God's hand; and God's hand is ever best. Everything is beautiful in 
    its season: when the mercy is ripe, we shall have it. It is true, we are now 
    between the hammer and the anvil: we may fear we shall see the death of 
    religion, before the birth of reformation. But do not cast away your anchor; 
    God sees when the mercy will be in season. When his people are low enough, 
    and the enemy high enough—then usually appears the church's morning-star! 
    Let God alone, to his time.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. God knows how to deliver.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"All things are naked and open before God." God delivers 
    sometimes in that way in which we think he will destroy. It might seem 
    strange, when he would deliver Israel, he stirred up the hearts of the 
    Egyptians to <i>hate </i>them. Could this be a likely way? yet by this 
    means, was deliverance ushered in. So now the hearts of many are stirred up 
    to hate the people of God, to hate the covenant; but God can make use of 
    their power and rage, as once he did of the High Priest's malice, and Judas' 
    treason—for our greater advantage. There was no way for Jonah to be saved, 
    but to be swallowed up; he sails safe to land in the whale's belly. God 
    brings his people many times to shore upon the broken pieces of the ship. 
    God can make the enemies do his work; he does sometimes play his own game by 
    their hand. Well then may we cry out with the apostle; "O the depth of the 
    riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" God will not make us privy 
    of his counsel, his path is in the deep. If we cannot see a reason of his 
    proceedings; let us censure our own shallowness—not his depth.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a word of counsel, it shows us where to have 
    recourse in all our straits and doubts. Go to God! All things are naked to 
    his all-seeing eye, he is the oracle of wisdom: "If any man lacks wisdom, 
    let him ask it of God," James 1.5. We are here in the dark; pray with David, 
    "Lord, light my candle!" shed some beams of divine knowledge into my soul. 
    Beg of God, that as things are naked and open before his eyes, so they may 
    be naked in our eyes—that we may see the sinfulness of sin, and the beauty 
    of holiness. The times are evil: let us pray to God that he would be our 
    pilot to steer us; that he would teach us to walk <i>jealously </i>towards 
    ourselves, <i>piously </i>towards him, <i>prudently </i>towards others; that 
    he would give us the graces of our relation which bespangle and grace our 
    profession; that so guiding us by his counsels, we may at last be received 
    to glory!</p>
