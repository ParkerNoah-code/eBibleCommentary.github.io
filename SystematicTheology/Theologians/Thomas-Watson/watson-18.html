<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Fight of Faith 
    Crowned</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">(A sermon preached at the funeral of that eminently holy 
    pastor, Mr. Henry Stubs, 1678)</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b></b></font>
<p align="justify">Christian Reader,<br/>
    It was not my intent to have this message appear publicly—but being 
    requested by the near relations of this worthy deceased minister to print my 
    sermon (which by their appointment was preached), I knew not well how to 
    withstand their importunity. Indeed, I was more willing to let these lines 
    be published—that I might raise a pillar of remembrance to the precious name 
    of Mr. Stubs.</p>
<p align="justify">The subject matter treated is the Christian's <i><b>combat</b>
</i>and <b> <i>crown</i></b>. Oh, this blessed crown cannot be fully penciled out in 
    its orient colors—though an archangel should take the pencil! The Roman 
    emperors had three crowns set upon their heads. The first was of iron, the 
    second of silver, and the third of gold. God sets three crowns upon the 
    elect: <i>grace</i>, <i>joy</i>, and <i>glory</i>. What should we thirst 
    after — but this incomprehensible bliss!<i> If our thoughts dwelt above, we 
    would live sweeter lives! </i>The higher the lark flies—the sweeter it 
    sings.</p>
<p align="justify">Cyprus was anciently called Macaria, the blessed 
    island—but it is more true that <i>heaven </i>is the blessed island. <i>
    Heaven is a place where sorrow cannot live—and joy cannot die! </i>It may be 
    compared to the fields of Sicily where there is continual spring and flowers 
    all the year long. Could our meditations mount up to the empyrean delights, 
    how would the world disappear and shrink into nothing! To those who stand 
    upon the top of the Alps, the great cities below seem as little villages. 
    After Paul was enrapt into the third heaven, the <i>world </i>was 
    crucified to him (Galatians 6:14). When worldly things are in their highest 
    meridian of glory—they hasten to a sunset. Let us live more in the <i>
    altitudes</i>, and take a prospect of our eternal felicities. What can be 
    more delicious or sacred—than to have Christ in our heart, and the crown in 
    our eye!</p>
<p align="justify">I have inserted something more into this sermon than 
    straits of time would permit in the delivery. If it kindles holy ardors in 
    the breasts of any and quickens their pace in the way to heaven, I have my 
    wish. That this may be effected is the prayer of him who is<br/>
    Your friend and servant in the gospel, <br/>
    Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"><i>"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my 
    course, I have kept the faith; henceforth is laid up for me a crown of 
    righteousness!" </i>2 Timothy 4:7-8</p>
<p align="justify">These words were spoken by Paul, the aged, not long 
    before his death. Verse 6 says, "I am now ready to be offered," or, as the 
    Greek word signifies, "to have my blood poured out in sacrifice." What a 
    comfort it was to make this noble declaration before his departure: "I have 
    fought a good fight!" The text falls into three parts:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Paul's <b>courage</b>—"I have <i>fought </i>a good 
    fight."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Paul's <b>constancy</b>—"I have <i>finished </i>my 
    course, I have <i>kept </i>the faith."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Paul's <b>crown</b>—"Henceforth is laid up for me a <i>
    crown of righteousness</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">Here is a large field, and I can but pluck a few ears of 
    corn. I begin with the first part of the text.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Paul's COURAGE—"I have fought a good fight."</p></b></font> 
    That is, "I have fought to an <i>agony</i>." Observe, first, that a 
    Christian's life is <i>military</i>. 1 Timothy 1:18 says, "That you may 
    fight a good <i>warfare</i>." A saint's life is not delicate and 
    slothful—but like the <i>soldier's </i>life:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) In respect to HARDSHIP.</p></b></font> A soldier does not 
    have his soft bed or daily fare, but undergoes tedious marches; and such is 
    the Christian life. 2 Timothy 2:3 says, "You, therefore, endure <i>hardness
    </i>as a good soldier of Jesus Christ." We must not be <i>delicate</i>, <i>
    silken </i>Christians—but expect to wrestle with difficulties. The naked 
    neck is too soft and tender to bear the cross of Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) In respect to WATCHFULNESS.</p></b></font> A soldier gets 
    up to his watchtower and sends abroad his scouts for fear the enemy may 
    surprise him. A Christian must stand sentinel and be ever on his guard. It 
    was Christ's watchword, Mark 13:37, "I say to you all—<i>watch!</i>" When 
    you have prayed against sin—watch against temptation.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) In respect to COMBAT.</p></b></font> 1 Timothy 6:12: 
    "Fight the good fight of faith." In order to fight, a Christian must get his
    <i>armor </i>and <i>weapons </i>ready.
<p align="justify">He must get his <font color="#b07050"><b>ARMOR </b>
</font>ready. The care of most is to get <i>riches</i>, not armor. There are 
    two things absolutely needful—food and armor. It is necessary to get <i>
    Christ </i>for our food—and <i>grace </i>for our armor—without which there 
    is no abiding the day of trial. A soldier who wears his prince's colors but 
    has no armor, will soon flee the field. If you wear Christ's colors but have 
    not the armor of God upon you, you will turn your backs in the day of 
    battle. There are two chief pieces of the spiritual armor. </p>
<p align="justify">First, the HELMET is divine <b>hope</b>. 1 Thessalonians 
    5:8: "For a helmet—the hope of salvation." A helmet is to defend the head so 
    that it is not hurt. So the hope of salvation as a helmet defends a person 
    and makes him lift up his head in the greatest dangers. Christians, be sure 
    you get the right helmet, because the helmet of hope may be counterfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">The first deceit of the helmet, or a false hope—is <b>
    DEAD </b>hope. Hypocrites have a faint wish for heaven. They hope for 
    heaven—but exert no activity in working out salvation. True hope is a 
    "lively hope" (1 Peter 1:3). True hope of glory sets the affectations on 
    fire, and adds wings to the endeavor.</p>
<p align="justify">A false hope is an <b>UNCLEAN </b>hope. A man hopes—but 
    continues in his sins. It is vain to speak of <i>hopes</i> of salvation—and have 
    the <i>marks</i> of damnation! True hope is a helmet made of <i>pure </i>metal. 1 
    John 3:3: "He who has this hope <i>purifies </i>himself."</p>
<p align="justify">A false hope is <b>VANISHING</b>. It is not a <i>helmet—</i>but 
    a <i>spider's web</i>. The least terror of conscience makes it vanish. But a 
    true hope is permanent. Proverbs 14:32: "The righteous has hope in his 
    death." In a dying hour—his hope is in a living God.</p>
<p align="justify">Quintian the persecutor commanded one of his men to cut 
    off the breasts of Agatha, a martyr. "Do your worst, tyrant," said the 
    martyr, "yet I have two breasts which you cannot touch. The one is of 
    <i>faith</i>, 
    the other of <i>hope</i>." Oh, get the right helmet! The devil laughs at hypocrites 
    who are deceived with false armor. A fool is content with a <i>paper </i>
    helmet.</p>
<p align="justify">The second piece of the spiritual armor is the 
    BREASTPLATE, which is <b>love</b>. "Putting on the breastplate of <i>love</i>" 
    (1 Thessalonians 5:8). This breastplate is inseparable; it may be shot <i>at</i>—but 
    it cannot be shot <i>through</i>, Song of Solomon 8:7. A soul armed with 
    love will go through a sea and a wilderness and will die in God's service.</p>
<p align="justify">A Christian must get his <font color="#b07050"><b>WEAPONS
    </b></font>ready. </p>
<p align="justify">Ephesians 6:16: "Above all things taking the <b>shield of 
    faith</b>." A shield is of great use. It defends the head, it guards the 
    vital organs, and it keeps the arrow from entering into the body. The shield 
    of faith defends the heart and beats back the fiery darts of temptation. A 
    Roman soldier resisted Pompeii's army until he had over a hundred darts 
    sticking in his shield. Hold forth the shield of faith—and nothing can hurt 
    you.</p>
<p align="justify">Ephesians 6:17: "The <b>sword of the Spirit </b>which is 
    the Word of God." It is good for a soldier to be well skilled in his weapon. 
    The Word of God is a weapon to stab lust at the heart! It is observable that 
    when the devil tempted our Savior he ran to Scripture and said, "It is 
    written" three times. Christ wounded the old serpent with this spiritual 
    weapon!</p>
<p align="justify">Having gotten into this warlike posture, a Christian must 
    enter the arena and fight the good fight of faith. In the future life, the 
    saints shall be out of the noise of the drum and cannon, and not one more 
    stroke shall be struck. Then they shall not appear in their <i>armor</i>—but 
    in their <i>white robes </i>and with palm branches in their hands in token 
    of victory. But here on earth, they must fight the Lord's battles, and have 
    no cessation of the warfare, until death. </p>
<p align="justify">There is a threefold enemy which they must encounter:</p>
<p align="justify">The first regiment is the <font color="#008000"><b>lusts 
    of the flesh</b></font>,<b> </b>which war against their souls (1 Peter 
    2:11). The flesh is a sly <i>internal </i>enemy and least suspected. An 
    enemy <i>within </i>the walls of the castle is most dangerous.</p>
<p align="justify">Luther said he feared his own heart, more than Pope or 
    Cardinal. The heart is the <i>fomenter </i>of sin. It mints evil 
    thoughts—and blows up the coals of fiery passions. It is the <i>Trojan horse
    </i>out of which comes a whole army of lusts! Shall we not fight the good 
    fight, and discharge with the <i>fire of zeal </i>against this bosom 
    traitor, the flesh! The primitive Christians chose rather to be destroyed by 
    lions without—than by lusts within!</p>
<p align="justify">The second regiment to be resisted is
    <font color="#008000"><b>Satan and the infernal powers</b></font>. 1 Peter 
    5:8: "Your adversary the devil as a roaring lion prowls about." He walks 
    about not as a pilgrim—but a spy who narrowly observes. Satan, like an 
    ambusher, lies in a bush, and his design carries death in the front, 
    "seeking whom he may <i>devour</i>." He tempts one man to be drunk—another 
    to immorality. He sets kingdoms quarreling that at last he may devour them, 
    like the person who sets two gamecocks to fight, so that once they have 
    killed each other he may sup with their carcasses. Does this <i>hellish 
    Goliath </i>come into the field and defy the living God? Shall not some 
    spear be lifted up against him? 1 Peter 5:9: "Resist him, standing firm in 
    the faith."</p>
<p align="justify">The third regiment Christians must fight against, is the
    <font color="#008000"><b>enchantments of the world</b></font>. The world is 
    a <i>flattering </i>enemy. It kills by <i>embracing</i>. Worldly things 
    hinder our passage to the holy land. They choke good affections—like the <i>
    earth </i>puts out the fire. Whom the world <i>kisses</i>—it <i>betrays! </i>
    Heliogabalus made ponds of sweet water to drown himself and gilded poisons 
    to poison himself. Just so, the world destroys millions with her <i>sweet 
    waters </i>of pleasure—and her <i>gilded poisons </i>of riches. Let us then 
    gird on our armor and fight valorously.</p>
<p align="justify">For good reason we should fight the fight of 
    faith—because we carry rich treasure about us. He who carries precious 
    jewels with him, should be in a fighting posture. We carry a precious soul 
    about us. If the cabinet of the <i>body </i>is so wonderfully wrought and 
    embellished (Psalm 139:15), then what is the <i>jewel </i>in it! The soul is 
    a spark and beam of celestial brightness, a blossom of eternity; and shall 
    not we, by our martial prowess and chivalry, defend this treasure? To be 
    robbed of the soul is an <i>irreparable </i>loss. God (said Chrysostom) has 
    given you two <i>eyes</i>. If you lose one, you have another; but you have 
    only one soul and if you are robbed of that, you are undone forever!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE. </p></b></font>Is the Christian life military? To blame, 
    then, are they who have no spiritual weapons, nor do they make one skirmish 
    against the enemy. It is death to go abroad unarmed. People spend time in 
    dressing themselves by the looking-glass and putting on their jewels—but do 
    not put on their sacred armor. They take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at 
    the sound of the organ—as if they were rather in a play-house, than in 
    battle. Lycurgus would have no man's name written upon his tomb, but he who 
    died manfully in war. God writes no man's name in the Book of Life, but he 
    who dies fighting the good fight of faith!
<p align="justify">Give battle to sin and Satan, and pursue them with a holy 
    malice. To <b>encourage </b>you in the fight, let these things be weighed:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It is a good <i>fight</i>. </p></b></font>It is a <i>lawful </i>
    war. Princes may commence a war to invade other men's rights and 
    properties—but God has proclaimed war against <i>sin</i>. Colossians 3:5: 
    "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual 
    immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. We have a good <i>captain</i>. </p></b></font>Jesus Christ is the 
    Captain of our salvation (Hebrews 2:10). If a flock of sheep has a <i>lion
    </i>for their captain—they need not fear the wolf. Christ is the Lion of the 
    tribe of Judah (Revelation 5:5). He not only leads us on in our march—but 
    helps us in the fight. A captain may give his soldier <i>armor</i>—but he 
    cannot give him <i>strength</i>. Christ animates and strengthens us (Isaiah 
    41:10). He puts His spirit within us, and so we are more than conquerors 
    (Romans 8:37).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Our enemy, Satan, is beaten in part already.</p></b></font> 
    Christ has given him his death's wound upon the cross (Colossians 2:15). The 
    devil may <i>roar </i>against a child of God—but shall not <i>hurt </i>him. 
    He could not touch Job's life, much less his soul; therefore, fear not. 
    "Resist the devil and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). Satan is a 
    conquered enemy. He knows no march, but running away.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Fighting is the best way to have peace.</p></b></font> By 
    sitting still, we tempt the enemy to fall upon us and wound us. Our peace is 
    preserved by war with Satan. He who has been skirmishing all day may take 
    David's pillow at night and say, "I will lay me down in peace."
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <font color="#008000"><b>How may we fight the 
    good fight so as to overcome?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. <font color="#008000"><b>Let us fight in the 
    strength of Christ. </b></font>Philippians 4:13: "I can do all things 
    through Christ who strengthens me." Grace itself, if it is not strengthened by 
    Christ — will be beaten out of the field. Some fight against sin in the 
    strength of their vows and resolutions—and so are foiled. We must go out 
    against our spiritual antagonists in the strength of Christ—like David went 
    out against Goliath in the name of the Lord (1 Samuel 17:45). "The saints 
    overcame the <i>accuser of the brethren</i>—by the blood of the Lamb" 
    Revelation 12:11.</p>
<p align="justify">We must fight on our knees by prayer. Prayer whips the 
    devil. The arrow of prayer, put into the bow of the promise and shot with 
    the hand of faith, pierces the old serpent. Prayer brings God over to our 
    side, and then we are on the strongest side. Let us pray that God will 
    enable us to overcome all our ghastly enemies. While Joshua was fighting, 
    Moses was praying on the mount (Exodus 17:11). So while we are fighting, let 
    us be praying (Ephesians 6:1318). The way to overcome is upon our knees.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Paul's CONSTANCY—"I have finished my course, I have 
    kept the faith."</p></b></font> It is as if Paul should say, "I have 
    finished my course. I have run out nature's lease. I have come to the ordained end of 
    life, and am stepping into eternity. I have kept the faith, that is, I have 
    kept the <i>doctrine </i>of faith. I have lived the <i>life </i>of faith."
<p align="justify">Observe, Christians should hold on until they come to the
    <i>finishing </i>of their faith. It is not enough to <i>begin </i>well, to 
    put forth fair <i>blossoms </i>of religion at first—but we must <i>continue 
    firm </i>to the end. This is the glory of a Christian—not only to hold <i>
    forth </i>the truth—but to hold <i>fast </i>the truth. It is a beautiful 
    sight to see <i>silver hairs </i>crowned with <i>golden virtues</i>. It was 
    the honor of the church of Thyatira that her last works were better than her 
    first (Revelation 2:19). The excellency of a medicine, is when it keeps its 
    virtue. To <i>finish </i>the course and <i>keep </i>the faith, is to be like 
    choice wine which keeps its spirits to the last drawing.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. </p></b></font>Here is a bill of indictment against 
    those who, before the finishing of their course, have departed from the 
    faith. They are fallen to <i>worldliness </i>or <i>wantonness</i>; the very 
    mantle of their profession is fallen off. <i>Judas </i>has many successors!
    <i>Demas </i>forsook God, and afterwards became a priest in an idol temple.
    <i>Julian </i>bathed himself in the blood of beasts offered in sacrifice to 
    heathen gods, and so, as much as in him lay, washed off his baptism. Things 
    which move from an <i>artificial </i>spring quickly cease. Profane hearts, 
    having only <i>external </i>artifices of piety—but lacking a <i>vital 
    principle of grace</i>, soon make a stop in true religion. How can they <i>
    adhere </i>to God—who never truly <i>loved </i>Him? The soldier who has no 
    true love for his commander, will throw off his colors. Hosea 8:3: "Israel 
    has cast off the thing that is good." We have had more <i>shipwrecks </i>at 
    land—than at sea. Men shipwreck their <i>conscience </i>(1 Timothy 1:19). <i>
    Apostates </i>unravel the work they have been doing for heaven. They pick 
    out all their golden stitches. As if a painter should with a pencil draw a 
    choice piece of art—and then come with his sponge and wipe it out again. <i>
    Apostates drop as windfalls into the devil's mouth</i>, having disparaged 
    the ways of God and put Christ to open shame (Hebrews 6:6). <i>God will make 
    them do penance in hell!
</i><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. </p></b></font>Persevere in the faith. What is a man 
    the better, to run some part of the race—and then tire and stop? What is a 
    man the better, to come within an inch of heaven—and then fall short? Who 
    makes reckoning of <i>corn </i>which withers before harvest, or <i>fruit </i>
    which falls from the tree before it is ripe. Oh, Christians, remember your 
    salvation is now nearer! (Romans 13:11) You are within sight of the holy 
    land—and will you now tire in your march? This is as if a ship laden with 
    jewels and spices, within sight of the shore, should be cast away. Or it is 
    as if a Jew had run to the city of refuge and had gotten within a few feet of 
    the city and then fainted and been slain by the avenger of blood. It was Beza's prayer, "Lord, perfect that which You have begun in me—that I may not 
    suffer shipwreck when I am almost in the haven."
<p align="justify">Consider that <i>persevering </i>in the faith is an 
    evidence between a true saint, and a hypocrite. The hypocrite sets up the 
    trade of religion—but will soon stop. He advances his mast and topsail, and 
    sets out for heaven—but in time of temptation falls away (Matthew 13:21). 
    But a true Christian is <i>fixed </i>in holiness. He is not as a <i>wave </i>
    of the sea—but as a <i>rock </i>in the sea. His zeal, like the fire of the 
    vestal virgins in Rome, is always kept burning.</p>
<p align="justify">That we may spin out this fine thread of piety, to its 
    full length and hold out to the end:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. If we would hold on in the faith, let us be 
    well-grounded in the fundamentals of true religion</p></b></font> (Colossians 
    1:23); the doctrines of justification, regeneration, resurrection and 
    eternal recompenses. Such as are <i>unprincipled </i>will be led into any 
    error—such as the Mass or the Koran. You may lead a <i>blind </i>man 
    anywhere!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If we would hold on in the faith, let us preserve a 
    jealous fear of ourselves. </p></b></font>Fear is the soul's safeguard. It 
    causes <i>vigilance </i>and banishes <i>presumption</i>. Romans 11:20: "Be 
    not high-minded, but fear." If God does not uphold us—we fall. How many have 
    been overturned with self-confidence, as the vessel with the large sail. The 
    fear of falling—keeps us from falling. Fear begets prayer—prayer begets 
    strength—and strength begets constancy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If we would keep the faith to the end, let us labor to 
    taste the sweetness of piety in our own souls. </p></b></font>Psalms 34:8: "Oh, 
    taste and see that the Lord is good." The <i>light </i>of truth is one 
    thing—the <i>relish of truth </i>is another. Psalm 119:103: "How <i>sweet
    </i>are Your words unto my taste—yes sweeter than honey!" Many fall away 
    because they never <i>tasted </i>what piety was. They could taste some 
    sweetness in food and wine—but Scripture promises were dry breasts to them. 
    If the <i>wine of the Word </i>has ever cheered our heart—we will never part 
    with it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. If we would continue our progress in the ways of God, 
    let us be inlaid with SINCERITY.</p></b></font> This silver thread of sincerity, 
    must run through the whole chain of our duties. A Christian may have a 
    double principle—but he does not have a double heart. He is sincere with the 
    Lord (Deuteronomy 18:13). Nothing will hold out but sincerity. Psalm 25:21: 
    "Let <i>integrity </i>preserve me." When Job could not hold fast his estate, 
    he held fast his piety. How was this? From his sincerity. Job 27:6: "My 
    righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go; my heart shall not 
    reproach me so long as I live." The garment of Job's profession did not 
    tear, because it was lined with sincerity.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Paul's CROWN.</p></b></font> The third part of the text is 
    Paul's crown: "Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness." It is 
    a crown <i><b>laid up. </b></i>A Christian's best things are to come. Well 
    might the Apostle say, "It does not yet appear what we shall be" (1 John 
    3:2). We are here on earth, as <i>princes in disguise</i>. The world knows us 
    not—but there is a crown laid up for us! While we are laying <i>out </i>for 
    God, He is laying <i>up </i>for us.
<p align="justify">What crown is this? A crown of righteousness. The 
    felicity of heaven is described sometimes by a city of <i>riches </i>
    (Hebrews 11:10), sometimes by a country of <i>pleasure </i>(Hebrews 11:16), 
    sometimes by a crown of <i>honor</i>. This crown has various appellations:</p>
<p align="justify">It is called a crown of <font color="#b07050"><b>glory
    </b></font>(1 Peter 5:4). It is full of <i>splendor</i>, therefore it is 
    said to be bespangled with stars (Revelation 12:1). We can no more bear a 
    sight of this crown until God enlarges our capacities, than a weak eye can 
    bear the dazzling beams of the sun.</p>
<p align="justify">It is called a crown of <font color="#b07050"><b>life </b>
</font>(James 1:12). Whoever heard of a <i>living </i>crown? It is a crown 
    of <i>life</i>, not only because it is bestowed in the life to come—but 
    because it enlivens with joy. It not only crowns the head—but cheers the 
    heart. It is a living crown.</p>
<p align="justify">It is called a crown of <font color="#B07050"><b>righteousness</b></font> in the text, not 
    that it is rightly due to us, or comes by our <i>merits, </i>as the papists 
    corruptly teach. <i>We cannot deserve a crumb at God's hands—much less a 
    crown!</i> Whatever service we do for God, is a due debt; nay, we cannot pay 
    for this crown—<i>for all our duties are stained with sin! </i>Where then, 
    is merit? </p>
<p align="justify">It is called a crown of righteousness, because it is 
    purchased by Christ's righteousness, and because it is righteous for God, 
    having promised this crown, to bestow it.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence, for the <i>persevering </i>saint, there is laid up 
    a crown of righteousness in heaven. A crown is the highest picture of 
    worldly happiness. It is only for kings and people of renown to wear. There 
    is a crown of righteousness laid up for the elect. It is a <i>weighty </i>
    crown. The Hebrew word for <i>glory </i>signifies a <i>weight</i>—things 
    that are precious and weighty. The more weighty they are, the more they are 
    worth. The weightier a gold chain is—the more it is worth. The heavenly 
    crown is expressed by a weight of glory in 2 Corinthians 4:17. This crown of 
    righteousness exceeds all earthly crowns.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">This crown of righteousness is more REFINED.</p></b></font> 
    Earthly crowns are interwoven with <i>troubles</i>. They are not made 
    without <i>crosses</i>. It was King Henry VII's motto: "A crown of gold, 
    hung in a bush of thorns." But the saint's crown is not mixed with trouble. 
    It adds no sorrow with it.
<p align="justify">The crown of righteousness is given to <i>every </i>
    individual saint. Here on earth, the crown goes but to one person; a crown 
    of gold will fit but one head. But in heaven, <i>every </i>saint is a 
    king—and has his crown!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">The crown of righteousness does not draw ENVY to it.</p></b></font> 
    David's crown was an eyesore to Absalom—and he would have plucked it from 
    his father's head. In the life to come, <i>different degrees of glory </i>
    shall neither stir up pride, nor cause envy, for though one crown may be 
    bigger than another, everyone's crown shall be as big as they can carry!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">The crown of righteousness is EVERLASTING</p></b></font>. 
    What disparages earthly crowns—is that they are <i>corruptible</i>. Proverbs 
    27:24: "Does the crown endure to every generation?" Terrestrial crowns soon 
    molder into the dust—but the crown of righteousness is a crown of <i>
    immortality</i>; it neither <i>wastes </i>nor <i>fades</i>. 1 Peter 5:4: 
    "And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the <i>unfading crown 
    of glory</i>." Eternity is a jewel of the saint's crown!
<p align="justify">QUESTION: <font color="#008000"><b>What is the MATTER of 
    which the celestial crown is made?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER: The crown itself consists in the beautiful sight 
    and fruition of the all-glorious God! What else is the angel's crown, but 
    the beholding of God's face! (Matthew 18:10) To experience transforming 
    sights of God, will ravish the elect with infinite delight! </p>
<p align="justify">If there was such gladness when Solomon was crowned (1 
    Kings 1:40): "All the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing 
    greatly, so that <i>the ground shook with the sound</i>", what mighty 
    acclamations and triumphs will be on the saints' coronation day? Such will 
    be the ecstasies and divine raptures of joy—as exceed our very faith! The 
    delights of heaven may be better <i>felt—</i>than <i>expressed</i>. Whatever 
    can be said of the celestial crown—is but as a drop in relation to the 
    ocean, nay, scarcely so much!</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION: <font color="#008000"><b>WHEN shall the saints 
    receive this crown of righteousness?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER: They shall receive it in part, immediately after 
    death. <i>Before their bodies are buried—their souls are crowned!</i> 2 
    Corinthians 5:8: "Absent from the body—present with the Lord." If the crown 
    were not instantly bestowed after death, it would be better for believers to 
    stay here on earth, for here they are daily increasing their grace. Here 
    they have some bunches of grapes by the way—sweet <i>foretastes </i>of God's 
    love. So they had better stay here if they do not have a speedy transition 
    and passage to glory. But this is the consolation of believers—that they 
    shall not wait long for their glorification. No sooner did <i>Lazarus </i>
    die, than he had a convoy of angels to carry him to Abraham's bosom! 
    Christians, you may be eternally happy and blessed—before you are aware! It 
    is but <i>winking—</i>and you shall see God!</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>full </i>glorification will be at the 
    resurrection, when the <i>bodies </i>and <i>souls </i>of believers shall be 
    reunited. Their <i>bodies </i>shall be crowned with immense felicity, and in 
    some measure, be like Christ's glorious body.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION: But why is the crown deferred at all? Why is it 
    not set on a Christian's head immediately after conversion?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER: It is not yet the proper season. We are heirs 
    under age. We receive but the first fruits of the Spirit (Romans 8:23). 
    Grace is in its minority now. Though some princes have been crowned in their 
    cradle, God crowns none until they are of perfect stature. Sin now mixes 
    with grace. Would we partake of glory—while we partake of sin?</p>
<p align="justify">Our work is not yet done; we have not finished the race. 
    The laborer does not receive his pay until his work is done. Christ's reward 
    was deferred until He had perfected His work. John 17:4-5: "I have brought 
    you glory on earth by <i>completing </i>the work you gave me to do. And now, 
    Father, <i>glorify </i>me in your presence with the glory I had with you 
    before the world began." The Lord does not think we should have our pay 
    beforehand. When we have arrived at the end of our faith—then comes full 
    salvation (1 Peter 1:9).</p>
<p align="justify">Then there is nothing lost by solid piety. After <i>
    fighting </i>the good fight of faith, comes the <i>crown </i>of 
    righteousness. When we hear of the <i>severe </i>part of religion, steeping 
    our souls in the briny tears of <i>repentance</i>, <i>mortifying </i>our 
    besetting sins—we are ready to grumble and rebel; but do we serve God for 
    nothing? Will He not compensate our labors with a <i>crown</i>, yes, a crown 
    which far exceeds our <i>thoughts</i>—as it does our <i>deserts!</i> No man 
    can say, without wrong done to God—that He is a hard master. The Lord gives
    <i>double </i>pay. He gives great rewards in His service here—inward joy and 
    peace—and afterwards He refreshes us with the delights of paradise which are 
    without <i>intermission </i>and <i>expiration</i>! Oh, what a vast 
    difference there is between <i>duty </i>enjoyed—and <i>glory </i>prepared! 
    What is the <i>shedding of a tear</i>—compared to an <i>eternal crown of 
    glory!</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">See what contrary ways the godly and the wicked go at 
    death.</p></b></font> The <i>godly </i>are advanced to crowns of glory; the <i>
    wicked </i>are bound with chains of darkness (Jude 6). But what are these 
    chains? Surely such as no strong corrosive can eat asunder. By these chains, 
    I understand God's sovereign omnipotence, fastening sinners under wrath (as 
    the chain does the prisoners) so that they cannot stir. Sinners may break the chain of God's <i>precepts—</i>but they cannot break 
    the chain of His <i>power</i>. This is the unparalleled misery of impenitent 
    souls—they do not go to a crown when they die—but are chained in a hellish 
    prison! Oh, think what horror and despair will possess the wicked, when they 
    see themselves engulfed in tremendous flames and their condition is <i>
    hopeless, helpless, </i>and <i>endless!
</i>
<p align="justify">A servant under the old law who had a hard master yet, 
    every seventh year being a year of <i>Jubilee </i>or <i>release</i>—might go 
    free. But in hell, there is no <i>year of release </i>when the damned shall 
    go free! (Mark 9:44). Have people lost their <i>reason</i>—as well as their
    <i>conscience! </i>They never think—what their sins will bring them to. 
    Though now sin shows its beauteous colors—yet in the end it will bite like a 
    serpent! If a man had but a sight of hell (said Bellarmine) it would be 
    enough to make him live a most godly life.</p>
<p align="justify">See the grand folly of those who for vain pleasures and 
    profits, will lose this celestial crown! It may be said of them, as in 
    Ecclesiastes 9:3, "Madness is in their heart!" Tiberias, for a drink of 
    water, lost his empire! Men swallow their <i>sugared temptations</i>, and 
    afterwards they forfeit eternal blessedness. This will accent and enhance a 
    sinner's torment, and will cause gnashing of teeth, to think how foolishly 
    he lost paradise. For a flash of impure joy—he parted with the quintessence 
    of eternal happiness. Would it not vex one to think he should be so seduced, 
    as to part with his great inheritance, for a bit of music? Such are they who 
    let heaven go—for a song! If Satan could make good his boast—in giving all 
    the glory and kingdoms of the world—they could not offset the loss of 
    heaven's crown! When a sinner dies, the devil receives him as <i>his fool</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">If the saints are installed and have the royal crown set 
    upon them at death, then what little cause have we to <i>mourn immoderately
    </i>at the death of godly friends! God allows us tears. Jacob wept over his 
    dead father. Tears give vent to grief—but there is no reason why we should 
    grieve excessively for the death of our pious friends. They receive an 
    eternal crown of glory! Shall <i>we </i>mourn—when <i>they </i>are crowned! 
    Suppose you had a dear relation beyond the sea, and you heard he was crowned 
    king. Would you grieve to hear of his advancement? The friend who dies in 
    the Lord, receives immediately a crown of righteousness—and will you be cast 
    down with sorrow? Why should you shed tears immoderately, for those who have 
    all tears wiped from their eyes! Why should you be swallowed up in <i>grief</i>, 
    for those who are swallowed up in <i>joy! </i>They are removed hence for 
    their advantage; as if one should be removed out of a <i>dungy cottage—</i>to 
    a <i>rich palace</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The prophet Elijah was removed in a fiery chariot to 
    heaven. Shall Elisha weep inordinately because he no longer enjoys the 
    company of Elijah? Is it not better to have <i>sparkling crowns </i>and <i>
    white robes</i>—than to sojourn in the tents of Kedar? Is it not better to 
    live among <i>holy angels—</i>than <i>fiery serpents? </i>Is it not best to 
    have Christ's banner of love displayed over us? Are there any sweeter 
    smiles, or softer embraces, than His? Why then should any bathe and even 
    entomb themselves in sorrow—for the death of their godly relations?</p>
<p align="justify">Theocritus says it was a custom among the ancients to 
    have a <i>funeral banquet, </i>because of the felicity they <i>supposed</i> the 
    deceased parties entered into. Oh, you who hang your harp upon the willows 
    and, with Rachel, refuse to be comforted! Remember there is no wiping away 
    tears from the eye—but with the shroud! Your godly friend could not be in 
    the region of the blessed—<i>until</i> he died. His <i>dying </i>day was his <i>
    ascension </i>day! Oh, then, keep your tears for your <i>sins</i>—but do not 
    torment yourself with grief, for him whose soul is as <i>holy </i>as it 
    would be—and as <i>happy </i>as it can be!</p>
<p align="justify">Are we heirs to this glorious crown? Such only as are 
    righteous people, shall wear the crown of righteousness. The <i>work </i>of 
    righteousness goes before the <i>crown </i>of righteousness (Isaiah 32:17). 
    Are we not only <i>morally </i>but <i>theologically </i>righteous? Have we a 
    righteousness of <i>imputation, </i>procured for us by Christ's merit, and a 
    righteousness of <i>implantation </i>produced in us by His Spirit? Are we 
    consecrated with the anointing oil of grace? God gilds the elect with the 
    beams of His own holiness, and makes them shine like Himself. Have we both 
    circumcision of <i>heart, </i>and circumspection of <i>life</i>? If we are 
    righteous people, we are sure to wear the crown of righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">Let not the profane presume on eternal happiness. Let 
    them not think to go to heaven, by leaping out of Delilah's lap into 
    Abraham's bosom. 1 Corinthians 6:9: "Don't you know that the <i>un</i>righteous 
    shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" <i>God will not lay a viper in his 
    bosom—or set a crown upon the head of a swinish sinner!</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use of Exhortation.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It has a double aspect to all in <i>general</i>.</p></b></font>

<p align="justify">Believe that there is a crown of righteousness laid up, 
    for all who fight the good fight. This truth should be engraved upon our 
    hearts as with the point of a diamond. Carnal people look upon the 
    felicities of the other world as a dreamy idea or delusion. They do not see 
    the crown with bodily eyes; therefore they question it. The verity of the <i>
    soul </i>may as well be questioned because, being a spirit, it cannot be 
    seen. <i>Doubting </i>biblical principles is the next step toward <i>denying
    </i>them. Let us set our seal to this: There <i>is </i>a crown of 
    righteousness laid up! Where should your faith rest, but upon a divine 
    testimony? The whole earth hangs upon the word of God's <i>power</i>—and 
    shall not our faith hang upon the word of His <i>promise</i>? Titus 1:2: "In 
    hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie, has promised."</p>
<p align="justify">The saint's crown is purchased by Christ's blood 
    (Ephesians 1:14), and Christ will not lose His purchase. What was the end of 
    Christ's ascension? He went up to heaven not only to invest Himself—but all 
    believers, with glory. What did Christ pray for—but that all the saints 
    might be with Him. (John 17:24) What Christ <i>prayed </i>for as a man, He 
    has <i>power </i>to give us since He is God. Besides, the Lord has given us 
    the <i>anointing </i>of His Spirit to prepare us, and the pledge of His 
    Spirit to assure us of happiness (2 Corinthians 1:21). The crown of 
    righteousness shall indubitably be bestowed—for He will not lose His pledge. 
    To question this, is to destroy the main article of our creed which is <i>
    life everlasting</i>. Such atheists who judge the eternal recompenses to be 
    fictions, put God to swear against them—that they shall never see life.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Strive for this crown.</p></i> I have read of those who 
    travel in long pilgrimages to the Holy Land. They have hard lodgings and 
    pass through a number of dangers, and at the end of their journey pay a 
    large tribute to the Turks. When they come there, they see only a bare 
    sepulcher where it is <i>supposed </i>that<i> </i>their Savior lay. Did <i>they </i>take 
    such pains to gratify their <i>superstitious </i>devotion? What herculean 
    labor, then, should a Christian undertake in his journey to the true land of 
    promise, whereby he shall both see and enjoy his Savior—and not enter into 
    His sepulcher but His palace and be eternally crowned with the delights of 
    the Jerusalem above!
<p align="justify">If we would take as many pains for heaven as others do 
    for the world, undoubtedly we might obtain it — reaching forth unto those 
    things which are ahead (Philippians 3:13). This is a metaphor taken from <i>
    racers </i>who reach their neck forward and strain every limb to lay hold 
    upon the prize.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two things requisite for a Christian—a <i>
    watchful eye </i>and a <i>working hand</i>. To achieve our purpose, let us 
    add <i>pursuit</i>. What scuffling is there for worldly honors! Men will 
    wade through blood for a crown! Was there such strife for a <i>corruptible
    </i>crown in the Olympian races? Sometimes the crown bestowed upon the 
    victor was made of olive branches, sometimes of myrtle, sometimes of 
    cinnamon enclosed in gold—but still it was <i>corruptible</i>. Oh, then, how 
    strenuously should we labor for the garland made of the <i>flowers of 
    paradise which never fade! </i>With what vigor and resolution did Hannibal 
    march over the Alps for the obtaining of <i>terrestrial </i>kingdoms! How 
    then, should we act  with extreme intensity for that <i>orient </i>crown 
    which shines ten thousand times brighter than the sun in its meridian 
    splendor!</p>
<p align="justify">Luther spent three hours a day in prayer. Anna, the 
    prophetess, departed not from the temple—but served God with fasting and 
    prayers night and day (Luke 2:37). The learned Calvin, Jewell, and Perkins 
    were indefatigable in their pursuit after glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us look to this cloud of witnesses and, turning back 
    to ourselves, ply our oar and double our efforts. Who would not toil all day 
    to catch <i>salvation </i>at night? The flesh cries out, "What weariness is 
    it! Who can endure all this labor!" The labor for heaven, though it seems 
    painful, is <i>transient</i>. The fight is quickly over—and then comes the 
    unfailing crown of glory!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It has a <i>particular </i>aspect to believers.</p></b></font> 
    Be full of pantings and longings for this crown of righteousness. Does not 
    the banished prince desire his native country? The unwillingness of 
    Christians to go to heavenly glory, shows:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) The weakness of their FAITH.</p></b></font> They question 
    their saving interest in this excellent glory. Were their title to heaven 
    more cleared, they would need patience to be content to stay here on earth 
    any longer.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) The weakness of their LOVE.</p></b></font> Love (as 
    Aristotle said) desires union. If men loved Christ as they should, they 
    would desire to be united to Him in glory. Paul desired to depart—and be 
    with Christ (Philippians 1:23). It was the speech of a holy man on his 
    deathbed, "My heart is in heaven, Lord; lead me to that glory which I have 
    seen already as through a glass."
<p align="justify">We are encompassed with a body of sin—should we not long 
    to shake off this viper! We are combating with Satan—should we not be 
    willing to be called out of the bloody field, where the bullets of 
    temptation fly so fast—that we may receive a victorious garland! We now live 
    far from heaven. Would we rather <i>desire </i>God — than <i>enjoy </i>Him? 
    Should we not long to be crowned with the blissful sight of God's face!</p>
<p align="justify">Though we should be content to stay here to do God's 
    service—we should ambitiously desire to be always sunning ourselves in the 
    light of God's countenance. Think what it will be to be led into Christ's 
    wine-cellar, to have the kisses of His mouth, to smell the fragrance of His 
    ointments, to lie in His bosom, that bed of love! Think what it will be like 
    to have unstained honor, unparalleled beauty, and unmixed joy! What will it 
    be like to tread upon stars, to dwell among cherubim, and to feast on those 
    heavenly delicacies and rarities with which God Himself is delighted! I 
    think our souls should be big with longing for these things, and we should 
    be put into such a blessed pathos of desire as Monica, who, hearing of the 
    joys of heaven, cried out, "What should I do here on earth? Why is my soul 
    held any longer with this earthen fetter of the flesh?" Would God but give 
    us some idea or imperfect glimpse of heaven's glory, how would we be ready 
    to fall into a ecstacy! And being a little recovered out of it, what earnest 
    suitors would we be to be caught up forever into the heavenly paradise!</p>
<p align="justify">You who are the heirs of glory—be exhorted to work with 
    all your might for God. Love and serve God more intently than others, for He 
    has laid up such things for you as eye has not seen, nor can it enter into 
    man's heart to conceive. 1 Corinthians 15:58: "Always abounding in the work 
    of the Lord, knowing your labor is not in vain in the Lord." Paul had a 
    spirit of fervent activity for God. 1 Corinthians 15:10: "I labored more 
    abundantly than they all." Paul's obedience did not move slowly, like the 
    sun upon the dial—but swiftly, like the sun in the skies. His eye was upon 
    the eternal crown! "Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness!"</p>
<p align="justify">The recompense of reward may add <i>wings</i> to duty—and 
    <i>oil</i> to 
    the flame of zeal. What are <i>we—</i>that God should encircle us with 
    happiness and not others—that He should (as Jacob) cross His hands, lay His 
    right hand upon <i>us </i>and His left hand upon others? Oh, may <i>sovereign 
    electing grace</i> forever to be adored! How can we ever serve God enough! 
    If there could be tears shed in heaven—it would be for this—that we have 
    been so lame in our duty, and have brought no more revenues into the 
    heavenly treasury!</p>
<p align="justify">Let this revive and bear up your hearts under all your 
    present sufferings. Acts 20:23: "Bonds and afflictions abide in me." 
    Affliction is the saints' portion here on earth. Instead of <i>roses</i>, 
    they are crowned with <i>thorns</i>. You may as well separate weight from 
    lead—as sufferings from a saint's life. 2 Corinthians 4:8: "We are troubled 
    on every side." Believers are as a ship which has the waves beating on both 
    sides—but this text may buoy them up from sinking. There is <i>glory</i> which 
    outlasts and exceeds all their <i>sufferings!</i></p>
<p align="justify">The saints now drink in a <i>wormwood </i>cup—but shortly 
    they shall drink in a <i>spiced </i>cup and taste the same heavenly nectar 
    as the angels! One day of wearing the celestial crown, will abundantly pay 
    for all their sufferings! Romans 8:18: "I recognize that the sufferings of 
    this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall 
    be revealed in us!" The weight of <i>glory </i>makes <i>affliction </i>
    light. Oh, you saints who are the true birds of paradise, sing in <i>winter</i>. 
    There is glory ahead, and every suffering will be like a grain put in the 
    scale to make your glory weigh heavier. Suffering saints shall have more <i>
    jewels </i>hung upon their crown!</p>
<p align="justify">Let this be an antidote against the fear of <b>death</b>. 
    The day of death is (as Seneca calls it) <i>the birthday of eternity</i>. 
    Believers are not fully happy and holy, until death. Death, therefore, is 
    made a part of the <i>inventory</i> (1 Corinthians 3:22). "Death is yours!" When 
    the mantle of the flesh drops off, the soul ascends in a triumphant chariot. 
    God has <i>promised</i> His people a portion—but it is not <i>paid</i> to them until the day 
    of death. It is their Father's good pleasure to give them a <i>kingdom </i>
    (Luke 12:32)—but they cannot see it until death has closed their eyes! Why 
    then should the saints be troubled at death? </p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, I wonder not that the <i>wicked </i>are <i>
    appalled </i>and <i>frightened </i>at the approach of the <i>King of terror</i>. 
    They are in debt to God's justice, and death, as <i>God's sergeant</i>, 
    arrests them and drags them before the divine tribunal. But why should any 
    of God's children be under such consternation and have trembling of heart? 
    What <i>hurt </i>does death do to them? It pulls off their fetters—and puts 
    jewels upon them! It leads them to gates of pearl, and rivers of pleasures! 
    Faith gives a <i>title </i>to heaven, death gives a <i>possession </i>to 
    heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">"Go forth, my soul," said Hilarion on his deathbed, "what 
    do you fear?" Why should the godly dread their <i>privilege</i>? Is a prince 
    afraid to cross the narrow sea, who is sure to be crowned as soon as he 
    comes to shore? This puts roses into the pale face of death, and makes it 
    look more ruddy and amiable. Death crowns the saints with all the delights 
    of heavenly glory.</p>
<p align="justify">I am done with the text—and it remains that I should 
    speak something to the <i>occasion </i>of this sermon.</p>
<p align="justify">It has pleased the all-wise God to take to Himself 
    lately, that holy and faithful minister, Mr. <i>Harry Stubs</i>, whose death 
    we now commemorate. The memory of the just is blessed. Fulgentius calls a <i>
    good name</i> the godly man's heir—it lives when he is dead. This man of God 
    has left a sweet savor and perfume behind in God's church, besides his 
    achievement of human learning. He was enriched with the knowledge of Christ 
    crucified.</p>
<p align="justify">He was very <b>humble</b>. Humility is the best garment a 
    minister can preach in. He was one of a thousand, for integrity. The plainer 
    the diamond is, the richer it is.</p>
<p align="justify">He was an <b>earnest </b>preacher, and chose rather to 
    speak <i>solidly </i>than <i>showy</i>. He spoke as was befitting the 
    oracles of God. <i>Levity </i>is below the majesty of preaching.</p>
<p align="justify">He was a <b>painstaking </b>laborer in God's vineyard. He 
    preached in season, and out of season. The souls of people were dearer to 
    him than his life. <i>Praying </i>and <i>preaching </i>were rather his <i>
    delight, </i>than <i>task</i>. He was a burning lamp, consuming himself to 
    give light to others.</p>
<p align="justify">He preached <b>feelingly</b>. He felt those truths in his 
    own soul which he recommended to his auditors. An unconverted minister is 
    like a lute, making sweet music to others but itself is not sensible. This 
    vessel retained a scent and relish of those sacred truths which he poured 
    out to others.</p>
<p align="justify">He lived much by <b>faith </b>and had sweet communion 
    with God. All the saints have God's <i>heart</i>—but some have more of His
    <i>company</i>. He was exemplary in his deportment. Ministers, by virtue of 
    their calling, approach nearer to God (Exodus 19:22). The <i>higher </i>the 
    elements are, the <i>purer </i>they are. The fire is purer than the air. The 
    higher we are by office—the holier we should be. Now deceased, he lived as 
    an incarnate angel. I may say of him what Basil said of Gregory Nazianzen: 
    he thundered in his doctrine—and was radiant in his life.</p>
<p align="justify">He was <b>charitably </b>minded. I have been credibly 
    informed that out of what little he had gathered together while he was 
    living, he appointed two hundred pounds, which he entrusted to the hands of 
    trustees to be improved annually for the good of the poor to buy them 
    Bibles.</p>
<p align="justify">He was of a sweet temper, never fierce—but against sin. 
    He was devout toward <i>God</i>, affable to his <i>friends</i>, and loving 
    to his <i>relations</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord honored his ministry very much; he had a <i>
    double </i>crown. The souls he converted were his crown of <i>rejoicing</i>, 
    and now he wears a crown of <i>righteousness</i>. How great a loss has 
    London of this eminent minister! It has been told me that he set apart some 
    time every day to pray for the church of God. He (like Moses) lay in the 
    breach—to turn away wrath. We shall soon grow poor if we lose such praying 
    friends. During the time of this good man's sickness, he was asthmatic and 
    labored much for breath so that he could not express himself so freely; but 
    what was heard to drop from him was very savory. He said he had fled to the 
    city of refuge and recited that Scripture, 2 Timothy 1:12: "I know whom I 
    have believed, and I am persuaded He is able to keep that which I have 
    committed to Him against that day."</p>
<p align="justify">I pray that God will give all who are concerned in this 
    loss, wisdom to improve this present stroke and make a <i>living sermon </i>
    of their dead pastor. He now enjoys the sight of that God, whom he so 
    pathetically longed for upon his deathbed. He is now into the <i>upper </i>
    region above all storms! His body is returned to dust—and his soul to rest. 
    He is <i>enclosed </i>in happiness, as the word for "crowning" imparts. He 
    is as rich as the angels! Though he has lost his life—yet not his crown!</p>
