    Soul</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>

<p align="justify"><br/>
    "For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his 
    own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</p></i> Matthew 
    16:26
<p align="justify">Every man carries a <i>treasure </i>about with him—a 
    divine soul. And that this jewel should not be undervalued, our Savior here 
    sets a price upon it. He lays the soul in balance with the whole world and, 
    being put in the scales—the soul weighs heaviest. "What is a man profited if 
    he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>world </i>is a stately fabric, enriched with 
    beauty and excellency; it is like a meticulous piece of tapestry, set about 
    with various colors. It is a bright mirror—in which much of the wisdom and 
    majesty of God is resplendent; but as glorious as this world is, every man 
    carries a more glorious world about with him—a precious soul. It would 
    bankrupt the world to give half the price of a soul; it will undo the world 
    to buy it, and it will undo him who shall sell it. If we can save our souls, 
    though we lose the world, it is a gainful loss. But if we lose our souls 
    though we gain the world, our very gains will undo us. "For what is a man 
    profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what 
    shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</p>
<p align="justify">The words branch themselves into five parts:</p>
<p align="justify">1. A <i>supposal </i>of a purchase—"if a man shall gain." 
    The proposition is hypothetical; Christ does not say he shall gain—but puts 
    forth a supposition; it is not a certain purchase, it is only <i>supposed</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The <i>purchase </i>itself—the world.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The <i>extent </i>of the purchase—the whole world, the 
    world with all its revenues and benefits.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The <i>terms </i>of this purchase—he shall lose his 
    soul. Not that his soul shall be annihilated (that would make him happy)—but 
    he shall lose the end of his creation. He shall miss glory—if he shall lose 
    his soul.</p>
<p align="justify">The loss of the soul is amplified by two things: </p>
<p align="justify">First, the <i>propriety</i>. It is his own soul, that 
    which is nearest to him, that which is most himself. The soul is the most 
    noble part; it is the man of the man.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, the <i>irrecoverableness </i>of the loss. "What 
    shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" What shall he give? It is as if 
    Christ had said, "Alas, he has nothing to give; or if he had something to 
    give—yet nothing will be taken for it." The soul cannot be exchanged; there 
    shall be no bail taken for it. "What shall a man give in exchange for his 
    soul."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Our Savior's verdict upon this purchase—"for what is a 
    man profited?" It is as if Christ had said, "He will have a hard bargain of 
    it; he will repent of selling it at last. It is but the fool's purchase!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE: The soul of man is a jewel more precious than a 
    world.</p></b></font> All souls are of one price; in this sense that maxim holds 
    true: "all souls are alike." The soul of prince and peasant are equal; and 
    every soul is of more value than a world.
<p align="justify">For the illustration of the doctrine there are two things 
    to be demonstrated: First, that the soul is very precious; second, that it 
    is more precious than a world.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The soul is very precious.</p></b></font> What Job said of 
    wisdom, I may fitly apply to the soul: "Man does not comprehend its worth. 
    It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in 
    silver. It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or 
    sapphires. Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had 
    for jewels of gold." (Job 28:13, 16-17). 
<p align="justify">The soul is the glory of the creation. The soul is a beam 
    of God; it is a sparkle of celestial brightness, as Demascen calls it. There 
    is in the soul, an idea and resemblance of God, an analogy of similitude of 
    God. If David so admired the rare texture and workmanship of his body (Psalm 
    139:14-15: "I am fearfully and wonderfully made.") If the <i>cabinet </i>is 
    so curiously wrought, what is the <i>jewel!</i> How richly and gloriously 
    the soul is embroidered! It is divinely inlaid and enameled. The body is but 
    the sheath. Daniel 7:15: "I was grieved in the midst of my body." In the 
    Chaldean version it is "in the midst of my sheath." The most beautiful body 
    is but like a velvet sheath; the soul is the blade of admirable metal. The 
    soul is a sparkling <i>diamond </i>set in a ring of clay. The soul is a 
    vessel of honor. God Himself is served in this vessel. The soul is the <i>
    bird of paradise </i>which soars aloft; it may be compared to the wings of 
    the cherubim; it has a winged swiftness to fly to heaven. The soul is 
    capable of communion with God and angels. The soul is God's house that He 
    has made to dwell in (Hebrews 3:6). The <i>understanding</i>, <i>will</i>, 
    and <i>affections </i>are the three stories in this house. What a pity it 
    is, that this goodly building should be rented out—and the devil become a 
    tenant in it!</p>
<p align="justify">The preciousness of the soul is seen in its intrinsic 
    worth and in its estimative worth.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The soul has an INTRINSIC worth</p></b></font>, which appears 
    in its <i>spirituality </i>and its <i>immortality</i>. The soul is a 
    spiritual substance. It is a saying among the ancients, "Our souls are 
    tempered in the same mortar as the heavenly spirits." The soul is spiritual 
    in three ways: in its essence, its object, and its operation.
<p align="justify">The soul is spiritual in its <b>essence</b>. God breathed 
    it in (Genesis 2:7). It is a spark lighted by the breath of God. The <i>soul
    </i>may be compared to the spirits of the wine; the <i>body </i>to the 
    dregs. The spirits are the more pure refined part of the wine—and such is 
    the soul. The body is more vulgar; the soul is the more refined, sublimated 
    part of man. Do not mistake me when I say the soul is spiritual, and that it 
    is beam of God. I do not mean that it is of the same substance with Him, as 
    Servetus, Osiander, and others have held; for when it is said that God 
    breathed into man the breath of life, they erroneously thought that the 
    soul, being infused, conveyed into man the spirit and substance of God, 
    which opinion is absurd and sinful. For if the soul should be part of the 
    Divine essence, then it will follow that the essence of God should be 
    subject not only to change and passion—but, which is worse, to sin, which 
    would be blasphemy to assert. So when we say that the soul is spiritual—we 
    mean that God has invested it with many noble endowments. He has made it a 
    mirror of beauty, and printed upon it a surpassing excellency. The sun 
    shining upon crystal conveys its beauty, not its being.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul is spiritual in its <b>object</b>; it 
    contemplates God and heaven. God is the orb and center where the soul fixes 
    itself upon. The soul moves to God as to its rest. Psalm 116:7: "Return to 
    your rest, O my soul." He is the ark to which this dove flies; nothing but 
    God can fill a heaven-born soul. If the earth were turned into a globe of 
    gold, it could not fill the heart; it would still cry, "Give, give." The 
    soul being spiritual, God only can be the adequate object of it.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul is spiritual in its <b>operation</b>. Since it 
    is immaterial, it does not depend upon the body in its working. The senses 
    of seeing, hearing, and the rest of those organs of the body, cease and die 
    with the body because they are parts of the body and have their dependence 
    on it. But the soul has a nature distinct from the body; it moves and 
    operates of itself though the body is dead, and has no dependence upon or 
    co-existence with the body. Thales Milesius, an ancient philosopher, called 
    the soul "self-moveable." It has an intrinsic principle of life and motion, 
    though it is separate from the body. Thus you have seen the soul's 
    spirituality.</p>
<p align="justify">The preciousness of the soul also appears in its 
    immortality. There are some who say that the soul is mortal; indeed, it 
    would be well for those who do not live like men—if they might die like 
    beasts. But, as one well observes, it is impossible for anything of a 
    spiritual, uncompounded nature to be subject to death and corruption. The 
    souls of believers are with Christ after death (Philippians 1:23).</p>
<p align="justify">Oecolampadias said to his friend, who came to visit him 
    on his death-bed, "Good news! I shall be shortly with Christ my Lord." And 
    the devout soul shall be forever with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:17). The 
    heathens had some glimmerings of the soul's immortality. Cicero said that 
    the swan was dedicated to Apollo because she sings sweetly before her death; 
    by which emblem they intimated the joyfulness of virtuous men before their 
    death, as supposing the Elysian delights which they should always enjoy 
    after this life. And we read that it was a custom among the Romans, when 
    their great men died, to cause an eagle to fly aloft in the air, signifying 
    hereby that the soul was immortal and did not die as the body dies.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul's immortality may be proved by this argument: 
    That which is not capable of being killed, is not capable of dying. The soul 
    is not capable of being killed. Our Savior Christ proved the minor 
    proposition, that it is not capable of being killed. Luke 12:4: "Fear not 
    those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." 
    Therefore the soul, not being capable of being killed, is not in a 
    possibility of dying. The essence of the soul is spiritual: it has a 
    beginning—but no end. It is eternal. The soul does not wax old; it lives 
    forever, which can be said of any other created thing. Worldly things are as 
    full of mutation as motion, and, like Jonah's gourd, have a worm eating at 
    the root.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The soul has an ESTIMATIVE worth. </p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ</p></b> has set a high value and estimate upon 
    the soul. He made it and He bought it; therefore He best knows the value of 
    it. He sold Himself to buy the soul. Zechariah 11:12: "They weighed for My 
    price thirty pieces of silver." Nay, He was content not only to be sold—but 
    to die. This enhances the price of the soul: it cost the blood of God (Acts 
    20:28). 1 Peter 1:19: "You were not redeemed with corruptible things, such 
    as silver and gold—but with the precious blood of Christ." Christ must die 
    that the soul may live; the Heir of heaven was pawned for the soul of man. 
    What could Christ give more than Himself? What in Himself was dearer than 
    His blood? O precious soul, who has the image of God to beautify you and the 
    blood of God to redeem you! Christ was the <i>Priest</i>, His divine nature 
    the <i>altar</i>, and His blood the <i>sacrifice </i>which He offered up as 
    an atonement for our souls! Now reckon what a drop of Christ's blood is 
    worth—and then tell me what a soul is worth!
<b>
<p align="justify">Satan </p></b>values souls; he knows their worth. The king of 
    Sodom said to Abraham, "Give me the people—and take the goods to yourself." 
    So Satan says, "Give me the people." He does riot care how rich you are; he 
    does not strive to take away your estates—but your souls. "Give me the 
    people," he says. "You take the goods." What are all his warlike stratagems, 
    his subtle snares—but to catch souls? Why does this lion so roar—but for his 
    prey? He envies the soul its happiness; he lays the whole train of 
    temptation, to blow up the whole royal fort of the soul. Why does he lay 
    such suitable baits? He allures the <i>ambitious </i>man with a crown, the
    <i>covetous </i>man with a golden apple, and the <i>lustful </i>man with 
    beauty. Why does he tempt you to Delilah's lap—but to keep you from 
    Abraham's bosom? The devil is <i>angling </i>for the precious soul. To undo 
    souls is his pride; he glories in the damnation of souls; it is next to 
    victory to die revenged. If Sampson must die, it is some comfort that he 
    shall make more die with him. If Satan, that lion, must be kept in his 
    hellish den, it is all the heaven he expects to reach forth his paw and pull 
    others into the den with him!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. </p></b></font>Having shown you the soul's preciousness, 
    the next thing to be demonstrated, is that <font color="#008000"><b>the soul 
    is more precious than a world</b></font>. The world is made of a more impure 
    lump; the world is of a coarser make, of an earthly extract. The soul is 
    heaven-born, of a finer spinning, of a more noble descent. The <i>world </i>
    is a great book or volume, wherein we read the majesty and wisdom of Him who 
    made it; but the <i>soul </i>is the image of God (Genesis 1). The soul is a 
    studied piece; when God made the world, it was but, "Let it be," and it was 
    done. But when He made the soul, all the persons in the Trinity sat together 
    at the council table. Genesis 1:26: "Come, let <i>us </i>make man in our own 
    likeness." The soul is a looking-glass wherein some rays of divine glory 
    shine; much of God is to be seen in it. Though this looking-glass is cracked 
    by the fall—yet it shall one day be perfect. We read of "spirits of just men 
    made perfect" (Hebrews 12:23). The soul, since the fall of Adam, may be 
    compared to the moon in its wane, very much obscured by sin. But when it is 
    sanctified by the Spirit and translated from hence, it shall be as the full 
    moon: it shall shine forth in its perfect glory.
<p align="justify">If the soul is so precious, see then what that worship 
    is, which God expects and accepts, namely, that which comes from the more 
    noble part of the soul. Psalm 25:1, "To You, O Lord, do I lift up my <i>soul</i>." 
    David not only lifted up his <i>voice</i>—but his <i>soul</i>. Though God 
    will have the eye and the knee, the service of the body—yet He complains of 
    those who draw near with their <i>lips</i>, when their <i>hearts </i>are far 
    from Him (Isaiah 29:13). The soul is the jewel. David not only put his lute 
    and violin in tune—but his soul in tune to praise God. Psalm 103:1: "Bless 
    the Lord, O my <i>soul</i>." His affections joining together in worship, 
    made up the concert. The soul is both altar, fire, and incense; it is the <i>
    altar </i>on which we offer up our prayers, the <i>fire </i>which kindles 
    our prayers, and the <i>incense </i>which perfumes them.</p>
<p align="justify">God's eye is chiefly upon the soul. Bring a hundred 
    dishes to the table, and He will carve none but this; this is the savory 
    meat He loves. He who is best—will be served with the best. When we give Him 
    the <i>soul </i>in a duty, then we give Him the <i>flower </i>and the <i>
    cream</i>. By a holy chemistry we distill out the spirits. A soul inflamed 
    in service is the cup of spiced wine, and the juice of the pomegranate (Song 
    of Solomon 8:2), which the spouse gives Christ to drink. Without the worship 
    of the soul, all our religion is but bodily exercise (1 Timothy 4:8), which 
    profits nothing. Without the soul, we give God but a carcass. What are all 
    the papists' fastings, penance, and pilgrimages—but going to hell in more 
    pomp and state? What are the formalist's prayers, which even cool between 
    his lips—but a dead devotion? It is not <i>sacrifice, </i>but <i>sacrilege</i>; 
    he robs God of that which He has a right to—his soul.</p>
<p align="justify">If the soul be so precious, then of what precious account 
    should ordinances and ministers be? <i>Ordinances </i>are the golden ladder 
    by which the soul climbs up to heaven; they are conduits of the water of 
    life. Oh, how precious should these be to us! They who are against 
    ordinances, are against being saved.</p>
<p align="justify">And of how precious an account should <i>ministers </i>
    be, whose very work is to save souls. Their feet should be considered 
    beautiful. Their labors should be precious. They labor with God, and they 
    labor for your souls; all their sweat, their tears, and their prayers are 
    for you. They woo for your souls, and oftentimes spend their lives in the 
    suit.</p>
<p align="justify">Their liberty should be precious. If indeed you see any 
    of them who are of this holy and honorable function, either idle or 
    ravenous; if they do not divide the Word rightly, and live uprightly—censure 
    them and do not spare them. God forbid I should open my mouth for such! In 
    the law, the lips of the leper were to be covered; that minister who is by 
    office an angel—but by his life a leper, ought to have his lips covered; he 
    deserves to be silenced. </p>
<p align="justify">A good <i>preacher</i>—but a bad <i>liver</i>, is like a 
    physician who has the plague: though the advice and prescriptions he gives 
    may be good—yet his plague infects the patient. So though ministers may have 
    good words and give good prescriptions in the pulpit—yet the plague of their 
    unholy lives infects their people. If you find a Hophni and Phinehas among 
    the sons of Levi, whose unholy life makes the offering of God to be 
    abhorred, you will save God a labor in ejecting them. But be sure you 
    distinguish between the precious and the vile; while you let out the bad 
    blood, have a care to preserve the heart-blood; while you purge out the ill 
    humors, do not destroy the spirits; while you are taking away the snuffs, do 
    not eclipse the lights of God's sanctuary. It is a work fit for a Julian to 
    suppress the orthodox ministry and open the temple of the idol. The Romans 
    sacked the city of Corinth, and razed it down to the ground for some 
    incivility offered to their ambassador. God will avenge the affronts offered 
    to His ministers (Psalm 105:15). Oh, take heed of this! </p>
<p align="justify">If souls are of such infinite value, how precious should 
    their liberties be, whose very design and negotiation is to save souls! (1 
    Timothy 4:16; Jude 23)</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Application</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Exhortation.</p></b></font> If the soul is so precious, take 
    heed of abusing your souls. Socrates exhorted young men that they should 
    look at their faces in a looking-glass, and if they saw they were fair, they 
    should do nothing unworthy of their beauty. Christians, God has given you 
    souls that sparkle with divine beauty. Oh, do nothing unworthy of these 
    souls; do not abuse them. 
<p align="justify">There are four sorts of people who abuse souls:</p>
<p align="justify">1. They abuse their souls who DEGRADE their souls. Such 
    people set the world above their souls. "Who pant after the dust of the 
    earth" (Amos 2:7). This is as if a man's house were on fire, and he should 
    take care to preserve the lumber—but let his child be burned in the fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Such people make their souls servants to their bodies. 
    The body is but the brutish part, the soul the angelic part. The soul is the 
    queen-regent, who is adorned with the jewels of knowledge and sways the 
    scepter of liberty. Oh, what a pity it is that this excellent soul shall be 
    made into a vassal and be put to grind in the mill, when the body in the 
    meantime sits in a chair of state! Solomon complains of an evil under the 
    sun in Ecclesiastes 10:7, "1 have seen servants upon horses, and princes 
    walking as servants upon the earth." Is it not an evil under the sun to see 
    the body riding in pomp and triumph, and the soul of man, that royal and 
    heaven-born thing, as a slave walking on foot?</p>
<p align="justify">2. They abuse their souls who SELL them. </p>
<p align="justify">The <b>covetous </b>person sells his soul for money. It 
    is said of the lawyer, "He has a tongue that will be sold for a fee." So the 
    covetous man has a soul that is sold for money. Achan sold his soul for a 
    wedge of gold. Judas sold his soul for silver, and cheap at that! For thirty 
    pieces of silver he sold Christ, who was more worth than heaven, and his own 
    soul, which was more worth than a world! How many have damned their souls 
    for money! (1 Timothy 6:9-10) If you mix these earthly things with your 
    souls and let them lie too near you, they will in time consume and undo your 
    souls.</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>ambitious </b>person sells his soul for honor. 
    Alexander the sixth sold his soul to the devil for a popedom. What is that 
    honor, but a torch lighted by the breath of people, and with the least puff 
    of censure blown out! How many souls have been blown into hell with the wind 
    of popular applause!</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>voluptuous </b>person sells his soul for pleasure. 
    Heliogabalus drowned himself in sweet water. Just so, many drown their souls 
    in the sweet perfumed waters of pleasure. Plato calls pleasure "the bait 
    that catches souls." Pleasure is a silken halter, a flattering devil; it 
    kills by <i>embracing</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They abuse their souls who POISON their souls. Error 
    is a sweet poison. Ignatius calls it the invention of the devil. A man can 
    as well damn his soul by <i>error </i>as by <i>vice</i>—and may as soon go 
    to hell for a drunken opinion as for a drunken life.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They abuse their souls who STARVE their souls; these 
    are they who say they are above ordinances. But surely we shall not be above 
    ordinances, until we are above sin. The apostle said that in the blessed 
    sacrament we are to remember the Lord's death until He comes (1 Corinthians 
    11:26), that is, until Christ comes to judgment. How then can any omit 
    sacraments without a contempt and affront offered to Christ Himself? If Paul 
    and the apostles, those giants in grace, needed the Lord's Supper to confirm 
    and nourish them, much more do we need such holy ordinances who have but an 
    infant faith. But Satan likes these fasting days; he would have men fast 
    from ordinances. If the body is kept from food, it cannot live long.</p>
<p align="justify">If the soul be so precious a thing, take heed that you do 
    not lose your souls. What a loss it is will appear in these two things:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It is a FOOLISH loss to lose the soul. </p></b></font>"You 
    fool, this night your soul shall be required of you!" (Luke 12:20) It is a 
    foolish loss to lose the soul, and that in a three-fold respect:
<p align="justify">First, because there is a possibility of saving the soul. 
    We have time to work in; we have light to work by; we have the Spirit 
    offering us help. The soul is like a ship laden with jewels; the Spirit is a 
    gale of wind to blow. If we would but loosen anchor from sin, we might 
    arrive at the port of happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, it is a foolish loss, because we lose the soul 
    for things of no value. Worldly things are infinitely below the soul; they 
    are nonentities. Proverbs 23:5: "Cast but a glance at riches, and they are 
    gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an 
    eagle." The world is but a bewitchery; these things glisten in our eyes—but 
    at death we shall say that we have set our eyes on that which is not. Now to 
    lose the soul for such poor inconsiderate things is a foolish thing. It is 
    as if one should throw a diamond at a pear tree; he loses his diamond.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, it is a foolish loss for a man to lose his soul, 
    because he himself has a hand in it. Is it not folly to give oneself poison? 
    A sinner has his hands saturated in the blood of his own soul. "Your 
    destruction is of yourself!" (Hosea 13:9). "They lay wait for their own 
    blood" (Proverbs 1:18). The foolish sinner nourishes those lusts which kill 
    his soul; the tree breeds the worm, and the worm eats the tree. Would it not 
    be folly for a garrison to open to the enemy which besieges it? The sinner 
    opens to those lusts which war against his soul (1 Peter 2:11), and this is 
    a foolish loss.</p>

<p align="justify">2. It is an IRREPARABLE loss to lose the soul.</p></b></font> 
    Other losses may be made up again; if a man loses his health, he may recover 
    it again; if he loses his estate, he may get it up again. But if he loses 
    his soul, this loss can never be made up again. Are there any more saviors 
    to die for the soul? As Naomi said to her daughters, "Are there yet any more 
    sons in my womb" (Ruth 1:11)? Has God any more sons? Or will He send His Son 
    any more into the world? No! Christ's next coming is not to save it—but to 
    judge it. Christian, remember you have but one soul, and if that is gone—all 
    is gone. "God," said Chrysostom, "has given you two eyes. If you lose one, 
    you have another. But you have but one soul, and if that perishes you are 
    quite undone." The merchant who ventures all in one ship, if that ship is 
    lost, he is quite bankrupt.

<p align="justify">3. The loss of the soul is an ETERNAL loss.</p></b></font> 
    Once the soul is lost, it is lost forever. The sinner and the furnace shall 
    never be parted (Isaiah 33:14). <i>As the sinner's heart will never be 
    emptied of sin—so God's vial shall never be emptied of wrath!
