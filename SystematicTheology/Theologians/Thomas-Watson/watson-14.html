<p align="justify">"Tell the <b>righteous</b> it will be <i>well</i> with 
    them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds. <i>Woe</i> to the <b>
    wicked</b>! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their 
    hands have done." Isaiah 3:10-11 </p>
<p align="justify">This text is like Israel's pillar or cloud—it has a <i>
    light </i>side and a <i>dark </i>side. It has a <i>light </i>side unto the 
    godly—"Tell the righteous it will be well with them." And it has a <i>dark
    </i>side unto the wicked—Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them!" Both, 
    you see, are rewarded, righteous and wicked—but here is a vast difference: 
    one has a reward of <i>mercy</i>—and the other a reward of <i>justice</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">I begin with the first of these, "Tell the righteous it 
    will be well with them." This Scripture was written in a very sad and 
    calamitous time, as you may read in the beginning of the chapter: "The 
    mighty man and the man of war shall cease, the prudent and the ancient, both 
    judge and prophet shall be taken away." This was a very sad time with the 
    church of God in Jerusalem.</p>
<p align="justify">If the <i>judge </i>is taken away, where will there be 
    any justice? If the prophet is removed, where will there be any message from 
    God? The whole nation was running to ruin and almost in the rubbish. Now in 
    this sad juncture of time, God would have this text to be written; and it is 
    like a rainbow in the clouds. God would have His people comforted in the 
    midst of all afflictions. "Tell the righteous it will be well with them."</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. </p></b></font>The great proposition which lies in the 
    words is this: <b>however things go in this world, it shall be well with the 
    righteous man at last. </b>This is an oracle from God's own mouth; 
    therefore, we are not to dispute it. It is God's own oracle, "Tell the 
    righteous it will be well with them."
<p align="justify">I might multiply Scriptures—but I will give you one 
    instance in Ecclesiastes 8:12: "Surely I know that it shall be well with 
    those who fear God." I know it. It is as a golden maxim not to be disputed. 
    "It shall be well with those who fear God."</p>
<p align="justify">For the illustration of this, consider two questions: </p>
<p align="justify">Who is meant by "the righteous man"? </p>
<p align="justify">And what does it mean that, however things go, it shall 
    be well with the righteous?</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION 1. <font color="#0000ff"><b>Who is meant here by 
    the righteous man?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. There is a threefold righteousness:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. There is a LEGAL righteousness</p></b></font>, and so 
    Adam, in this sense, was said to be righteous when he wore the robe of <i>
    innocence</i>. Adam's heart agreed with the law of God exactly—as a 
    well-made dial goes exactly with the sun; but this righteousness has been 
    forfeited and lost.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. There is a MORAL righteousness</p></b></font>, and thus he 
    is said to be righteous who is adorned with the moral virtues, who is 
    prudent and just and temperate, who is decked with the <i>jewel of morality</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. There is an EVANGELICAL righteousness </p></b></font>and 
    this is what is meant here in this verse. This evangelical righteousness is 
    twofold.
<p align="justify">There is a righteousness of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    imputation</b></font>, and that is when Christ's righteousness is made over 
    to us. Beloved, this righteousness is as truly ours to justify us—as it is 
    Christ's to bestow upon us.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a righteousness of <font color="#b07050"><b>
    implantation</b></font>, which is nothing else but the infusing of the <i>
    seed </i>and <i>habit </i>of grace into the heart, a planting of holiness in 
    a man and making him partaker of the divine nature. This is to be righteous 
    in the sight of God, a righteousness of <i>imputation </i>and a 
    righteousness of <i>implantation</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION 2. <font color="#0000ff"><b>How is it that 
    however things go in the world—yet it shall be well with this righteous man?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. It must be thus for two reasons:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Because he who is righteous has his greatest evils 
    removed, his sin is pardoned, and then it must be well with him.</p></b></font> 
    Sin is the thorn in a man's conscience. When the thorn is plucked out by 
    forgiveness and remission, then it is well with that man. 
<p align="justify">Forgiveness in Scripture is called a <i>lifting off of 
    sin</i>. Job 7:21: "Lord, why do You lift not off my sin?" So the Hebrew 
    word carries it; it is a metaphor taken from a <i>weary </i>man who goes 
    under a <i>burden </i>and is ready to sink under it—and then another man 
    comes and lifts off this burden. Even so does the great God. When the burden 
    of sin is ready to sink the man, God lifts off this burden from the 
    conscience and lays it on Christ's shoulder—and He carries it now. He who 
    has this burden thus carried, it is well with him however things go for him 
    in this world.</p>
<p align="justify">Forgiveness and pardon of sin, is a crowning blessing. It 
    is the <i>jewel </i>of a believer's crown. Pardon of sin is a <i>multiplying
    </i>mercy—it brings a great many mercies along with it. Whom God pardons, He
    <i>adopts</i>; whom God pardons, He invests with <i>grace </i>and <i>glory</i>! 
    This is a multiplying mercy—and it is enough to make a sick man well. Isaiah 
    33:24: "The inhabitants shall not say, 'I am sick'; the people shall be 
    forgiven their iniquity." The sense of <i>pardon </i>takes away the sense of
    <i>pain</i>. It must be well with the righteous for sin—his greatest evil, 
    is removed.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. However things go, it is well with the righteous 
    because God is his portion. </p></b></font>Psalm 16:5-6: "The Lord is the 
    portion of my inheritance. The lines have fallen unto me in pleasant 
    places." In <i>God</i>, there are all <i>good </i>things to be found; and 
    all that is in God is engaged for the good of the righteous. His <i>power
    </i>is to help, and His <i>wisdom </i>is to teach, and His <i>mercy </i>is 
    to save.
<p align="justify">God is the righteous man's portion, and can God give a 
    greater gift unto us than Himself? God is a <i>rich </i>portion, for He has 
    unsearchable riches. God is a <i>safe </i>and <i>sure </i>portion, for His 
    name is a strong tower. He is a portion that can never be spent—for He is 
    infiniteness. He is a portion that can never be <i>lost—</i>for He is 
    eternity. "You are my portion forever" (Psalm 73:26), and surely it is well 
    with the righteous man, who has God for his portion. Is it not well with 
    that man who is <i>happy</i>? Why, if God is our portion, we are happy. 
    Psalm 144:15: "<i>Happy </i>is the people whose God is the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">Thus I have cleared up the doctrinal part for the use of 
    this. Here is abundance of comfort for every godly man. God has sent me this 
    day with a commission to comfort you!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, that I might drop the <i>oil of gladness </i>into 
    every broken heart and rejoice every troubled spirit. Here is good news from 
    heaven: <i>"Say unto the righteous it shall be well with him."</i></p>

<p align="justify">QUESTION 3. But here is a question that must be answered. 
    You will say to me, <font color="#0000ff"><b>"But how does it appear that it 
    shall be <i>well </i>with the righteous, for we often see it is <i>worse </i>
    with them in this world? </b></font>He is deprived of his comfort many 
    times; he is made the very reproach of the world oftentimes. How then, is it 
    well with the righteous?"</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. To this I answer, still it is well with the 
    righteous. Though he meets with trouble in the world and one follows on the 
    neck of another—yet it is well with the righteous as will appear in these 
    four particulars:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The troubles the righteous man meets with turn to his 
    good, and so it is well with him. </p></b></font>That is a most famous Scripture 
    in Jeremiah 24:5: "Whom I have sent out of this place unto the land of the 
    Chaldeans, <i>for their good</i>." God's own Israel was transported into 
    Babylon among their enemies—but it is for their good, said the Lord. The 
    troubles of the righteous, are a means to purge out their sin. I have read a 
    story of one who was running at another with a sword to kill him, and by 
    accident his sword ran into an abscess—and broke the abscess—and so cured 
    him. Just so, all the evils and troubles of the righteous serve but to cure 
    them of the <i>abscess of pride</i>, and to make them more <i>humble</i>. 
    When that <i>body </i>of a saint is afflicted, his <i>soul </i>revives and 
    flourishes in grace.
<p align="justify">At Rome, there were two laurel trees—when one withered 
    the other flourished. So when the <i>body </i>is afflicted, the <i>soul </i>
    revives and flourishes.</p>
<p align="justify">Out of the bitterest drink, God distills His glory—and 
    our salvation. Jerome said that the world looks on affliction as a 
    punishment—but God makes a <i>medicine </i>to heal the sore. Then it is well 
    with the righteous. The <i>rod of God </i>upon a saint—is but only <i>God's 
    pencil </i>whereby He draws His image more lively on the soul. God never <i>
    strikes </i>the strings of His violin—but to make the music the <i>sweeter</i>. 
    Then it is well with the righteous.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. In the midst of all the trouble that befalls the 
    righteous, still it is well with them in regard to those <i>inward heart 
    revivings</i>, which God gives them. </p></b></font>We see a godly man's <i>
    misery</i>—but we do not see his <i>comfort</i>. We see his <i>prison </i>
    gates—but we do not hear the <i>music </i>which is within his conscience. 
    God sweetens His people in outward trouble—with inward peace. He is "the 
    Father of compassion and the <i>God of all comfort</i>, who comforts us in 
    all our troubles." 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 . The bee can gather honey as well 
    from the thistle and bitter herb—as from the sweet flower. A child of God 
    can gather <i>joy </i>out of his <i>sorrow</i>. Out of the very carcass, 
    sometimes, the Lord gives honey. When the <i>body </i>is in pain—the <i>soul
    </i>may be at ease. Just as when a man's head aches—yet his heart may be 
    well. Thus it is well with the righteous. God gives him that <i>inward 
    comfort </i>that revives and sweetens his <i>outward pain.
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. In the time of trouble and calamity—yet still it is 
    well with the righteous because God covers His people in time of trouble.
    </p></b></font>He hides them in the storms. God cares to hide <i>His jewels</i>—and 
    will not let them be carried away; thus He makes good the Scripture, Psalm 
    91:4, 10, 11: "He will shield you with his wings. He will shelter you with 
    his feathers. If you make the Lord your refuge, if you make the Most High 
    your shelter, no evil will conquer you."
<p align="justify">God oftentimes verifies this Scripture literally. He 
    makes His <i>angels </i>to be His people's lifeguard to hide and defend 
    them. When a flood was coming upon the world, God provided an <i>ark </i>to 
    hide Noah. When Israel was carried and transported into Babylon, God hid 
    Jeremiah and gave him his life for a prey, Jeremiah 39:11. In this sense, 
    the saints of God are called hidden ones in Psalm 83:3. Why so? Not only 
    because they are hidden in <i>God's decree </i>and <i>Christ's wounds—</i>but, 
    oftentimes, God hides them in a time of common danger and calamity. They are 
    hidden ones. He reserved to Himself 7,000 who had not bowed the knee to 
    Baal. The prophet knew not where there was one—but God knew where there were 
    7,000. In this sense it is well with the righteous in time of public misery.</p>
<p align="justify">But you will say, "Sometimes it fares worse than all 
    this. Sometimes the righteous die and perish. They are carried away with a 
    tempest. Why?"</p>
<p align="justify">Yet still it is well with the righteous, and that in a 
    twofold sense:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) Many times God does take away the righteous by death 
    and in great mercy—he takes them away that they shall not see the misery 
    that comes upon a nation. </p></b></font>Virgil, the heathen poet, said, "They 
    are happy that die for their country." His meaning was they die before they 
    see the ruin of their country. Truly God many times takes away His people in 
    mercy that they may not see the ruin that is coming on a land. You have a 
    Scripture for this in 1 Kings 14:13: "He only of Jeroboam shall come to the 
    grave in peace because in him there is found some good things towards the 
    Lord God of Israel." God puts him in this grave early in mercy, so that he 
    would not see the evil coming on the land. There's a parallel to this in 2 
    Kings 12:21. It is spoken in Joshua, "I will gather you unto your Fathers, 
    you shall be gathered unto your grave in peace and your eyes shall not see 
    the evil I will bring upon this place." Joshua died in battle; how then was 
    it said he went to the grave in peace? We must understand the meaning of it; 
    Joshua went to his grave in peace because he was a holy man and he made his 
    peace with God. Because he should not see the evil approaching, God gathered 
    him to his grave in peace.
<p align="justify">Jerome, speaking of his friend Nepotian said, "Oh, how 
    happy is my friend Nepotian, that he does not see these troubles, but is got 
    out of the storm and has arrived safely in the haven!"</p>
<p align="justify">Luther died in mercy before the troubles in Germany broke 
    forth. Thus you see that it is well with the righteous, though they die. God 
    takes them away in mercy—that they may not see approaching evils.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) Though the righteous die and are taken away, it is 
    well with them because death cannot hurt them. </p></b></font>Death can neither 
    hurt their <i>bodies </i>nor their <i>souls</i>—and it is well with them.
<p align="justify">Death cannot hurt their <b>bodies</b>. The body of a 
    saint does not perish, though it dies. The bodies of the saints are very 
    precious dust in God's account. The Lord locks up these jewels in the grave 
    as in a cabinet. The bodies of the saints lay mellowing and ripening in the 
    grave until the blessed time of the resurrection. Oh, how precious is the 
    dust of a believer! Though the world minds it not—yet it is precious to God.</p>
<p align="justify">The farmer has some corn in his barn and other corn in 
    the ground. Why? The corn that is in the ground is as precious to him as 
    that in the barn. The bodies of the saints in the grave are God's corn in 
    the ground—but the Lord makes very precious account of this corn. The bodies 
    of the saints shall be more glorious and blessed at the resurrection, than 
    ever they were before. Tertullian calls them <i>angelic bodies </i>with 
    regard to the beauty and luster that shall be upon them. This is as it is 
    with your silks—when they are dyed a purple or scarlet color, they are made 
    more bright and illustrious than they were before. Thus it is with the 
    bodies of the saints—they shall be dyed a better color at the resurrection 
    and shall be made like a glorious body (Philippians 3:20). Thus it shall be 
    well with the righteous; their bodies shall not perish.</p>
<p align="justify">It will be well with the righteous at death as to their
    <b>souls</b>, too. Oh, it will be a blessed time! It is with a saint at the 
    time of death, just as it was with Paul in his voyage to Rome, where we read 
    that the ship broke—but though there were so many broken pieces, he got 
    safely to shore. Though the ship of the believer's body breaks by death, it 
    is safe with the passenger; his soul gets safely to the heavenly harbor. Let 
    me tell you, the day of a believer's <i>death, </i>is the <i>birthday </i>of 
    his blessedness! It is his <i>ascension </i>day to heaven. It is his <i>
    marriage </i>day with Jesus Christ. Faith contracts us here in this life—but 
    at death the nuptials shall be solemnized in glory! They shall see God face 
    to face. "It will be heaven enough to have a sight of God," said Augustine. 
    When the saints enter into joy here on earth, joy enters into them; but when 
    they enter heaven, they shall enter into joy. They shall drink of those pure 
    rivers which run from the everlasting fountain!</p>
<p align="justify">Thus, you see it will be well with the righteous. However 
    things go, though <i>trouble </i>comes, though <i>death </i>comes—it will go 
    well with the righteous. Oh, let those who are the people of God comfort 
    themselves with these words! What an encouragement this is, to begin to be 
    righteous. This text may allure us all to be godly. "Tell the righteous it 
    will be well with them!" When things are never so <i>ill </i>with him—yet it 
    is <i>well </i>with him. When these righteous things go well with us, your 
    pardon is sealed. You are heir of all God's promises; you are Christ's 
    favorite; you have heaven in reversion; and is it not now well with you! If 
    you would have <i>happiness</i>, you must espouse <i>holiness</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">"Tell the righteous it will be well with them!" Thus much 
    for the first proposition, of the godly man's comfort in life and death: it 
    will be well with him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II.</p></b> </font>But now, if all this will not prevail with 
    you to make you leave your sins and become righteous, I must pass on a few 
    words to the next branch of the text to scare men out of their sins, to 
    frighten men out of their wickedness: "Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon 
    them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done!" Isaiah 
    3:10-11.
<p align="justify">This, my beloved, is the <i>dark </i>side of the cloud. 
    It may cause in every wicked man who hears me—a trembling at the heart. "Woe 
    to the wicked! Disaster is upon them!" The proposition resulting out of the 
    words is this: <b>When things seem to be well with the wicked—it shall be 
    ill with them at last. </b>Though they have more than their heart can 
    wish—yet it shall be ill with them at last. Ecclesiastes 8:13: "Because the 
    wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them." It shall not be well 
    with the wicked; the God of truth has pronounced this.</p>
<p align="justify">It is as true as God is true—<i>it shall not be well with 
    the wicked!</i> Now that I may make this a little clearer to you, I shall 
    demonstrate this to you in these four particulars:</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is ill with the wicked in this <i>life</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is ill with them at <i>death</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is ill with them at the day of <i>judgment</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is ill with them in <i>eternity</i>. </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It is ill with the wicked in THIS LIFE. </p></b></font>A 
    wicked man who hears me, will hardly think so when he has the affluence, and 
    confluence of outward comforts—when he eats the fat and drinks the sweet. He 
    will hardly believe the minister who tells him it shall be ill with him; but 
    it is so! For is it not ill with that man who has a <i>curse</i>? Yes, the
    <i>curse of God </i>is entailed upon him—and can that man ever thrive, who 
    lives under the curse of God?
<p align="justify">Floods of God's <i>fury </i>and <i>wrath </i>hang over 
    the head of a wicked man! He is heir to all the plagues written in the Book 
    of God! All God's curses are the sinner's portion, and, if he dies in his 
    sin, he is sure to have his portion paid to him!</p>
<p align="justify">Woe unto the wicked! Every bit of food he has—he has it 
    with a curse! It is like poisoned food given to a dog! Every drop of <i>wine
    </i>he drinks—he swallows a curse with it. Woe unto the wicked! There is a 
    curse in his <i>cup, </i>and upon his <i>table</i>. God has said, "Woe unto 
    him!" </p>
<p align="justify">We read of Belshazzar, in Daniel 5:2-4, that he took the 
    wine and commanded to bring the gold and silver vessels which they took from 
    the Temple of God in Jerusalem. Then they brought the golden vessels that 
    were taken out of the temple—and the king, his princes, his wives, and his 
    concubines drank from them. Belshazzar was jovial in the midst of his cups. 
    He was merry. But woe unto the wicked, for "At that very moment they saw the 
    fingers of a human hand writing on the plaster wall of the king's palace. 
    The king's face turned pale with fear. Such terror gripped him that his 
    knees knocked together and his legs gave way beneath him." There was a <i>
    woe </i>written on the wall. Let a sinner live until he comes to a hundred 
    years of age—yet he is cursed (Isaiah 65:20). His gray hairs have a curse 
    upon them!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is ill with the wicked </p></b></font>not only in this 
    life—but <font color="#0000ff"><b>at the hour of DEATH </b></font>in these 
    two respects: 
<p align="justify">(1) Death puts an end to all his <i>comforts</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(2) Death is the beginning of all his <i>miseries</i>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Death puts an end to all his COMFORTS</p></b></font>—no 
    more indulging and pampering the flesh, no more cups of wine, no more music. 
    Revelation 18:14, 22: "All the fancy things you loved so much are gone! The 
    luxuries and splendor that you prized so much will never be yours again. 
    They are gone forever! Never again will the sound of music be heard there—no 
    more harps, songs, flutes, or trumpets." You may say of the wicked man—no 
    more joy and gladness, no more mirth and music. All a sinner's choice foods, 
    his fancy garments, his sparkling diamonds—all depart from him at death!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. As death puts an end to a sinner's mirth, so death is 
    the beginning of all his MISERIES. </p></b></font>Alas, before death begins to 
    close a sinner's eyes, the eye of his conscience is first opened. Every sin 
    at the hour of death stands with its drawn sword in its hand. Those sins 
    that delighted him in life--now frighten and terrify him! All his joy and 
    mirth--is turn into sadness! All the sugared joys of a wicked man at the 
    hour of death--turn into the water of tears and into the water of sorrow.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. It shall be ill with the wicked man at the day of 
    JUDGEMENT when he is seated before God's tribunal.</p></b></font> He shall leave 
    judging others—and shall stand at God's bar and be tried for his life. I 
    read that when Felix heard Paul speak of judgment he trembled. Josephus 
    observed that Felix was a wicked man, and the woman who lived with him, 
    Drusilla, he enticed from her husband and lived in immorality with her. When 
    Felix <i>heard </i>Paul preaching of judgment, he trembled. If he trembled 
    to <i>hear </i>of judgment, what will he do when judgment comes, when all 
    his secret sins shall be made manifest, and all his midnight wickedness 
    shall be written on his forehead as with the point of a diamond! At the day 
    of judgment shall be two things: first, there shall be a legal trial; 
    second, the sentence.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, a legal TRIAL. </p></b></font>God will call forth the 
    sinner by name and say, "Stand forth, hear your charge, see what you can 
    answer to this charge! What can you say for your all your sins—your 
    drunkenness and lying? For all your revenge and malice? For all the 
    persecuting of My people? What do you say—guilty or not guilty? You wretch, 
    you dare not say you are not guilty, for have I not been an eyewitness to 
    all your wickedness? Do not the <i>books </i>agree, the book of your <i>
    conscience</i>—and the book of My <i>omniscience</i>, and dare you offer to 
    plead not guilty?" How will the sinner be amazed with horror and run in 
    desperation!
<p align="justify">Second, after this legal process or trial follows<font color="#008000"><b> 
    the SENTENCE</b></font>: "Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the 
    eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels!" Go from the presence of 
    Christ—in whose presence is fullness of joy! Go from Christ with a curse! 
    Why, said Chrysostom, that very word "depart" is worse than the torment 
    itself. Remember this, you who go on in your sins, once this sentence is 
    passed—it can never be reversed. This is the most supreme court—from which 
    there is no appeal. Here on earth men remove their causes from one court to 
    another. But, at the last day of judgment, there will be no appeals and no 
    removing the sentence, for this is the highest court.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. It will be ill with the wicked who die in their 
    sins—in ETERNITY.</p></b></font> Then there is but one way for them, and they 
    would be glad if they might not go that way—any way but to prison. "Oh—but 
    there is no way but to hell." Luke 16:24: "I am in agony in this fire!" Hell 
    is the very center of misery; it is the very spirit of agony distilled out. 
    The Scripture tells us that in hell there are these three things: darkness, 
    fire, and chains.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) Hell is called a place of DARKNESS.</p></b></font> Jude 
    13: "For whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever!" Darkness, you 
    know, is the most uncomfortable thing in the world. A man who goes in the 
    dark trembles every step. Hell is a black region, nothing but blackness of 
    darkness. It must be a dark place where they shall be separated from the 
    light of God's presence. Indeed, Augustine thinks there shall be some little 
    sulphurous light there; but even if it is so, that light will serve only 
    that the damned may see the tragedy of their own misery and see themselves 
    tormented!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) In hell, as there is darkness so there is FIRE. </p></b>
</font>It is called a burning lake in Revelation 20:15: "Anyone whose name 
    was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of 
    fire!" You know that fire is the most torturing element and makes the most 
    dreadful impression on the flesh. Hell is a place of fire.
<p align="justify">It is disputed among the learned what kind of fire it 
    is—I wish we may never know! Augustine and others affirm that it is material 
    fire—but far hotter than any earthly fires—which are but <i>painted fires
    </i>in comparison with hell fire! I rather think that the fire of the damned 
    is partly material and partly spiritual (which is the wrath of God to 
    torment the soul); that is the lake, the burning fire. Who knows the power 
    of God's anger! Who can dwell with these everlasting burnings! It is 
    intolerable to <i>endure </i>them—and impossible to <i>escape </i>them!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) In hell there are CHAINS of darkness.</p></b></font> 2 
    Peter 2:4. Sinners who will not be bound by any law of God—shall have chains 
    of darkness to bind them!
<p align="justify">QUESTION: What should be the meaning of that phrase, 
    "chains of darkness"?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER: These chains suggest unto us, that the wicked in 
    hell shall not have power to walk up and down, which perhaps might be a 
    little easier, though very little. But they shall be chained down fast so as 
    not to stir. They shall be fastened to that stake with chains of darkness! 
    Oh, this will be terrible indeed! Suppose a man should lie always chained on 
    a <i>down bed—</i>and might not stir out of his place—it would be very 
    painful unto him. But the damned will lie eternally chained upon the rack, 
    always under the torturing scorching of God's wrath! How dreadful are the 
    thoughts of this condition of the wicked! They are under <i>fire</i>, <i>
    darkness </i>and <i>chains!</i></p>

<p align="justify">To add to the torment of hell, there are two more things 
    which show that it shall be torment with the wicked--the <i>worm </i>and the
    <i>serpent!</i></p>

<p align="justify">First, there is the WORM to torture the damned 
    spirits--the worm of a tormenting conscience! "Where the worm never dies!" 
    Mark 9:44. Oh, how dreadful it will be, to have this tormenting worm! The 
    tormenting conscience a hellish fury. Conscience will be just as if a worm 
    full of poison were feeding on the heart of a man! Those sinners who would 
    never hear the voice of conscience--shall feel the worm of conscience!</p>
<p align="justify">Second, as there is the worm to torment, so there is the 
    devil, who is called "the old SERPENT." In hell, as there is the <i>biting
    </i>of this worm—so there is the <i>stinging </i>of this old serpent!</p>
<p align="justify">The damned shall be forced to <i>behold </i>the devil. I 
    remember what Anselm said: "I would rather endure all the torments of this 
    life than to see the devil with bodily eyes." But the wicked <i>shall </i>
    see the devil--whether they want to or not; and not only <i>see</i>—but <i>
    feel </i>the stinging of this old serpent, the devil.</p>
<p align="justify">Satan is full of rage against mankind, and will show no 
    mercy. As he puts forth all his subtlety in <i>tempting </i>man, so he puts 
    out all his cruelty in <i>tormenting </i>man. </p>
<p align="justify">This is not all! There are two more things in the 
    torments of hell.</p>
<p align="justify">These agonies and hell-convulsions shall be FOREVER. Take 
    Scripture for proof, Revelation 14:11: "And the smoke of their torment 
    ascends forever and ever and they have not relief day nor night." Thus it is 
    in hell. They desire to die—but they cannot. The wicked shall be always 
    dying—but never dead. The smoke of the furnace ascends forever and ever. Oh, 
    who can endure thus to be ever upon this rack! This word "forever" breaks 
    the heart! Wicked men now think a sermon and a prayer long—but oh, how long 
    will it be, to lie in hell forever and ever! After millions of years, their 
    torments are as far from ending—as at the first hour they began!</p>
<p align="justify">Another aggravation of hell torment, is that the damned 
    in hell have none to pity them. It is some comfort, some ease to have our 
    friends to pity us in our sickness and need—but those in hell have no 
    friends.</p>
<p align="justify">God's mercy will not pity them. His mercy is turned into 
    fury! Christ will not pity them; He is no longer an advocate for them. The 
    holy angels will not pity them—but will rejoice when they see the vengeance. 
    They exult and glory when they see the justice of God executed upon His 
    enemies. "After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude 
    in heaven shouting, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our 
    God, for true and just are His judgments. He has condemned the great 
    prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries." And again they 
    shouted: "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever!" 
    Revelation 19:1-3 </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, how sad is this—to lie in the scalding furnace of 
    God's wrath—and none to pity them! When they cry out, God will laugh at 
    them. Hear this, all you who go on in sin! Turn from your sins--lest God 
    tears you in pieces as a lion, and there are none to help you.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">APPLICATION</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1. </p></b></font>What a frightening word is this—to all 
    wicked men who go on desperately to sin. There has never been such an 
    inundation of wickedness as now. Men sin as if they would spite God, and 
    dare Him to damn them! Men sin so greedily—as if they were afraid hell's 
    gates would be shut up before they got there! Oh, how brazenly do many sin! 
    They go to hell shamelessly in their wickedness! These are in a sad 
    condition. It is sad at the hour of death—and at the day of judgment. Wicked 
    men live cursed and die damned. Sinners are the very mark which God will 
    shoot at—and He never misses this mark! You know what the Scripture says, 
    "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth!" One says, "That is sad 
    fare—where weeping is the first course, and gnashing of teeth is the second 
    course."
<p align="justify">QUESTION. Whence is it that there is this gnashing of 
    teeth?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. First, it arises from the <i>extremity </i>of 
    torment the wicked suffer. They are not able to <i>bear </i>it—and know not 
    how to <i>avoid </i>it.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, the wicked gnash their teeth in hell at the godly 
    to see them in heaven, those whom they persecuted, scoffed, and jeered 
    at—and themselves in hell forever. Luke 13:28: "When they shall see Abraham, 
    Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and they 
    themselves shut out," they shall gnash their teeth at this. How may this 
    astonish a wicked man! If all the curses in the Bible will make a man 
    miserable—he shall be made so!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2. </p></b></font>Take heed that none of you here are 
    found among the number of the wicked. Take heed of being of this <i>black 
    regiment</i>, which wears the devil's colors and fights under his banner. 
    The sinner and the fiery furnace shall never be parted. Take heed of those 
    sins which will bring you to hellfire.
<p align="justify">When you are tempted to any wickedness, think to 
    yourself, "How can I bear the fierceness of God's wrath forever! How can I 
    lie in the winepress of God's wrath forever!" Take heed of those sins which 
    will bring you into this place of torment!</p>
<p align="justify">I have read a story of a young woman who, being tempted 
    by a young man to commit sin, said unto him, "Grant me but one request—and I 
    will do what you ask."</p>
<p align="justify">"What is that?" he said.</p>
<p align="justify">"Only hold your finger for one hour, in the flame of this 
    burning candle."</p>
<p align="justify">"No, I will not do that!"</p>
<p align="justify">She replied, "Will you not for my sake, hold your finger 
    for one hour in the candle—and will you have my soul lie burning in hell 
    forever?" Thus, she rebuked the temptation.</p>
<p align="justify">Does Satan tempt you to wickedness? Say this, "Oh, Satan, 
    if I embrace your temptations, I must lie under your tormenting cruelty for 
    all eternity!" This will be a shield, to quench fiery darts of the devil.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, labor to be righteous. It shall be <i>well </i>
    with the righteous. But take heed of sin. It shall be <i>ill </i>with the 
    sinner.</p>
<p align="justify">I will conclude with a saying of Augustine: "When a man 
    has been godly—the labor is gone but the pleasure remains! When a man has 
    been wicked—the pleasure is gone but the sting remains!"</p>
