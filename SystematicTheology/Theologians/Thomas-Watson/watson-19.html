<p align="center"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>A godly man does not 
    indulge in any sin</b></font></p>
<p align="center">(from Thomas Watson's "The Godly Man's Picture")<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">Though sin lives in him—yet he does not live in sin. A 
    godly man may <i>step </i>into sin through infirmity—but he does not <i>keep
    </i>on that road. He prays, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me 
    and know my thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me 
    along the path of everlasting life." (Psalm 139:24).</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Question:</p></i><b> <font color="#0000FF">What is it to 
    indulge sin?</font>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Answer</p></i> 1: To give the breast to it and feed it. As a 
    fond parent humors his child and lets him have what he wants, so to indulge 
    sin is to humor sin.
<i>
<p align="justify">Answer</p></i> 2: To indulge sin is to commit it with 
    delight. The ungodly "delight in wickedness" (2 Thess. 2:12).
<p align="justify">In this sense, a godly man does not indulge sin. Though 
    sin is in him, he is troubled at it and would gladly get rid of it. There is 
    as much difference between sin in the wicked and sin in the godly—as between 
    poison being in a serpent and poison being in a man. Poison in a serpent is 
    in its natural place and is delightful—but poison in a man's body is harmful 
    and he uses antidotes to expel it. So sin in a wicked man is delightful, 
    being in its natural place—but sin in a child of God is burdensome and he 
    uses all means to expel it. The sin is trimmed off. The will is against it. 
    A godly man enters his protest against sin: "Oh, what a miserable person I 
    am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin?" (Romans 
    7:24). A child of God, while he commits sin, hates the sin he commits 
    (Romans 7). </p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>
<p align="justify">In particular there are four kinds of sin, which a godly 
    man will not allow himself:</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. SECRET sins.</p></b></font> Some are more modest than to 
    commit open gross sin. That would be a stain on their reputation. But they 
    will sit brooding upon sin in a corner: "Saul secretly practiced mischief" 
    (1 Sam. 23:9). All will not sin on a balcony—but perhaps they will sin 
    behind the curtain. Rachel did not carry her father's images like a saddle 
    cloth to be exposed to public view—but she put them under her and sat on 
    them (Gen. 31:34). Many carry their sins secretly.
<p align="justify">But a godly man dare not sin secretly:</p>
<p align="justify">(1) He knows that God sees in secret, "for he knows the 
    secrets of every heart." (Psalm 44:21). As God cannot be deceived by our 
    subtlety, so he cannot be excluded by our secrecy.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) A godly man knows that secret sins are in some sense 
    worse than others. They reveal more guile and atheism. The curtain-sinner 
    makes himself believe that God does not see: "Son of man, have you seen what 
    the leaders of Israel are doing with their idols in <i>dark </i>rooms? They 
    are saying—The Lord doesn't see us!" (Ezek. 8:12). Those who have bad eyes 
    think that the sun is dim. How it provokes God, that men's atheism should 
    give the lie to his omniscience! "He who formed the eye, shall he not see?" 
    (Psalm 94:9).</p>
<p align="justify">(3) A godly man knows that secret sins shall not escape 
    God's justice. A judge on the bench can punish no offence but what is proved 
    by witnesses. He cannot punish the treason of the heart—but the sins of the 
    heart are as visible to God as if they were written upon the forehead. As 
    God will reward secret duties, so he will revenge secret sins.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. GAINFUL sins.</p></b></font> Gain is the golden bait, with 
    which Satan fishes for souls! "The sweet smell of money." This was the last 
    temptation he used with Christ: "All these things will I give you" (Matt. 
    4:9). But Christ saw the hook under the bait. Many who have escaped gross 
    sins, are still caught in a <i>golden net. </i>To gain the world, they will 
    use indirect routes.
<p align="justify">A godly man dare not travel for riches along the devil's 
    highway. Those are sad gains, which make a man lose peace of conscience and 
    heaven at last. He who gets an estate by injustice stuffs his pillow with 
    thorns, and his head will lie very uneasy when he comes to die. "What good 
    will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?" 
    Matthew 16:26.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A beloved BESETTING sin.</p></b></font> "Let us throw off 
    everything that hinders and <i>the sin that so easily entangles</i>, and let 
    us run with perseverance the race marked out for us." Hebrews 12:1. There is 
    usually one sin that is the favorite—the sin which the heart is most fond 
    of. A beloved sin lies in a man's bosom as the disciple whom Jesus loved, 
    leaned on his bosom (John 13:23). A godly man will not indulge a darling 
    sin: "I kept myself from <i>my </i>iniquity" (Psalm 18:23). "I will not 
    indulge the sin of my constitution, to which the bias of my heart more 
    naturally inclines." "Fight neither with small nor great—but only with the 
    king" (1 Kings 22:31). A godly man fights this king sin. The oracle of 
    Apollo answered the people of Cyrrha that if they would live in peace among 
    themselves, they must make continual war with those strangers who were on 
    their borders. If we would have peace in our souls, we must maintain a war 
    against our favorite sin and never leave off until it is subdued.
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify"><br/>
</p></font>Question: How shall we know what our beloved sin is?
<p align="justify">Answer 1:</p></b> The sin which a man does not love to have 
    reproved is the <i>darling </i>sin. Herod could not endure having his incest 
    spoken against. If the prophet meddles with that sin—it shall cost him his 
    head! "Do not touch my Herodias!" Men can be content to have other sins 
    reproved—but if the minister puts his finger on the sore, and touches this 
    sin—their hearts begin to burn in malice against him!
<b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2: </p></b>The sin on which the thoughts run most, is 
    the darling sin. Whichever way the <i>thoughts </i>go, the <i>heart </i>
    goes. He who is in love with a person cannot keep his thoughts off that 
    person. Examine what sin runs most in your mind, what sin is first in your 
    thoughts and greets you in the morning—that is your <i>predominant </i>sin.
<b>
<p align="justify">Answer 3: </p></b>The sin which has most power over us, and 
    most easily leads us captive, is the one beloved by the soul. There are some 
    sins which a man can better resist. If they come for entertainment, he can 
    more easily put them off. But the bosom sin comes as a suitor, and he cannot 
    deny it—but is overcome by it. The young man in the Gospel had repulsed many 
    sins—but there was one sin which soiled him, and that was covetousness. 
    Christians, mark what sin you are most readily led captive by—that is <i>the 
    harlot in your bosom! </i>It is a sad thing that a man should be so 
    bewitched by lust, that if it asks him to part with not only half the 
    kingdom (Esther 7:2) but the whole kingdom of heaven, he must part with it, 
    to gratify that lust!
<b>
<p align="justify">Answer 4: </p></b>The sin which men use arguments to defend, 
    is the beloved sin. He who has<i> a jewel in his bosom, </i>will defend it 
    to his death. So when there is any sin in the bosom, men will defend it. The 
    sin we advocate and dispute for, is the besetting sin. If the sin is anger, 
    we plead for it: "I do well to be angry" (Jonah 4:9). If the sin is <i>
    covetousness </i>and we vindicate it and perhaps wrest Scripture to justify 
    it—that is the sin which lies nearest the heart.
<b>
<p align="justify">Answer 5:</p></b> The sin which most troubles us, and flies 
    most in the face in an hour of sickness and distress, that is the <i>Delilah 
    sin! </i>When Joseph's brethren were distressed, their sin in selling their 
    brother came to remembrance: "We are truly guilty concerning our brother . . 
    . therefore is this distress come upon us" (Gen. 42:21). So, when a man is 
    on a sickbed and conscience says, "You have been guilty of such a sin; you 
    went on in it, and rolled it like honey under your tongue!" Conscience is 
    reading him a sad lecture. That was the beloved sin for sure.
<b>
<p align="justify">Answer 6: </p></b>The sin which a man finds most difficulty 
    in giving up, is the endeared sin. Of all his sons, Jacob found most 
    difficulty in parting with Benjamin. So the sinner says, "This and that sin 
    I have parted with—but must Benjamin go, must I part with this delightful 
    sin? That pierces my heart!" As with a castle that has several forts about 
    it, the first and second fort are taken—but when it comes to the <i>castle</i>, 
    the governor will rather fight and die than yield that. So a man may allow 
    some of his sins to be demolished—but when it comes to one sin, that is the 
    taking of the castle; he will never agree to part with that! That is the 
    master sin for sure.
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">The besetting sin is a God-provoking sin. The wise men of 
    Troy counseled Priam to send Helena back to the Greeks, not permitting 
    himself to be abused any longer by the charms of her beauty, because keeping 
    her within the city would lay the foundation of a fatal war. So we should 
    put away our Delilah sin, lest it incense the God of heaven, and make him 
    commence a war against us.</p>
<p align="justify">The besetting sin is, of all others, most dangerous. As 
    Samson's strength lay in his hair, so the strength of sin, lies in this 
    beloved sin. This is like a poison striking the heart, which brings death. A 
    godly man will lay the <i>axe of repentance </i>to this sin and hew it down! 
    He sets this sin, like Uriah, in the forefront of the battle, so that it may 
    be slain. He will sacrifice this Isaac, he will pluck out this right eye, so 
    that he may see better to go to heaven.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Those sins which the world counts LESSER.</p></b></font> 
    There is no such thing as little sin—yet some may be deemed less 
    comparatively. But a godly man will not indulge himself in these. Such as:
<p align="justify">(1) Sins of omission. Some think it no great matter to 
    omit family, or private prayer. They can go for several months and God never 
    hears from them. A godly man will as soon live without food, as without 
    prayer. He knows that every creature of God is sanctified by prayer (1 Tim. 
    4:5). The bird may shame many Christians; it never takes a drop—but the eye 
    is lifted up towards heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) A godly man dares not allow himself vain, frothy 
    discourse, much less that which looks like an oath. If God will judge for 
    idle <i>words</i>, will he not much more for idle <i>oaths</i>?</p>
<p align="justify">(3) A godly man dare not allow himself rash censuring. 
    Some think this a small matter. They will not <i>swear</i>—but they will <i>
    slander</i>. This is very evil. This is wounding a man in that which is 
    dearest to him. He who is godly turns all his censures upon <i>himself!</i> 
    He judges himself for his own sins—but is very watchful and concerned, about 
    the good name of another.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use: </p></b></font>As you would be numbered among the 
    genealogies of the saints—do not indulge yourselves in any sin. <b>Consider 
    the mischief which<i> one sin lived in, </i>will do:
</b>
<p align="justify">1. <i>One sin lived in, gives Satan as much advantage 
    against you as more sins</i>. The fowler can hold a bird by one wing. Satan 
    held Judas fast by one sin.</p>
<p align="justify">2. <i>One sin lived in, proves that the heart is not 
    sound</i>. He who hides one rebel in his house is a traitor to the crown. 
    The person who indulges one sin is a traitorous hypocrite.</p>
<p align="justify">3. <i>One sin lived in, will make way for more</i>, as a 
    little thief can open the door to more. Sins are linked and chained 
    together. One sin will draw on more. David's adultery made way for murder. 
    One sin never goes alone! If there is only one <i>nest egg</i>—the devil can 
    brood on it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. <i>One sin lived in, is as much a breach of God's law 
    as more sins.</i> "Whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is 
    guilty of breaking it all" (Jas. 2:10). The king may make a law against 
    felony, treason and murder. If a man is guilty of only one of these, he is a 
    transgressor.</p>
<p align="justify">5. <i>One sin lived in, prevents Christ from entering</i>. 
    One stone in the pipe keeps out the water. One sin indulged in, obstructs 
    the soul and keeps the streams of Christ's blood from running into it.</p>
<p align="justify">6. <i>One sin lived in, will spoil all your good duties</i>. 
    A drop of poison will spoil a glass of wine. Abimelech, a bastard-son, 
    destroyed seventy of his brethren (Judges 9:5). One bastard-sin will destroy 
    seventy prayers. One dead fly will spoil the whole box of precious ointment.</p>
<p align="justify">7. <i>One sin lived in will be a cankerworm to eat out 
    the peace of conscience</i>. It takes away the <i>manna </i>from the ark, 
    and leaves only a <i>rod</i>. "Alas! What a scorpion lies within!" (Seneca). 
    One sin is a <i>pirate—</i>to rob a Christian of his comfort. One jarring 
    string puts all the music out of tune. One sin lived in—will spoil the music 
    of conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">8. <i>One sin lived in, will damn as well as more sins.</i> 
    One <i>disease </i>is enough to kill. If a <i>fence </i>is made ever so 
    strong, and only one gap is left open; the wild beast may enter and tread 
    down the corn. If only one sin is allowed in the soul, you leave open a gap 
    for the devil to enter! A <i>soldier </i>may have only one gap in his 
    armor--and the bullet may enter there. He may as well be shot there--as if 
    he had no armor on at all. So if you favor only one sin, you leave a part of 
    your soul unprotected--and the bullet of God's wrath may enter there—and 
    shoot you! One sin lived in, may shut you out of heaven! What difference is 
    there, between being shut out of heaven for one sin--or for many sins? One 
    millstone will sink a man into the sea--as well as a hundred!</p>
<p align="justify">9. <i>One sin harbored in the soul will unfit us for 
    suffering</i>. How soon an hour of trial may come. A man who has hurt his 
    shoulder cannot carry a heavy burden, and a man who has any guilt in his 
    conscience cannot carry the cross of Christ. Will he who cannot deny his <i>
    lust </i>for Christ—deny his <i>life </i>for Christ? <i>One unmortified sin 
    in the soul</i>—will bring forth the bitter fruit of apostasy.</p>
<p align="justify">If, then, you would show yourselves godly, give a 
    certificate of divorce to every sin. Kill the Goliath sin! "Let not sin 
    reign" (Romans 6:12). In the original it is "Let not sin <i>king </i>it over 
    you." Grace and sin may be together—but grace and <i>the love of sin cannot</i>. 
    Therefore parley with sin no longer—but with the <i>spear of mortification</i>, 
    spill the heart-blood of every sin! "For if you live after the flesh, you 
    shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, 
    you shall live." Romans 8:13. "So put to death the sinful, earthly things 
    lurking within you." Colossians 3:5.</p>
