        <p>Thou shalt not steal.' Exod 20: 15.</p>
        <p>
          AS the holiness of God sets him against uncleanness, in the command
          Thou shalt not commit adultery;' so the justice of God sets him
          against rapine and robbery, in the command, Thou shalt not steal.' The
          thing forbidden in this commandment, is meddling with another man's
          property. The civil lawyers define furtum, stealth or theft to be the
          laying hands unjustly on that which is another's;' the invading
          another's right.
        </p>
        <p>I. The causes of theft.</p>
        <p>
          The internal causes are, (1) Unbelief. A man has a high distrust of
          God's providence. Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?' Psa 78:
          19. Can God spread a table for me? says the unbeliever. No, he cannot.
          Therefore he is resolved he will spread a table for himself, but it
          shall be at other men's cost, and both first and second course shall
          be served in with stolen goods. (2) Covetousness. The Greek word for
          covetousness signifies an immoderate desire of getting;' which is the
          root of theft. A man covets more than his own, and this itch of
          covetousness makes him scratch what he can from another. Achan's
          covetous humour made him steal the wedge of gold, a wedge which
          cleaved asunder his soul from God. Joshua 7: 21.
        </p>
        <p>
          The external cause of theft is Satan's solicitation. Judas was a
          thief. John 12: 6. How came he to be a thief? Satan entered into him'.
          John 13: 27. The devil is the great master-thief, he robbed us of our
          coat of innocence, and he persuades men to take up his trade; he tells
          men how bravely they shall live by thieving, and how they may catch an
          estate. As Eve listened to the serpent's voice, so do they. As birds
          of prey, they live upon spoil and plunder.
        </p>
        <p>II. The kinds of theft.</p>
        <p>
          There is stealing from God. They are thieves who rob God of any part
          of his day. Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day.' Not a part of the
          day only, but the whole day must be dedicated to God. And, lest any
          should forget this, the Lord has prefixed a memento, remember.'
          Therefore, after morning sacrifice, to spend the other part of the
          Sabbath in vanity and pleasure, is spiritual theft. It robs God of his
          due, and the very heathen will rise up in judgement against such
          Christians; for the heathen, as Macrobius notes, observed a whole day
          to their false gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is stealing from others. A stealing away souls, as heretics, by
          robbing men of the truth, rob them of their souls. Stealing money and
          goods. There is
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The highway thief, who takes a purse, contrary to the letter of
          the commandment. Thou shalt not rob thy neighbour.' Lev 19: 13. Do not
          steal.' Mark 10: 19. This is not the violence which takes the kingdom
          of heaven by force.' Matt 11: 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The house-thief, who purloins and filches out of his master's
          cash, or steals his wares and drugs. The apostle says, Some have
          entertained angels unawares' (Heb 13: 2), but many masters have
          entertained thieves in their houses unawares. The house-thief is a
          hypocrite as well as a thief; for he has demure looks, and pretends to
          be helping his master, when he only helps himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The thief that shrouds himself under law, as the unjust attorney
          or lawyer, who prevaricates and deals falsely with his client. This is
          to steal from the client. By deceit and prevarication, the lawyer robs
          the client of his land, and may be the means of ruining his family,
          and is no better than a thief in God's account.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The church-thief or pluralist, who holds several benefices, but
          seldom or never preaches to the people. He gets the golden fleece, but
          lets the flock starve. Woe be to the shepherds of Israel.' Ezek 34: 2.
          They fed themselves, and fed not my flock;' ver.8. These ministers
          will be indicted for thieves at God's bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) The shop-thief, who steals in selling. He who uses false weights
          and measures steals from others what is their due. Making the ephah
          small.' Amos 8: 5. The ephah was a measure the Jews used in selling.
          Some made the ephah small, and gave scant measure, which was plainly
          stealing. The balances of deceit are in his hand.' Hos 12: 7. By
          making their weights lighter, men make their accounts heavier. He
          steals in selling who puts excessive prices on his commodities. He
          takes thrice as much for an article as it cost him, or as it is worth.
          To overreach others in selling, is to steal money from them. Thou
          shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him.' Lev 19: 13. To
          defraud him is to rob him; to overreach others in selling is a cunning
          way of stealing, and is against both law and gospel. It is against the
          law of God. If thou sell ought to thy neighbour, ye shall not oppress
          one another.' Lev 25: 14. It is against the gospel. That no man go
          beyond, and defraud his brother.' 1 Thess 4: 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) The usurer, who takes by extortion from others. He seems to help
          another by letting him have money in his necessity, but gets him into
          bonds, and sucks out his very blood and marrow. I read of a woman whom
          Satan had bound (Luke 13: 16), and truly he is almost in as bad a
          condition whom the usurer has bound. The usurer is a robber. A usurer
          once asked a prodigal when he would leave off spending? The prodigal
          replied, I will leave off spending what is my own, when thou leanest
          off stealing from others.' Zacchaeus was an extortioner who, after his
          conversion, made restitution. Luke 19: 8. He thought all he got by
          extortion was theft.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) The trustee, who has the orphan's estate committed to him, is
          deputed to be his guardian, and manages his estate for him; if he
          curtails the estate, and gets a fleece out of it for himself, and
          wrongs the orphan, he is a thief. This is worse than taking a purse by
          violence, because he betrays his trust, which is the highest piece of
          treachery and injustice.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) The borrower, who borrows money from others, with an intention
          never to pay them again. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again.'
          Psa 37: 21. What is it but thievery to take money and goods from
          others, and not restore them again. The prophet Elisha bade the widow
          sell her oil, and pay her debts, and then live upon the rest.2 Kings
          4: 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          (9) The last sort of theft is, the receiver of stolen goods. The
          receiver, if he be not the principal, yet is accessory to the theft,
          and the law makes him guilty. The thief steals the money, and the
          receiver holds the sack to put it in. The root would die if it were
          not watered, and thieving would cease if it were not encouraged by the
          receiver. I am apt to think that he who does not scruple to take
          stolen goods into his house, would as little scruple to have stolen
          them.
        </p>
        <p>What are the aggravations of this sin?</p>
        <p>(1) To steal when there is no need; to be a rich thief.</p>
        <p>
          (2) To steal sacrilegiously; to devour things set apart to holy uses.
          It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy.' Prov 20:
          25. Such an one was Dionysius, who robbed the temple, and took away
          the silver vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) To commit the sin of theft against checks of conscience, and
          examples of God's justice; which, like the dye to the wool, dyes the
          sin of a crimson colour.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) To rob the widow and orphan. Ye shall not afflict the widow or
          fatherless.' Peccatum clamans [This sin shrieks aloud]. If they cry
          unto me, I will surely hear them.' Exod 22: 23.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) To rob the poor. How angry was David that the rich man should take
          away the poor man's lamb! As the Lord lives, he shall surely die.' 2
          Sam 12: 5. What is inclosing of commons but robbing the poor!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a stealing from a man's self. A man may be a thief to
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>How so?</p>
        <p>
          (1) By niggardliness. The niggard is a thief; he steals from himself
          in not allowing himself what is needful. He thinks that lost which is
          bestowed upon himself; he robs himself of necessaries. A man to whom
          God has given riches, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof'
          Eccl 6: 2. He gluts his chest and starves his belly; he is like the
          ass that is loaded with gold, but feeds upon thistles; he robs himself
          of what God allows him. This is to be punished with riches; to have an
          estate and want a heart to take the comfort of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) A man may rob himself by foolishly wasting his estate. The
          prodigal lavishes gold out of the bag; he is like Crates, the
          philosopher, who threw his gold into the sea. The prodigal boils a
          great estate to nothing. He is a thief to himself who spends away that
          estate which might conduce to the comfort of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) He is a thief to himself, by idleness, when he misspends his time.
          He who spends his hours in pleasure and vanity robs himself of that
          precious time which God has given him to work out salvation in. Time
          is a rich commodity, because on well spending present time a happy
          eternity depends. He that spends his time idly and vainly, is a thief
          to himself; he robs himself of golden seasons, and by consequence, of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) A man may be a thief to himself by suretiship. Be not thou one of
          them that are sureties for debts.' Prov 22: 26. The creditor comes
          upon the surety for debt, and so, by paying another's debt, he is a
          thief to himself. Let not any man say he would have been counted
          unkind if he had not entered into a bond for his friend. Better thy
          friend should count thee unkind than all men count thee unwise. Lend
          another what you can spare; nay, give him if he needs, but never be a
          surety. It is no wisdom for a man so to help another as to undo
          himself. It is to rob himself and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. For confutation of the doctrine of community, that all things
          are common, and one man has a right to another's estate. This is
          confuted by Scripture. When thou comest into the standing corn of thy
          neighbour, thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's corn.'
          Deut 23: 25. Property must be respected; God has set this eighth
          commandment as a hedge about a man's estate, and this hedge cannot be
          broken without sin. If all things be common, there can be no theft,
          and so this commandment would be in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. For reproof of such as live by stealing. Instead of living by
          faith, they live by their shifts. The apostle exhorts that every man
          eat his own bread.' 2 Thess 3: 12. The thief does not eat his own
          bread, but another's. If there be any who are guilty of this sin, let
          them labour to recover out of the snare of the devil, by repentance,
          and let them show their repentance by restitution. Non remittitur
          peccatum nisi restituatur ablatum. Augustine. Without restitution, no
          remission.' If I have taken away any thing from any man by false
          accusation, I restore him fourfold.' Luke 19: 8. Ill-gotten things may
          be restored by one's own hand, or by proxy. Better a thousand times
          restore goods unlawfully gotten, than stuff your pillow with thorns,
          and have guilt trouble your conscience upon a death-bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. For exhortation to all to take heed of the sin of thieving;
          which is against the light of nature. Some may endeavour to excuse
          this sin. It is a coarse wool that will take no dye, and a bad sin
          that has no excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am (says one) grown low in the world, and trading is bad, and I have
          no other way to a livelihood.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) This shows great distrust in God, as if he could not provide for
          thee without thy sin. (2) It shows sin to be at a great height, that,
          because a man is grown low in the world, therefore he will Acheronta
          movere [knock at Hell's door], go to the devil for a livelihood.
          Abraham would not have it said, that the king of Sodom had made him
          rich.' Gen 14: 22. O let it never be said, that the devil has made
          thee rich! (3) Thou oughtest not to undertake any action upon which
          thou canst not pray for a blessing; but thou canst not pray for a
          blessing upon stolen goods. Therefore take heed of this sin; lucrum in
          arca, damnum in conscientia [you gain materially, but your conscience
          suffers loss]. Augustine. Take heed of getting the world with the loss
          of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use four. To dissuade all from this horrid sin, consider -- (1)
          Thieves are the caterpillars of the earth, enemies to civil society.
          (2) God hates them. In the law, the cormorant was unclean, because a
          thievish, devouring creature, a bird of prey; by which God showed his
          hatred of this sin. Lev 11: 17. (3) The thief is a terror to himself,
          he is always in fear. There were they in great fear,' is true of the
          thief. Psa 53: 5. Guilt breeds fear: if he hears but the shaking of a
          tree, his heart shakes. It is said of Catiline, he was afraid of every
          noise. If a briar does but take hold of a thief's garment, he is
          afraid it is the officer to apprehend him; and fear has torment in
          it.1 John 4: 18. (4) The judgements that follow this sin. Achan the
          thief was stoned to death. Josh 7: 25. What sees thou? And I answered,
          A flying roll. . . . This is the curse that goes forth over the face
          of the whole earth; I will bring it forth, saith the Lord, and it
          shall enter into the house of the thief' Zech 5: 2, 3, 4. Fabius, a
          Roman censor, condemned his own son to die for theft. Thieves die with
          ignominy, the ladder is their preferment: and there is a worse thing
          than death; for while they rob others of money, they rob themselves of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>What is to be done to avoid stealing?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Live in a calling. Let him that stole steal no more, but rather
          let him labour, working with his hands.' Eph 4: 28, &amp;c. The devil
          hires such as stand idle, and puts them to the pilfering trade. An
          idle person tempts the devil to tempt him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Be content with the estate that God has given you. Be content with
          such things as ye have.' Heb 13: 5. Theft is the daughter of avarice.
          Study contentment. Believe that condition best which God has carved
          out to you. He can bless the little meal in the barrel. We shall not
          need these things long: we shall carry nothing out of the world with
          us but our winding sheet. If we have but enough to bear out our
          charges to heaven, it is sufficient.<br />
