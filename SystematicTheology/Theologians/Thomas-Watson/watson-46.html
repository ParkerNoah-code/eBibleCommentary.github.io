 </p>
<p align="justify">"Unto the upright there arises <b>light in darkness</b>." 
    Psalm 112:4</p>
<p align="justify">Chrysostom calls the Scriptures <i>a spiritual paradise</i>. 
    The Book of Psalms is placed in the midst of this paradise. David's Psalms 
    are not only for <i>delight, </i>but for <i>benefit</i>. They are like those 
    trees of the sanctuary in Ezekiel, which were both for <i>food </i>and for
    <i>medicine</i>. The Psalms are commensurate and exactly fitted to every 
    Christian's condition. If his affections are frozen—here he may fetch fire; 
    if he is weak in grace—here he may fetch armor; if he is ready to faint—here 
    he may fetch cordials.</p>
<p align="justify">Among other divine consolations, this text is none of the 
    least, "Unto the upright there arises light in darkness." These words are 
    calculated for the comfort of God's Church in all ages. This text is like 
    Israel's pillar of fire, which gave light in the wilderness. Or it is like 
    the mariner's lantern, to give light in a dark night.</p>
<p align="justify">"To the upright there arises light in darkness." Give me 
    permission to explain the words, then I shall come to the proposition.</p>
<p align="justify">"To the upright." Who are meant here, by <b>the upright</b>? 
    The Hebrew word for <i>upright, </i>signifies <i>plainness of heart</i>. The 
    upright man is without deception or fraud. He is one in whose spirit there 
    is no deceit, Psalm 32:2. He who is upright, his heart and his tongue go 
    together, as a well-made dial goes exactly by the sun. The words following 
    here in the text, may serve for a short paraphrase to show us who this 
    upright man is. He is gracious, full of compassion, and righteous.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The upright man is gracious—that implies his holiness.<br/>
    2. The upright man is full of compassion—that implies his charitableness.<br/>
    3. The upright man is righteous—that implies his justness.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The upright man is gracious—therefore he fears God.
    <br/>
    2. The upright man is full of compassion—therefore he feeds the poor. <br/>
    3. The upright man is righteous—therefore he does to others as he would have 
    them do to him. </p>
<p align="justify">1. The upright man is one who acts from a right 
    principle—and that is faith. <br/>
    2. The upright man is one who acts by a right rule—and that's the Word of 
    God.<br/>
    3. The upright man is one who acts to a right end—and that's the glory of 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the sincere and upright man.</p>
<p align="justify">The second thing in the text is, "There arises light to 
    the upright man." By <b>light </b>is here meant, metaphorically, comfort or 
    joy. Esther 8:16, "The Jews had <i>light</i>, gladness, and joy." By light 
    is meant gladness. The light, when it springs, very much relieves. Joy is to 
    the heart as light is to the eye—very exhilarating and refreshing.</p>
<p align="justify">Third, "light arises in darkness." By <b>darkness </b>is 
    meant trouble, anything that disquiets either the body or the mind. Trouble 
    is darkness. Isaiah 8:22, "Look unto the earth and behold trouble and 
    darkness." Psalm 107:10, "Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of 
    death." As darkness is very disconsolate and frightening, so where trouble 
    comes it makes everything look like the terrors of the night.</p>
<p align="justify">The observation is this:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. When the condition of God's people is darkness, 
    God causes a light to shine unto them.</p></b> "To the upright there arises 
    light in darkness."
<p align="justify">Here are two branches of the proposition. First, the 
    upright, such whom God loves, have their night. Second, a morning light 
    arises to them in the midst of all their darkness.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. First, the upright, such whom God loves, have their 
    night.</p></b></font> It may be a very <i>dark </i>season. Godliness does not 
    exempt them from <i>suffering</i>. They may have a <i>night of affliction</i>; 
    a <i>cloud </i>may set upon their names and estates. God may send trouble 
    upon all their outward comforts, Ruth 1:20.
<p align="justify">Moreover, the people of God may have a night of <b>
    desertion</b>. God may withdraw the smiling beams of His favor, and then it 
    is night with them indeed. Job 6:4, "For the Almighty has struck me down 
    with his arrows. He has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my spirit!" It 
    alludes, said Grotius, to the Persians who, in their war, dip their arrows 
    in poison to make their wounds more deadly. Thus God sometimes shoots the 
    poisonous arrows of desertion at the godly. Then they are in the dark. They 
    are benighted. Though God has the <i>heart of a Father</i>—yet sometimes He 
    has the <i>look of an enemy</i>. He may cause darkness in the soul, and shut 
    up the beams of spiritual comfort.</p>
<p align="justify">He does this, that He may the more <i>quicken the 
    exercise of grace</i>, for prayer may sometimes act highest in the hour of 
    desertion. Jonah 2:4, "I said I was cast out of Your sight; yet will I look 
    towards Your holy temple." Faith and patience, like two stars, shine most 
    bright in the night of desertion. We prefer our comforts—but God prefers the 
    actings of our graces.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord may cause a dark cloud to be upon the righteous, 
    a cloud of desertion—that He may hereby <i>awaken and stir up in His people 
    a spirit of prayer </i>that they may now cry mightily to God, that they may 
    stir up themselves to take hold of God by prayer. Sometimes a father hides 
    his face to make the child cry after him more. Just so, God may hide His 
    face in a cloud of desertion, that His children may cry the more after Him, 
    "Oh, hide not Your face from me!" Psalm 140:7. Desertion will make one pray, 
    if anything will. Desertion is <i>a short hell. </i>Jonah called the whale's 
    belly, <i>the belly of hell, </i>because he was deserted there. And if ever 
    he was going to pray, it was now, that he might get out of that hell. Jonah 
    2:2, "Out of the belly of hell, I cried unto You, and You heard my voice."</p>
<p align="justify">That's the first point, the godly may have their night.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The second part of the proposition is this—A morning 
    light arises in the righteous in all their darkness.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"To the upright there arises light in the darkness." 
    Psalm 18:28, "The Lord will light my candle." As if David had said, "My 
    comforts at present seem to be blown out, and I am in the dark. But the Lord 
    will light my candle and cause light to arise."</p>
<p align="justify">There is a twofold light that God causes to arise in His 
    people in the dark—an outward light and an inward light.</p>
<p align="justify">An <b>OUTWARD </b>light shines; that is, God oftentimes 
    causes the light of prosperity to arise upon His people, which is a light in 
    darkness. When God causes peace and prosperity in the tabernacle of the 
    righteous, here is light rising in darkness. Job 29:3, "When His candle 
    shines upon my head." The candle is the candle of prosperity, a lamp of 
    outward blessings. God has suddenly altered the scene of providence; all of 
    a sudden He has turned the shadows of death into the light of morning.</p>
<p align="justify">When God's people are in the dark, God sometimes causes 
    an <b>INWARD </b>light to arise in them.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, the light of grace</p></b></font>; He makes that 
    shine. In the midst of darkness, a spark of faith in the soul is a spark of 
    light. When the tree has no blossoms or leaves to be seen, as in winter, 
    there may yet be sap in the root of the vine.
<p align="justify">So, my brethren, when our outward comforts are dead, as 
    it were, it is winter; yet there may be the seed of God in the heart. And 
    this <i>spark of grace </i>is a dawning light to the soul.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, God sometimes causes a light of spiritual joy and 
    consolation to arise in the dark and disconsolate soul.</p></b></font> And truly 
    this light of spiritual joy is the very glimmering of the light of heaven. 
    Isaiah 12:1, "Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me." This light of 
    spiritual comfort is sweet and ravishing. It as far exceeds all other joys 
    as heaven excels earth. Thus you see in the midst of darkness or black 
    clouds—that God makes light to arise and shine unto the godly. 
<p align="justify">It is only God Himself who can make it lightsome when the 
    soul is in a dark, disconsolate condition. When the <i>sun </i>sets, none 
    can make it rise but God. Just so, when it is <i>sunset in the soul </i>and 
    the <i>dew of tears </i>drops—none can make <i>daylight in that soul </i>but 
    God Himself. Others may preach comfort to us—but it is God who must make us 
    feel comfort. Others may bring a cordial to us, and set it before us—but it 
    is God who must pour in this cordial, and make it effectual. Psalm 4:7, 
    "You, Lord, have put gladness in my heart."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Question. Why does God make light and joy to arise to the 
    upright in their darkness?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer. For three reasons:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. That He may fulfill His promises. </p></b></font>He has 
    said that He will give light to His people when they are in darkness. Isaiah 
    42:16, "I will make darkness light before them." God's honor lies upon it to 
    make good His promise. He causes light to spring up in the disconsolate 
    soul. God's promise is His bond. When a man has given his bond, he cannot 
    well go back. God's promises may be long in travail—yet at last they bring 
    forth. There are two things in God that never fail.
<p align="justify">First, His <b>compassions </b>fail not, Lamentations 
    3:22.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, His <b>faithfulness </b>fails not, Psalm 89:33. 
    God may sometimes <i>delay </i>a promise—but He will never <i>deny </i>His 
    promise. God may sometimes <i>change </i>His promise, or He may turn a 
    temporal promise into a spiritual promise—but He will never <i>break </i>His 
    promise. He has said He will cause light to go before His people in all 
    their darkness.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. God will cause light to arise in His people in all 
    their darkness, because they help to enlighten others</p></b></font>, and 
    therefore they shall not lack light. When others are in the dark of 
    ignorance—they enlighten them with knowledge. When others are in the dark of 
    affliction—they relieve them. They are merciful to them in giving them alms, 
    which administer light and joy to their hearts. The saints of God are lights 
    to those who sit in darkness. When they are benighted with any sorrow, they 
    shall not lack comfort. The Lord causes light to arise to them in darkness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. God will cause light to arise in His people in 
    darkness; either He will <i>support </i>them in trouble—or <i>deliver </i>
    them out of trouble.</p></b></font> He will cause light to arise because He sees 
    His people have need, great need of some dawnings of light. They would faint 
    away and be discouraged, if there was nothing but darkness and no glimmering 
    of light.
<p align="justify">Should the sick patient always have purging medicine and 
    no cordials given him, he would faint away. God knows our frame, and He sees 
    our spirits would fail before Him—if He always allowed a cloud to lie upon 
    us. Therefore, in judgment He remembers mercy. He causes the daystar of 
    comfort to arise upon His people. God will not let it be always be 
    midnight—lest we touch upon the rock of despair. The musician will not 
    stretch the strings of his violin too far—lest they break asunder. Thus you 
    see why the wise God sees it best to cause light to arise in the midst of 
    darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">So much for the doctrinal part.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Of INFERENCE.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 1.</p></b></font> See the infinite goodness of God 
    towards His people in all cases that fall out in this world, whether 
    affliction or desertion. Oh, the goodness of God! The Lord <i>checkers </i>
    His work. He <i>mixes </i>in some stars to give light—as the artist mixes 
    bright colors with dark shadows. The condition of God's people on earth is 
    never so dark but they may see a <i>rainbow </i>in the cloud of providence. 
    Take one Scripture to verify this. Psalm 138:7, "Though I walk in the midst 
    of trouble, You will revive me." Every step I take I tread upon thorns; I 
    walk in the midst of trouble.
<i>
<p align="justify">Joseph </p></i>was in prison, and there was darkness; but the 
    text says, "The Lord was with Joseph," Genesis 39:21. There light arose. 
<i>
<p align="justify">Jacob </p></i>had the hollow of his thigh put out of 
    joint—there was darkness; but at that very time he saw God's face, a 
    glimmering of God, and the Lord blessed him—there was light rising in 
    darkness, Genesis 32:25.
<i>
<p align="justify">Job </p></i>lost all he ever had and was struck with boils 
    and sores; here was a dark providence. Yes—but hereby Job's grace was 
    perfected and improved, and God gave him an honorable testimony that he was 
    upright, and gave him double estate to what he had before—here was light 
    arisen to Job in the clouds of darkness, Job 42:10.
<p align="justify">Thus God mixes light with His people's darkness. In the
    <i>ark </i>there was <i>manna </i>laid up with the <i>rod</i>. So it is in 
    God's providence towards His people. With the rod of affliction there is 
    some manna, some light, some comfort that God causes to spring up. Manna 
    with the rod, oh, the goodness of God! In the darkest night He keeps alive 
    some spark of light among His people. That's the first inference.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 2. </p></b></font>If it is God's work to cause 
    light and comfort to the righteous, why then, how contrary do they act, who 
    make it their work to cause darkness and sorrow to the righteous! God's work 
    is to cause light to spring up in the godly. Their work is to cause 
    darkness. You know there is a woe that belongs to them who make the heart of 
    the righteous sad. God is creating light for His people, and His enemies are 
    laying snares for them. God is pouring wine and oil into His people's 
    wounds, and His adversaries are pouring vinegar into those wounds.
<p align="justify">How contrary do these act! Those who are of the Romish 
    whore are this day plotting the ruin of God's people, and would have the 
    Church of God lie in a field of blood. The Lord makes light to arise to the 
    godly. The wicked labor to make darkness and sorrow to arise for them. But 
    such as lay snares for the righteous will find God raining fire upon them, 
    Psalm 11:6. Upon the wicked God shall rain fire and brimstone. The wicked 
    strike at Christ through His members' sides; but let them know that if they 
    kick against Christ the Rock, the Lord will be too hard for them at last. 
    God ordains His arrows against the persecutors, Psalm 7:13, and God never 
    misses His mark! If He has His arrow upon the string, He will certainly 
    shoot; and He never misses His mark. That's a second inference.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 3.</p></b></font> See here the difference between 
    the wicked and the godly. In all their darkness, the godly have some light; 
    some comfort arises to them. In all their comforts, the wicked have some 
    darkness rising up to them. Conscience chides them and troubles threaten 
    them. It is like the handwriting upon the wall. God shall wound the heads of 
    His enemies, and the hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still in his 
    trespasses. The sinner, in his light-hearted condition, in all his outward 
    mirth, may see some clouds of darkness. God's threatening arrows are against 
    him and God's curse is against him; and God's curse blasts wherever it 
    comes. An impenitent sinner lives every day under the sentence of death, and 
    there remains for him, said the Apostle, God's fiery indignation! Hebrews 
    10:27.
<p align="justify">When the hardened sinner dies he will be in a bad case;
    <i>he drops into the grave and hell both at once! </i>God has brewed a 
    deadly cup for the impenitent sinner. Observe Psalm 75:8, "In the hand of 
    the Lord there is a cup, the wine is red, it is full of mixture, and the 
    dregs thereof, the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink 
    them." This red wine is the wrath of God, and this wine is <i>full of 
    mixture</i>. What's that? That's the worm of conscience, and the fire of 
    hell. Here is a mixed cup, and the wicked shall ever be drinking this cup. 
    God will never say, "Let this cup pass away." No, they must be forever 
    drinking the dregs of the cup of wrath! I think this Scripture should put a 
    damp on all their joy and mirth. Darkness is coming upon them, 1 Samuel 
    28:19. It was sad news to Saul that the devil brought, "Tomorrow you shall 
    be with me." Dreadful news! Now men are sporting with their lusts and 
    pleasures; now they think they are in their gallantry—but tomorrow they may 
    be with the devil!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 4. </p></b></font>Does God cause light to spring up 
    in His people's darkness? Then see here the difference between earth and 
    heaven. Here in this world there is a mixture of darkness with the saints' 
    light; in heaven there shall be nothing but pure light, no darkness there. 
    It is called an inheritance of light, Colossians 1:12. As the philosophers 
    say, light is the very glory of the creation. It is the beauty of the world. 
    What was all the world without light but a dark prison? Here's the beauty of 
    heaven, it is a place of light. There is no eclipse or dark shadow to be 
    seen there. Heaven is a bright body all over embroidered with light. There 
    is the Sun of righteousness shining with the bright orient beams of glory, 
    Revelation 21:23. The Lamb is the light thereof. Oh, how should we long for 
    that place of paradise!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of CONSOLATION.</p></b></font> This consolation is for 
    the Church and people of God.
<p align="justify">This text is a pillar of light, a breast of consolation. 
    "To the upright arises light in darkness." Does God make light, joy, and 
    peace to arise to the righteous? Why, then, should we despair? Why should we 
    despond when it is God's great design to lighten His people's darkness? I 
    confess things have a bad aspect. England is like the ship in the gospel, 
    almost covered with waves. This may humble us and set our eyes abroach with 
    tears—yet let us not mourn as without hope.</p>
<p align="justify">First, this text, I think, lets in some branches of 
    light. It gives some spark of comfort in our darkness. Let me come as the 
    dove with an olive branch of peace. That is some spark of light that there 
    are many upright ones in the land. And the text says, "Light arises to the 
    upright." Indeed, were the godly quite removed, as it is the desire of some 
    to destroy them, God would soon make quick work with the nation. He would 
    soon break up house here. Genesis 19:22, "Hasten! Escape—for I cannot do 
    anything until you leave." God will do much for the sake of the upright of 
    whom my text speaks. The upright are the excellent of the earth; they are 
    the chariots and horsemen of Israel. They are the very flower and cream of 
    the creation; they are the glory of Christ, 2 Corinthians 8:23. And for 
    their sakes God may yet cause light to arise, and His arm may bring 
    salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, another spark of light in our darkness that God 
    is pleased to stir up in His people is a spirit of mighty prayer. They cry 
    mightily. Certainly God will not say to this city and nation, "Seek My face 
    in vain." Prayer is the wall and bulwark of the land. It is observable that 
    when the Lord intends to pour out the vials of His indignation, He stops the 
    sluices of prayer; He shuts up the spirit of prayer. Jeremiah 7:16, 
    "Therefore, do not pray for this people, neither lift up a cry nor prayer 
    for them, neither make intercession to Me, for I will not hear." God has not 
    yet said this to us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The key of prayer, oiled with tears and turned with the 
    hand of faith, unlocks God's heart.</p></b> Prayer, when it is importunate, 
    staves off wrath from the nation, Exodus 32:10. God said to Moses, "Now 
    therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I 
    may consume them." And what did Moses do? He only prayed. Fervent prayer 
    overcomes the Almighty. Prayer finds God free—but it leaves Him bound. It is 
    as it was. His hand staves off judgment. This lets in some dawning to this 
    land, that God doesn't wholly leave us, especially remembering that Christ 
    Jesus, praying over our prayers again, presents them to His Father and 
    perfumes them with His sweet fragrance, which makes them go up as incense, 
    Revelation 8:3.
<p align="justify">Third, another spark arising is when we consider God's 
    compassion and mercy. Mercy is God's darling attribute, which He loves most 
    of all to magnify, Micah 7:18. Mercy pleases Him. Justice is God's strange 
    work, as if He was not used to it; but mercy is His proper work. It is as 
    natural for Him to show mercy as for the bee to give honey. Why may not 
    mercy give the casting voice for this nation? As that Scripture says, "In 
    His love and in His pity He redeemed them," Isaiah 63:9. Love and pity will 
    do great things.</p>
<p align="justify">God's mercy is not only free, sending out pardons where 
    He pleases—but, which is more, God's mercy can as well heal as it can save. 
    It is a healing mercy. Hosea 14:4, "I will heal their backslidings." 
    Observe, God's mercy can reclaim the persecutor; it can soften the 
    impenitent; it can bring back some who are gone astray. Mercy can destroy 
    the sins of the nation and yet save the nation. It is a healing mercy. "I 
    will heal their backslidings." These are the sparks that God causes to 
    arise.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But things still look and seem as if they are 
    in the dark. We would have more light. What must we do? How must behave, 
    until God makes light to arise to us in darkness?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. Let us, in all dark providences, go into our 
    chambers. Isaiah 26:20, "Come my people, enter into your chamber, and hide 
    yourself." Enter into your chamber, that is, we must go and search our 
    hearts by serious meditation. Go into this chamber of your hearts. Let us, 
    in the first place, search our <b>evidences </b>for heaven, bring our graces 
    to the touchstone. Let us see what <i>faith </i>we have, and what <i>love
    </i>for God we have.</p>
<p align="justify">Does conscience witness that we not only <i>serve </i>
    God, but <i>love </i>Him? Can we cry out for God, for the living God? Are we 
    carried up to heaven in a fiery chariot of love? Is it thus with us? Oh, let 
    us search into the chambers of our hearts and see how all things stand 
    between God and our souls!</p>
<p align="justify">My brethren, when things are dark without, we need to 
    have all clear within.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us go not only into the chamber of our hearts—but let 
    us go into the chamber of divine <b>promises</b>, and there let us rest a 
    while. Oh, these sweet promises of God which our souls may take comfort in! 
    God has promised comfort to all His mourners. God has promised that He will 
    strengthen the infirmed, Isaiah 40:29. God has promised a crown of glory, 
    Revelation 2:10. He has said that He will never leave us nor forsake us. Let 
    us now, by faith, hide ourselves in these chambers. That's the first thing 
    we are to do.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. Having done this, let us, under all clouds of 
    darkness—commit ourselves to God so that He would safeguard and keep us. 
    This I ground upon that Scripture in Psalm 37:5, "Commit your way unto the 
    Lord." In the Hebrew it is "roll your way upon the Lord." Commit yourself 
    and your cause to God by prayer. As an orphan commits himself under care of 
    his guardian, so should we give all our care to God. "Commit your way unto 
    the Lord." Let us do our duty and trust God with our safety. It is our work 
    to <i>cast </i>care; it is God's work to <i>take </i>care.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. Having gone into these chambers, the chambers 
    of our hearts and the chambers of divine promises, now, in the third place, 
    let us now wait for God's time until He shall make light to arise in our 
    horizon, until God turns our darkness into the light of the morning. God can 
    suddenly disperse the black clouds. God can create light; God can strike a 
    straight stroke by a crooked stick; God can remove the mountains that lie in 
    our way until light arises.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us patiently wait; light will spring up. The 
    blessings that we expect are worth waiting for. To see the golden fleet of 
    prayer come laden home with rich returns of mercy, to see peace and truth 
    united, to see popery and profaneness abominated, to see the beauty of 
    holiness shining forth, to see Christ ride in triumph in the chariot of His 
    gospel, to see the righteous honored and renowned and be like the wings of a 
    dove covered with yellow gold—these certainly are mercies worth waiting for. 
    Therefore, let us wait patiently.</p>
<p align="justify">And to encourage holy waiting, I will shut up all with 
    that Scripture, Isaiah 30:18, "And therefore will the Lord wait, that He may 
    be gracious unto you; and therefore will He be exalted, that He may have 
    mercy upon you; for the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all they that 
    wait for Him."</p>
