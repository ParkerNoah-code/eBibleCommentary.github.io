<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Perfume of Love</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"><i>"See that you love one another with a pure heart 
    fervently."</i> 1 Peter 1:22</p>
<p align="justify">The Holy Scripture makes the <i>love of the brethren </i>
    the surest note of a man who shall go to heaven, 1 John 3:14. Christ and His 
    Apostles beat much upon this <i>string of love</i>—as if this made the 
    sweetest music and harmony in true religion. The consideration of this has 
    put me upon this subject.</p>
<p align="justify">All the <i>graces </i>have their beauty—but there are 
    some that more adorn and set off a Christian in the eye of the world, such 
    as <i>humility </i>and love. These two graces, like precious diamonds, cast 
    a sparkling luster upon religion. I have designed to speak of the last of 
    these at this time, "See that you love one another with a pure heart 
    fervently." Love is a grace always needful, therefore never out of season, 
    though too much out of use. My text, like the River of Eden, parts itself 
    into four heads:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The <b>command</b>, "See that you love."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The <b>extent </b>of this love, "One another."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The <b>manner </b>of this love, "With a pure heart."</p>
<p align="justify">4. The <b>degree </b>of this love, "Fervently."</p>
<p align="justify">Love <i>purely</i>; that is—opposed to <i>hypocrisy</i>. 
    Love must be with the heart. It must not be a 'mere complement', which is 
    like a painted fire. <i>Pretended </i>love is worse than hatred.</p>
<p align="justify">Love <i>fervently</i>; that is—opposed to <i>neutrality</i>. 
    Love must flame forth. It must not be as the smoking flax—but as a burning 
    lamp. The Hebrew word for love imports an ardent and zealous affection; no 
    water must quench it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Christians must love one another cordially and 
    fervently.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Colossians 3:14, "Above all these things, put on love." 1 
    Peter 4:8, "Above all things, have fervent love among yourselves." It is as 
    if the Apostle had said, "Whatever you neglect—do not neglect this grace." 
    Jerome reports that when John was old, he was said to be led up into the 
    pulpit and there he repeated these words, "Little children, love one 
    another!" Oh, that this grace of love were engraved as in letters of gold 
    upon our hearts, by the finger of the Holy Spirit!</p>
<p align="justify">Here the question will be asked, "What is love?"</p>
<p align="justify">I answer, love is a sweet and gracious affection whereby 
    we wish the good of another and promote his welfare as our own. Love is a 
    sacred fire kindled in the heart by the Spirit, like that fire which came 
    from heaven, 2 Chronicles 7:1. I shall endeavor to preserve this fire in 
    Christian hearts, as the fire the vestal virgins kept in Rome, that it may 
    not go out.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Arguments to Enforce Love</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. We must love by virtue of command. </p></b></font>John 
    13:34, "A new commandment I give unto you—that you love one another." Love 
    is both a <i>new </i>commandment and an <i>old</i> commandment<i>. </i>It is 
    an old commandment, because it is a law written in the heart of man by the 
    pen of nature as with the point of a diamond. And it is old because it is 
    written in the ancient statutes and records. Leviticus 19:18, "You shall 
    love your neighbor as yourself, I am the Lord."
<p align="justify">Yet it is a new commandment because it is newly purged 
    from pharisaical glosses. Before it was "love your <i>neighbor</i>," but now 
    it is "love your <i>enemy</i>," Matthew 5:44. Here is a new comment upon an 
    old law.</p>
<p align="justify">Love is said to be a new commandment because of a new 
    edition. It came out of the new mint of the gospel, and was pressed by a new 
    example. John 13:34, <i>"As I have loved you"</i>; so that it is not 
    arbitrary but a duty. It is a new commandment and an old commandment.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. We must love because of the excellency of this grace.</p></b></font> 
    It is a lovely grace. All the other graces seem to be eclipsed, unless love 
    shines and sparkles forth in them. <i>Faith </i>itself has no beauty, unless 
    it works by love. The tears of <i>repentance </i>are not pure unless they 
    flow from the spring of love. Love is the jewel which Christ's bride wears; 
    it is the <i>diamond </i>in the <i>ring of graces</i>. This is the grace 
    which seasons all our actions and makes them savory. Love is like musk among 
    linen—which perfumes it. So love makes all our pious services a sweet 
    fragrance to God, Ephesians 5:2.
<p align="justify">Prayer is compared to incense, Psalm 141:2. Now incense, 
    if it is laid on the altar and has no fire put to it, does not smell so 
    sweet. The incense of prayer does not cast such a fragrant aroma, unless 
    kindled with this fire of love. Love is the badge and temper of a true 
    saint. John 13:35, "By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if 
    you love one another"; not if you work miracles—but if you love one another. 
    By this garb, you are known to belong to Me, says Christ. Bernard calls 
    love, the <i>sweet dew </i>which distills from a Christian, and refreshes 
    all whom it drops upon. Love is the <i>golden clasp </i>which knits hearts; 
    it is the <i>cement </i>which unites Christians together; it is the bond of 
    perfectness, Colossians 3:14. If this bond is broken, all falls to pieces. 
    Love is the fulfilling of the law, Romans 13:10. All the duties of the first 
    and second table—<i>piety towards God </i>and <i>equity towards our 
    neighbor, </i>are comprehended in this, "You shall love."</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, how sweetly does the Apostle Paul discourse and 
    expound upon this grace! How he extols it! He plays as well the orator as 
    the theologian; how he delineates this grace of love! How he pencils and 
    draws it out to the life, in all its beauty and spiritual embroidery!</p>
<p align="justify">That he may extol this grace, first he does it 
    exclusively. He shows that the most glorious things are nothing without it.
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>1 Corinthians 13</b></font>:1, <b>"Though I speak 
    with the tongues of men." </b>If a man could speak in as many languages as 
    Mithridates (of whom it is said he understood 22 sundry tongues), if he had 
    the golden mouth of Chrysostom, if he could do with his oratory as the poets 
    said Orpheus did with his harp, move the very rocks and stones—yet without 
    love it would be nothing!</p>
<p align="justify">No, says the Apostle, <b>"though I speak with the tongues 
    of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or as a 
    tinkling cymbal." </b>Would it not be a noble thing to have the eloquence of 
    angels? Yet this, without love, would be but the tinkling of the cymbal. To 
    love as Christians, is better than to speak as angels.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"And though I understand all mysteries and all 
    knowledge," </p></b>verse 2. If a man's head were a library of all learning, if 
    he could know all that is knowable, if he could, with Solomon, discourse 
    from the Cedar in Lebanon even to the hyssop—and have not love, all is 
    nothing. <i>Knowledge without love makes a man no better than a devil.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"And though I have all faith, so that I could move 
    mountains."</p></b> Would it not be admirable to have the faith of miracles? To 
    unhinge mountains, to cast out devils, to take up serpents, and drink 
    poison, and not have it hurt us? Matthew 16:16. Yet "if I have not love, I 
    am nothing." I am of no account with God. The miracles of faith, without the 
    mystery of love, profit nothing.
<b>
<p align="justify">"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,"</p></b> 
    verse 3. Suppose I give away all my estate to charity—yet without love it 
    avails me nothing. It is like a lamp without oil.
<b>
<p align="justify">"And though I give my body to be burned, and have not 
    love, it is nothing."</p></b> The fire of martyrdom avails nothing, without the 
    fire of love. Let a man come to church, pray, and read Scripture; yet if his 
    heart burns in malice, it is but going to hell in more saint-like manner. 
    "Oh, how precious a jewel," said Augustine, "is love! How rare a grace that, 
    if this is lacking, all other things, though ever so glorious, are in vain!"
<p align="justify">The Apostle sets forth this grace of love positively by 
    deciphering its <i>nature </i>and excellency.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Love is kind," </p></b>verse 4. Love is a generous, 
    bountiful grace. It is full of good works; it drops as the honeycomb.
<b>
<p align="justify">"Love is not puffed up."</p></b> Though it is bountiful, it 
    is not proud. Love is a humble grace, like the violet. Though it perfumes 
    the air—yet it hangs down its head. Loves lays aside the trumpet and covers 
    itself with a veil. Love conceals its own worth, and says, as Paul, 2 
    Corinthians 12:11, "though I am nothing."
<b>
<p align="justify">"Love seeks not her own," </p></b>verse 5. The Apostle 
    complains, Philippians 2:21, "All men seek their own," but love seeks not 
    her own. This is a <i>diffusive </i>grace, and wholly spends itself for the 
    good of others, 1 Corinthians 10:33. Love makes a private Christian a common 
    good. Love is a grace which does not dwell at home; it goes abroad; it makes 
    frequent visits; it looks into the condition of others and relieves them. <i>
    Love has one eye blind to wink at the infirmities of others—and another eye 
    open to spy their needs!
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"Love is not easily provoked." </p></b>It is not in a violent 
    fit; it does not burn in anger. It is meek and calm, never taking fire 
    unless to warm others with its gracious beams of mercy. It gives honey but 
    does not easily sting.
<p align="justify">The Apostle sets forth the excellency of this grace of 
    love comparatively, by laying it in the balance with other graces, verse 13,<b> 
    "And now abides faith, hope, love; these three—but the greatest of these is 
    love."</b> He compares love with faith and hope, and then sets the crown 
    upon love. Indeed, in some senses, faith is greater than love.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith is the cause of love; therefore, more noble; for, 
    as Augustine said, though the root of the tree is not seen—yet all the 
    beauty of the branches proceeds from the root. So all the beauty which 
    sparkles in love, proceeds from the root of faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith is more excellent than love. Faith is a more 
    beneficial grace to us; for by faith we are ingrafted into Christ and 
    partake of all the blessings of salvation. Faith fetches into the soul—all 
    the strength and riches of Christ! Faith puts upon the soul the embroidered 
    robe of Christ's righteousness, in which it shines brighter than the angels. 
    But, in another sense, love is greater than faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Love is greater than faith because love is a more <i>
    visible </i>grace then faith. Faith lies hidden in the heart, Romans 10:9. 
    Love is more conspicuous and shines forth more in the life. Love reveals the 
    soundness of faith, as the steady beating of the pulse shows the healthful 
    temper of the body. Faith bows the knee to Christ and worships Him; love 
    opens its treasures and presents unto Christ gifts, gold and frankincense.</p>
<p align="justify">Love is greater than faith in regard of <i>continuance</i>. 
    1 Corinthians 13:8, "Love never fails." We shall lay down our body of flesh, 
    and see God face to face. Faith and hope shall be no more—but love shall 
    remain. While we live here, we have need of faith, this is our <i>Jacob's 
    staff </i>to walk with. 2 Corinthians 5:7, "We walk by faith." But we shall 
    set this staff shortly at heaven's door, and <i>love </i>alone shall enter 
    within the veil. So you have seen the sparkling of this diamond, and thus 
    does the Apostle no less elegantly than divinely set forth the beauty and 
    orient luster of this grace.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third argument pressing Christians to love is that 
    this sets a crown of honor upon true religion.</p></b></font> It renders the 
    Gospel lovely in the eyes of the world. It was an honor to religion in 
    Tertullian's time, when the heathens could say, "See how the Christians love 
    one another!" Psalm 133:1, "Behold how good, and how pleasant it is for 
    brethren to dwell together in unity!" It is like precious ointment upon the 
    head which runs down to the skirts of holy garments. Oh, what a blessed 
    sight it is to see Christians linked together with the silver link of love! 
    The church is Christ's Temple, the saints are living stones, 1 Peter 2:5. 
    How beautiful is this temple when the stones of it are cemented together 
    with love! It was said of the first Temple, that there was no noise of 
    hammer in it; and oh, that there might be no noise of strife and division in 
    God's church! Could we see unity and truth, like the vine and elm mutually 
    embracing; could we see the children of Zion spreading themselves as olive 
    plants round about their mother's table in an amicable and peaceable manner; 
    how would this adorn true religion and be a lure to invite and draw others 
    to be in love with it! What is true religion, but a binding and knitting 
    together of hearts! We are knit to God by faith—and one to another by love.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fourth argument is the necessity of love.</p></b></font> 
    Love is a debt. Now debts must be paid. "Let no debt remain outstanding, 
    except the continuing debt to love one another," Romans 13:8. The <i>debt of 
    love </i>differs from other debts.
<p align="justify">When a debt is paid, we receive an acquittance and are to 
    pay it no more; but this debt of love must be always paying. In heaven we 
    must be paying this debt, love to God and the saints; there is no discharge 
    from this debt.</p>
<p align="justify">Other debts may be dispensed with. We forgive a debt 
    sometimes, as that creditor did in the parable, Matthew 18:27, "The Lord of 
    that servant was moved with compassion and forgave him the debt." But this 
    debt of love is by no means to be dispensed with; it must be paid. If we do 
    not pay this debt, God will come upon us with an arrest, and throw us into 
    hell prison!</p>
<p align="justify">In civil debts between man and man, the more they pay, 
    the <i>less </i>they have; but, in this debt of love, it is quite contrary. 
    The more we pay, the <i>more </i>we have. The more grace from God, the more 
    love to others. Love, like the widow's oil, increases by being poured out. 
    By paying other debts we grow poorer—by paying this debt, we grow richer.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A fifth argument enforcing love, is that love makes us 
    like God.</p></b></font> "God is love," 1 John 4:16, a golden sentence. 
    Augustine said, "The Apostle more commends love in this one word, 'God is 
    love,' than Paul does in his whole chapter." As the nature of the sun is 
    light, so God's nature is love. The three persons in the trinity are all 
    love.
<p align="justify">God the <b>Father </b>is love. John 3:16, "God so loved 
    the world." That God should part with Christ out of His bosom, the Son of 
    His love, and lay this jewel, as it were, to pawn for our salvation, oh, 
    unparallel love! Never was such love shown to the fallen angels!</p>
<p align="justify">God the <b>Son </b>is love. How did Christ love His 
    spouse when He died for her! His sides dripped <i>blood</i>—His heart 
    dripped <i>love! </i>Such a vein of love was opened in Him, that our sins 
    could not quench it. Love was the wing on which Christ flew into the 
    virgin's womb. Christ incarnate—here was <i>love covered over with flesh!</i> 
    Christ on the cross—here was a <i>book of love </i>laid open before us to 
    read in!</p>
<p align="justify">God the<b> Holy Spirit </b>is love. His appearing in the 
    likeness of a dove showed His nature. "The dove," said Pliny, "is an 
    amicable creature; it is without gall." What are all the motions of the 
    Spirit, but offers of love? Thus all the persons of the trinity are love; 
    and the more we shine in the grace of love, the more we resemble the God of 
    love.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A sixth argument enforcing love, is from the sweet 
    relations we stand in one to another. </p></b></font>We are fellow-<i>citizens</i>, 
    Ephesians 2:19; we all expect one heaven. We shall shortly <i>live </i>
    together, and shall we not <i>love </i>together? We are <i>soldiers </i>of 
    the same army, 2 Timothy 2:3; ours must be the fight of faith, not the fight 
    of contention. Our strife must be who shall love most! We are <i>branches
    </i>of the same vine, and shall we not be united? We are <i>stones </i>of 
    the same building, and shall we not be cemented with love? Nay, we are 
    brethren. Acts 7:26, "Sirs, you are brethren, why do you wrong one to 
    another?"<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Practical Application</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1.</p></b></font> I might here take up a lamentation and 
    steep my words in tears, to consider the <b>decay </b>(I almost said "the 
    funeral") of this grace among Christians. The fire of brotherly love is 
    almost ready to go out. Instead of the fire of love, we see the wildfire of 
    contention. I have read of one Vitalis who hazarded his life to rescue his 
    distressed friend; but surely such Vitalises are dead in this age. The text 
    says, "See that you love one another." But our times are a bad commentary 
    upon this text. How Christians reproach, censure, and malign one another! 
    The text says, "love fervently," but they hate fervently. Instead of the 
    bond of love, behold the apple of strife! We live in the frigid zone, "the 
    love of many waxes cold." Many live as if they had been born upon the 
    mountains of <i>Bether</i>, the mountains of division, and as if they had 
    been baptized in the waters of Meribah, the water of strife. 
<p align="justify">Do the wicked unite? Nay, do the devils unite? There was, 
    in one man, a <i>legion </i>of demons, which is, according to Varro, seven 
    thousand six hundred twenty two. Shall there be more harmony among <i>devils
    </i>than among <i>Christians! </i>For these divisions among the godly, there 
    are great thoughts of heart. Oh, Christians! Turn your hot words—into salt 
    tears! How do the enemies of true religion insult us, to see not only 
    Christ's <i>coat </i>torn—but His <i>body </i>torn! For these things let our 
    eyes run down with tears.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider the evil consequence, where love is lacking. The 
    absence of this grace brings forth divisions, and they are dangerous. For 
    divisions bring a reproach and scandal upon true religion; they make the 
    ways of God evil spoken of, as if religion were the fomenter of envy and 
    sedition. Julian, in his invectives against the Christians, said that they 
    lived together as tigers, rending and tearing one another. And shall we, by 
    our animosities and contentions, make good, Julian's words? Lack of love 
    will make others afraid to embrace the Christian faith. </p>
<p align="justify">Divisions advance Satan's kingdom. The devil has no hope 
    but in our discords. Chrysostom observes that, in the city of Corinth when 
    many zealous converts were brought in, Satan knew no better way to dam up 
    the current of religion, than by throwing in a bone of contention and 
    dividing them into parties. One was for Paul and another for Apollo—but few 
    for Christ.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2.</p></b></font> Be exhorted to cordial and fervent 
    love. "See that you love one another." Oh, that this sweet spice might send 
    forth its fragrant aroma among Christians! Oh, that the Lord would rain down 
    some of these <i>silver showers of love </i>upon the hearts of Christians, 
    which are, for the most part like the mountains of Gilboa, which have none 
    of this heavenly dew upon them! They say of the stones of the temple, that 
    they were so closely cemented as if there had been but one stone in the 
    temple. It is to be wished that the hearts of Christians were so sweetly 
    cemented in love, as if there were but one heart.
<p align="justify">Let me commend this grace of amity and love to 
    Christians. You are members of the church of God; you bear Christ's name. 
    You wear His garb; therefore, you must be <i>soldered </i>together in 
    affection. It is a sad omen when the joints of the same body are loosed, and 
    the knees shall smite one against another.</p>
<p align="justify">If yet men will live at variance, nourishing a viper in 
    their bosoms, I shall offer two things to their serious consideration.</p>
<p align="justify">1. An unloving person is an unregenerate person. Titus 
    3:3, "At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by 
    all kinds of passions and pleasures.<i> We lived in malice and envy, being 
    hated and hating one another." </i>It is as if he had said, "Before grace 
    came, we were filled and ready to burst with this poison of malice." The 
    Apostle, describing a natural condition, calls it the gall of bitterness. A 
    malicious person is of no kin to God, for God is love. He knows nothing of 
    the Gospel savingly, for it is a Gospel of peace. We read in Scripture of 
    the bond of peace, Ephesians 4:3 and the bond of iniquity, Acts 8:23. Him 
    whom the Gospel has not bound in the bond of peace, Satan has bound in the 
    bond of iniquity.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Uncharitableness is a leaven, which sours the whole 
    lump, 1 Corinthians 5:8. </p>
<p align="justify">Uncharitableness sours your good <b>qualities</b>. Naaman 
    was an honorable man, a mighty man in valor—<i>but he was a leper</i>, 2 
    Kings 5:1. Like a dead fly in the ointment, it spoiled all the rest. So it 
    may be said that such a man is a man of abilities, a man of great moral 
    endowments; he is just, affable, temperate—<i>but he is a leper</i>. He is 
    not a loving person. He pays everyone their own—but there is one debt he 
    will not pay, though he rots in hell for it—namely the debt of love. This is 
    a <i>brand of infamy </i>upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">Uncharitableness sours your good <b>duties</b>. You pray 
    and come to church—but refuse to be tied in a knot of love. What profit is 
    there of all your <i>seeming </i>devotion? We are bid to lift up pure hands 
    without wrath, 1 Timothy 2:8. The unloving person does not lift up pure 
    hands in prayer—but leprous hands, bloody hands. 1 John 3:16, "Whoever hates 
    his brother is a murderer!" Prayer, said Chrysostom, may be compared to a 
    fine garland. The hands which make a garland must be clean; just so, the 
    heart which makes a prayer needs to be clean. Wrath and anger sully and 
    defile a Christian's prayers—and will the Holy God touch them? The unloving 
    man poisons his own prayers—and will the Lord accept a poisoned sacrifice?</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, that all this might at last persuade us to cordial 
    and fervent love! Let us turn all our <i>censuring </i>into <i>praying</i>! 
    Let us pray to God that He would quench the fire of contention, and increase 
    the fire of brotherly love among us. Let us pray that the Lord would heal 
    our schisms, and repair our breaches; that He would make us like the 
    cherubim with our faces looking one upon another. Let us pray that God will 
    make good that promise that we shall serve Him with one heart, and that this 
    may be the golden motto written upon our churches, "One heart and one way."</p>
<p align="justify">It exhorts us that, as we would be amicable to all, so 
    especially that we would love those who are of the household of faith—namely 
    the people of God, Psalm 16:2. We must love as God loves, He loves those 
    most who are like Him. He loves <i>piety</i>, though it is espoused to <i>
    poverty</i>. So must our love run out especially to those who have the image 
    and superscription of God upon on them. Joseph loved all his brethren—but he 
    loved Benjamin the most. The people of God must have a <i>Benjamin's portion
    </i>of our love. </p>
<p align="justify">The saints are called <i>jewels</i>, Malachi 3:17, which 
    we must love and prize; they are called the <i>apple of God's eye</i>—to 
    show how tender they should be in our eye. The saints are <i>partakers of 
    the divine nature</i>, 2 Peter 1:4, not by an incorporation into divine 
    essence—but by a <i>conformity to the divine likeness</i>. These we must 
    love, with a love of delight and delight. These are near allied to Christ by 
    faith; they are of the <i>blood royal </i>of heaven; these must be higher in 
    our thoughts and deeper in our affections than others.</p>
<p align="justify">When I say the saints must have the largest share in our 
    love, I mean not all who call themselves saints, such as under a <i>mask of 
    holiness </i>commit sin, hypocritical saints—but such as the <i>Scripture
    </i>calls saints, such as excel in virtue and grace, Psalm 16, such as walk 
    humbly with God, Micah 6:8; such as have something of Christ in them. These 
    saints, we must place our entire love upon. Indeed, there is that in them 
    which may excite and draw forth love; they have the beauty of inner 
    holiness, and they have an interest in the unspotted holiness of Christ, 
    which may be a sufficient loadstone to draw our love to them.</p>
<p align="justify">But what shall we say to those who, instead of loving the 
    people of God because they are saints—hate them because they are saints! As 
    Tertullian says, "the very confession of the name of a Christian was enough 
    to bring them into an odium, and was laid against them as a matter of 
    crime!" It was said of Aristides that he was banished out of Athens because 
    he was <i>just</i>. Sanctity is the thing that is reproached and hated in 
    the world. Wicked men, panther-like, would tear the picture of God drawn in 
    the new man! Let one have all kinds of accomplishments, learning, morality, 
    piety—though men will love him for his learning and morality, they will hate 
    him for his piety. <i>Holiness has become a crime!</i></p>

<p align="justify">The serpent is known by his hissing. They are the seed of 
    the old serpent that hiss at true religion. Let me speak my mind freely. 
    There is generally among men a secret antipathy against the power of 
    godliness. They are for some <i>shows </i>of devotion; they keep up a <i>
    form</i> of religion—but such as have a spirit of zeal and sanctity shining 
    in them—the hearts of men rise against! Let me tell you, there is not a 
    greater sign of a rotten and devilish heart—than to hate a man for that very 
    thing for which God loves him—namely, his holiness!</p>
<p align="justify">It is a high affront to abuse the King's statue. What 
    vengeance shall they be counted worthy of, who malign and do all that they 
    can—to tear in pieces the image of the living God! Oh, take heed of this! 
    Hating the <i>grace of the Spirit </i>comes near to <i>despising the Spirit 
    of grace. </i></p>

<p align="justify">To conclude, let us plead with God for the spirit of 
    amity and unity—that we may love one another; especially that we may be 
    endeared in our affections to those who are of the family of God and whose 
    names are enrolled in the Book of Life.</p>
