<p align="justify">David sometimes <i>sang with his harp</i>; and sometimes 
    the<i> organ of his eye </i>wept: "I water my couch with my <i>tears</i>" 
    (Psalm 6:6). Christ calls his spouse his "dove" (Song 2:14). The dove is a
    <i>weeping</i> creature. <i>Grace dissolves and liquefies the soul</i>, 
    causing a spiritual thaw. <i>The sorrow of the heart, runs out at the eye
    </i>(Psalm 31:9).</p>
<p align="justify">The Rabbis report that the same night on which Israel 
    departed from Egypt towards Canaan, all the <i>idols </i>of Egypt were 
    broken down by lightning and earthquake. Just so, at that very time at which 
    men go forth from their natural condition towards heaven, all the <i>idols 
    of sin </i>in the heart must be broken down by repentance! A <i>melting 
    heart</i> is the chief branch of the covenant of grace (Ezek. 36:26), and 
    the product of the Spirit: "I will pour upon the house of David the spirit 
    of grace, and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, <i>and they 
    shall mourn for him" </i>(Zech. 12:10).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question: But why is a godly man a weeper? </p></b></font>Is 
    not sin pardoned, which is the ground of joy? Has he not had a transforming 
    work upon his heart? Why, then, does he weep?
<i>
<p align="justify">Answer:</p></i> A godly man finds enough reasons for weeping:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He weeps for indwelling sin</p></b></font>, the law in his 
    members (Romans 7:23), the outbursts and first risings of sin. His nature is 
    a poisoned fountain. A regenerate person grieves that he carries with him, 
    that which is enmity to God! His heart is like a wide sea in which there are 
    innumerable <i>creeping things </i>(Psalm 104:25)—vain, sinful thoughts. A 
    child of God laments <i>hidden </i>wickedness; he has more evil in him than 
    he knows of. There are those <i>windings </i>in his heart which he cannot 
    trace—an unknown world of sin. "Who can understand his errors?" (Psalm 
    19:12).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A godly man weeps for clinging corruption.</p></b></font> 
    If he could get rid of sin, there would be some comfort—but he cannot shake 
    off this viper! Sin cleaves to him like leprosy! Though a child of God 
    forsakes his sin—yet sin will not forsake him. "Concerning the rest of the
    <i>beasts</i>, they had their <i>dominion </i>taken away: yet their <i>lives
    </i>were prolonged for a season" (Dan. 7:12). So though the <i>dominion </i>
    of sin is taken away—yet its life is prolonged for a season; and while sin
    <i>lives</i>, it <i>molests! </i>The Persians were daily enemies to the 
    Romans and would always be invading their frontiers. So sin "wars against 
    the soul" (1 Pet. 2:11). And there is no cessation of war—until death. Will 
    not this cause tears?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A child of God weeps that he is sometimes overcome by 
    the prevalence of corruption.</p></b></font> "For I do not do the good that I 
    want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do." (Romans 
    7:19). Paul was like a man carried <i>down</i>stream. How often a saint is 
    overpowered by pride and passion! When David had sinned, he steeped his soul 
    in the <i>brinish tears of repentance</i>. It cannot but grieve a regenerate 
    person to think he should be so foolish as, after he has felt the smart of 
    sin—still to put this fire in his bosom again!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A godly heart grieves that he can be no more holy.</p></b></font> 
    It troubles him that he shoots so short of the rule and standard which God 
    has set. "I would", says he, "love the Lord with all my heart. But how 
    defective my love is! How far short I come of what I <i>should </i>be; no, 
    of what I might have been! What can I see in my life—but either <i>blanks
    </i>or <i>blots</i>?"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. A godly man sometimes weeps out of the sense of God's 
    love.</p></b></font> Gold is the finest and most solid of all the metals—yet it 
    is soonest melted in the fire. <i>Gracious </i>hearts, which are <i>golden
    </i>hearts, are the soonest melted into tears by the fire of God's love. I 
    once knew a holy man, who was walking in his garden and shedding plenty of 
    tears, when a friend came on him accidentally and asked him why he wept. He 
    broke forth into this pathetic expression: "Oh, the love of Christ! Oh, the 
    love of Christ!" Thus have we seen the cloud melted into <i>water</i>, by 
    the sunbeams.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. A godly person weeps because the sins he commits are 
    in some sense worse than the sins of other men. </p></b></font>The sin of a 
    justified person is very odious:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(i) The sin of a justified person is odious—because he 
    acts <i>contrary </i>to his own principles.</p></b></font> He sins not only 
    against the rule—but against his principles, against his knowledge, vows, 
    prayers, hopes, experiences. He knows how dearly sin will cost him—yet he 
    adventures upon the forbidden fruit!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(ii) The sin of a justified person is odious, because it 
    is a sin of unkindness</p></b></font> (1 Kings 11:9). Peter's denying of Christ 
    was a sin against <i>love</i>. Christ had enrolled him among the apostles. 
    He had taken him up into the Mount of Transfiguration and shown him the 
    glory of heaven in a vision. Yet after all this dazzling mercy—it was base 
    ingratitude, that he should deny Christ! This made him go out and "weep 
    bitterly" (Matt. 26:75). He baptized himself, as it were, in his own tears!
    <i>The sins of the godly go nearest to God's heart. </i>The sins of others
    <i>anger </i>God; the sins of the godly <i>grieve </i>him! The sins of the 
    wicked pierce Christ's <i>side! </i>The sins of the godly wound his <i>
    heart!</i> The unkindness of a <i>spouse, </i>goes nearest to the heart of 
    her husband.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(iii) The sin of a justified person is odious, because it 
    reflects more dishonor upon God.</p></b></font> "By this deed you have given 
    great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme" (2 Sam. 12:14). The 
    sins of God's people put <i>black spots on the face of piety</i>. Thus we 
    see what cause there is why a child of God should weep even after 
    conversion. "Can whoever sows such things refrain from tears?"
<p align="justify">Now this sorrow of a godly man for sin, is not a 
    despairing sorrow. He does not mourn without hope. "Iniquities prevail 
    against me" (Psalm 65:3)—there is the holy <i>soul weeping</i>. "As for our 
    transgressions, you shall purge them away"—there is <i>faith triumphing</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Godly sorrow is excellent. There is as much difference 
    between the sorrow of a godly man, and the sorrow of a wicked man—as between 
    the water of a spring which is clear and sweet, and the water of the sea 
    which is salt and brackish. <font color="#008000"><b>A godly man's sorrow 
    has these three qualifications:</b></font></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(a) Godly sorrow is INWARD.</p></b> It is a sorrow of <i>soul</i>. 
    Hypocrites "disfigure their <i>faces</i>" (Matt. 6:16). Godly sorrow goes 
    deep. It is a "pricking at the heart" (Acts 2:37). True sorrow is a 
    spiritual martyrdom, therefore called "soul affliction" (Lev. 23:29).
<b>
<p align="justify">(b) Godly sorrow is SINCERE.</p></b> It is more for the evil 
    that is <i>in </i>sin—than the evil which follows <i>after </i>sin. It is 
    more for the <i>spot—</i>than the <i>sting</i>. Hypocrites weep for sin only 
    as it brings affliction. Hypocrites never send forth the streams of their 
    tears, except when God's judgments are approaching.
<b>
<p align="justify">(c) Godly sorrow is INFLUENTIAL. </p></b>It makes the heart 
    better: "by the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better" 
    (Eccles. 7:3). Divine tears not only <i>wet</i>—but <i>wash</i>; they purge 
    out the love of sin!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1.</p></b></font> How far from being godly are those who 
    scarcely ever shed a tear for sin! If they lose a near relation—they weep. 
    But though they are in danger of losing God and their souls—they do not 
    weep. How few know what it is to be in an agony for sin, or what a broken 
    heart means! Their eyes are not like the "fishpools in Heshbon", full of 
    water (Song 7:4)—but rather like the mountains of Gilboa, which had "no dew" 
    upon them (2 Sam. 1:21). It was a greater plague for Pharaoh to have his <i>
    heart turned into stone</i>—than to have his <i>rivers turned into blood.
</i>
<p align="justify">The wicked, if they sometimes shed a tear—are never the 
    better. They go on in wickedness, and do not drown their sins in their 
    tears!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2:</p></b></font> Let us strive for this divine 
    characteristic. Be weepers! This is "a repentance not to be repented of" (2 
    Cor. 7:10). It is reported of Bradford, the martyr, that he was of a melting 
    spirit; he seldom sat down to his meal but some tears trickled down his 
    cheeks. There are two lavers to wash away sin: <i>blood </i>and <i>tears</i>. 
    The <i>blood of Christ </i>washes away the guilt of sin; <i>our tears </i>
    wash away the filth of sin. 
<p align="justify">Repenting tears are <b>precious</b>. God puts them in his 
    bottle (Psalm 56:8). Repenting tears are <b>beautifying</b>. To God—a tear 
    in the eye, adorns more than a ring on the finger. Oil makes the <i>face </i>
    shine (Psalm 104:15). Tears make the <i>heart </i>shine. Repenting tears are
    <b>comforting</b>. A <i>sinner's </i>mirth turns to <i>melancholy</i>. A <i>
    saint's </i>mourning turns to <i>music!</i> Repentance may be compared to 
    myrrh, which though it is bitter to the taste—is comforting to the spirits. 
    Repentance may be bitter to the <i>flesh</i>, but it is most refreshing to 
    the <i>soul</i>. Wax which <i>melts </i>is fit for the seal. A melting soul 
    is fit to take the stamp of all heavenly blessing. Let us give Christ the <i>
    water of our tears—</i>and he will give us the <i>wine of his blood!</i></p>
