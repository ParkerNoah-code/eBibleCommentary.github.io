<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">B. The second good effect of the saints piety—was that 
    God RECORDED it. </p></b></font>"A book of remembrance was written before him"; 
    the word in the original for "book of remembrance" signifies "a book of 
    memorials" or "monuments". The words immediately foregoing recite God's 
    hearkening and hearing; but lest any should say, though God does at the 
    present hear the holy speech and thoughts of his children—yet may they not 
    in time slip out of his mind? Therefore these words are added, "a book of 
    remembrance was written before him." The Lord did not only <i>hear </i>the 
    godly speeches of the saints—but <i>recorded </i>them, and wrote them down! 
    "A book of remembrance was written."
<p align="justify">This is spoken after the manner of men—not that God has 
    any book of records by him. He does not need to write down anything for the 
    help of his memory. He is not subject to forgetfulness. Things done a 
    thousand years ago are as fresh to him—as if they were done but yesterday: 
    "A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past" (Psalm 
    90:4).</p>
<p align="justify">This "book of remembrance", therefore, is a borrowed form 
    of speech, taken from kings, who have their <i>chronicles </i>wherein they 
    note memorable things. King Ahasuerus had his book of records, wherein were 
    written the worthy deeds of Mordecai (Esther 6:1-2). Just so, God bears in 
    mind, all the godly speeches and pious actions of his children. God's 
    particular and critical assessment is a book of records, where nothing can 
    be lost or torn out.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine: God eternally remembers all the good designs 
    and pious endeavors of his people.</p></b></font> "God is not unjust; he will 
    not <i>forget </i>your <i>work </i>and the <i>love </i>you have shown him, 
    as you have helped his people and continue to help them." (Heb. 6:10). There 
    are eight things which God writes down in his book of remembrance:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The Lord writes down the NAMES of his people.</p></b></font> 
    "Whose names are written in the Book of Life" (Phil. 4:3). This book has no
    <i>errata</i>, "I will never <i>erase </i>their names from the Book of 
    Life!" (Rev. 3:5).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The Lord writes down the godly SPEECH of his people.</p></b></font> 
    When Christians speak together of the mysteries of heaven (which is like 
    music in concert), God is much delighted with it. <i>When their tongues are 
    going on earth—God's pen is going in heaven! </i>"Those who feared the Lord 
    spoke often one to another, and a book of remembrance was written!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The Lord writes down the TEARS of his people.</p></b></font> 
    Tears drop down to the earth—but they reach heaven! God has his bottle and 
    his book: "You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears 
    in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book!" (Psalm 56:8). 
    Tears drop from the saints—as water from the roses—they are fragrant to 
    God—and he puts them in his bottle. And besides this, he has his book of 
    remembrance, where he writes them down, "You have recorded each one in your 
    book!" Especially God writes down such tears as are shed for the sins of the 
    times. "There was another man among them, clothed in linen, with <i>writing 
    equipment </i>at his side" (Ezek. 9:2). This was to write down the tears of 
    the mourners, and to "put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and 
    groan over all the abominations committed in the city" (verse 4).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. God writes down the THOUGHTS of his people.</p></b></font> 
    We can write down men's <i>words</i>—but we cannot write down their <i>
    thoughts</i>. It would perplex the <i>angels—</i>to write men's thoughts! 
    But be assured, never a holy thought comes into our mind—but God writes it 
    down! So in the text—a book of remembrance was written for those who <i>
    thought </i>upon his name. Two things are silent—yet have a voice:
<i><b>
<p align="justify">1. Tears: </p></b></i>"the Lord has heard the voice of my <i>
    weeping</i>" (Psalm 6:8). 
<i><b>
<p align="justify">2. Thoughts: </p></b></i>"I know what they are <i>thinking</i>" 
    (Isaiah 66:18).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. God writes down the DESIRES of his people.</p></b></font> 
    "Lord, my every desire is known to You!" (Psalm 38:9); that is, "It is set 
    down in your book!" Desire is the spiritual appetite, or the soul's panting 
    and breathing after God (Psalm 84:2). In this life we do rather <i>desire
    </i>God—than <i>enjoy </i>him. Can we say that we take our souls out of the 
    quiver of our bodies, and shoot them into heaven? Do our affections sally 
    forth towards Christ? Do we desire him superlatively and incessantly? Every 
    such desire is put down in God's register book! Lord, my every desire is 
    known to You!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The Lord writes down the PRAYERS of his people.</p></b></font> 
    (Jonah 2:7). Prayer, though it be not vocal, only mental, is recorded. 
    "Hannah spoke in her heart" (1 Sam. 1:13). That prayer, God wrote down and 
    answered. God was <i>better </i>to her than her prayer; she prayed for a <i>
    son</i>—and God gave her a <i>prophet!</i> At times the heart is so full of 
    grief, that it can only <i>groan </i>in prayer; yet a <i>groan </i>is 
    sometimes the best part of a prayer, and God writes it down: "My groaning is 
    not hidden from You!" (Psalm 38:9). If we cannot speak with <i>elegance </i>
    in prayer; if it is only <i>lisping </i>and <i>chattering</i>, God puts it 
    in his book of remembrance: "I chattered like a swallow, and then I moaned 
    like a mourning dove. I am in trouble, Lord. Help me!" (Isaiah 38:14); yet 
    that prayer was <i>heard </i>and <i>registered</i>, "I have <i>heard </i>
    your prayer—I have <i>seen </i>your tears!" (verse 5).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. God writes down the WORKS of his people. </p></b></font>
    Works of mercy must be done out of love to God. As Mary out of love brought 
    her ointments and sweet spices, and anointed Christ's dead body—so out of 
    pure love we must bring our <i>ointments of charity </i>to anoint the 
    saints, which are Christ's living body. Such alms are not lost. With such 
    sacrifices God is well pleased (Heb. 13:16). And that we should see how well 
    the Lord is pleased with them, he writes them down thus: "Your gifts to the 
    poor have come up as a memorial offering before God." (Acts 10:4).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. God has a book of remembrance for the SUFFERINGS of 
    his people.</p></b></font> The saints <i>purgatory </i>is in this life. But 
    there are two things which may bear up their spirits:
<p align="justify">First, every groan of theirs goes to God's heart: "I have 
    also heard the <i>groaning </i>of the children of Israel" (Exod. 6:5). In 
    music when one string is touched—all the rest sound. When the saints are 
    stricken—God's heart reverberates.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, God has a book of records, to write down his 
    people's injuries. The wicked make wounds in the backs of the righteous, and 
    then pour in vinegar. God writes down their cruelty: "I remember what Amalek 
    did to Israel" (1 Sam. 15:2). Amalek was Esau's grandchild (Gen. 36:12), a 
    bitter enemy of Israel. The Amalekites showed their spite to Israel in two 
    ways:</p>
<p align="justify">First, "Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the 
    way when you came out of Egypt. When you were weary and worn out, they met 
    you on your journey and cut off all who were lagging behind; they had no 
    fear of God." (Deuteronomy 25:17-18)</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, they openly gave battle to them, and would have 
    hindered them from going into Canaan (Exod. 17:8). Now God took notice of 
    Israel's sufferings by Amalek: "I remember what Amalek did to Israel, and I 
    have my book of remembrance; I write it down." "This is what the Lord 
    Almighty says—I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when 
    they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go, attack the Amalekites 
    and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put 
    to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and 
    donkeys." (1 Sam. 15:2-3).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First use of the doctrine: INFORMATION.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. This shows us that it is not in vain to serve God.</p></b></font> 
    The wicked who do not know God, think him to be a hard Master, and say, like 
    those Job speaks of, "What would we gain by praying to him?" (Job 21:15). 
    But the text shows us that God records all the services of his people, "a 
    book of remembrance was written before him." God's writing in his book is:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">A. An HONOR to the saints.</p></b></font> The Romans wrote 
    the names of their senators in a book, and in token of honor they were 
    called the "chosen fathers" of the people. So God's book of remembrance 
    shows his high esteem of his people and their services. He writes them down.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">B. A mark of the SPECIAL FAVOR God bears to his people.</p></b></font> 
    He registers them and their services—with an intent to <i>crown </i>them! 
    Tamerlane, wrote down all the memorable deeds of his soldiers, whom he 
    afterwards advanced to places of dignity. God's service is most desirable; 
    let us make Joshua's choice: "As for me and my house—we will serve the 
    Lord!" (Joshua 24:15).
<p align="justify">If we should desert God's service, where shall we go? 
    When Christ asked his disciples, Will you also go away? Peter said, "Lord, 
    to whom shall we go?" (John 6:68); as if to say, "If we leave you, we do not 
    know where to get help for ourselves." Let us adhere to God; he has his book 
    of memorials to record our allegiance. We may be losers <i>for </i>him—but 
    we shall not be losers <i>by </i>him.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. As God registers the good works of his people—so he 
    has a book of remembrance to write down the sins of the wicked! </p></b></font>
    "Go now, <i>write </i>it on a tablet for them, <i>inscribe </i>it on a 
    scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness. These 
    are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to 
    the Lord's instruction!" (Isaiah 30:8-9). 
<p align="justify">Men's sins are written in the book of <i>conscience</i>—and 
    the book of God's <i>omniscience</i>. They think that because God does not 
    speak to them by his loud judgments, therefore God does not know their sins. 
    But though God does not <i>speak</i>—he <i>writes</i>: "The sin of Judah is 
    written with an iron stylus. With a diamond point it is engraved." (Jer. 
    17:1). God writes down every act of oppression, bribery, and immorality. 
    "They never consider that I remember all their evil. Now their sins are all 
    around them; they are right in front of My face!" (Hos. 7:2). King 
    Belshazzar was carousing and drinking wine in bowls, and praising his gods 
    of gold and silver; but while he was <i>sinning</i>—God was <i>writing! </i>
    "At that very moment they saw the fingers of a human hand writing on the 
    plaster wall of the king's palace. The king himself saw the hand as it 
    wrote, and his face turned pale with fear. Such terror gripped him that his 
    knees knocked together and his legs gave way beneath him!" (Dan. 5:5-6). </p>
<p align="justify">We read of God's <i>book</i>: "The <i>books </i>were 
    opened" (Rev. 20:12); and we also read of his <i>bag</i>: "My transgression 
    is sealed up in a <i>bag</i>" (Job 14:17). This seems to allude to law 
    courts, where indictments against malefactors are sealed up in a bag, and 
    produced at the trials. When God shall open his <i>black book </i>in which 
    men's <i>names </i>are written, and his <i>bag </i>in which their <i>sins
    </i>are written—then their hearts will tremble, and their knees will knock 
    together in terror! Every <i>lie </i>a sinner tells, every <i>oath </i>he 
    swears, every <i>drunken </i>bout—God writes it down in his book of 
    remembrance! And woe to him—if the book is not crossed out with the blood of 
    Christ!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. See the mercifulness of God to his children—who blots 
    their <i>sins </i>out of his book of remembrance, and writes their <i>good 
    deeds </i>in his book of remembrance.</p></b></font> "I, even I, am he who blots 
    out your transgressions" (Isaiah 43:25). This is a metaphor borrowed from 
    the case of a creditor who takes his pen and blots out the debt owing to 
    him; so says God, I will "blot out your transgressions". Or as the Hebrew 
    has it, "I am blotting them out."
<p align="justify">God in forgiving sin, passes an act of <i>oblivion </i>or
    <i>amnesty</i>: "I will remember their sin no more!" (Jer. 31:34). God will 
    not upbraid his people with their former offences. We never read that when 
    Peter repented, that Christ upbraided him for his denial of his Lord. Oh, 
    the heavenly <i>indulgence </i>and <i>kindness </i>of God to his people! He 
    remembers everything about them—but their sins! He writes down their good 
    thoughts and speeches in a merciful book of remembrance; but their sins are 
    as if they had never been—they are carried into the land of oblivion!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Second Use: EXHORTATION.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">If God records our services—then let us record his 
    mercies. Let us have our book of remembrance. A Christian should keep two 
    books always beside him; one to write his <i>sins </i>in—that he may be 
    humble; the other to write his <i>mercies </i>in—that he may be thankful. 
    David had his book of remembrance: "David appointed some of the Levites to 
    be ministers before the ark of the Lord, to give thanks and praise to Him." 
    (1 Chron. 16:4). We should keep a book to record God's mercies—though I 
    think it will be hard to get a book big enough to hold them! At such and 
    such a time we were in straitened circumstances—and God supplied us; at 
    another time under sadness of spirit—and God dropped in the oil of gladness; 
    at another near death—and God miraculously restored us. If God is mindful of 
    what we do for him—shall not we be mindful of what he does for us! God's 
    mercies, like jewels, are too good to be lost! Get a book of remembrance!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Third Use: COMFORT. </p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It is comfort to the godly—in the case of friends 
    forgetting them.</p></b></font> Joseph did Pharaoh's cupbearer a kindness—"Yet 
    the cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him." (Gen. 40:23). It is 
    only too usual to remember <i>injuries</i>—and forget <i>kindnesses</i>; but 
    God has a book of remembrance where he writes down all his old friends. Near 
    relations may sometimes be forgetful. The tender mother may forget her 
    infant: "Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion 
    on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!" (Isa. 
    49:15). A mother may sooner forget her child—than God be forgetful. Christ 
    our high priest, has the names of the saints written upon his breastplate, 
    and all their good deeds written in his book of memorials! Let this be a <i>
    remedy </i>to revive the hearts of God's people; though friends may blot you 
    out of their mind—yet God will not blot you out of his book!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. This is consolation to the godly—the Lord keeps a book 
    of remembrance for this end—that he may at the last day make a public and 
    solemn mention of all the good which his saints have done.</p></b></font> God 
    will open his book of records and say, "Then the King will say to those on 
    His right—Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom 
    prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you 
    gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink; 
    I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was 
    sick and you took care of Me; I was in prison and you visited Me." (Matt. 
    25:34-36).
<p align="justify">God will make known all the memorable and pious actions 
    of his people before men and angels! He will say, "Here are those who have 
    prayed and wept for sin; here are those who have been advocates for my 
    truth; here are those who have laid to heart my dishonors, and have mourned 
    for what they could not reform. These are my renowned ones, my <i>Hephzibahs—</i>in 
    whom my soul delights!" (Isaiah 62:4).</p>
<p align="justify">What a glorious thing will this be—to have God express 
    the high praise of his saints! When Alexander saw the sepulcher of Achilles, 
    he cried out "O happy Achilles, who had Homer to set forth your praise!" 
    What an honor will it be to have the names and worthy deeds of the saints 
    mentioned, and <i>God himself </i>to be the herald to proclaim their 
    praises! (2 Cor. 4:5).</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    C. The third good effect of the saints piety—was that God REWARDED it.</p></b></font> 
    "And they shall be mine, says the Lord Almighty, in that day when I make up 
    my jewels!" (Mal. 3:17). The reward is threefold.
<p align="justify">1. God's <b>owning </b>them: "They shall he <i>mine</i>, 
    says the Lord Almighty."</p>
<p align="justify">2. God's <b>honoring </b>them: "In that day when I make 
    up my <i>jewels</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">3. God's <b>sparing </b>them: "I will <i>spare </i>them, 
    as a man spares his own son that serves him."</p>
<p align="justify">Note first, <b>the Person speaking</b>, "the Lord 
    Almighty". This is too great a word to he passed by in silence. God is often 
    in Scripture styled, "the Lord Almighty" (Psalm 46:11; Isaiah 1:24); that 
    is, he is the Supreme General, and Commander of all armies and forces, and 
    gives victory to whom he will.</p>
<p align="justify">Question: <i>Why is this name, "the Lord Almighty", given 
    to God?</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer: Not because God needs any others to protect 
    himself, or suppress his enemies. Earthly princes have armies to defend them 
    from danger—but God needs none to help him: he can fight without an army. 
    God puts strength into all armies. Other captains may give their soldiers <i>
    armor</i>; they cannot give them <i>strength</i>; but God does: "You have 
    girded me with <i>strength </i>for the battle" (Psalm 18:39). Why then is 
    God said to have armies—if he needs them not?</p>
<p align="justify">Firstly, it is to set forth his sovereign power and 
    grandeur; all armies and regiments are under his command.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, it is to show us that though God can effect all 
    things by himself; yet in his wisdom he often uses the <i>agency of the 
    creature </i>to bring to pass his will and purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">Question: <i>What are these hosts or armies, of which God 
    is the sovereign Lord?</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer 1: God has an army in <b>heaven</b>—<i>angels </i>
    and <i>archangels</i>: "I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the 
    armies of heaven around him" (1 Kings 22:19). By the <i>armies of heaven</i>, 
    is meant the angels; they, being spirits, are a powerful army: "You his 
    angels, which excel in strength" (Psalm 103:20). We read of one angel who 
    destroyed in one night "a hundred and eighty-five thousand men" (2 Kings 
    19:35). If one angel destroyed such a vast army, what can a whole <i>legion
    </i>of angels do? A legion consisted of six thousand, six hundred and sixty 
    six. How many of these legions go to make up the heavenly host! (Dan. 7:10).</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>stars </i>are God's army too (Deut. 4:19). These 
    were set in battalions and fought against God's enemies: "The stars in their 
    courses fought against Sisera" (Judg. 5:20). That is, the stars charged like 
    an army, raising storms and tempests by their influences, and so destroying 
    the whole army of Sisera.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2: God has armies upon <b>earth</b>, both rational 
    and irrational. The <i>rational </i>are armies of men. These are under God's 
    command and conduct. They do not stir without his warrant. The Lord has the 
    managing of all military affairs. Not a stroke is struck—but God orders it! 
    Not a bullet flies—but God directs it! As for the <i>irrational</i> armies, 
    God can raise an army of <i>flies</i>, as he did against King Pharaoh (Exod. 
    8:24); an army of <i>worms</i>, as he did against King Herod (Acts 12:23). 
    Oh, what a Lord is here—who has so many armies under his authority!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First use of the doctrine: EXHORTATION.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Let us dread this Lord Almighty! </p></b></font>We fear 
    men who are in power, and is not that God to be adored and feared, who does 
    all thing at his good pleasure? "All the peoples of the earth are regarded 
    as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples 
    of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him—What have you 
    done?" (Dan. 4:35). 
<p align="justify">His <b>power </b>is as large as his <b>will</b>. "What 
    his soul desires—that he does" (Job 23:13). God is a sovereign power over 
    all. "He pours contempt upon princes" (Job 12:21). He threw the proud angels 
    to hell. God can with a word, unpin the wheels and break the axle of the 
    creation. God's power is a glorious power (Col. 1:11). And in this it 
    appears glorious—it is never consumed or exhausted. Men, while they <i>
    exercise </i>their strength, <i>weaken </i>it. "Have you never heard or 
    understood? Don't you know that the Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator 
    of all the earth? He never grows faint or weary." (Isaiah 40:28). "I will 
    use up My arrows against them." (Deut. 32:23) Though God "uses up his 
    arrows" upon his enemies—yet he never exhausts his strength.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, then tremble before this Lord Almighty! Remember, O 
    hard-hearted sinner, how many ways God can be revenged on you! He can raise 
    an army of <i>diseases </i>against you in your body. He can arm every 
    creature against you, the dog, the boar, the elephant. He can arm conscience 
    against you, as he did against Spira—making him a terror to himself. Oh, 
    dread this Lord Almighty.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If God is the Lord Almighty—let us take heed of 
    hardening our hearts against God. </p></b></font>It was the saying of Pompey 
    that with one stamp of his <i>foot—</i>he could raise all Italy up in arms. 
    God can with a <i>word—</i>raise all the militia of heaven and earth against 
    us, and shall we dare affront him! "Who has hardened himself against him, 
    and has prospered?" (Job 9:4). Such as live in the open breach of God's 
    commandments, harden their hearts against God; they raise a war against 
    heaven! "He has stretched out his hand against God and has arrogantly 
    opposed the Almighty!" (Job 15:25). Like warriors who muster up all the 
    forces they can, to fight with their antagonists, so the sinner hardens and 
    strengthens himself against Jehovah: "He runs upon him, even on his neck, 
    upon the thick bosses of his bucklers" (verse 26). <i>Bucklers </i>anciently 
    had one great boss in the middle with a sharp spike in it to wound the 
    adversary. The grossly wicked sinner encounters the God of heaven—and runs 
    upon the thick bosses of his fury, which will wound mortally. Who ever 
    hardened himself against God—and prospered! Will men go to measure arms with 
    God! Do you have an arm like God’s?" (Job 40:9).
<p align="justify">God is <i>almighty</i>—and therefore can hurt his 
    enemies; and he is <i>invisible</i>—therefore they cannot hurt him. Who can 
    fight with a spirit? God will be too hard for his enemies in the long run: 
    "God will smash the heads of his enemies, crushing the skulls of those who 
    love their guilty ways!" (Psalm 68:21). </p>
<p align="justify">How easily can God chastise rebels! "The Lord looked down 
    on the Egyptian forces from the pillar of fire and cloud, and threw them 
    into confusion" (Exod. 14:24). It need cost God no more to destroy his 
    proudest adversaries than a <i>look</i>—a cast of the eye! It is better to 
    be prostrate at God's feet, and to meet him with tears in our eyes—rather 
    than weapons in our hands! We overcome God, not by <i>resistance</i>—but by
    <i>repentance!</i></p>

    Laban had <i>power </i>to do hurt—but no <i>heart</i>. When Balak called 
    upon Balaam to curse Israel, God so dispirited Balaam that he could not 
    discharge his thunderbolt: "How shall I curse, those whom God has not 
    cursed?" (Num. 23:8). He had a good mind to curse—but God held him back.

    But God made a <i>fish </i>to be a <i>ship, </i>in which he sailed safely to 
    shore. Paul got to land by the breaking of the ship (Acts 27:44). God can 
    make the adverse party do his work; he can cause divisions among the

    A. God Rewards His People by OWNING Them</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">I now come to the REWARD itself, the first part of which 
    is—God's <b>owning </b>them, "They shall be <i>mine</i>." I take the sense 
    of it to be, "They shall be mine in covenant." "I entered into a covenant 
    with you—and you became mine!" (Ezek. 16:8; Isa 43:1). This is no small 
    blessing—to be in covenant with God. Therefore, when God told Abraham that 
    he would enter into covenant with him, Abraham fell on his face (Gen. 17:3), 
    as being amazed that the great God should bestow such a signal favor upon 
    him. God never entered into covenant with the angels when they fell—but he 
    proclaims himself God in covenant with believers, "They shall be mine." This 
    covenant enriched with <i>free grace, </i>is a better covenant than that 
    which was made with <i>Adam in innocence</i>, for:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The <i>least </i>failing would have made the first 
    covenant null and void—but <i>many </i>failings do not invalidate the 
    covenant of grace. I grant the least sin makes a trespass upon the 
    covenant—but it does not <i>cancel </i>it. Every failing in the marital 
    relation, does not break the marriage bond.</p>
<p align="justify">2. If the first covenant was violated, the sinner had <i>
    no remedy</i>; all doors of hope were shut. But the new covenant allows of a 
    remedy. It provides a Surety, "Jesus the mediator of the new covenant" (Heb. 
    12:24).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First use: INFORMATION.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">See the amazing goodness of God to his people, to enter 
    into covenant with them and say, "You are mine!" "He has made with me an 
    everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure!" (2 Sam. 23:5). The 
    first covenant stood upon the delicate foundation of works. Adam had no 
    sooner a stock of original righteousness to trade with, than he broke the 
    covenant. But this covenant of grace is confirmed with God's decree, and 
    rests upon two mighty pillars—the oath of God, and the <i>blood </i>of God. 
    That you may see how great a privilege it is to be owned by the Lord 
    federally, consider:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. If we are in covenant with God, and he says to us "You 
    are mine"—then <i>all that is in God is ours!</i></p></b></font><i> </i>A person 
    falling on hard times and then marrying a king, has a share in all the crown 
    revenues. God having entered into a near relation with us and saying, "You 
    are mine"—we have a share in his rich revenues! The Lord says to every 
    believer, as the King of Israel said to the King of Syria, "I am yours, and 
    all that I have is yours!" (1 Kings 20:4). My <i>wisdom </i>shall be yours 
    to teach you, my <i>holiness </i>shall be yours to sanctify you, my <i>mercy
    </i>shall be yours to save you! What richer dowry—than Deity! God is a whole 
    ocean of blessedness. If there is enough in him to fill the angels—then 
    surely, he has enough to fill us!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If God says to us, "You are mine"—then he will have a
    <i>tender care </i>for us.</p></b></font> "Cast all your care upon Him, because
    <i>He cares for you!" </i>(1 Pet. 5:7). God, to show his tender solicitude 
    towards Israel, bore them "on eagles wings" (Exod. 19:4). The eagle carries 
    her young ones upon her wing to defend them; the arrow must first shoot 
    through the old eagle, before it can touch her young ones. A mother's care 
    is seen in leading a child, so that it may not fall. Such is God's care: "It 
    was I who taught Israel how to walk, leading him along by the hand." (Hos. 
    11:3). We may argue from the lesser to the greater, that if God takes care 
    of the lowest insects and animals which creep upon the earth, much more will 
    he take care of his covenant saints. He is still contriving and planning for 
    their good. If they <i>wander </i>out of the way—he guides them; if they <i>
    stumble</i>—he holds them by the hand; if they <i>fall</i>—he raises them; 
    if they become <i>dull</i>—he quickens them by his Spirit; if they are <i>
    obstinate</i>—he draws them with cords of love; if they are <i>sad</i>—he 
    comforts them with his promises.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If God says to us, "You are mine"—then he will 
    entirely love us!</p></b></font> "I have loved you with an everlasting love" 
    (Jer. 31:3). The Lord may give a man riches—and not love him; his prosperity 
    may be as Israel's quails—sauced with God's wrath (Num. 11:32-33). But when 
    God says, "You are mine"—he cannot but love. Everyone loves his own. If God 
    has any love better than another—his covenant people shall have it; he will 
    extract the essence of his love for them; he loves them as he loves Christ! 
    (John 17:23).
<b>
<p align="justify">4. If God says to us, "You are mine"—then he will not 
    allow us to be in need. </p></b>Believers are not only of God's family—but of 
    Christ's body; and will the Head let the body starve? "Truly you shall be 
    fed" (Psalm 37:3). God has not promised <i>dainties</i>; he will not satisfy 
    his people's <i>lusts</i>—but he will supply their <i>needs</i>. If the bill 
    of fare should be restricted, what they lack in worldly comforts, they shall 
    have in spiritual blessing: "He shall bless your bread, and your water" 
    (Exod. 23:25). God will rather work a miracle than that any of his children 
    shall famish. The raven is so unnatural that she will hardly feed her 
    young—yet she became a <i>caterer </i>and brought food to the prophet 
    Elijah.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. If God says to us, "You are mine"—then we have great 
    freedoms!</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. We are freed from the revenging wrath of God! </p></b>
</font>We are not free from God's anger as a <i>Father</i>—but as a <i>Judge</i>. 
    God will not pour his <i>vindictive </i>justice upon us. Christ has drunk 
    the red wine of God's wrath upon the cross—that believers may not taste a 
    drop of it!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. We are freed from the predominant reign of sin. </p></b>
</font>"Sin shall not have dominion over you" (Romans 6:14). Though 
    believers are not freed from the <i>indwelling </i>of sin, nor from <i>
    combat </i>with it—yet they are freed from its <i>imperious </i>command. As 
    it it said of those beasts in Daniel, "They had their dominion taken 
    away—yet their lives were prolonged for a season" (Dan. 7:12), so sin <i>
    lives </i>in the regenerate, but its <i>domination </i>is taken away. And to 
    be thus freed from the jurisdiction, power, and tyranny of sin—is no small 
    blessing! A wicked man is at the command of sin, as the donkey at the 
    command of the driver. The curse of Ham is upon him, "a servant of servants 
    shall he be" (Gen. 9:25). He is a slave to his <i>lusts</i>, and a slave to
    <i>Satan! </i>Oh, what a privilege it is—to have one's neck out of the 
    devil's yoke!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. We are freed from the accusations of conscience. </p></b>
</font>The <i>worm of conscience </i>is part of the torment of hell. But, 
    God being our God, we are freed from the clamors of this hellish fury. 
    Conscience sprinkled with Christ's blood speaks <i>peace!</i> A good 
    conscience, like the bee, gives honey. It is like the golden pot which had
    <i>manna </i>in it (2 Cor. 1:12).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. If God says to us, "You are mine"—then we shall he his 
    forever!</p></b></font> "This God is our God, forever and ever" (Psalm 48:14). 
    You cannot say that you have <i>health</i>—and you shall have it forever. 
    You cannot say that you have a child—and you shall have it forever. But if 
    God is your God—you <i>shall </i>have him forever! The covenant of grace is 
    a royal charter, and this is the happiness of it—it is made for eternity! <i>
    Justification </i>is never rescinded. The covenant between God and his 
    people shall never be broken off. How false therefore is the opinion of <i>
    falling from grace! </i>Shall any whom God makes his own by federal union 
    fall finally? Indeed if salvation has no better pillar to rest upon than <i>
    man's will </i>(as the Arminians hold) no wonder if there is falling away; 
    but a Christian's stability in grace, is built upon a surer basis, namely, 
    God's "everlasting (or inviolable) covenant" (Isaiah 55:3). Once in 
    Christ—forever in Christ. A star may sooner fall out of its place—than a 
    true believer be plucked away from God! "None of them is lost" (John 17:12). 
    "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish—ever! No one will 
    snatch them out of My hand." (John 10:28)
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. If God says to us, "You are mine"—then he will take us 
    up to himself at death!</p></b></font> Death breaks the union between the <i>
    body </i>and the soul—but perfects the union between <i>God </i>and the 
    soul. This is the emphasis of heaven's glory—to be forever with God. What is 
    the joy of the blessed—but to have a clear, transparent sight of God, and to 
    be in the sweet and soft embraces of his love forever! This has made the 
    saints desire death, as the bride her wedding day! "I have the desire to 
    depart and be with Christ—which is <i>far better!" </i>(Phil. 1:23). "Lead 
    me, Lord, to that glory", said a holy man, "a glimpse whereof I have seen as 
    in a glass darkly."

<p align="justify">Second Use: COMFORT.</p>

<p align="justify">Let this be for the consolation of the saints. There is a 
    covenant union between God and them. God is theirs—and they are his! "They

    show the debt book, crossed out in his blood. It was a saying of Bucer, "I 
    am Christ's, and the devil has nothing to do with me."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. This is comfort, in respect of poverty.</p></b></font> 
    Believers are married to the King of heaven—and all that is in God is 
    theirs! A philosopher comforted himself with this, that though he had no 
    music or vine trees—yet he had the household gods with him. So we, though we 
    have not the vine or fig tree—yet if God is ours and we are his—this creates 
    joy in the most impoverished condition! And that which may raise the comfort 
    of the godly higher, and cause a jubilation of spirit, is that shortly God 
    will own his people before all the world, and say,<i> "These are mine!"</i> 
    At present the elect are not known: "It does not yet appear what we <i>shall
    </i>be" (1 John 3:2). The saints are like kings in disguise; but how will 
    their hearts leap for joy—when God shall pronounce that word,<i> "These are

    bloody sinner, is held forth as a pattern of mercy. Some of the Jews who had 
    a hand in crucifying Christ—yet had their sins forgiven!</p>
<p align="justify">2. Faith in the merit of Christ. Christ's blood is not

<p align="justify">Question: <i>In what sense are the saints, God's jewels?</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer 1: They are jewels for their <b>sparkling </b>

<p align="justify">Answer 2: The godly are jewels for their <b>scarcity</b>. 
    Diamonds are not common. Just so, the godly are scarce and rare. There are

    Queen Cleopatra had two jewels which contained half the price of a kingdom. 
    Thus the saints are jewels, for their <i>value</i>. God esteems them at a 
    high rate; he parted with his best jewel for them. Christ's precious blood 
    was shed to ransom these jewels!</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 4: The saints are jewels for their <b>adorning </b>

<p align="justify">1. </p></b></font>See the worth of the godly—they are God's 
    jewels—"a royal diadem in the hand of your God" (Isaiah 62:3). That is, they 
    are eminent above others, as a crown hung with jewels is a sign of the 
    highest state and honor. The saints are God's glory (Isaiah 46:13), as if 
    God's glory did lie in them.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. </p></b></font>See then that which may bring holiness into 
    repute, and make us desire to be godly. It casts a splendor upon us, and 
    makes God number us among his jewels! Some are loath to embrace godliness, 
    for fear it will be a stain on their reputation, and bring them out of favor 
    with great men. But you see how it raises a person's renown; it makes him 
    precious in God's sight—he is a jewel! Believers, on account of their 
    mystical union with Christ, have a preciousness above the angels! The angels 
    are morning <i>stars </i>(Job 38:7). Believers are clothed with the <i>sun
    </i>of righteousness (Rev. 12:1).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. </p></b></font>See the different opinion which God has—of 
    the godly and the wicked. The one he esteems <i>precious</i>, the other <i>
    vile</i>. "You are vile" (Nahum 1:14). This is spoken of King Sennacherib; 
    though he was by birth noble—yet he was by sin vile. The Hebrew word for <i>
    vile </i>signifies of <i>base esteem</i>. Though the wicked are high in 
    dignity and worldly grandeur, yet God slights them. A dunghill may be higher 
    than other ground—but it sends forth foul vapors: "They have all together 
    become <i>filthy</i>" (Psalm 14:3). In the original it is, "They have become
    <i>stinking</i>."
<p align="justify">The <b>wicked </b>are compared to <i>dogs </i>and <i>
    swine </i>(2 Pet. 2:22) and to <i>dross </i>(Ezek. 22:19). Dross is the 
    filth of the metal. Sinners are compared to <i>chaff </i>(Psalm 1:4). When a 
    wicked man dies—there is only a little chaff blown away! A sinner is the 
    most contemptible thing in the world; there is no worth in him while he 
    lives—and no loss of him when he dies! A sinner is worse than a toad or 
    serpent; a toad has nothing but what <i>God </i>has put into it—but a wicked 
    man has that which the <i>devil </i>has put into him: "Why has <i>Satan </i>
    filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?" (Acts 5:3).</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. </p></b></font>See what a high estimate we should set upon 
    the godly; they are jewels, they are the glory of the creation. They are 
    compared to <i>stars </i>for their beauty (Rev. 1:20), to <i>spice trees </i>
    for their perfume (Song of Sol. 4:14). They are the excellent of the earth 
    (Psalm 16:3). The Lord would soon destroy the earth—but that he has some of 
    his jewels in it.
<p align="justify">Prize the saints—though they are humbled with poverty. We 
    esteem a diamond, though it lies in the dust. "John's clothes were made of 
    camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was 
    locusts and wild honey"—yet he was a jewel (Matt. 11:9). He was the morning 
    star to usher in the Sun of righteousness into the world. The saints are 
    precious—for they are <i>God's lesser heaven! </i>(Isaiah 57:15).</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. </p></b></font>See the saints safety: they are God's 
    jewels, and he will take great care to preserve them. A man is careful that 
    he does not lose his jewels. God often gives his people a temporal 
    salvation. If a storm comes he knows how to hide his jewels. He hid a 
    hundred prophets in a cave (1 Kings 18:4). The angel is commanded, before he 
    poured his vial of curses on the earth, to <i>seal </i>the saints of God on 
    their foreheads (Rev. 7:3), which was a mark of safety. God will ensure the 
    spiritual safety of his jewels: "None of them is lost!" (John 17:12). "I 
    give them eternal life, and they will never perish—ever! No one will snatch 
    them out of My hand." (John 10:28)
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. </p></b></font>It the saints are God's jewels—then how 
    incensed and enraged will God be, against those who have abused his jewels! 
    Theodosius, counted them traitors who abused his statue. What will become of 
    those who persecute God's saints, and tread upon his jewels! It goes near to 
    God's heart—to see his jewels sprinkled with blood! What is done to them—the 
    Lord takes as done to himself: "Why do you persecute <i>me!" </i>(Acts 9:4). 
    When the <i>foot </i>was trod on—the <i>head </i>cried out! The saints are 
    God's royal diadem (Isaiah 62:3). Will a king endure to have his robes spat 
    upon, or his crown-royal thrown in the dust! "He reproved kings for their 
    sakes!" (Psalm 105:14).
<p align="justify">What monuments of God's vengeance were Nero, Diocletian, 
    Gardiner, and the rest of that persecuting tribe! "Shall not God avenge his 
    own elect! I tell you—he will avenge them speedily!" (Luke 18:7-8). 
    Persecutors stand in the place where all <i>God's arrows </i>fly! "He 
    ordains his arrows against the persecutors" (Psalm 7:13). That is a killing 
    Scripture: "The Lord will send a plague on all the nations that fought 
    against Jerusalem. Their people will become like walking corpses, their 
    flesh rotting away. Their eyes will shrivel in their sockets, and their 
    tongues will decay in their mouths!" (Zech. 14:12).</p>

<p align="justify">Here is <i>comfort </i>to the people of God, in case of 
    the world's disesteem of them<i>—God values them </i>as jewels! And his 
    judgment is according to truth (Rom. 2:2). The wicked have low thoughts of 
    the righteous. They beat down the price of these jewels as far as they can. 
    They think them but refuse. They disdain them, and load them with slanders 
    and invectives. The prophet Elijah was looked upon by Ahab as the "troubler 
    of Israel" (1 Kings 18:17), and Luther was called a "trumpet of rebellion". 
    Paul was judged "a pestilent fellow" (Acts 24:5). The wicked think that of 
    all things in the world, the saints may be best exterminated: "We have 
    become the <i>scum </i>of the earth, the <i>refuse </i>of the world" (1 Cor. 
    4:13).</p>
<p align="justify">But this is a great consolation to believers that, <i>low
    </i>as is the esteem the reprobate world has of them—yet God has <i>high </i>
    thoughts of them; he numbers them among his jewels! They are compared for 
    their <i>preciousness, </i>to gold and silver (Rev. 1:20). They are the <i>
    coins </i>and <i>medals </i>which bear God's own image! They are <i>princes
    </i>in all lands (Ps. 45:16). Christ engraves their names on his breast, as 
    the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on precious stones upon Aaron's 
    breastplate. God will give whole kingdoms to ransom his jewels (Isaiah 
    43:3). The wicked think the godly are not worthy to live in the world, "Rid 
    the earth of him! He's not fit to live!" (Acts 22:22) But God thinks the 
    world is not worthy of them "The world was not worthy of them." (Heb. 
    11:38). Hence it is, that God takes away his jewels so fast, and places them 
    in his heavenly treasury!</p>

<p align="justify">3. There is a time shortly coming when God will make up 
    his jewels. </p></b></font>"In that day when I make up my jewels".
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 1: What is meant by God's making up his jewels?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer: There is a difference between God's making <i>of
    </i>jewels—and his making <i>up </i>of jewels. God's making <i>of </i>jewels 
    is when he works grace in their hearts while on earth. What is God's making
    <i>up </i>of jewels? This implies two things.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Firstly, God's GATHERING his saints together.<i> </i></p></b>
    God's making up his jewels, implies his gathering his saints together. The 
    godly in this life are like scattered diamonds, they are <i>separated </i>
    from one another, being <i>dispersed </i>all over the world. But there is a 
    day coming when God will gather all his saints together, as one puts all his 
    pearls together on a string. There must be such a collection or gathering 
    together of God's scattered saints:
<p align="justify">1. From the near relation they have to all the persons of 
    the Trinity. God the <i>Father </i>has chosen these jewels and set them 
    apart for himself (Psalm 4:3), and will he lose any of his elect? They are 
    related to <i>Christ</i>—he has bought these jewels with his blood, and will 
    he lose his purchase? They are related to the Holy Spirit. He has sanctified 
    them. When they were a lump of sin, he made them his jewels; and when he has 
    bestowed cost on them, will he lose his cost? Will he not string these 
    pearls, and put them in his celestial cabinet?</p>
<p align="justify">2. There must be a gathering together of God's scattered 
    saints—from the prayer of Christ. It was Christ's prayer to his Father, that 
    he would make up his jewels, that he would gather together his pearls, that 
    they might be with him in heaven! "That they may be with me—where I am!" 
    (John 17:24). Christ will not be <i>content</i>—until all the elect jewels 
    lie together in his bosom. He does not think himself <i>complete</i>—until 
    all his saints are with him!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use: Here is a SOVEREIGN COMFORT to the people of God in 
    two cases.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. In case of <b>scattering</b>. God's people are 
    scattered up and down in the world; and, which is worse, these jewels lie 
    among <i>rubbish</i>—they dwell among the <i>wicked!</i> "Woe is me that I 
    dwell in the tents of Kedar" (Psalm 120:5). Kedar was Ishmael's son. "Woe is 
    me", says David, "that I live with an Ishmael-brood!" The wicked are still 
    molesting the righteous. God's jewels lie scattered among the vile! But here 
    is the comfort—that shortly God will gather his people from among the 
    wicked—he will make up his jewels—and all his precious jewels shall lie with 
    him in bliss!</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is comfort in case of <b>dividing</b>. God's people 
    are now divided; their <i>love </i>for one another is very little. They 
    often look suspiciously upon one another. These divisions are <i>flaws </i>
    in God's diamonds! <i>Discord among Christians </i>brings a reproach upon 
    true religion, advances Satan's kingdom, and hinders the growth of grace! 
    But this is comfort—God will shortly make up his jewels—he will so <i>gather
    </i>his saints together—that he will <i>unite </i>them together. They shall 
    be all of one heart (Acts 2:46). What a happy time it will be—when the 
    saints shall be as so many <i>pearls upon one string</i>—and shall accord 
    together in a blessed unity!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, God's making up his jewels also implies his 
    PERFECTING his saints.</p></b> A thing is said to be <i>made up</i>—when it is 
    perfected. You make up a <i>garment</i>, when you perfect it. You make up a
    <i>watch</i>, when you put all the wheels and pins in perfect order. So 
    God's making up his <i>jewels</i>, signifies his <i>perfecting </i>them. The 
    godly in this life are imperfect. They cast but a faint luster of holiness; 
    they receive but "the first fruits of the Spirit" (Rom. 8:23), that is,<i> a 
    small measure of grace. </i>The first fruits under the law were but a <i>
    handful</i>, compared to the whole vintage.
<p align="justify">The consideration of this may humble us. We are God's 
    jewels—yet we are now imperfect. Our <i>knowledge </i>is chequered with 
    ignorance (1 Cor 13:5). Our <i>love </i>to God is feeble. Behold here, <i>
    flaws </i>in the diamond. This may take down our topsail of pride—to 
    consider how flawed and incomplete we are. But when God shall make up his 
    jewels, and <i>perfect </i>his saints—it will be a glorious time! This 
    brings me to the second question.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 2: What is that day—<i>when</i> God will make up 
    his jewels?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Firstly, God makes up his jewels at the day of DEATH. </p></b>
</font>Then he makes the saints' graces, perfect. For this reason the 
    departed saints are called "just men made <i>perfect" </i>(Heb. 12:23). Sin 
    so mixes with, and dwells within a Christian—that he cannot write a copy of 
    holiness without blotting it. Grace, though it abates sin—yet it does not 
    abolish corruption. But at death God makes up his jewels—he perfects the 
    graces of his people. Will not that be a blessed time, never to have a vain 
    thought again, never to be within the sight of a temptation, or the fear of 
    a relapse?
<p align="justify">This, I think, may make death desirable to the godly; 
    then the Lord will complete the graces of His children! They shall be as 
    holy as they desire to be, and as holy as God would have them to be! How 
    will God's jewels sparkle--when they shall be without flaws! In that day of 
    death when God makes up his jewels, the saints <i>light </i>will be clear, 
    and their <i>love </i>will be perfect!</p>
<p align="justify">Their <b>light </b>will be clear. They shall be so 
    divinely irradiated, that they shall know the "deep things of God". They 
    shall in this sense be "as the angels" (Matt. 22:30). Their faculty of 
    thought shall be raised higher and made more capacious! Through the crystal 
    glass of Christ's human nature, the saints shall have glorious transparent 
    sights of God! They shall know as they are known (1 Cor. 13:12); a riddle 
    too mysterious for us mortals, if not for angels, to expound!</p>
<p align="justify">In that day the saints <b>love </b>will be perfect. Love 
    is the queen of the graces—it outlives all the other graces. In this life, 
    our love to God is lukewarm and sometimes frozen. A believer weeps that he 
    can love God no more. But at the day of death, when God makes up his 
    jewels—then the saints' love shall be seraphic! The spark of love shall be 
    blown up into a pure flame! The saints shall love God—as much as they 
    desire! They shall love him superlatively and without defect—they shall be 
    made up wholly of love. Oh, blessed day of death! When God shall make up his 
    jewels, the saints graces shall shine forth in their meridian splendor!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, God makes up his jewels at the day of the 
    RESURRECTION.</p></b></font> Then he makes the saints <b>bodies </b>perfect. 
    These, like sparkling diamonds, shall shine in glory! At the resurrection 
    God is said to change the bodies of the saint, "He will take these weak 
    mortal bodies of ours and change them into glorious bodies like his own!" 
    (Phil. 3:21). How will he change them? Not that they shall be other bodies 
    than they were before. The <i>substance </i>of their bodies shall not be 
    changed—but the <i>qualities</i>. As wool, when it is dyed into a purple 
    color, is not altered in the substance—but in the quality, and is made more 
    illustrious. Just so, God in making up his jewels, will cause a greater 
    resplendency in the saints bodies than before.
<p align="justify">When God makes up the jewels of the saints <i>bodies </i>
    at the resurrection, <i>they shall be perfect in four ways:</i></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In amiability or sweetness of beauty. </p></b></font>Here 
    the bodies of the righteous are often deformed. Leah has her weak eves, and 
    Barzillai has his lameness; but at the resurrection the bodies of the saints 
    shall be of unspotted loveliness. And no wonder, for they shall be made like 
    Christ's glorious body (Phil. 3:21).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2.</p></b></font> When God at the resurrection makes up the 
    jewels of the saints bodies, <font color="#b07050"><b>they shall have 
    perfection of parts. </b></font>Their bodies in this world may be maimed and 
    disfigured; but in the day of the resurrection they shall have all the parts 
    of their bodies restored (Acts 3:21). Such as have lost an eye, shall have 
    their eye again; such as lack a leg or an arm, shall have their arm again.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. </p></b></font>When God makes up the jewels of the saints 
    bodies at the resurrection, <font color="#b07050"><b>they shall be swift and 
    lively in their motion. </b></font>Here on earth, the bodies of the saints 
    move heavily—but <i>then </i>they shall be sprightly, and move rapidly from 
    one place to another. Here the body is a <i>weight</i>; in heaven it shall 
    be a <i>wing!
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. </p></b></font>When God makes up the jewels of the saints 
    bodies, <font color="#b07050"><b>they shall be immortal. </b></font>The body 
    once glorified, shall never be subject to death! "For our perishable earthly 
    bodies must be transformed into heavenly bodies that will never die!" (1 
    Cor. 15:53). Heaven is a healthy climate; no death-bell goes there. This 
    mortal body shall put on immortality.
<p align="justify">Let us labor to he in the number of God's jewels, that 
    when the Lord shall make up his jewels, he may perfect our <i>souls </i>and
    <i>bodies </i>in glory</p>
<p align="justify">Question: <i>How shall we know that we are in the number 
    of God's jewels?</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer: Have we holiness? "But we are washed—but we are 
    sanctified" (1 Cor. 6:11). We are not God's jewels by<i> creation</i>—but <i>
    regeneration</i>. If holiness sparkles in us—it is a sign we are God's 
    jewels; and then when God comes to make up his jewels, he will put glory 
    upon our souls and bodies forever!</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    C. God Rewards His People by SPARING Them</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The third part of the saints reward is God's sparing 
    them: "I will spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who 
    serves him." The Hebrew word to spare signifies to use clemency. In this 
    phrase, there is less said—and more intended. "I will spare them", that is, 
    "I will deal with them as a father does with his son. The kind of tenderness 
    that a father shows to his child, the same will I show to those that fear 
    me."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine: God will deal with those who fear him—as a 
    compassionate father does with his dutiful son.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Two things are in this proposition:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. That God is a Father. </p></b></font>He is a father by <i>
    creation</i>. He has given us our being: "Have not we all one father? Has 
    not one God created us?" (Mal. 2:20). God is also a father by <i>election</i>: 
    he has chosen out a certain number, to be his children (Eph. 1:4). And God 
    is a father by special <i>grace</i>: he stamps his <i>impress of holiness
    </i>upon men (Col. 3:10). <i>All God's children resemble him—though some are 
    more like him than others.
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. That God will deal with those that fear him, as a 
    compassionate father does with his dutiful son.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">A. God will accept them, as a father does his son. If the 
    child only lisps and can hardly speak plainly, the father takes all in good 
    part. So God, as a father, will accept what his children do in sincerity: 
    "There will I require your offerings ... I will accept you with your sweet 
    savor" (Ezek. 20:40-41).</p>
<p align="justify">B. To such as fear God, he will be full of pity to them, 
    as a tender father is to his son. There are in God, affections of compassion 
    and <i>affections </i>of <i>delight</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Affections of <b>compassion</b>. A father feels for his 
    child. God has great pity and tenderness towards his children. (Isaiah 
    63:15). The compassion of parents are <i>steel </i>and <i>marble </i>
    compared with God's—"the <i>tender </i>mercy of our God" (Luke 1:78). In the 
    Greek it is "the affections of mercy". These affections make God sympathize 
    with his children in misery. He is touched in their wounds: "As a father 
    pities his children so the Lord pities those who fear him" (Psalm 103:13 ).</p>
<p align="justify">In God are also affections of <b>delight</b>. How dearly 
    did Jacob love Benjamin! His life was bound up in him (Gen. 44:30). All the 
    affections of parents come from God. They are but a drop of his ocean, a 
    spark of his flame. God's love is a love that "passes knowledge!" (Eph. 
    3:19). The saints cannot love their own souls, so entirely as God loves 
    them. In particular,</p>
<p align="justify">a. God loves the <i>persons </i>of his children; they are 
    the apple of his eye (Zech. 2:8). He engraves them upon the palms of his 
    hands (Isaiah 49:16). This alludes to those who carry about them, engraved 
    on the stone of their ring, the picture of some dear friend whom they 
    entirely love.</p>
<p align="justify">b. God loves the <i>places </i>his children were born in, 
    the better for their sakes: "God loves the gates of Zion" (Psalm 87:2); 
    "This and that man was born in her" (verse 5); that is, "this and that 
    believer". God loves the very ground his children walk upon. Why was Judea, 
    the ancient seat of Israel, called "a delightsome land" (Mal. 3:12)? Not so 
    much delightful for the <i>fruit </i>growing in it—as for the <i>saints </i>
    living in it.</p>
<p align="justify">c. God so loves his children, that he charges the great 
    ones of the world upon pain of death, not to hurt them. They are sacred to 
    him. "He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings: Do 
    not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm" (Psalm 105:14-15). By 
    "anointed" are meant such as have the anointing of the Spirit (1 John 2:20).</p>
<p align="justify">d. God delights in his children's <b>company</b>, he 
    loves to see their faces, "Let Me see your face, let Me hear your voice; for 
    your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely." (Song of Sol. 2:14) If but 
    two or three of God's children meet and pray together, God will he sure to 
    make one of the company: "There am I in the midst of them!" (Matt. 18:20).</p>
<p align="justify">e. God so loves his children that his <b>eye </b>is never 
    off them: "The eye of the Lord is upon those who fear him" (Psalm 33:18).
    </p>
<p align="justify">Question: <i>But is this such a privilege—to have God's 
    eye upon his children? God's eye is upon the wicked too.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer: it is one kind of eye that the <i>Judge </i>casts 
    upon the malefactor; and another that the <i>Prince </i>casts upon his 
    favorite. God's eye upon the wicked is an eye of <i>vengeance</i>—but his 
    eye upon his children is an eye of <i>benediction</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">f. God sets a continual <b>guard </b>about his children, 
    to preserve them from danger. He hides them in his pavilion (Psalm 27:5). He 
    covers them with the golden feathers of his protection (Psalm 91:4). No 
    prince goes so well guarded, as God's child, for he has a guard of <i>angels
    </i>about him. The angels are a numerous guard: "The mountain was full of 
    horses and chariots of fire" (2 Kings 6:17). Those horses and chariots of 
    fire were the angels of God, gathered in the manner of a huge army to defend 
    the prophet Elijah.</p>
<p align="justify">g. God clothes his children in rich <b>garments</b>: "Her 
    clothing is of wrought gold" (Psalm 45:13). Jacob loved his son Joseph and 
    gave him a finer coat to wear than the rest of his brethren: "He made him a 
    coat of many colors" (Gen. 37:3). God loves his children and gives them a 
    finer coat, more finely woven, a coat of diverse colors. It is</p>
<p align="justify">partly made of Christ's righteousness, and partly of 
    inherent holiness (Rev. 19:8).</p>
<p align="justify">h. Such is God's love that he thinks nothing too good for 
    his children! He enriches them with the upper and lower springs; he gives 
    them the finest of the wheat, and honey out of the rock; he makes them a 
    feast of fat things (Isaiah 25:6). He gives them the body and blood of his 
    Son, and delights to see his children spreading themselves as olive plants 
    round about his table (Psalm 128:3).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. God will receive the PETITIONS of those who fear 
    him—as a tender father receives his son's petitions. </p></b></font>They may 
    come boldly to the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16). If they come for pardon of 
    sin, or strength against temptation, God will not deny them. Three things 
    may cause boldness in prayer—the saints have a Father to pray to, the Spirit 
    to help them to pray, and Jesus Christ as their Advocate to present their 
    prayers.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. On such as are fearers of God, God will bestow an 
    inheritance, as a father does upon his son. </p></b></font>This inheritance is 
    no less than a kingdom! (Luke 12:32). In it are gates of pearl, rivers of 
    pleasure; and (which is to be noted as a difference between God's settling 
    an inheritance on his children, and an earthly father's settling an 
    inheritance) a son cannot enjoy the inheritance until his father is dead; 
    but every adopted child of God may at once enjoy both the inheritance and 
    the father, because God is both <i>father </i>and <i>inheritance! </i>(Gen. 
    15).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. With such as are fearers of God, God will pass by many 
    infirmities.</p></b></font> That is what is meant by this expression in the 
    text, "I will spare them as a man spares his own son." What a wonder is 
    this—that God did not spare the angels (2 Pct. 2:4)! No, he did not spare 
    his natural Son (Rom. 8:32). Yet he will spare his adopted sons! "I will 
    spare, them, I will not use extremity as I might—but pass by many 
    aberrations."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Caution:</p></b></font> It is not that the sins of God's 
    children are hidden from him—but such is his paternal clemency that he is 
    pleased to bear with many frailties in his children. He spares them as a 
    father spares his son. How often do God's people grieve his Spirit by the 
    neglect of spiritual watchfulness, or the loss of their first love; but God 
    spares them! Israel provoked God with their murmurings—but he used fatherly 
    indulgence towards them (Psalm 78:38; Neh. 9:17).
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First Use: INFORMATION.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. From this word, "I will spare them as a man spares his 
    son", take notice that even the best need <i>sparing</i></p></b></font>. "If 
    you, Lord, should mark iniquities—who shall stand?" (Psalm 130:3). The 
    Papists speak of <i>merits</i>—but how can we merit—when our best services 
    are so defective that we need sparing! How can these two stand together, our 
    meriting and God's sparing? What will become of us without sparing mercy? We 
    need to pray as Nehemiah, "Remember me, O my God, concerning this also—and 
    spare me according to the greatness of your mercy!" (Neh. 13:22). Let us fly 
    to this asylum, "Lord, spare us as a father spares his son!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. See God's different dealing with the godly and the 
    wicked.</p></b></font> The Lord will not spare the wicked: "I will not pity, nor 
    spare, nor have mercy—but destroy them!" (Jer. 13:14). It is sad when the 
    prisoner begs of the judge to spare him—but the judge will show him no 
    favor. God's cup of wrath is <i>unmixed! </i>(Rev. 14:10). Yet it is said to 
    be <i>mixed</i>. The cup of wrath God gives the wicked is <i>mixed </i>with 
    all sorts of punishments. But in this sense it is <i>unmixed</i>— it is 
    without the least drop of mercy in it! (Psalm 78:45-51). God for a while 
    reprieves men—but <i>forbearance </i>is not <i>forgiveness</i>. Though God 
    spares his children—yet obdurate sinners shall feel the weight of his wrath!
    
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If the Lord spares his people as a father does his 
    son—then they should serve him as a son does his father.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. They should serve him WILLINGLY. </p></b></font>"Serve Him 
    with a whole heart and a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and 
    understands the intention of every thought!" (1 Chron. 28:9). Cain's 
    sacrifice was rejected, because he brought it grudgingly and against his 
    will. It was rather the <i>paying of a tax </i>than a free-will offering. 
    The best obedience is that which is voluntary, as that is the best honey 
    which drops from the honeycomb. God sometimes accepts of willingness without 
    the work (1 Kings 8:18)—but never of the work without willingness.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. They should serve God UNIVERSALLY.</p></b></font> True 
    obedience is universal; it observes one command as well as another; it 
    fulfills <i>difficult </i>duties and <i>dangerous </i>duties. As the needle 
    points the way that the magnet draws, so a gracious heart inclines to those 
    things which the Word teaches (Luke 1:6). It is the note of a hypocrite to 
    be partial in obedience; some <i>sin </i>he will indulge (2 Kings 5:18), 
    some <i>duty </i>he will dispense with; his obedience is lame on one foot.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. They should serve God SWIFTLY. </p></b></font>Beware of a 
    dull temper of soul; the <i>loveliness </i>of obedience is in the <i>
    liveliness </i>of it. We read of two women, "The wind was in their wings" 
    (Zech. 5:9). Wings are swift—but <i>wind </i>in the wings denotes <i>great
    </i>swiftness. Such swiftness should be in our obedience to God. If God 
    spares us as a father does his son, we should serve him as a son does his 
    father.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Second Use: EXHORTATION.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">If God spares us as a father does his son—let us imitate 
    God. It is natural for children to imitate their parents; what the father 
    does, the child is apt to learn the same. </p>
<p align="justify">Let us imitate God in this one thing—As God spares us, 
    and passes by many failures—so let us be sparing in our censures of others; 
    let us look upon the weaknesses and indiscretions of our brethren with a 
    more tender compassionate eye.</p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, in cases of scandal we ought not to bear with 
    others—but sharply reprove them. But if through inadvertence or passion they 
    act wrongly—let us <i>pity </i>and <i>pray </i>for them. How much God bears 
    with us! He spares us, and shall not we be sparing to others? Perhaps they 
    have been wronged, and false things may be said about them. Athanasius was 
    falsely accused by the Arians of adultery; Basil was falsely accused of 
    heresy. It is usual for the world to <i>misrepresent </i>the people of God; 
    therefore let us be sparing in our censures. God spares us--and shall not <i>
    we </i>be sparing towards others?</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Third use: COMFORT.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Here is comfort to the children of God in case of <b>
    failings</b>. The Lord will not be severe to mark what they have done 
    amiss—but will spare them. He passes by many infirmities: "He will rest in 
    his love" (2eph. 3:17); in the original it is, "He will be silent in his 
    love". As if the prophet had said, though the church had her failings—yet 
    God's love was such, that it would not allow him to mention them. God turns
    <i>a blind eye</i> to our many oversights: "My eye spared them from 
    destruction" (Ezek. 20:17). </p>
<p align="justify">I do not speak of presumptuous sins—but of failings such 
    as vain thoughts, deadness in duty, sudden surprises by temptation. These 
    being mourned for, God for Christ's sake will spare us as a father does his 
    son.</p>
<p align="justify">This is one of the richest comforts in the Book of God. 
    Who is he who lives—and sins not? How defective we are in our best duties! 
    How full our lives are either of <i>blanks </i>or of <i>blots! </i>Were it 
    not for God's sparing mercy—we would all go to hell. But this text is a 
    choice cordial; if our hearts are sincere, God will spare us as a father 
    does his son. "I will not execute the fierceness of my anger" (Hos. 11:9).</p>
<p align="justify">I know not a greater rock of support, for a fainting 
    Christian than this—God will abate the severity of the law. Though we come 
    short in our duty, he will not fail of his mercy—but will spare us as a 
    father spares his son.</p>

    The Difference Between Righteous and the Wicked</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Then you will again see the difference between the 
    righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not." 
    (Mal. 3:18).</p>
<p align="justify">Here follows the close of the chapter, which I shall 
    little more than paraphrase. These words are spoken to the <i>wicked</i>, as 
    learned expositors assert; for though the godly shall at last discern what a 
    difference God makes between them and the wicked, how <i>merciful </i>he is 
    to the one, and how <i>severe </i>to the other—yet this text is chiefly 
    spoken to the wicked: "You have said, <i>It is vain to serve God!</i>" 
    (verse 14) "From now on we will say, 'Blessed are the arrogant.' For those 
    who do evil get rich, and those who dare God to punish them go free of 
    harm." (verse 15). Well, says God, though now you call the <i>proud </i>
    happy and the <i>godly </i>foolish—yet when I have made up my jewels—then 
    you wicked ones shall see clearly what a difference I make between the 
    righteous, and the wicked; between him who serves God—and him who does not 
    serve him. Then, when it is too late, when the day of grace is past, and the 
    drawbridge of mercy is pulled up—then shall you discern a difference between 
    the holy and the profane!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 1: The wicked at present have their eyes shut!</p></b></font> 
    "To this day the Lord has not given you <i>minds </i>that understand, nor <i>
    eyes </i>that see, nor <i>ears </i>that hear!" (Deut. 29:4). Natural men 
    have the sword upon their right eye, "The sword will cut his arm and pierce 
    his right eye! His arm will become useless, and his right eye completely 
    blind!" (Zech. 11:17). They see no difference between the pious and the 
    impious; they imagine that it fares as well with the wicked as with the 
    righteous; nay, it seems to fare <i>better </i>with the wicked. The wicked 
    flourish: "These are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in 
    riches" (Psalm 73: 12). Whereas those who pray and fast, are oppressed. The 
    wicked bless themselves, and think they are now in a better condition than 
    the righteous; the matter is not to be wondered at, for "the <i>god of this 
    world </i>has blinded the minds of sinners" (2 Cor. 4:4). But at last their 
    eyes shall he opened; and that brings me to the second doctrine.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 2: There is a time shortly coming when impious, 
    grossly wicked sinners, shall SEE an obvious difference between the godly 
    and the nicked.</p></b></font> The tables will then be turned! "Then you will 
    again <b>see </b>the difference between the righteous and the wicked, 
    between those who serve God and those who do not." 
<p align="justify">Question: When is the <i>time </i>when the eyes of 
    sinners shall he opened, and they shall see a difference between the 
    righteous and the wicked?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: There are two times when sinners shall see a 
    manifest difference between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
<p align="justify">Firstly, at the day of <b>judgment</b>. That will be a 
    day of manifest difference. Things will then appear in their proper colors; 
    the difference will easily be seen between the godly and the wicked; the one 
    being absolved—the other condemned!</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, at the hour of <b>separation</b>, when God 
    shall eternally separate the reprobate from the elect, as a winnowing fan 
    separates the chaff from the wheat—and there shall be a visible discerning 
    between the righteous and wicked. "All the nations will be gathered in his 
    presence, and he will separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from 
    the goats. He will place the sheep at his right hand and the goats at his 
    left. And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will 
    go into eternal life!" (Matt. 25:32-33, 46). Jesus Christ will take his 
    saints up with him into glory—and will cast the wicked down to hell. He will 
    make up the godly as jewels, and tie up the wicked in bundles to be burned! 
    "Bind them in bundles to burn them" (Matt. 13:30). Now sinners shall be 
    convinced with a vengeance, that the state of the righteous and the wicked 
    is different! They shall <b>see </b>the righteous advanced to a <i>heavenly 
    kingdom</i>, and themselves cast into a <i>fiery prison!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Oh, the dreadfulness of that place of torment! Could men 
    lay their ears to the infernal lake, and but for one hour hear the groans 
    and shrieks of the damned—they would tell us that they now see what before 
    they would not believe—the infinite difference between the righteous and the 
    wicked! In hell is torment upon torment, "blackness of darkness" (Jude 13), 
    "chains of darkness" (2 Pet. 2:4). These chains are God's <i>decree 
    ordaining</i>, and his <i>power binding </i>men under wrath! And that which 
    accentuates and puts a sting into the torments of the wicked—is that they 
    shall be <i>always </i>scorching in the fire of God's wrath! "The smoke of 
    their torment ascends up forever and ever" (Rev. 14:11 ). </p>
<p align="justify">Christ said of his suffering on the cross, "It is 
    finished!" But sinners shall never say of their sufferings in hell—that they 
    are finished. No! if the damned had lain in hell as many thousand years as 
    there are drops in the sea—eternity has yet to begin!</p>

    count themselves the only happy men, and look upon the people of God with 
    derision. They load them with invectives and curse them with their slanders. 
    Well, the time is not far off—when the wicked shall clearly discern who 
    belong to Christ—and who belong to the devil. As Moses said to Korah and his 
    company, "Tomorrow the Lord will show who are his" (Num. 16:5), so at the 
    day of <i>judgment </i>the Lord will show who are his—and who are not. Nay, 
    sooner than that: at the day of <i>death </i>the wicked shall see how it 
    will be with them for eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, that the eyes of sinners may be speedily opened—that 
    they may see the difference of things, the beauty which is in holiness, and 
    the astonishing madness that is in sin!</p>

</b></font>
<p align="justify">Though at present they are slighted, and have the odium

    between them and the wicked. As it was with Pharaoh's two officers, the 
    butler and the baker; at first there seemed to be no difference between 
    them—but in a short while there was difference made. The chief butler was 
    advanced to honor—but the chief baker was executed (Gen. 40:21-22). So 
    though now God's people are low and despised, and the wicked treat them with 
    boastful insolence—yet when the critical day comes, there shall be a <i>
    final separation </i>made between the righteous and the wicked. The one 
    shall be <i>dignified</i>—the other<i> damned!</i> "And they will go away 
    into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life!" 
    (Matt. 25:46).</p>
<p align="justify">Be encouraged therefore, saints of God—to persist in a 
    course of holiness. Though now you seem to be lowermost—yet in the 
    resurrection you shall be uppermost: "The upright shall have dominion over 
    them in the morning" (Psalm 49: 14). That is, they shall have dominion over 
    the wicked in the morning of the resurrection. They shall then laugh the 
    wicked to scorn (Psalm 52:6). "Then you will see the difference between the 
    righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not."
