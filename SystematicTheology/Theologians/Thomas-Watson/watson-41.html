<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">The Trees of 
    Righteousness Blossoming<br/>
    and Bringing Forth Fruit</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
<i>"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, 
    unto the glory and praise of God."</i> Philippians 1:11</p>
<p align="justify">The blessed apostle in this chapter makes a solemn prayer 
    to God for these Philippians; and, among the rest, he puts up two rare 
    petitions for them: </p>
<p align="justify">First, that they might be sincere (verse 10).</p>
<p align="justify">Second, that they might be fruitful: "being filled with 
    the fruits of righteousness."</p>
<p align="justify">Here observe:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The matter: "being filled with fruits."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The manner of production: "by Jesus Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The end: "which are to the glory and praise of God."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE: Christians should above all things, endeavor 
    after fruitfulness.</p></b></font> The saints are called "trees of 
    righteousness" in Isaiah 61:3. These <i>rational </i>trees must not only 
    bring forth <i>leaves</i>—but <i>fruit</i>, "being filled with the fruits of 
    righteousness." To further amplify this, there are two things to be inquired 
    into:
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How does a Christian bring forth fruit?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. He brings forth fruit in the vine. By nature we 
    are barren, and there is not one good blossom growing on us; but when by 
    faith we are engrafted into Christ, then we grow and bear fruit. John 15:4: 
    "Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on 
    the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me." Jesus Christ is that 
    blessed Root which shoots up that <i>sap of grace </i>into His branches. The 
    Pelagians tells us we have sufficiency of ourselves to bring forth good 
    fruit; but how improper is this? Does not the root contribute to the 
    branches? Is it not of Christ's precious fullness that we receive (John 
    1:16)? Therefore it is observable that Christ calls the spouse's grace His 
    grace. Song of Solomon 5:1: "I have gathered <i>My </i>myrrh with <i>My </i>
    spice." Christ does not say, "your myrrh," but "My myrrh." If the saints 
    bear any spiritual fruit, they are indebted to Christ for it; it is His 
    myrrh. Hosea 14:8: "From <i>Me </i>is your fruit found."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What is that fruit which a sincere Christian 
    brings forth?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is inward fruit, outward fruit, kindly fruit, 
    and seasonable fruit.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. A Christian brings forth INWARD fruit: </p></b></font>
    love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, and faith (Galatians 
    5:22). This fruit is sweet and mellow, growing under the Sun of 
    righteousness. This is that ripe fruit which God delights to taste (Micah 
    7:1).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. A Christian brings forth OUTWARD fruit.</p></b></font> He 
    brings forth the fruit of good <b>speech</b>. Proverbs 15:4: "A wholesome 
    tongue is a tree of life." Gracious speeches fall from the lips of a godly 
    man, as fruit does from a tree.
<p align="justify">A Christian brings forth the fruit of good <b>works </b>
    (Colossians 1:10). God will say at the last day, "Show me your faith by your 
    works" (James 2:18). A true saint does all the good he can, honoring the 
    Lord with his substance; he knows he is to be in the world but a while, and 
    therefore lives much in a little time, crowding up a great deal of work in a 
    little time. It was Christ's speech not long before His suffering, "I have 
    finished the work which You gave Me to do" (John 17:4). How can they be said 
    to finish their work—who never began to work?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. A Christian brings forth KINDLY fruit.</p></b></font> "The 
    godly man brings forth his fruit" (Psalm 1:3), that is, he brings forth that 
    fruit which is proper for him to bear. But what is this kindly and proper 
    fruit? It is when we are holy in our callings and relations. In a 
    magistrate, justice is kindly fruit (Deuteronomy 16:19); in a minister, zeal 
    (Acts 17:16); in a parent, instruction (Deuteronomy 4:10); in a child, 
    reverence (Ephesians 6:1); in a master, a good example (Genesis 18:19; 
    Ephesians 6:9); in a servant, obedience (1 Peter 2:18); in the husband, love 
    (Ephesians 5:25); in the wife, submission (Ephesians 5:22); in a tradesman, 
    diligence (Exodus 20:9); in a soldier, innocence (Luke 3:14). 
<p align="justify">A tree of God's planting brings forth his fruit, that 
    which is suitable and proper. I shall never believe him to be godly, who 
    does not bear kindly fruit. A man cannot be a sincere Christian—but a bad 
    master. A sincere Christian—but a bad parent, does not sound well. That 
    minister can no more be godly who lacks zeal—than that wine is good which 
    lacks spirits; that magistrate can no more be good who lacks justice—than 
    that pillar is good which is not upright. That child can no more be good who 
    does not honor his parents—than a traitor can be said to be loyal. When 
    Absalom rose up in rebellion against his father, the mule which he rode upon 
    (as if she were weary of carrying such a burden) resigned her load up to the 
    great, thick oak, and there left him hanging by the hair, between heaven and 
    earth, as neither fit to ascend the one nor worthy to tread upon the other.</p>
<p align="justify">Let Christians be persuaded to bring forth proper and 
    genuine fruit, and shine forth in their relations. He who is not godly in 
    his relations goes under the just suspicion of being a hypocrite; let a man 
    seem to be a penitent or zealous—yet if he does not bear fruit proper to his 
    station, he is no tree of righteousness—but some wild, degenerate plant. 
    There are some who will pray, hear sermons, discourse well; and this is 
    good; but what does this <i>bleating of the sheep </i>mean? They are not 
    good in their relationships; this reveals that they are unsound. A sincere 
    Christian labors to fill his relationships. I do not like those Christians 
    who, though they seem to be traveling to heaven—yet leave the duties of 
    their relations, as a uncharted territory, which they never come near.</p>
<p align="justify">The excellency of a Christian is to bring forth proper 
    fruit. Wherein does the goodness of a member in the body lie, but to 
    discharge its proper office? The eye is to see, the ear to hear, and so on. 
    So the excellency of a Christian is to bring forth that fruit which God has 
    assigned to him. What is a thing good for—which does not do its proper work? 
    What is a clock good for—which will not strike? What is a ship good 
    for—which will not sail? What is a rose good for—which does not give forth 
    its fragrance? What is that professor good for—who does not send forth a 
    sweet perfume in his relationships? </p>
<p align="justify">The commendation of a thing, is when it puts forth its 
    proper virtue.</p>
<p align="justify">Not to bring forth suitable fruit, spoils all the other 
    fruit which we bring forth. If a man were to make a medicine and leave out 
    the chief ingredient—the medicine would lose its virtue. If one were to draw 
    a portrait and leave out an eye—it would spoil the picture. There are many 
    to whom Christ will say at the day of judgment, as He did to the young man 
    in Luke 18:22, "Yet lack you one thing. You have prayed, fasted, and heard 
    sermons—yet lack you one thing—you have not been godly in your 
    relationships."</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Relative graces </p></i>do much to beautify and set off a 
    Christian. It is the beauty of a star to shine in its proper orb. <i>
    Relative grace </i>bespangles a Christian.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A sincere Christian brings forth SEASONABLE fruit. </p></b>
</font>Psalm 1:3 speaks of "he who brings forth fruit <i>in his season</i>." 
    Ecclesiastes 3:11 says that "everything is beautiful <i>in his time</i>." 
    That may be good at one time, which at another time may be out of season. 
    There is a great deal of skill in the <i>right timing </i>of a thing; duties 
    of religion must be performed in the fit juncture of time.
<p align="justify">Christian duties which relate to our neighbor must be 
    observed in their season. For example, our <i><b>reproving </b></i>others 
    must be seasonable. Reproof is a duty; when we see others walk irregularly, 
    like soldiers who march out of rank and file, we ought mildly—yet gravely, 
    to tell them of their sin (Leviticus 19:17); but let this fruit be brought 
    forth in its season.</p>
<p align="justify">Do it <i>privately</i>. Matthew 18:15: "Go and tell him 
    his faults between him and you alone." Do it when you see him in the best 
    temper, not when his passions are up—that would be like pouring oil on the 
    flame. But only reprove him when it is seasonal—when his spirit is meekened 
    and calmed. You put the seal on the wax when it is soft and pliable. There 
    is a time when men's spirits are more flexible and yielding; now is the 
    fittest time to stamp a reproof upon them, and it is likeliest to take 
    impression. When Abigail reproved Nabal, it was in the right season; not 
    when he was in wine—but when he was in his wits, and was fit to hear a 
    reproof (1 Samuel 25:37).</p>
<p align="justify">Another season for reproof is in the time of <i>
    affliction</i>. Affliction tames men's spirits, and then a word of reproof 
    spoken prudentially may work with the affliction. A bitter potion is not 
    refused if in case of extremity of pain. Affliction opens the ear to 
    discipline.</p>
<p align="justify">Also, our <i>comforting </i>others must be seasonable. 
    Proverbs 15:23: "A word spoken in due season, how good is it?" When we see 
    one fallen into sin, and like Peter weeping bitterly—now a word of comfort 
    will do well. When the incestuous Corinthian was deeply humbled, the apostle 
    called for oil and wine to be poured into his wounds. 2 Corinthians 2:7: 
    "You ought rather to comfort him." And the reason given was, "lest perhaps 
    such a one should be swallowed up with sorrow." When the soul is wounded for 
    sin, them bring the mollifying ointment of a promise (Jeremiah 3:1). Hang 
    out free grace's colors; display the glory of God's attributes, His mercy 
    and truth to the sinner. </p>
<p align="justify">When the spirit is broken, a word of comfort spoken in 
    season is putting it in joint again. We bring forth seasonable fruit when we 
    give wine to those who are of a heavy heart. Pleasant words are as an 
    honeycomb, sweet to the soul. Job's friends pretended to comfort him—but, 
    instead of pouring oil into the wound, they poured in vinegar.</p>
<p align="justify">Duties of religion that relate to God must be performed 
    in their season. Mourning for sin is a duty. God loves a contrite heart 
    (Psalm 51:17). How powerful with God is the <i>weeping rhetoric </i>which a 
    poor sinner uses? Yet there is a time when weeping may not be so seasonable; 
    when God has given us some eminent signal deliverance, and this mercy calls 
    aloud to us to rejoice—but we hang our harps on the willows and sit weeping. 
    This sadness is fruit out of season.</p>
<p align="justify">There was a special time at the Feast of Tabernacles when 
    God called His people to rejoicing: "Seven days shall you keep a solemn 
    feast unto the Lord your God—and you shall surely rejoice." Now if the 
    Israelites had sat heavy and disconsolate at the time when God called them 
    to rejoice, it would have been very unseasonable, like mourning at a 
    wedding. When we are called to thanksgiving, and we mingle our drink with 
    tears, is not this to be highly unthankful for mercy? God would have His 
    people humble—but not ungrateful. It is the devil's policy either to keep us 
    from duty—or else to put us upon it when it is least in season.</p>
<p align="justify">Rejoicing is a duty (Psalm 33:1). But when God, by some 
    special providence, calls us to weeping, then joy is unseasonable. This is 
    that which God complained of in Isaiah 22:12-13: "In that day the Lord 
    Almighty called you to weep and mourn. He told you to shave your heads in 
    sorrow for your sins and to wear clothes of sackcloth to show your remorse. 
    But instead, you dance and play." Occolampadius and others think it was in 
    the time of king Ahaz, when the signs of God's anger, like a blazing star, 
    appeared. Now to be given to mirth was very unseasonable, according to verse 
    14: "Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you until you die." It is 
    a concise form of an oath, as if God had said, "I swear that it shall not by 
    any prayer or sacrifice be expiated!"</p>
<p align="justify">To read at home when the word is being preached or the 
    sacrament is being celebrated, is unseasonable, nay, sinful. As Hushai said 
    in 2 Samuel 17:7, "The counsel is not good at this time." One duty is to 
    prepare for another—but not to jostle out another; fruit must put forth <i>
    seasonably</i>. The great God who has appointed the duties of His worship 
    has appointed also the time. If, when public ordinances are administered, 
    any person, whether out of pride or sloth, shall stay at home, though he may 
    have his private devotions—yet he brings forth fruit out of season, and let 
    that man know he shall bear his sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all the trees of righteousness bring forth seasonable 
    fruit. In prosperity, be thankful; in adversity, be patient. "To everything 
    there is a season" (Ecclesiastes 3:1). The Psalmist said, "He appointed the 
    moon for seasons" (Psalm 104:19).</p>
<p align="justify">To excite you to seasonable fruit, consider that the 
    seasonableness of a thing, puts a value and preciousness upon it. Duties of 
    religion performed in their season, are glorious. Creatures, by the instinct 
    of nature, observe their season. Jeremiah 8:7: "Yes the stork in the heaven 
    knows her appointed times." And shall not Christians observe their 
    seasons—when to mourn and when to rejoice? Consider also that duties of 
    religion not well timed are dangerous; mourning in a time of</p>
<p align="justify">joy, and private duties in time of public ones—are 
    unseasonable and will prove harmful.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center"><br/>
<font size="4">Application</font></p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Information.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">This shows us who is a Christian in God's calendar, 
    namely, the fruit-bearing Christian. As soon as the sap of grace is 
    infused—it puts itself forth in evangelical fruit. No sooner was Paul 
    converted than he became a plant of renown; he brought forth rare 
    fruit—humility, faith, and heavenly mindedness. He was one of the most 
    fruitful trees that God ever planted in His vineyard. When God changed the 
    jailor from a wild tree to a tree of righteousness, he brought forth sweet 
    and generous fruit. How kindly he treated the apostles! He set food before 
    them and washed their wounds; he who was before their jailor, became then 
    their nurse and physician!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Reproof.</p></b></font> Here is an indictment against 
    three sorts of people:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. This reproves such as bring forth no fruit.</p></b></font> 
    Hosea 10:1: "Israel is an <i>empty </i>vine." Oh, how many unfruitful 
    hearers there are who evaporate into nothing but froth and smoke, being like 
    those ears of corn which are turned into straw! They give God neither the 
    early fruit, nor the latter. There are many Christians who are like arbors, 
    covered only with the leaves of profession; they may be compared to the wood 
    of the <i>vine </i>which is good for nothing (Ezekiel 15:2). "He who has not 
    the fruits of the Spirit—has not the Spirit, and he who has not the 
    Spirit—is none of Christ's" (Romans 8:9). And if he is not Christ's, whose 
    is he then? I fear the sin of this age is <i>unfruitfulness</i>. Never has 
    there been more laboring in God's vineyard, and yet never has there been 
    less fruit; instead of the fruitful fig tree and the pomegranate, we have 
    abundance of <i>barren willows </i>growing among us. Ministers say they fear 
    they spend their labor in vain; many are <i>perverted</i>, few <i>converted</i>.
<p align="justify">To those professing Christians who are unfruitful, let me 
    say four things: </p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First, unfruitfulness is a shame</p></b></font>; <i>
    barrenness of children </i>was counted a great shame. For a tree in <i>
    winter </i>to be unfruitful is no great wonder; but in the <i>spring </i>and
    <i>summer</i>, to be without fruit—is a reproach to the tree. So, in the 
    winter of <i>ignorance </i>and <i>popery</i>—to have less fruit was less 
    culpable; but in the <i>springtime of the gospel</i>, when the Sun of 
    Righteousness has shined so gloriously in our horizon, now to be without 
    fruit is a reproach not to be wiped away!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, what account can the unfruitful professor give to 
    God? </p></b></font>God will come with this question, "Where is your fruit?" A 
    godly man dies full of fruit. Job 5:26: "You will approach the grave in full 
    vigor, as a stack of sheaves is gathered in its season." The unfruitful 
    professor comes to his grave, not with a stack of sheaves is gathered in its 
    season—but as a bundle of worthless straw, fit only for the fire! It is good 
    to think to ourselves what answer we shall give to God for our barrenness. 
    The Lord has planted us in a rich soil, and He may say to us as He did to 
    His vineyard in Isaiah 5:1-2 "My beloved has a vineyard on a rich and 
    fertile hill. He plowed the land, cleared its stones, and planted it with 
    choice vines. Then he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes—but the grapes 
    that grew were wild and sour!"
<p align="justify">Hilly places are judged the fittest for vines to grow in 
    (Psalm 80:10), that is, in a very fat, rich soil. There the sun comes best, 
    and is of more force for ripening the grapes. So may God say to us, "I have 
    planted you in a hilly place. You have been higher than the nations round 
    about you. You have even been lifted up to heaven with ordinances. The 
    sunbeams of mercy, and Zion's silver drops, have fallen upon you—but where 
    is your fruit? Your blessings have been great—but where is your fruit?" Whom 
    God finds without fruit, He leaves without excuse.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, those who do not bring forth good fruit, shall 
    never taste of the fruits that grow in heaven.</p></b></font> Heaven is the 
    garden of God, the paradise of pleasure, where the most rare, delicious 
    fruits grow; there are fruits which the angels themselves delight to feed 
    on. Now, if you do not bring God your fruit, you shall never taste His 
    fruit. You who do not bring forth the fruits of <i>righteousness</i>, shall 
    never taste the fruits of <i>paradise</i>. Oh, present Christ with your 
    sweet spices; give Him your myrrh, your spiced wine. Your <i>myrrh </i>is, 
    repentance; this, though it is bitter to you, is sweet to Christ. Those who 
    have no myrrh or wine to give to God—shall never feed upon the Tree of Life 
    which bears several sorts of fruit.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Fourth, think of the heavy doom which will be passed upon 
    the unfruitful person</p></b></font>. Matthew 25:30: "Cast the unprofitable 
    servant into outer darkness." This man had not <i>embezzled </i>his 
    talent—but because he did not trade with it and bring forth fruit—he was 
    therefore sentenced.
<p align="justify">This reproves such as bring forth <i>evil </i>fruit. They 
    are not trees of the garden—but the wilderness; their hearts are a fruitful 
    soil for sin! They bring forth pride, malice, superstition, and the like. 
    This reproves such as bring forth good fruit—but to a bad end. Hosea 10:1: 
    "Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himself." A man would 
    be better to bring forth no fruit—as bring forth fruit unto himself.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What is it for one to bring forth fruit unto 
    himself?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is when all the good he does, is to magnify 
    himself. The <i>worm of pride </i>gets into his fruit and spoils it. Prayer 
    is good; but when a man prays only to show his gifts, this is to bring forth 
    fruit unto himself.</p>
<p align="justify">Some take pride in their humbling confessions, which is 
    as if Benhadad's servants had been proud when they came before the king with 
    ropes around their necks (1 Kings 20:31). Works of mercy are good—but when a 
    man gives alms not so much to feed the poor, as to feed his pride—then he 
    brings forth fruit to himself, and this fruit is filled with <i>worms</i>. 
    God will say to all such self-seekers, as once He did to the people of the 
    Jews in Zechariah 7:5, "When you fasted and mourned, did you at all fast 
    unto Me, even to Me?" Sinners, did you not bring forth fruit unto 
    yourselves?"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Exhortation. </p></b></font>Let this exhort all to 
    fruitfulness. How happy would it be, if it might be said of us as it was of 
    Joseph in Genesis 49:22, "Joseph is a fruitful bough!" We love to see 
    everything fruitful; if there is a tree in our orchard, though covered with 
    ever such fair leaves, we do not value it unless there is <i>fruit</i>. When 
    you come into your garden, you complain if you see no fruit. We love to see 
    fruitfulness everywhere, and why not in our hearts? Oh, let the precious 
    grapes and figs we bear, give evidence that we are trees of God's planting.
    
<p align="justify">We often plant trees to be a <i>shade </i>to the house. 
    God cares for no such trees as are only for shade—He loves fruit. Arabia is 
    called "Felix," because of the sweet fruits which grow there: frankincense, 
    with other perfumes and spices. That Christian may be entitled "Felix," <i>
    happy</i>, who has the sweet fruits of the Spirit growing in his heart. Be 
    fruit-bearing trees. This is the emblem of a sincere Christian: he is never 
    without fruit, either blooming in his <i>affections </i>or fructifying in 
    his <i>life</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">That I may persuade Christians to fruitfulness, I desire 
    them to weigh these five things:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Fruit is that which God expects from us. </p></b></font>We 
    are His plants, and "Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit?" (1 
    Corinthians 9:7). Let us not be as Pharaoh's lean cows, which devoured the 
    fat cows, and yet still were lean; let us not be still devouring sermons—yet 
    never the fatter for them.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Fruitfulness is one of the most distinctive 
    characteristics of a Christian. </p></b></font>Proverbs 12:12: "The root of the 
    righteous yields fruit." Fruitfulness distinguishes a saint from a 
    hypocrite. The hypocrite is all for show and pretense; he has fair 
    leaves—but "the root of the righteous yields fruit." Fruit can no more be 
    separated from faith—than moisture from the air; it is the very definition 
    of a branch in Christ; it bears fruit (John 15:2). As a <i>man </i>differs 
    from a beast by reason, a <i>beast </i>differs from a plant by sense, and a
    <i>plant </i>differs from a stone by fruit—so a sincere Christian differs 
    from a hypocrite by fruit. Fruitfulness puts a difference between the <i>
    sound </i>tree—and the <i>hollow </i>tree.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But may not hypocrites bring forth fruit?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. They do not bring forth fruit in the Vine; they 
    bring forth in the strength of their abilities, not in the strength of 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Hypocrites bring forth something like fruit—but it is not 
    the right fruit. The fruit they bear is not so sweet. The crab-apple tree 
    may bear fruit as well as the pear-tree—but the pear excels in sweetness. 
    The hypocrite may pray and give alms as well as a child of God—but there is 
    a difference in the fruit. The fruit of the regenerate is wholesome; it is 
    sweetened with faith and ripened with love. The hypocrite's fruit is sour 
    and harsh; he does not bring forth sweet pomegranates—but crab-apples; not 
    figs—but wild grapes.</p>
<p align="justify">The seeming fruit of hypocrites dies and comes to 
    nothing. John 15:6: "He is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; 
    such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned." The 
    hypocrite's fruit is like the grass upon the housetops, which withers before 
    it grows up (Psalm 139:6; Matthew 13:6).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Fruitfulness adorns a Christian.</p></b></font> The fruit 
    adorns the tree; a fruit-bearing Christian is an ornament to religion. The 
    more fruitful the branch is, the more fair to look on. A dead tree, as it is 
    unserviceable, so it is unattractive. A Christian, decked with the fruits of 
    righteousness, is beautiful and glorious.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Fruitfulness is good evidence to show for heaven</p></b></font>; 
    the fruits of love, humility, and good works are (as Bernard said) seeds of 
    hope, signs of predestination, and the happy foretastes of future glory. The 
    righteousness of faith, is always accompanied with the fruits of 
    righteousness. He who can show good, fruit goes full sail to heaven!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. God delights in His fruitful trees.</p></b></font> When 
    His garden flourishes, He will walk there. He who curses the barren tree 
    will taste of the fruitful tree. Song of Solomon 5:1: "I am here in My 
    garden, My treasure, My bride! I gather My myrrh with My spices and eat My 
    honeycomb with My honey. I drink My wine with My milk."
<p align="justify">This exhorts those who do bear fruit—to bring forth more 
    fruit. Do not think that you have enough fruit—but bring forth greater 
    degrees of sanctity. John 15:2: "He prunes every branch that produces fruit 
    so that it will produce more fruit." Grace is like the morning light which 
    increases more and more—to the full meridian of glory. Christians should be 
    like that ground in the parable which "produced a crop that was thirty, 
    sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted." (Matthew 
    13:8). He who has a little gold labors to increase it; and is not grace more 
    precious than gold? </p>
<p align="justify">Some Christians have a little fruit, and they think that 
    is well. They are like trees which have an apple or two growing on them to 
    show that they are of the right kind. They are like the church of 
    Philadelphia which had a little strength (Revelation 3:8). Just so, they 
    have a little faith and a spark of love. Christ chides a <i>little </i>faith 
    (Matthew 14:31). We "grow only as we get our nourishment and strength from 
    God" (Colossians 2:19). Christ compared the breasts of the spouse to <i>
    clusters </i>of grapes for their fruitfulness (Song of Solomon 7:7). Oh, 
    labor to be Christians of high degrees! The apostle prayed that the love of 
    the Philippians might <i>abound </i>yet more and more (Philippians 1:9).</p>
<p align="justify">Now that I may press Christians who have fruit—to bring 
    forth more fruits of patience, humility, love, and the like. Consider that 
    this is the end why we have continual cost laid out upon us—that we should 
    bring forth more fruit. The Lord is still manuring us; not a week, not a 
    day—but He is at continual cost with us. He rains down golden showers; and 
    why is God at all this cost with us, but that we may bring forth more fruit?</p>
<p align="justify">The more fruit we bring forth, the more glory we bring to 
    God. John 15:8: "Herein is My Father glorified—that you bear much fruit." 
    Though it is a blessed sight to see any fruit, I would not discourage such 
    as bear but two or three olive berries; it is a sign they are not <i>dead
    </i>trees. It is observable, the ground in the parable which brought forth a 
    small amount of fruit—Christ called "good ground" (Matthew 13:8). If the 
    farmer sees a thin ear which has but a little corn in it—yet he is glad to 
    see some fruit, and he carries it into the barn. So, though you are a thin 
    ear and do not have as much grace as others, God will not reject you. If 
    there is <i>any </i>fruit, God will accept it. He who gained but two talents 
    still heard, "Well done, good and faithful servant!" I say this that I may 
    not discourage the weak Christian; though you have less fruit growing on 
    you, you are too good a tree to be made fuel for the fire; you shall be 
    transplanted into paradise!</p>
<p align="justify">But I also say, do not rest in small beginnings—but labor 
    to put more oil in the lamp and be increasing your stock of grace; for the 
    more fruit you bring forth, the more glory God has. Though the lowest degree 
    of grace may bring salvation to you—yet it does not bring as much glory to 
    God. It is observable in the text, when the apostle had said, "<i>filled </i>
    with the fruits of righteousness," he adds, "which are unto the glory and 
    praise of God." It is a praise to the farmer, and commends his skill and 
    industry—when the plants in his orchard thrive. Just so, when the plants of 
    righteousness flourish, this is to the praise of God's glory. It is the 
    highest end of the creature to bring glory to God. Better we lose our 
    lives—than lose the end of our living.</p>
<p align="justify">The fuller we are of fruit, the more we are like Christ, 
    who was full of grace and truth (John 1:14). He received the Spirit without 
    measure (John 3:34). This tree of life was ever bearing; and He brought 
    forth several sorts of fruit—wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and so 
    on. The more we are filled with the fruits of righteousness, the more we 
    resemble the Sun of Righteousness. We were elected to this end—to be made 
    like Christ (Romans 8:30); and we are most like this blessed Vine when we 
    bear full clusters.</p>
<p align="justify">The more fruit a Christian brings forth, the more will 
    Christ love him. "Surely now," said Leah, "my husband will feel affection 
    for me, since I have given him three sons!" (Genesis 29:34). When we bear 
    much fruit, then Christ's heart will be joined to us. Christ will <i>pardon
    </i>a weak faith—but He will <i>honor </i>a great faith. It was not a <i>
    sparkle </i>of faith which Christ commended in Mary Magdalene—but <i>flaming
    </i>love. Luke 7:47: "She loved much." Christians, would you be like that 
    beloved disciple who leaned on the bosom of Jesus? Would you have much <i>
    love </i>from Christ? Let Him have much <i>fruit </i>from you.</p>
<p align="justify">Bearing much fruit will usher in abundance of comfort 
    into the soul in the hour of temptation. Satan will be sure to besiege the 
    weakest Christian; all his darts fly that way, and<i> a strong temptation 
    may overcome a weak faith. </i>But a flourishing faith stands like a cedar, 
    and is not blown down by the wind of temptation. A strong faith can stop the 
    mouth of the devil, that roaring lion.</p>
<p align="justify">A store of fruit will also give comfort in the hour of 
    death. A little grace will make us above the <i>danger </i>of death—but high 
    degrees of grace will make us above the <i>fear </i>of death. Oh, what joy 
    it will be on the deathbed, when a Christian can bring his sheaves full of 
    corn, when he can show the five talents that he has gained by trading, when 
    there is not only a <i>drop </i>or two of oil—but his lamp <i>full </i>of 
    oil! What if the devil shows God our debts—if we can show him our fruit? Oh, 
    how sweet will death be! It will not be a <i>destruction</i>—but a <i>
    deliverance</i>. Death, like a whirlwind, may blow down the tree of the 
    body—but it cannot blast the fruit of our graces. The trees of righteousness 
    carry their fruit with them. Revelation 14:13: "Their works follow them." 
    The Christian who abounds in holiness may say as Simeon did in Luke 2:29, 
    "Lord, now let You Your servant depart in peace." He who bears but a little 
    fruit departs in <i>safety</i>; but he who bears much fruit departs in <i>
    peace</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider what need we have to be putting forth still more 
    fruit; our graces are yet in their infancy. Indeed, in heaven this doctrine 
    will be out of season; we shall not need to hear it. Then we shall be done 
    growing, being arrived at our full stature. Then our light shall be clear 
    and our love perfect; but while we live here, there is something lacking in 
    our faith (1 Thessalonians 3:10). Therefore we need to increase the stock of 
    grace and bring forth more fruit. Our grace is eclipsed with sin; our faith 
    is full of unbelief. When the sun is eclipsed, it is by degrees getting out 
    of the eclipse and it shines brighter and brighter, and will recover its 
    perfect luster. So it must be with us: we must be getting out of the eclipse 
    until we arrive at our perfect luster in glory.</p>
<p align="justify">He who does not increase to more fruitfulness, will soon 
    be on the losing hand. He who has not more faith will quickly have less. 
    "You have left your first love." It is with grace as it is with fire: if it 
    is not fed and increased, it will soon decay. Such as do not <i>thrive </i>
    in their spiritual estate, we may perceive sadly to <i>decline</i>. Though a 
    Christian cannot lose the seed of grace—yet he may lose the actings of grace 
    and the comfort of grace. Therefore, bring forth more fruit. No sooner does 
    a Christian begin to stand still—than you may perceive him going backward.</p>
<p align="justify">The more your <i>fruit </i>is increased, the more your <i>
    glory </i>is increased. He whose pound gained ten more, was made ruler over 
    ten cities. If you would have your <i>crown </i>hung full of jewels, let 
    your <i>boughs </i>be hung full of fruit.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">IV. Direction.</p></b></font> I shall here lay down some <b>
    means to fruitfulness</b>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Be sensible of unfruitfulness. </p></b></font>Any might 
    have been fruitful in grace if they had not conceited themselves so; he who 
    thinks himself fruitful enough—is barren enough. Be sensible of your needs; 
    it is better to know your spiritual leanness, than presume. "You say, 'I am 
    rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not 
    realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you 
    to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white 
    clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put 
    on your eyes, so you can see." Revelation 3:17-18 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If you would be fruitful, remove those things which 
    will hinder fruitfulness</p></b></font>, such as cherishing any secret lust in 
    the heart. Sin indulged—is like vermin to the tree, which destroys the 
    fruit. Grace cannot thrive in a sinful heart.
<p align="justify">Avoid the love of riches. The cares of the world choked 
    the seed, in Matthew 13. The love of sin <i>poisons </i>the fruit; the love 
    of riches <i>chokes </i>it.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third means to fruitfulness is weeping for sin.
    </p></b></font>Moisture helps growth in trees; holy tears water the trees of God 
    and make them more fruitful. Mary Magdalene, a weeping plant, how fruitful 
    was she in love to Christ! Moist grounds are most fertile; the soul that is 
    moistened and steeped in tears, is most fruitful. Never did David's graces 
    flourish more, than when he watered his couch with tears.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. If you would be fruitful, often apply the blood of 
    Christ and His promises.</p></b></font> Apply the blood of Christ. Naturalists 
    say that blood applied to the root of some trees makes them bear better 
    fruit. However that may be—I am sure that the blood of Christ applied to the 
    heart makes it flourish more in holiness. None are so fruitful as a 
    believer. "I know," said Paul, "whom I have believed." There was applying 
    blood to the root of the tree; and how fruitful he was in zeal, love for 
    Christ, and heroic courage! He who believes Christ died for him, never 
    thinks he can do or suffer enough for Christ. When we read and pray, then we 
    do but water the branches; when we believe, then we water the root of the 
    tree and make it fruitful.
<p align="justify">Apply the promises. Farmers have an art to nourish the 
    root to make the tree bear better. The promises applied, are for nourishing 
    of a Christian, and then he puts forth fruit more vigorously. The root of 
    the pine tree watered with wine, causes it to flourish. The promises are as 
    wine to water the trees of righteousness, whereby they spread and increase 
    more in grace. Ever preserve the nourishment of the tree, if you would have 
    it bear fruit. A pensive, dejected soul is less fruitful; but when through 
    the promises a Christian's heart is cheered and comforted, then he is 
    enriched with pleasant fruits. He becomes like a tree laden with fruit.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Another means to fruitfulness is humility. </p></b></font>
    The <i>low </i>grounds are most fruitful. "The <i>valleys </i>are covered 
    with grain." (Psalm 65:13). The humble heart is the fruitful heart. The 
    largest and sweetest fruits of the Spirit, grow in a humble Christian. 1 
    Peter 5:5: "God gives grace to the humble." Paul called himself the <i>least
    </i>of saints—yet he was the <i>chief </i>of the apostles. The virgin Mary 
    was low in her own eyes—but this lowly plant bore that blessed Vine which 
    brought the fruit of salvation to the world.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. If you would be fruitful in grace, be much in godly 
    fellowship.</p></b></font> Malachi 3:16: "Then those who feared the Lord spoke 
    often one to another." It is observed that some plants will bear better near 
    other trees, than when they grow alone—as is seen in the myrtle and olive 
    trees. This holds true in divinity also: the trees of righteousness, when 
    they associate and grow near together, thrive best in godliness. The 
    fellowship of saints is an excellent means for fruitfulness. Christians 
    increase one another's knowledge, strengthen one another's faith, and clear 
    one another's evidences. When the trees planted in God's orchard stand at a 
    distance and grow strange one to another, they are less fruitful.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. If you would be fruit-bearing trees—be near the water 
    of the sanctuary.</p></b></font> Jeremiah 17:8: "He shall be like a tree planted 
    by the waters, and that spreads out the roots by the river; her leaf shall 
    be green, nor shall it cease from yielding fruit." The Word preached will 
    not only make us <i>knowing </i>Christians—but <i>growing </i>Christians. 
    Ministers are compared to clouds in Isaiah 5:6; their doctrine drops as the 
    rain, and makes the trees of God fruitful. No wonder that they are barren 
    trees and near unto cursing, who are not under the droppings of the 
    sanctuary; a Christian can no more be fruitful without ordinances, than a 
    tree without showers.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. And last, if you would fructify quickly—go to God and 
    implore Him to make you fruitful. </p></b></font>God is called the gardener in 
    John 15:1, and He has an art above all other gardeners. They can plant and 
    prune trees—but if those trees are dead they cannot make them bear fruit. 
    God can make the barren tree bear fruit. He can put life into a dead tree! 
    (Ephesians 2:5)
