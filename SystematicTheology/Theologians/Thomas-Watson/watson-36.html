<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">A Plea for Alms</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">(Delivered in a sermon before the London city assembly, 
    on April 13, 1658)</p>
<p align="justify">"If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother 
    in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?" 1 John 
    3:17</p>
<p align="justify"><i>To the assembly of the famous city of London,</i><br/>
    My own lack of dexterity and my unfitness to release this publicly, needs 
    some apology. But your acceptance is my encouragement and the order from 
    your honorable court carries so much authority with it as to add some <i>
    weight </i>to that which dares not plead <i>worth</i>. I was more inclined 
    to publish this discourse because, though the <i>theme </i>is common—yet the
    <i>practice </i>of it is rare and unusual. When contentions are never more 
    hot, and charity never more cold—it is a sign that iniquity abounds. The 
    zeal of our forefathers condemns us; we with Rachel have <i>better eyes</i>—but 
    they with Leah were <i>more fruitful</i>. We are so far (at least the 
    generality of men) from building churches and almshouses, that we are more 
    ready to pull them down.</p>
<p align="justify">How <i>truth </i>is, in these days, forsaken—and <i>
    charity </i>forgotten! We may say of many, that they are <i>miserably rich</i>; 
    their affections toward public advancements and charity are like the scales 
    of the Leviathan, "tightly sealed" (Job 41:15). Ambrose said that when we 
    relieve not one whom we see ready to perish with hunger—that we are the 
    cause of his death. If this rule holds true, there are more guilty of the 
    breach of the sixth commandment, than we are aware of.</p>
<p align="justify">When shall we see a resurrection of charity, which seems 
    to lie dead and buried? Surely it will not be, unless God works a miracle 
    upon men's hearts. May the good Lord by His Spirit cleave the <i>rocks in 
    our bosoms </i>so that the <i>water of repentance </i>and the <i>wine of 
    charity </i>may flow forth! Oh, that England might have that eulogy, as once 
    Athens had, to be the <i>nursery of humanity.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Believe it, <i>charity is the best policy</i>. By helping 
    others—we heal ourselves. Job 29:13: "The blessing of him who was ready to 
    perish came upon me." As the poor had Job's alms—so he had their prayers, 
    and he fared better. <i>Christ's poor </i>are favorites of the court of 
    heaven, and when you give them of your gold—they can unlock heaven by the 
    golden key of prayer, and set God at work on your behalf. The merciful man 
    has many intercessors, which made Jerome to say that it is almost impossible 
    that God should not hear the prayers of so many. Why should there be the 
    least regret or hesitance in our hearts? It would be our glory, if it might 
    be said of us as Paul speaks of those evangelical Christians in 1 
    Thessalonians 4:9: "As touching brotherly love, you need not that I write 
    unto you." Oh, how forgetful are we—of that <i>breast of mercy </i>which 
    feeds us, those <i>golden wings </i>which cover us! Surely we need to keep a 
    register of <i>God's favors to us. </i>If we did, we would, as Clement of 
    Alexandria said, give alms to testify of our gratitude. </p>
<p align="justify">This sermon which you read with seriousness, is not so 
    much to be <i>read </i>over as to be <i>lived </i>over. Your liberality to 
    those who are in need will give the best commentary upon the text. The Lord 
    has set you in public places, and that you may become public blessing in 
    your generation, walking in the fear of God and shining forth in a Bible 
    life, shall be the prayer of him who is your servant in the work of the 
    Lord,<br/>

    "He distributes freely to the poor; his righteousness endures forever."</p></i> 
    Psalms 112:9 
<p align="justify">The prophet David, inspired from heaven in this Psalm, 
    describes a godly man and describes him in two ways:</p>
<p align="justify">1. By his <b>sanctity</b>, and that, first, in general, 
    he is one who <i>fears God </i>(verses 1 and 2). In particular, he is <i>
    charitably minded </i>(verses 5 and 9).</p>
<p align="justify">2. The psalmist describes a godly man by his <b>safety</b>. 
    "Surely he will never be shaken" (verse 6). He stands impregnable, being 
    planted on the rock of ages. Though evil times come, he is not terrified. 
    "They do not fear bad news; they confidently trust the Lord to care for 
    them" (verse 7). <i>Guilt </i>is the breeder of <i>fear</i>. Isaiah 33:14: 
    "The sinners in Zion are terrified; trembling grips the godless!" Leviticus 
    26:36: "The sound of a wind-driven leaf will put them to flight."</p>
<p align="justify">It is not <i>affliction</i> <i>without</i>—but <i>sin 
    within </i>which creates fear. It is the stirring withing the earth which 
    makes an earthquake. True religion is the best antidote against these 
    heart-killing fears.<i> The fear of God drives out all other fear! </i>The 
    godly man insults danger. With the Leviathan, he laughs at the shaking of a 
    spear, as in Job 41:29. When there is a <i>tempest </i>abroad—he has <i>
    music </i>at home. He is settled by faith—as a ship at anchor or as a weight 
    in the center. His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall at this time consider the godly man as he is 
    described by his <b>sanctity</b>, specified under the notion of <i>charity
    </i>and <i>munificence </i>in these words: <i>"He distributes freely to the 
    poor; his righteousness endures forever."</i> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Mercy </p></i>is a weighty matter of the law (Matthew 23:23). 
    Never can it more seasonably be pressed, than upon a day of such solemnity 
    wherein we commemorate the noble bounty of many worthy and famous men, whose 
    acts of beneficence and liberality are left behind, as so many <i>monuments 
    of their piety and renown </i>to succeeding ages.
<p align="justify">Give me permission to open the <i>terms</i>. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"He distributes freely." </p></i>This is a metaphor taken 
    from farmers who scatter and disperse their seed in the furrows of the 
    field, expecting a crop afterwards. So the godly man scatters the precious 
    seed of his charity abroad—-and this seed is not lost but afterwards springs 
    up into a crop.
<i>
<p align="justify">"To the poor." </p></i>The Hebrew word for "poor" in 
    Scripture signifies one who is <i>empty </i>or <i>drawn dry</i>, a metaphor 
    taken from ponds or rivers that are drawn dry. So the poor are exhausted of 
    their <i>strength</i>, <i>beauty</i>, and <i>substance</i>. Like ponds, they 
    are dried up; therefore, they must be filled again with the silver streams 
    of charity.
<i>
<p align="justify">"His righteousness." </p></i>By "righteousness" (as most 
    agreeable to the context) I understand <i>the work of inherent grace in the 
    heart, displaying and evidencing itself in works of mercy and bountifulness.
<p align="justify">"Endures forever."</p></i> Either, first, the <i>comfort </i>
    of his righteousness endures—he has sweet peace and satisfaction in his own 
    mind. 
<p align="justify">Or, second, the <i>honor </i>of it endures. According to 
    the Hebrew phrase, the memorial of his goodness stands as a monument of 
    fame, not to be forgotten. </p>
<p align="justify">Or third, the <i>reward </i>of his righteousness endures. 
    He reaps the fruit of his charity forever, as others interpret it. </p>
<p align="justify">The words thus opened fall into these four parts: </p>

<p align="justify">the <i>benefactor</i>; </p>
<p align="justify">his <i>bounty</i>—"He distributes freely"; </p>
<p align="justify">the <i>object</i>—the poor; </p>
<p align="justify">the <i>trophy </i>or insignia of his honor 
      displayed—"His righteousness endures forever."</p>

<p align="justify">Or, if you will, the text consists of two things: </p>
<p align="justify">the godly man's <i>benignity</i>—"He distributes freely";
    </p>
<p align="justify">and his <i>benediction</i>—"His righteousness endures 
    forever."</p>
<p align="justify">The observation from the words is this—that <b>a <i>godly
    </i>man is a <i>liberal </i>man. </b>The Hebrew word for "godly" signifies
    <i>merciful</i>. The more godly—the more merciful. A godly man is a public 
    blessing in the place where he lives, as in Psalm 37:26. "He is ever 
    merciful and lends." As a nobleman's servant is known by the livery he 
    wears; just so, a servant of Christ known by this livery of <i>mercifulness
    </i>and <i>charity</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two channels in which the stream of charity 
    must run: charity to the <i>souls </i>of others and charity to the <i>
    temporal needs </i>of others.</p>
<p align="justify">Charity to the <font color="#0000ff"><b>souls </b></font>
    of others is a spiritual alms. Indeed, this is the highest kind of charity. 
    The soul is the most precious thing. It is a vessel of honor, a bud of 
    eternity, a spark lighted by the breath of God, a rich diamond set in a ring 
    of clay. The soul has the image of God to beautify it—and the blood of God 
    to redeem it. It being, therefore, of so high a descent, sprung from the 
    ancient of days, and of so noble an extraction, that charity which is shown 
    to the soul must be the greatest.</p>
<p align="justify">This is charity to souls—when we see others in their 
    sins, and we pity them. If I weep (says Augustine) for that body from which 
    the soul is departed, how should I weep for that soul from which God is 
    departed! This is charity to souls—when we see men in the bondage of sin—and 
    we labor by counsel, admonition or reproof to pull them out of their 
    dreadful estate, as the angels did to Lot in Sodom. "Hurry! Get out of here 
    right now, or you will be caught in the destruction of the city! When Lot 
    still hesitated, the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and 
    two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city!" Genesis 19. </p>
<p align="justify">God made a law (Exodus 23:5) "If you see the <i>donkey
    </i>of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it 
    there; be sure you help him with it." On these words Chrysostom said, "We 
    will help a <i>beast </i>which is fallen under a burden, and shall we not 
    extend relief to those who are fallen under a worse burden of sin!" To let 
    others go on in sin securely—is not <i>charity </i>but <i>cruelty! </i>If a 
    man's house were on fire, and another should see it and not tell him of it 
    for fear of waking him—would not this be cruelty? Did he not deserve to be 
    warned? And when we see the souls of others sleeping the sleep of death and 
    the fire of God's wrath ready to burn about their ears—and we are silent, is 
    not this to be accessory to their death!</p>
<p align="justify">If men wish to go to hell—and we do not attempt to stop 
    them, is this love to their souls? Oh, I beseech you, if you have any 
    compassion—strengthen the weak, bring back the wandering, raise up those who 
    are fallen. "He who turns a sinner from the error of his way, will save his 
    soul from death and cover a multitude of sins." James 5:20</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Charity to the <font color="#0000ff"><b>needs </b></font>
    of others, which this text properly intends, consists of three things: </p>

<p align="justify">(1) a judicious consideration; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) a tender commiseration; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) a liberal contribution.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1 A judicious CONSIDERATION.</p></b></font> Psalm 41:1, 
    "Blessed is he who cares for the poor." And you must consider four things:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It might have been your own case. </p></b></font>You might 
    have stood in need of another's charity—and then how welcome and refreshing 
    would those streams have been to you!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Consider how sad a condition poverty is.</p></b></font> 
    Though Chrysostom calls poverty the highway to heaven, he who keeps this 
    road will go <i>weeping </i>there. Consider the poor. Behold their tears, 
    their sighs, their dying groans. Look upon the deep furrows made in their 
    faces and consider if there is not reason why you should scatter your seed 
    in these furrows. The poor man feeds upon sorrow, he drinks tears (Psalm 
    80:5). Like Jacob in a windy night—he has the clouds for his canopy, and a 
    stone for his pillow. Further, consider that oftentimes poverty becomes not 
    only a cross—but a snare. It exposes to much evil which made Agur pray, 
    "Give me not poverty" (Proverbs 30:8). Poverty puts men upon sinful courses. 
    The poor will venture their souls for money. If the rich would wisely 
    consider this, they might be a means of preventing much sin.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Consider why the wise God has ordained an inequality 
    in the world.</p></b></font> It is for this very reason, that He would have 
    charity exercised. If all were rich, there would be no need for alms nor 
    could the merciful man have been so well known. If he who traveled to 
    Jericho had not been wounded and left half dead, the good Samaritan who 
    poured wine and oil into his wounds would not have been known.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Consider how quickly the <i>balance of providence </i>
    may turn.</p></b></font> We ourselves may be brought to poverty, and then it 
    will be no small comfort to us that we relieved others while we were in a 
    capacity to do it. Ecclesiastes 11:2: "Give a portion to seven and also to 
    eight, for you know not what evil shall be upon the earth." We cannot always 
    promise ourselves halcyon days. God knows how soon any of us may change our 
    pasture. The cup which now runs over with wine—may be soon filled with the 
    waters of Marah. Ruth 1:21: "I went out full—and the Lord has brought me 
    home again empty." How many have we seen who are invested with great 
    lordships and possessions, who have, all of a sudden brought their manor 
    down to a morsel.
<p align="justify">It is wisdom in this sense to consider the poor. Remember 
    how soon the scene may alter, and we may be put in the poor's dress and, if 
    adversity comes, it will rejoice us to think that while we had an estate, we 
    laid it out upon Christ's indigent members.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the first thing in charity—a judicious 
    consideration. </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Second is a tender COMMISERATION. </p></b></font>The 
    Hebrew word for "mercy" signifies affections. Christ first had <i>compassion
    </i>on the multitude (Matthew 15:32), then He wrought a miracle to <i>feed
    </i>them. <i>Charity which lacks compassion, is brutish. </i>The brute 
    creatures can relieve us in many ways—but cannot pity us. It is a kind of 
    cruelty (said Quintilian) to <i>feed </i>one in need and not to <i>
    sympathize </i>with him. True religion begets <i>tenderness</i>. As it melts 
    the heart in tears of contrition towards God, so in affections of compassion 
    toward others. Isaiah 16:11: "My affections shall sound like a harp." When 
    your affections of pity sound, then your alms make sweet music in the ears 
    of God.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Charity consists of a liberal CONTRIBUTION.</p></b></font> 
    Isaiah 58:10: "Feed the hungry and help those in trouble." Deuteronomy 15:8: 
    "If there be a poor man within your gates, you shall open your hand <i>wide
    </i>unto him." The Hebrew word in the text signifies a largeness of bounty. 
    It must be like water which overflows the banks. If God has enriched you 
    with estates and made His candle (as Job said) to shine upon your 
    tabernacle, you must not encircle and engross all to yourselves—but be as 
    the moon which, having received its light from the sun, lets it shine to the 
    world. The ancients made <i>oil </i>to be the emblem of charity. The golden 
    oil of your mercy must, like Aaron's oil, run down upon the poor which are 
    the lower skirts of the garment.
<p align="justify">This liberal disbursement to the necessities of others, 
    God commands, and grace compels. There is an express statute in Leviticus 
    25:35: "'If one of your countrymen becomes poor and is unable to support 
    himself, then you shall relieve him." The Hebrew is, "You shall strengthen 
    him," or "put under him a <i>silver crutch </i>when he is falling."</p>
<p align="justify">It is worth our observation, what great care God took of 
    the poor besides what was given privately. God made many laws for the public 
    and visible relief of the poor, as in Exodus 23:11: "During the seventh year 
    let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may 
    get food from it. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove." 
    God's intention in this law was that the poor should be liberally provided 
    for. They might freely eat of anything which grew of itself the seventh 
    year, whether of herbs, vines, or olive trees.</p>
<p align="justify">Someone may ask how the poor could live only on these 
    fruits, there being (as it is probable) no corn growing then. Cajetan is of 
    the opinion they lived by selling these fruits and converting them into 
    money; so they lived upon the price of the fruits.</p>
<p align="justify">There is another law made in Leviticus 19:9: "When you 
    reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field 
    or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a 
    second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor 
    and the alien. I am the Lord your God." See how God indulged the poor. Some 
    corners of the field were for the poor's sake, to be left uncut; and when 
    the owners reaped they must not go too near the earth with their sickle. 
    Something like an after-crop must be left. The shorter ears of corn, and 
    such as lay bending to the ground, were to be reserved for the poor.</p>
<p align="justify">God made another law in favor of the poor, Deuteronomy 
    14:28-29: "At the end of every third year bring the tithe of all your crops 
    and store it in the nearest town. Give it to the Levites, who have no 
    inheritance among you, as well as to the foreigners living among you, the 
    orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied. 
    Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work." The Hebrews write 
    that every third year, besides the first tithe given to Levi, which was 
    called the perpetual tithe (Numbers 18:21), the Jews set apart another tithe 
    of their increase for the use of the widows and orphans; and that was called 
    the <i>tithe of the poor</i>. Besides, at the Jew's solemn festivals, the 
    poor were to have a share (Deuteronomy 16:11).</p>
<p align="justify">Relieving the necessities was commanded under the law, 
    and it stands in force under the gospel. 1 Timothy 6:17-18: "Charge those 
    who are rich in this world, that they do good, that they be rich in good 
    works." It is not only a <i>counsel </i>but a <i>charge</i>, and 
    non-attendance to it runs men into a gospel offense.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus we have seen the mind of God in this particular 
    charity. Let all good Christians comment upon it in their <i>practice</i>. 
    What benefit is there of gold while it is emboweled and locked up in the 
    mine? How is it better to have a great estate if it is so hoarded and 
    cloistered up, as to never see the light?</p>
<p align="justify">As God commands us, so grace compels us to works of mercy 
    and beneficence. 2 Corinthians 5:14: "The love of Christ constrains us." 
    Grace comes with majesty upon the heart. Grace is not in theory—but virtue. 
    Grace does not lie as a sleepy habit in the soul—but will put forth itself 
    in vigorous and glorious actions. Grace can no more be concealed, than fire. 
    Like new wine, it will have vent. Grace does not lie in the heart as a <i>
    stone </i>in the earth—but as <i>seed </i>in the earth; and it will spring 
    up into good works.</p>
<p align="justify">It may serve to justify the Church of England against the 
    calumny of malevolent men. The church of Rome lays upon us the aspersion 
    that we are against good works. Indeed, we plead not for the <i>merit </i>of 
    them—but we are for the <i>use </i>of them (Titus 3:14). Let us also learn 
    to maintain good works for necessary use.</p>
<p align="justify">We read the angels had <i>hands </i>under their wings 
    (Ezekiel 1:8). It may be an emblem of this truth: Christians must not only 
    have the wings of faith to fly—but hands under their wings to work the works 
    of mercy. "Everyone who trusts in God will be careful to do good deeds all 
    the time. These things are good and beneficial for everyone" (Titus 3:8).</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>lamp of faith </i>must be filled with the <i>oil 
    of charity</i>. Faith alone justifies—but justifying faith is not alone. You 
    may as well separate weight from lead or heat from fire—as works from faith. 
    Good works, though they are not the <i>causes </i>of salvation—yet they are
    <i>evidences</i> of salvation. Though they are not the <i>foundation</i>—yet 
    they are the <i>superstructure</i>. Faith must not be built upon works—but 
    works must be built upon faith. Romans 7:4: "You are united with the One who 
    was raised from the dead. As a result, you can produce good fruit, that is, 
    good deeds for God." <i>Faith is the spouse which marries Christ—and good 
    works are the children which faith bears! </i>For the vindication of the 
    doctrine of our church and in the honor of good works, I shall lay down 
    these four aphorisms.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Works are distinct from faith. </p></b></font>It is vain 
    to imagine that works are included in faith, as the diamond is enclosed in 
    the ring. They are distinct, as the sap in the vine is different from the 
    clusters that grow upon it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Works are the touchstone of faith. </p></b></font>"Show me 
    your faith by your works" (James 2:18). Works are faith's letters of 
    credence to show. If (said Bernard) you see a man full of good works, then, 
    by the rule of charity, you are not to doubt his faith. We judge the health 
    of the body by the <i>pulse</i>, where the blood stirs and operates. 
    Christian, judge the health of your faith—by the pulse of charity. It is 
    with faith as with a deed in law. To make a deed in law valid, there are 
    three things required: the writing, the seal, and the witnesses. So for the 
    trial and confirmation of faith, there must be these three things: the 
    writing (the Word of God), the seal (the Spirit of God), and the witnesses 
    (good works). Bring your faith to this <i>Scripture touchstone</i>. Faith 
    justifies works; works testify to faith.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Works honor faith—as the fruit adorns the tree.</p></b></font> 
    Let the liberality of your hand (said Clement of Alexandria) be the ornament 
    of your faith, and wear it as a holy bracelet about your wrists. "All who 
    heard of me praised me. All who saw me spoke well of me. For I helped the 
    poor in their need and the orphans who had no one to help them. I helped 
    those who had lost hope, and they blessed me. And I caused the widows' 
    hearts to sing for joy. All I did was just and honest. Righteousness covered 
    me like a robe, and I wore justice like a turban. I served as eyes for the 
    blind and feet for the lame. I was a father to the poor." Job 29:11-16. 
    While Job was pleading the cause of the poor, this was the ensign of his 
    honor; it clothed him as a robe and crowned him as a diadem. This is what 
    takes off the odium and obloquy from religion, and makes others speak well 
    of holiness—when they see good works as <i>handmaids </i>waiting upon this 
    queen.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Good works are in some sense more excellent than faith</p></b></font> 
    in two respects:
<b>
<p align="justify">First, because they are of a more noble diffusive nature.</p></b> 
    Though faith is more needful for <i>us</i>—yet works are more beneficial to
    <i>others</i>. Faith is a receptive grace, all for self-interest, and it 
    moves within its own sphere. Works are for the good of others. It is a more 
    blessed thing to give, than to receive.
<b>
<p align="justify">Second, good works are more visible and conspicuous than 
    faith.</p></b> Faith is a more <i>hidden </i>grace. It may lie hidden in the 
    heart and may not be seen—but when works are joined with it, it shines forth 
    in its native beauty. Though a garden is decked with flowers, they are not 
    seen until the <i>light </i>comes. So the heart of a Christian may be 
    enriched with faith—but it is like a <i>flower in the night</i>. It is not 
    seen until <i>works </i>come. When this light shines before men—then faith 
    appears in its orient colors.

<p align="justify">REPROOF.</p></b></font> If this is the effigy of a godly man, 
    that he is of a charitable disposition; then it sharply reproves those who 
    are far from this temper—who are all for <i>gathering, </i>but not for <i>
    dispersing</i>. They move only within the circle of their own interests—but 
    do not relieve the necessities of others. They have a <i>flourishing estate</i>—but, 
    like the man in the gospel, they have a <i>withered hand </i>and cannot 
    stretch it out to good uses. These are like the churl Nabal in 1 Samuel 
    25:11: "Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have 
    slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows 
    where?" 
<p align="justify">It was said of the Emperor Pertinaz that he had a large 
    empire—but a narrow, scanty heart. There was a temple at Athens which was 
    called the <i>temple of mercy</i>. It was dedicated to charitable uses, and 
    the greatest reproach was to upbraid one—that he had never been in the <i>
    temple of mercy</i>. It is the greatest disgrace to a Christian to be 
    unmerciful.</p>
<p align="justify">Covetous men, while they <i>enrich </i>themselves, <i>
    debase </i>themselves, setting up a monopoly and committing <i>idolatry with 
    mammon</i>, thus making themselves lower than men.</p>
<p align="justify">In the time of pestilence it is sad to have your <i>
    houses </i>shut up—but it is worse to have your <i>hearts </i>shut up. 
    Covetous people are like the Leviathan in Job 41:24—<i>their hearts are hard 
    as a stone</i>. You may as well extract oil out of a flint—as the golden oil 
    of charity out of their flinty hearts! <i>Coldness of the heart </i>is a 
    presage of death. When men's affections toward works of mercy are frozen, 
    this coldness of heart is ominous and sadly portends that they are dead in 
    sin. We read in the law, that the <i>shellfish </i>was accounted as unclean. 
    This is probably because the meat of it was enclosed in the shell and was 
    hard to come by. They are to be reckoned among the <i>unclean </i>who 
    enclose all their estate within the shell of their own cabinet, and will not 
    let others be the better for it. How many have <i>lost </i>their souls by 
    being so <i>saving!</i></p>

<p align="justify">There are some who, perhaps, will give the poor good <i>
    words</i>—and that is all. James 2:15-16: "Suppose a brother or sister is 
    without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, 'Go, I wish you 
    well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, 
    what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied 
    by action, is dead." James 2:15-17. Good <i>words </i>are but a cold kind of 
    charity. The poor cannot live as the chameleon, upon this air. Let your 
    words be as smooth as oil—yet they will not heal the wounded. Let them drop 
    as the honeycomb, they will not feed the hungry. </p>
<p align="justify">"Though I speak with the tongue of angels and have not 
    charity, I am but as a tinkling cymbal" (1 Corinthians 13:1). It is better 
    to be <i>charitable </i>as a saint—than <i>eloquent </i>as an angel. Such as 
    are cruel to the poor, let me tell you—you "unChristian" yourselves.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Unmercifulness is the sin of the heathen</p></i>, Romans 
    1:31. While you put off the affections of charity, you put off the badge of 
    Christianity. James speaks a sad word in James 2:13: "for he shall have 
    judgment without mercy—who showed no mercy." Dives denied Lazarus a <i>crumb 
    of bread</i>—and Dives was denied a <i>drop of water </i>at the last day. 
    Behold the sinner's indictment in Matthew 25:42: "I was hungry and you gave 
    Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a 
    stranger and you didn’t take Me in; I was naked and you didn’t clothe Me, 
    sick and in prison and you didn’t take care of Me." Christ does not say, 
    "You took away My food," but "You gave Me nothing to eat. You did not feed 
    My members." Then follows the sentence, "Depart from Me, you who are cursed, 
    into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels!"
<p align="justify">If Christ's poor come to your doors—and you bid them 
    depart from you; the time may come when you shall knock at heaven's gate—and 
    Christ will say, "Go from My door; depart from Me, you who are cursed."</p>
<p align="justify">In short, covetousness is a <i>foolish </i>sin. God gave 
    the rich man in the gospel the appellation, "You fool!" (Luke 12:20). The 
    covetous man does not enjoy what he possesses. He embitters his own life. He 
    occupies himself with care either how to <i>get</i>, or how to <i>increase</i>, 
    or how to <i>secure </i>an estate; and what is the outcome and result? 
    Often, as a just reward of sordid penuriousness, God blasts and withers him 
    in his outward estate. The saying of Gregory Nazianzen is to be seriously 
    weighed: "God many times lets the thief take away and the moth consume that 
    which is injuriously and uncharitably withheld from the poor."</p>
<p align="justify">I am sorry that any professors should be impeached as 
    guilty of this <i>sin of covetousness and unmercifulness</i>. Sure I am, 
    that God's elect are merciful people. (Colossians 3:12). I tell you, these
    <i>devout misers </i>are the reproach of Christianity! They are <i>warts </i>
    and <i>spots </i>on the face of true religion. Truly, I know not well what 
    to make of them!</p>
<p align="justify">Aelian, in his history, reports that in India there is a
    <i>griffin </i>having four feet and two wings, with a bill like an eagle. It 
    is hard to decide whether to rank him among the <i>beasts </i>or the <i>fowl</i>. 
    So I may say of <i>penurious votaries</i>: they have the <i>wings of 
    profession</i>, by which they seem to fly to heaven—but the <i>feet of 
    beasts—</i>walking on the earth and even licking the dust! It is hard to 
    know where to rank these, whether among the godly or the wicked. Take heed 
    that, if your religion will not destroy your covetousness, that at last, 
    your covetousness does not destroy your religion.</p>
<p align="justify">The fable tells us a story of the <i>hedgehog </i>that 
    came to the conies' burrows in stormy weather and desired harbor, promising 
    that he would be a quiet guest. Once he had gotten entertainment, he set up 
    his prickles and never left until he had thrust the poor conies out of their 
    burrows. So it is with covetousness: though it has many fair pleas to 
    insinuate and wind itself into the heart, as soon as you let it in—this 
    thorn will never stop pricking until it has choked all good beginnings and 
    thrust all religion out of your heart!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">EXHORTATION 1.</p></b></font> I beseech all who hear me this 
    day to put on affections of mercies, to be ready to relieve the miseries and 
    necessities of others. Ambrose calls <i>charity "</i>the sum of 
    Christianity". The Apostle James (1:27) makes it the very definition of 
    religion: "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this—to 
    visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction." The poor are, as 
    it were, in the grave—the <i>comfort </i>of their life is <i>buried</i>. 
    Help with your merciful hands to raise them out of the sepulcher. God sends 
    His <i>springs </i>into the <i>valleys </i>(Psalm 104:10). Let the springs 
    of your charity run among the <i>valleys of poverty</i>. Your sweetest and 
    most gracious influences should fall upon the <i>lower grounds</i>. What is 
    all your <i>seeming devotion, </i>without bounty and mercifulness?
<p align="justify">I have known many (said Basil) who <i>pray </i>and <i>
    fast</i>—but do not relieve those who as are in distress. They are for a 
    zeal which puts them to no expense. What are they the better (said he) for 
    all their <i>seeming virtue?</i></p>

<p align="justify">We read that the incense was to be laid upon the <i>fire
    </i>(Leviticus 16:13). The <i>flame of devotion </i>must be perfumed with 
    the <i>incense of charity</i>. Aaron was to have a <i>bell </i>and a <i>
    pomegranate</i>. The <i>pomegranate </i>(as some of the learned observe) was 
    a symbol of good works. They lack the pomegranate (said Gregory Nazianzen) 
    who have no good works. The wise men not only bowed the knee to Christ—but 
    presented Him with gold, myrrh, and frankincense (Matthew 2:11). <i>
    Pretenses of zeal </i>are insufficient. We must not only worship Christ—but 
    bestow something upon His members. This is to present Christ with gold and 
    frankincense. Isaac would not bless Jacob by the <i>voice</i>—but he <i>felt
    </i>and <i>handled </i>him, and supposing them to be Esau's hands—he blessed 
    him. God will not bless you by your voice, your loud prayers, or your devout 
    discourses—but<i> if He feels Esau's hands</i>, if your hands have wrought 
    good works—then He will bless you.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me exhort you, therefore, to <i>deeds of mercy</i>. 
    Let your fingers drop with the <i>myrrh of liberality</i>. Sow your <i>
    golden </i>seed. In this sense, it is lawful to put out your money—when you 
    lay it out for good uses. Remember that excellent saying of Augustine, <i>
    "Give those things to the poor which you cannot keep—that you may receive 
    those things which you cannot lose."</i></p>

<p align="justify">There are many <i>occasions </i>for exercising your pious 
    charity: hear the <i>orphan's </i>cry; pity the <i>widow's </i>tears. There 
    are some who need <i>employment</i>, so it would do well to set their wheel 
    a-going. Others who are past employment. Be as eyes to the blind and feet to 
    the lame. Some whole families will sink—if your merciful hands do not help 
    to shore them up.</p>
<p align="justify">I cannot be unmindful of the Christian universities—which 
    are the nurseries of the church. They may be compared to that Persian 
    tree—which <i>buds</i>, <i>blossoms </i>and bears ripe <i>fruit </i>at the 
    same time. Oh, let these plants be watered with your silver drops! Cast not 
    salt—but <i>gold </i>into these springs, that from thence may flow forth 
    many celestial streams both of <i>learning </i>and <i>piety—</i>to refresh 
    this city of our God.</p>
<p align="justify">Before I come to press you with arguments to liberality 
    and munificence, there are three objections in the way which I shall 
    endeavor to remove.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 1.</p></b></font> "We may give, and so in time 
    ourselves come to need." Let Basil answer this, "<i>Wells </i>which have 
    their water drawn—spring ever more freely." Proverbs 11:25: "The <i>liberal
    </i>soul shall be made fat." There is nothing lost—by doing our duty. An 
    estate may be <i>imparted, </i>yet not <i>impaired</i>. The <i>flowers </i>
    yield honey to the bee—yet their own fruit is not harmed. When the <i>candle
    </i>of prosperity shines upon us—we may give light to our neighbor who is in 
    the dark—and have never the less light ourselves. Whatever is disbursed to
    <i>pious </i>uses, God brings it back in some other way, as the <i>loaves
    </i>multiplied in breaking, or as the <i>widow's oil </i>increased by 
    pouring it out. 1 Kings 17:16.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 2.</p></b> </font>"I cannot do so much as 
    others—erect churches, build hospitals, augment libraries, or maintain 
    scholars at the university."
<p align="justify">If you cannot do <i>much</i>—do <i>something!</i> The <i>
    widow's two mites </i>cast into the treasury were accepted by Christ. He did 
    not look at the smallness of her <i>gift</i>—but the largeness of her <i>
    heart!</i> In the law, for him who could not bring a lamb for an offering, 
    it sufficed if he brought two turtle-doves. We read in Exodus 35 that the 
    people brought <i>gold </i>and <i>silver </i>and <i>goat's hair </i>for the 
    building of the tabernacle. On which place, said Origen, "I desire, Lord, to 
    bring something to the building of Your temple; if not <i>gold </i>to make 
    the mercy seat, if not <i>silk </i>to make the curtains—yet <i>a little 
    goat's hair </i>that I may not be found in the number of those who brought 
    nothing to Your temple."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 3. </p></b></font>"I have nothing to bestow upon 
    the necessities of others." Do you have money to feed your lust and 
    pride—and nothing to relieve the poor members of Christ? Let us admit this 
    excuse to be real, that you have no such estate—yet you may <b>do </b>
    something wherein you may express your mercy to the poor. You may <i>
    sympathize </i>with them, <i>pray </i>for them, or <i>speak </i>a word of 
    comfort to them. Isaiah 40:2 says, "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem." If you 
    can give them no gold—you may speak a word in season which may be as apples 
    of gold in pictures of silver. You may be helpful to the poor by stirring up 
    others who do have estates, to relieve them. If a man is hungry, the wind 
    will not fill him—but it can blow the sails of the mill and make it grind 
    corn for the use of man. Just so, though you have no estate yourself to help 
    those in need, you may stir up others to help them. You may blow the sails 
    of their affections, causing them to show mercy—and so may help your brother 
    by a proxy.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">EXHORTATION 2.</p></b></font> Having answered these 
    objections, let me pursue the exhortation to mercy and liberality. I shall 
    lay down <i>several arguments </i>which I desire you to weigh in the balance 
    of reason and conscience.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">To be <i>diffusively good </i>is the great end of our 
    creation. </p></b></font>Ephesians 2:10 says we are created in Christ Jesus unto 
    good works. Every creature answers the end of its creation. The <i>star </i>
    shines, the <i>bird </i>sings, the <i>plant </i>bears fruit, the end of <i>
    our life </i>is service. He who does not answer his end in respect of <i>
    usefulness</i>, cannot enjoy his end in respect of <i>happiness</i>. Many, 
    says Seneca, have been long in the world—but have not lived. They have done 
    no good for others. A selfish person is good for nothing, but to cumber the 
    ground and—because he is barren of good works—he shall be fruitful in 
    curses.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">By this we resemble God, who is a God of mercy.</p></b></font> 
    He is said to <i>delight </i>in mercy (Micah 7:18). "His mercies are over 
    all His works" (Psalm 145:9). He requites <i>good </i>for evil. Like the 
    clouds which receive ill vapors from us—but return them to us again in sweet 
    showers, there is not a creature alive—but tastes of the mercies of God! 
    "Every <i>bird</i>," said Ambrose, "does in its kind sing hymns of praise to 
    God for His bounty—but <i>men </i>and <i>angels</i>, in a more peculiar 
    manner, taste the cream and quintessence of God's mercies."
<p align="justify">What temporal mercies have you received? Every time you 
    draw your breath—you suck in God's mercy; every bit of bread you eat—the 
    hand of God's mercy carves it to you. You never drink, but in a golden cup 
    of mercy. What <i>spiritual </i>mercies has God invested some of you with? 
    Pardon, adoption, saving mercy. The picture of God's mercy, can never be 
    drawn to the full. You cannot take the <i>breadth </i>of His mercy, for it 
    is infinite; nor the <i>height </i>of it, for it reaches above the clouds; 
    nor the <i>length </i>of it, for it is from everlasting to everlasting 
    (Psalm 103:17). The works of mercy are the glory of the Godhead. Moses 
    prayed, "Lord, show me Your <i>glory</i>." God said, "I will make all My <i>
    goodness </i>to pass before you" (Exodus 33:18-19). God accounts Himself 
    most glorious, in the shining robes of His mercy. Now, by <i>works </i>of 
    mercy, we resemble the <i>God </i>of mercy. We are bid to draw our lines 
    according to Luke 6:36: "Be merciful—as your Father also is merciful."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Alms are a sacrifice.</p></b></font> Hebrews 13:16: "Don't 
    forget to do good and to share what you have with those in need, for such <i>
    sacrifices </i>are very pleasing to God." When you are <i>distributing </i>
    to the poor, it is as if you were <i>praying</i>, as if you were <i>
    worshiping </i>God. There are two sorts of sacrifices: <i>expiatory </i>
    sacrifices (the sacrifice of Christ's blood); and <i>thank offerings </i>
    (the sacrifice of alms). This, said holy Greenham, is more acceptable to God 
    than any other sacrifice. Acts 10:4: "The angel said to Cornelius, 'Your 
    acts of charity have come up as a memorial offering before God." The backs 
    of the poor are the <i>altar </i>on which this <i>sacrifice </i>is to be 
    offered up!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">We ourselves live upon alms. </p></b></font>Other creatures 
    liberally contribute to our necessities. The <i>sun </i>has not its light 
    for itself—but for us. It enriches us with its golden beams; the <i>earth
    </i>brings us a fruitful crop. The Psalmist says, "The valleys are covered 
    with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing" (Psalm 65:13). One creature 
    gives us wool, another oil, another silk. We are glad to go begging to the 
    creation. Shall every creature be for the good of man—and man alone, be for 
    himself alone?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">We are to extend our liberality by virtue of a shared 
    membership.</p></b></font> Isaiah 58:7: "I want you to share your food with the 
    hungry and to welcome poor wanderers into your homes. Give clothes to those 
    who need them, and do not hide from your own flesh and blood, who need your 
    help." The poor are fellow members of the same body. The members, by a law 
    of equity and sympathy, contribute one to another.
<p align="justify">The <i>eye </i>conveys light to the body, the <i>heart
    </i>blood, the <i>head </i>spirits. It is a dead member in the body, which 
    does not communicate to the rest. Thus it is also in the body of Christ. Let 
    no man think it is too far below him, to mind the needs and necessities of 
    others. It is a pity that the hand should disdain to pluck a thorn out of 
    the foot. It is spoken in the honor of that renowned princess, the Empress 
    of Theodosius, that she herself visited the sick and prepared relief for 
    them with her own imperial hands.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">We are not <i>owners </i>of an estate—but <i>stewards</i>.</p></b></font> 
    Soon we may hear, "Give an account of your <i>stewardship</i>, for you may 
    be no longer steward" (Luke 16:2). An estate is a <i>talent </i>to trade 
    with. It is as dangerous to <i>hide </i>our talent—as to <i>waste </i>it 
    (Matthew 25:25-30). If the covetous man keeps his gold too long, it will 
    begin to rust—and the rust of it will witness against him.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Recall the <i>examples </i>of others who have been famous 
    and renowned for acts of charity.</p></b></font> Our Lord Christ was a great 
    example of charity. He was not more full of <i>merit, </i>than of <i>bounty</i>. 
    Trajan, the emperor, tore off a piece of his own royal robe, to wrap his 
    soldiers' wounds. Christ did more: He made a <i>medicine </i>of His body and 
    blood to heal us. Isaiah 53:5: "By <i>His stripes </i>we are healed." Here 
    was a pattern of charity without parallel.
<p align="justify">The <b>Jews </b>are noted in this respect. It is a 
    rabbinical observation that those who live devoutly among the Jews 
    distribute a tenth part of their estate among the poor, and they give freely 
    (said Philo, the Jew) as if by giving they hope to receive some great 
    gratuity. Now if the Jews are so devoted to works of mercy, who live without 
    the Messiah, shall not we much more, who profess our faith in the blessed 
    Messiah?</p>
<p align="justify">Let me tell you of some <b>heathens</b>. I have read that 
    Titus Vespasian, who was so accustomed to works of mercy that, remembering 
    he had given nothing that day, cried out, "I have lost a day!" It is 
    reported of some of the Turks that they have servants whom they employ for 
    the sole purpose to send relief to the poor. The Turks have a saying in 
    their Koran, that if men knew what a blessed thing it was to distribute 
    alms—they would give some of their own flesh to relieve the poor; and shall 
    not a Christian's creed be better than a Turk's Koran!</p>
<p align="justify">Beloved, we are not left this day without witness. I 
    desire to speak it to the glory of God, and the renown of this city—that 
    there has been, both in the days of our worthy ancestors, and still to this 
    day among many of you—a spirit of sympathy and compassion.</p>
<p align="justify">When poor indigent creatures have been as Moses, laid in 
    the ark of bulrushes, ready to sink in the waters of affliction, you have 
    sent temporal favors to them, and have drawn them out of the waters with a
    <i>golden </i>cord. When they have been ready to make their own grave, you 
    have built them hospitals. The <i>milk of your charity </i>has nursed 
    them—and while they have sat under your vines, they have eaten the sweet 
    grape! We read that they showed Peter the garments and coats which Dorcas 
    made (Acts 9:39). May we not this day behold the coats which have been made 
    to clothe the indigent? Go on still to do worthily, and, by your acts of 
    munificence, to emblazon your coat of arms and eternalize your fame!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I shall use one more argument to persuade to charity, and 
    that is the REWARD which follows alms-deeds. </p></b></font>Giving alms is a 
    glorious work, and, let me tell you, it is a fruitful work. They who <i>sow
    </i>mercy—shall <i>reap </i>mercy<i>. Whatever is disbursed to the poor, is 
    given to Christ! </i>Matthew 25:40: "Whatever you did for one of the least 
    of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me!" The poor man's hand is <i>
    Christ's treasury</i>—and there is nothing lost, which is put there.
<p align="justify">There is a <font color="#b07050"><b>reward in this life</b></font>. 
    The charitable man is crowned with a blessing. He is:</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed in his PERSON. Psalm 41:1: "Blessed is he who 
    considers the poor." God casts a favorable aspect upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed in his NAME. So it is in the text: his horn shall 
    be exalted with honor. Also Psalm 112:6: "He shall be had in everlasting 
    remembrance." His name shall be gloriously embalmed.</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed in his ESTATE. Proverbs 11:25: "The liberal soul 
    shall be made fat." He shall not only have the <i>venison</i>—but the <i>
    blessing</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed in his POSTERITY. Psalm 37:26: "He is ever 
    merciful and lends, and his seed is blessed." He shall not only leave an <i>
    estate </i>behind—but a <i>blessing </i>behind to his children; and God will 
    see that the estate shall not be cut off.</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed in his NEGOTIATIONS. Deuteronomy 15:10: "Give 
    freely without begrudging it, and the Lord your God will bless you in 
    everything you do!" The charitable man shall be blessed in his building, 
    planting, journeying; whatever he is about—a blessing shall empty itself 
    upon him. He shall be a prosperous man; the <i>honeycomb of a blessing </i>
    shall be still dropping upon him!</p>
<p align="justify">Blessed with LONG LIFE. Psalm 41:2: "The Lord will 
    preserve him and keep him alive." He has helped to keep others alive—and God 
    will keep hint alive. Is there anything then, lost by charity? It spins out 
    the silver thread of life. Many are taken away the sooner for their 
    unmercifulness; because their <i>hearts </i>are not charitable, their lives 
    are shortened.</p>
<p align="justify">The great reward is in the <font color="#b07050"><b>life 
    to come</b></font>. Aristotle joined these two together, <i>liberality </i>
    and <i>usefulness</i>. God will reward the merciful man, though not <i>for
    </i>his works—yet <i>according </i>to his works. Revelation 20:12: "I saw 
    the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened and 
    the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, <i>
    according to their works</i>." As God has a bottle to put your <i>tears </i>
    in—so He has a book to write your <i>alms </i>in! As God will put a veil 
    over His people's <i>sins</i>—so He will set a crown upon their <i>works</i>. 
    The way to lay <i>up—</i>is to lay <i>out</i>. Other parts of your estate 
    you leave behind—but that which is given to Christ's poor, is hoarded up in 
    heaven! That is a blessed kind of giving which, though it makes the <i>purse
    </i>lighter—makes the <i>crown </i>heavier.</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever alms you distribute, you shall have good 
    security. Proverbs 19:17: "He who gives to the poor lends to the Lord, and 
    that which he has given will He pay him again." There is God's pledge to 
    save you from being the loser for your charity. Yet here is our unbelief and 
    atheism: we will not take God's pledge. We commonly put our <i>deeds of 
    mercy </i>among our desperate debts.</p>
<p align="justify">You shall be paid with an <b>abundance</b>. For a <i>
    wedge of gold </i>which you have parted with—you shall have a <i>weight of 
    glory! </i>For a<i> cup of cold water</i>—you shall have <i>rivers of 
    pleasure </i>which run at God's right hand forevermore! The <i>interest </i>
    comes to infinitely more than the <i>principal</i>. Pliny writes of a 
    country in Africa where the people, for every bushel of seed they sow, 
    receive a hundred and fifty-fold increase. Just so, for every <i>penny </i>
    you drop into Christ's treasury—you shall receive above a thousandfold 
    increase. Your after-crop of glory will be so great that, though you are 
    still reaping, you will never be able to come to the end the whole harvest. 
    Let this persuade rich men to honor the Lord with their substance.</p>
<p align="justify">Before I conclude, let me briefly lay down some <b>RULES</b> 
    concerning your charity—that it may be the sacrifice of a sweet-smelling 
    savor to God.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 1. Your charity must be FREE. </p></b></font>Deuteronomy 
    15:10: "Give freely without begrudging it, and the Lord your God will bless 
    you in everything you do." That is, you shall not be troubled at parting 
    with your money. He who gives <i>grievingly </i>gives <i>grudgingly</i>. 
    Charity must flow like spring water—freely. The heart must be the spring, 
    the hand the pipe, the poor the cistern. God loves a <i>cheerful </i>giver. 
    You must not give to the poor as if you were delivering your purse to the 
    highway robber. Charity without willingness, is rather a <i>fine </i>than an
    <i>offering</i>. It is rather doing <i>penance </i>than giving alms. Charity 
    must be like the myrrh which <i>drops </i>from the tree without cutting or 
    forcing.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 2. We must give that which is our own.</p></b></font> 
    Isaiah 58:7: "Share <i>your </i>bread with the hungry, bring the poor and 
    homeless into <i>your </i>house." The word for "alms" in the Syriac 
    signifies "justice". To show that alms must be of that which is justly 
    gotten, the Scripture puts them together. "To do <i>justice</i>, to love <i>
    mercy</i>" (Micah 6:8), we must not make a <i>sacrilege </i>of sacrifice. 
    Isaiah 61:8: "For I the Lord love justice; I hate robbery and injustice." He 
    who shall build a hospital with ill-gotten goods, displays the insignia of 
    his pride and sets up the monument of his shame!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 3. Do all IN Christ and FOR Christ. </p></b></font>Labor 
    that your persons may be in Christ. We are accepted in Him (Ephesians 1:6). 
    Origen, Chrysostom, and Peter Martyr affirm that the all works, not 
    springing from a root of faith—are lost.
<p align="justify">The Pelagians thought to have posed Augustine with the 
    question whether it was sin in the heathen to clothe the naked. Augustine 
    answered rightly, "The doing of good is not in itself simply evil—but, 
    proceeding of infidelity, it becomes evil." Titus 1:15: "To those who are 
    unbelieving, nothing is pure." That fruit is most sweet and genuine which is 
    brought forth in the vine (John 15:4). Outside of Christ—all our alms and 
    charities are but the fruit of the wild olive. They are not <i>good </i>
    works—but <i>dead </i>works.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 4. Do all for Christ, for His sake, that you may 
    testify to your love for Him.</p></b></font> Love mellows and ripens our alms 
    deeds; it makes them a precious perfume to God. As Mary, out of love, 
    brought her ointments and sweet spices to anoint Christ's dead body; so, out 
    of love for Christ, bring your ointments and anoint His living body, His 
    saints and members.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 5. Works of mercy are to be done in HUMILITY.</p></b></font> 
    Away with ostentation! The <i>worm </i>breeds in the fairest fruit, the <i>
    moth </i>in the finest cloth. Pride will be creeping into our most holy 
    things. Beware of this <i>dead fly </i>in the box of ointment. When Moses' 
    face shone, he put a veil over it; so while your light shines before men, 
    and they see your good works—cover yourselves with the veil of humility. As 
    the silkworm weaves her fancy works, and <i>hides </i>herself within the 
    silk and is not seen—so we should hide ourselves from pride and vainglory.
<p align="justify">It was the sin of the Pharisees that, while they were 
    distributing alms, they blew the trumpet (Matthew 6:2). They did not <i>give
    </i>their alms—but <i>sold </i>them for applause. A proud man casts his 
    bread upon the waters, as the fisherman casts his rod upon the waters—he 
    angles for vainglory.</p>
<p align="justify">I have read of Cosmos Medices, a rich citizen of 
    Florence, who confessed to a near friend of his, that he built so many 
    magnificent structures, and spent so much on libraries, not for any love of 
    learning—but to raise up for himself the trophies of <i>fame </i>and <i>
    renown</i>. A humble soul <i>denies </i>himself, yes, even <i>annihilates
    </i>himself. He thinks how little it is he can do for God, and, if he could 
    do more, it would be but a due debt. Therefore he looks upon all his works 
    as if he had done nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">The saints are brought in at the last day as <i>disowning
    </i>their works of charity. "Then the righteous will answer Him—Lord, when 
    did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to 
    drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or without clothes 
    and clothe You? When did we see You sick, or in prison, and visit You?" 
    Matthew 25:37-39. A good Christian not only empties his hand of alms—but 
    empties his <i>heart of pride</i>. While he raises the poor out of the 
    dust—he lays himself in the dust. Works of mercy must be like the <i>cassia</i>—which 
    is a sweet spice, but grows low. </p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 6. Dispose your alms PRUDENTLY.</p></b></font> It is 
    said of the merciful man, that he orders his affairs with discretion (Psalm 
    112:5). There is a great deal of wisdom in distinguishing between those who 
    have <i>sinned </i>themselves into poverty—and those who, by the hand of 
    God, are <i>brought </i>into poverty. Discretion in the distribution of alms 
    consists in two things: in finding a fit <i>object </i>and in taking the fit
    <i>season</i>.
<p align="justify">In finding a fit <b>OBJECT</b>. Give to those who are in 
    most need. Raise the hedge where it is lowest; feed the lamp which is going 
    out. Give to those who most in dire need. Though we bestow cost and dressing 
    upon a <i>weak </i>plant—yet not upon a <i>dead </i>plant. Help such as may 
    help to build the house of Israel (Ruth 4:11). Those who may be <i>pillars
    </i>in church and state, not <i>caterpillars</i>, make your charity to 
    flourish.</p>
<p align="justify">In taking the fit <b>SEASON</b>. Give to charitable uses 
    in time of health and prosperity. Distribute your silver and gold to the 
    poor before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken 
    (Ecclesiastes 12:6). Make your <i>hands </i>your executors, not as some who 
    reserve all they give until after they expire. Truly, what is then bestowed 
    is not <i>given </i>away—but <i>taken </i>away by death. It is not <i>
    charity </i>but <i>necessity</i>. Do not marry yourselves to money—so that 
    you are resolved that nothing shall part you but death. The miser is never 
    good—until he is rotted in the grave. A covetous man receives money—but 
    parts with none until death breaks his money-box in pieces, and then the 
    silver and gold come tumbling out. Give in time of health. These are the 
    alms which God takes notice of, and, as Calvin said, He puts into His book 
    of accounts.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">RULE 7. Give THANKFULLY.</p></b></font> They should be more 
    thankful who <i>give </i>alms—than they who <i>receive </i>alms. We should, 
    said Nazianzen, give a thank offering to God that we are in the number of <i>
    givers—</i>and not <i>receivers</i>. Bless God for a willing heart. To have 
    not only a good estate—but a good heart, is a matter for thankfulness. Set 
    the crown of your thankfulness upon the head of free grace!
