<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>The Crown of 
    Righteousness</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">A sermon preached on May 1, 1656, at the funeral of 
    Thomas Hodges</p>
<p align="justify">"Those who honor Me—I will honor." 1 Samuel 2:30</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b></b></font>
<p align="justify">To my honored friend, Mrs. Mary Hodges,<br/>
    It was not my intention when I preached this sermon, that it should go any 
    further than the pulpit. But seeing you were pleased to request me to print 
    it, that I might herein gratify your desire and exhibit testimonial of that 
    respect which I bore to your deceased husband, I was willing to make it more 
    public, and may the Lord make it profitable. </p>
<p align="justify">You are sensible enough, I doubt not, of the late loss 
    you have sustained. I therefore chose to treat this subject that I might 
    revive you with the hope of future gain, not forgetting that saying in 
    Proverbs 31:6, "Give wine to those who are of heavy heart."</p>
<p align="justify">The Jews have this form of speech at their funerals 
    whereby they would cheer up the surviving party: "Let your consolation be in
    <i>heaven</i>." So I say to you, look up to heaven! Let the <i>crown </i>
    laid up for you, comfort you! May the Lord help you to make a sanctified use 
    of this sad stroke of providence.</p>
<p align="justify">Learn, dear friend—to make sure of Christ—when you cannot 
    make sure of other relations. Faith will contract you to Christ, and if your
    <i>Maker </i>is your <i>Husband</i>, death shall not <i>dissolve</i>—but <i>
    perfect </i>the union. We break our <i>earthly comforts, </i>when we <i>lean
    </i>too hard on them! but I must not expatiate.</p>
<p align="justify">I have here presented you with the sermon as I preached 
    it, only I have cast in some few additional things which, through straits of 
    time, I was then forced to omit. May the blessing of the Almighty rest upon 
    you, and let that <i>golden oil </i>be poured out upon your posterity. So 
    prays,</p>
<p align="justify">Your faithful friend and servant in the Lord, <br/>
    Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    "Henceforth there is laid up for me a<i> crown of righteousness</i>, which 
    the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day!" 2 Timothy 4:8</p>
<p align="justify">The wise God, that He may invite and encourage the sons 
    of men to holiness of life, is pleased to set before their eyes the 
    recompense of <i>reward</i>, that if the equity of His <i>precepts </i>does 
    not prevail, the excellency of His <i>promise </i>may. God will have His 
    people to be volunteers in piety—not forced with fear—but drawn with love. 
    Therefore He works upon them in such a way as is most alluring and 
    persuasive. He would catch men with a <i>golden bait, </i>and <i>allure them 
    to obedience </i>by showing them what is laid up in heaven for them. So says 
    the text, "Henceforth there is laid up for me a<i> crown of righteousness</i>." 
    A crown? Oh, infinite! For a <i>delinquent </i>to have a <i>pardon </i>is 
    well—but to have a <i>crown </i>set upon him is no less rare, than 
    stupendous!</p>
<p align="justify">A true saint has a double crown—one in this life, the 
    other <i>laid up. </i>In this life he has a crown of <i>acceptance</i>. 
    Ephesians 1:6: "He has made us accepted in the Beloved." Some render it, "He 
    has made us favorites." Here is the crown of acceptance; and in the life to 
    come a crown of righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>glory of heaven </i>is represented in Scripture 
    under various similes and metaphors. Sometimes heaven is compared to a <i>
    place of rest</i>, as in Hebrews 4:9. Sometimes it is compared to a <i>house 
    not made with hands </i>(2 Corinthians 5:1). Sometimes it is compared to an
    <i>inheritance in light </i>(Colossians 1:12). In our text the glory of 
    heaven is set forth by a <i>crown</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>circle </i>is the most perfect figure. This 
    blessed <i>crown </i>encircles within it all perfection. I shall first break 
    up the ground of the text by explanation, and then come to sow the seed of 
    doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">"Henceforth." First, it may bear date from the time of 
    the Apostle's conversion, <i>henceforth there is laid up a crown</i>. As 
    soon as a man is implanted into Christ, he stands entitled to a crown. Or, 
    secondly, this word <i>henceforth </i>may relate to the end of his race and 
    fight. Paul had run through all the several stages of Christianity. He had 
    finished his course, and from henceforth, he said, there was laid up a 
    crown. He knew his work was done, and there was nothing now remaining but to 
    step out of the world—and put on his crown! <i>"There is laid up for me a 
    crown of righteousness."</i></p>

<p align="justify">QUESTION. Why a crown of <i>righteousness</i>? It is a 
    crown of <i>mercy</i>—a crown which <i>free grace </i>bestows. Why, then, is 
    it called a crown of righteousness?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. <i>Negatively</i>, not that we can, by <i>our
    </i>righteousness, <i>merit </i>this crown. The Apostle makes a clear 
    distinction between a reward bestowed by <i>merit</i>—and by <i>grace</i>. 
    Romans 6:23: "The <i>gift </i>of God is eternal life." Had the reward been 
    by <i>merit</i>, the Apostle would have said, "The <i>wages </i>of God is 
    eternal life." Alas! How can we <i>merit </i>a heavenly crown? Before we 
    merit, we must satisfy the justice of God for our sin; but we have nothing 
    to satisfy. How can <i>finite obedience </i>satisfy <i>infinite justice</i>? 
    Besides, what equality is there between our <i>service </i>and the <i>
    eternal reward</i>? What proportion is there between the shedding of a <i>
    tear</i>—and the receiving of a <i>crown</i>? So we cannot, by our 
    righteousness, merit this crown.</p>
<p align="justify">2. <i>Affirmatively</i>, it is called a crown of 
    righteousness in a double sense. First, because it is a crown <i>promised</i>. 
    Revelation 2:10: "I will give you a crown." Since God made this promise, it 
    is a righteous thing to bestow this crown on us. </p>
<p align="justify">Second, it is a crown of righteousness because it is a 
    crown <i>purchased</i>. It is a crown bought with the price of blood! It was 
    so <i>bought </i>as it was given, else where was God's mercy? And it was so
    <i>given </i>as it was bought, else where was God's Justice? This crown 
    swims to us through the blood of a Savior! When Christ was hanging upon the 
    cross, He was purchasing a crown for us! And in this sense it is a crown of 
    righteousness. It is righteous with God to give us the crown, which Jesus 
    Christ has paid for so dearly.</p>
<p align="justify">3. This crown is said to be "laid up." The crown is kept 
    in reversion. God does not presently broach the full vessels of glory. He 
    does not presently install us into our honor. It is a crown <i>laid up. </i>
    The saints are heirs under age. God does not crown them until they are of 
    age. The sons of kings are often crowned during their minority, some have 
    been crowned in the cradle—but the heirs of glory must be of perfect stature 
    before they are crowned. God will give His children the ring and the 
    bracelets here—some of the <i>comforts </i>of His Spirit—but not the <i>
    crown</i>. We are all for immediate pay. We are still putting off our <i>
    repentance</i>—yet would be putting on our <i>crown</i>. God will have us 
    wait awhile. The crown is "laid up."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION.<b> WHY is it <i>laid</i> up? Why is not the 
    crown <i>presently</i> put on?</b></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. It is not fit that we should yet wear it for 
    two reasons:</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">1. Our graces are imperfect in this life.</p></i> They are in 
    their infancy and minority. Therefore we are said to receive but "the <i>
    first fruits </i>of the Spirit" (Romans 8:23)—not all of them. We have only 
    some imperfect lines of grace drawn in us. Our graces are mingled with much
    <i>corruption</i>, as gold in the ore is mingled with dross. The most 
    refined soul has some <i>lees </i>and <i>dregs </i>of sin left in it. The 
    life of grace is said to be hidden (Colossians 3:3). Our faith is hidden 
    under unbelief—as the corn is hidden under the chaff. Now if God should set 
    this crown upon us in this life, He would be crowning our <i>sins </i>as 
    well as our <i>graces</i>. Therefore, the crown is laid up.
<i>
<p align="justify">2. It is not fit that we should yet wear the crown, for 
    then it would take us away from doing our work.</p></i> We would be idle in the 
    vineyard. Who will take pains for a reward—when he has the reward already? 
    Therefore, the crown is laid up. We must run the <i>race—</i>before we wear 
    the <i>crown</i>.
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. <i>The crown is laid up to make heaven sweeter.</i> 
    The longer we wait for our crown—the sweeter it will be when it comes. The 
    absence of that which we desire, merely endears it more to us when we enjoy 
    it. After all our sweating for heaven, all our praying, weeping, fasting—how 
    welcome will a crown be! Therefore God, though He will not deny our 
    reward—will delay our reward. It is a crown laid up.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But if this crown is laid up, <b>WHEN shall we 
    wear it?</b></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. This brings me to the fourth and last particular 
    in the text.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"In that day."</p></i> What day? "In the day of my death," 
    said Tertullian. Justinus and others are of the opinion that the saints 
    shall not receive this crown until the <i>resurrection</i>. But Jerome 
    confutes this opinion.
<p align="justify">The souls of the elect shall be immediately crowned with 
    joy and felicity. The body, indeed, shall lie in the grave as in a bed of 
    perfume, until the resurrection. That this resurrection shall be, is clear. 
    Therefore it is that some of the ancients have called the grave a <i>
    sleeping house </i>because this body shall wake again. The Jews called their 
    burying place—the house of the living—because they believed that life would 
    come into them again at the resurrection. Until then, the bodies of the 
    saints must wait for their glorification—but their souls shall be 
    immediately crowned after death.</p>
<p align="justify">Why else would Paul desire to die—if he were not 
    immediately crowned with glory? It would be better for believers to stay 
    here—if they would not be immediately with Christ. Here they are daily 
    improving their stock of grace; they are increasing the jewels of their 
    crown. Though they sit in the valley of tears—yet God often turns their <i>
    water </i>into <i>wine</i>. They have many sweet tastes of God's love; they 
    have the bunches of grapes. If Paul's soul should <i>sleep </i>in his body 
    (a <i>drowsy </i>opinion), then when he desired to be dissolved he wished 
    that which was to be his <i>loss</i>. But this crown shall be given "in that 
    day," the day of our death. It cannot be half a day's journey between the <i>
    cross </i>and <i>paradise</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The words fall into these three parts:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Here is a glorious reward: a crown.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The adjourning of this reward: it is laid up.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The people on whom it is bestowed: Paul and the rest 
    of the believers. "For me, and not for me only—but for all them that love 
    Christ's appearing."</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. The righteous person shall wear the crown of 
    righteousness.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">For the illustration of this I shall do four things: </p>
<p align="justify">1. I shall inquire who this righteous person is.</p>
<p align="justify">2. I shall evidence by Scripture that the righteous 
    person shall wear this blessed crown.</p>
<p align="justify">3. I shall show you wherein this reward of glory is 
    compared to a crown.</p>
<p align="justify">4. I shall show you wherein the crown of righteousness 
    excels and outshines all earthly crowns.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Who this righteous person is.</p></b></font> A man may be 
    said to be righteous in two ways:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. LEGALLY righteous.</p></b></font> Thus Adam, while he wore 
    the robe of <i>innocence</i>, was legally righteous. He had that law of 
    holiness written in his heart, and his life was a living commentary on it. 
    He lived exactly according to every institute of God, like a well-made dial 
    goes with the sun; but this is lost and forfeited.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. EVANGELICALLY righteous. </p></b></font>And this 
    righteousness is two-fold.
<p align="justify">There is a righteousness by <font color="#b07050"><b>
    imputation</b></font>. This is as truly ours to justify us—as it is Christ's 
    to give us. </p>
<p align="justify">There is a righteousness by <font color="#b07050"><b>
    implantation</b></font>. The one is by the merit of Christ, the other is by 
    the Spirit of Christ. Now this implanted righteousness is in the soul, as an 
    intrinsic quality; and if it is of the right kind it must be there in three 
    ways.</p>
<p align="justify">(1) Righteousness must be in the soul <b>extensively</b>, 
    in every part. We do not call a black man <i>white</i>—because he has white 
    teeth. Those are not said to be righteous who only speak righteously. What 
    are these but white teeth? Righteousness, like a holy leaven, must diffuse 
    and swell itself into every part—the understanding, will, and affections. 
    "May the God of peace sanctify you <i>wholly</i>" (1 Thessalonians 5:23). 
    Therefore grace is called "the new <i>man</i>," not a new <i>eye </i>or a 
    new <i>tongue</i>—but a new <i>man</i>. Though a saint is righteous but in
    <i>part</i>—yet he is righteous in <i>every part</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Righteousness must be in the soul <b>intensively</b>. 
    We call water <i>hot </i>when it is hot in the third or fourth degree. He is 
    not said to be righteous who is <i>tepid </i>and <i>neutral </i>in religion. 
    This was Laodicea's temper, lukewarm. Revelation 3:16: "I would you were 
    cold or hot." It is as if God said, "I wish you were anything but <i>
    lukewarm</i>." Righteousness must rise up to some degree. David boiled over 
    in holy zeal. Psalm 119:139: "My zeal has consumed me."</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Righteousness must be in the soul <b>perseveringly</b>. 
    It must abide and continue. He is not a righteous person who is godly only 
    in a passion, either of fear or joy. Hypocrites may seem righteous for a 
    time, as long as the wind blows that way—but it is quickly over. They <i>
    change </i>quickly—like the herb whose leaves in the morning are white, at 
    noon are purple, and at night are blue. Thus they change in their goodness 
    and are of divers opinions, like Joseph's coat of divers colors. Hypocrites, 
    for the most part, live to confute themselves. They are like one who has a 
    good and hopeful <i>beginning</i>—but a bad <i>end. </i>I have read of a 
    certain people in India called <i>Pandorae</i>, who have white hoary hair in 
    their youth and black hair in their old age. This is an emblem of 
    hypocrites, who at first look white and fair like saints—but in their elder 
    years blacken in wickedness. The piety of these men was never <i>ingrained</i>. 
    They are only to be judged righteous people who, with Job, persevere in 
    godliness (Job 2:3).</p>
<p align="justify">There is a great deal of difference between the motion of 
    a watch—and the beating of a pulse. The one is quickly at an end—but the 
    other, proceeding from a vital principle, is permanent and constant. As long 
    as there is life—the pulse beats. True righteousness is a spiritual 
    pulse—which will ever be beating. So much for the first point, who this 
    righteous person is.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The righteous person <i>shall </i>wear the crown of 
    righteousness.</p></b></font> James 1:12: "He <i>shall </i>receive the crown of 
    life." Revelation 2:10: "I will give you the crown of life." By both 
    Scriptures you see that a true saint, is an heir to the crown. The truth 
    being so apparent, I may say, as they did in another sense, "Why do we need 
    any further witness?" (Luke 22:71). I proceed therefore to the next point.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. I will show you wherein the reward of glory, is 
    compared to a crown.</p></b></font> It is called here a crown of righteousness, 
    and that in three respects:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">A crown is RESPLENDENT.</p></b></font> The royal crown, hung 
    with jewels, is a splendid, magnificent thing. Thus the crown of 
    righteousness is most radiant and illustrious. For the splendor of it, it is 
    called a crown of <b>glory </b>(1 Peter 5:4). It must be glorious because it 
    is a crown of God's own making. Sin has made us our <i>crosses</i>; God has 
    made us our <i>crown</i>. What are all the beauties and glories of the world 
    which have been esteemed most famous—in comparison to this crown of 
    righteousness? They all fade by comparison. The glory of this crown is 
    inexpressible. Were the angels themselves sent to heaven to give us a 
    description of this crown of righteousness, they would sooner lack words 
    than matter. But here I must draw a veil, as not being able to give you the 
    dark shadow of it. Nor can it be set out by all the lights of heaven, though 
    every star were turned into a sun.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">A crown is a WEIGHTY thing.</p></b></font> So is the crown of 
    righteousness. Therefore it is called a <i>weight of glory </i>by the 
    Apostle. We think our <i>sufferings </i>are weighty; alas, they are light—in 
    comparison with our crown. This crown of righteousness is so weighty that it 
    would soon overwhelm us—if God did not make us able to bear it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">A crown is an HONORABLE thing. </p></b></font>"You crown him 
    with honor" (Psalm 8:5). Therefore, when King Ahasuerus asked Haman what 
    should be done to the man whom the king would honor, Haman could think of 
    nothing more honorable than the crown. "Let the crown royal which the king 
    wears, be set upon his head" (Esther 6:8). A crown is not fit for everyone. 
    It will not fit every head; it is for kings and people of renown to wear. 
    What a great honor it was to wear the Olympic crown, to which the Apostle 
    here seems to allude. A crown is a badge and sign of imperial honor. So this 
    crown of righteousness is the sign of <i>royalty </i>and <i>excellence</i>. 
    Only those who are born of God and have the royal blood of heaven running in 
    their souls, wear this blessed crown. The men of the world may heap up 
    silver like dust—but the crown of righteousness, God reserves only for those 
    whom He has made <i>kings </i>(Revelation 1:6).
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The last thing is to show you wherein this crown of 
    righteousness exceeds and outshines all earthly crowns. </p></b></font>This will 
    appear in six particulars.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) This crown of righteousness is LAWFULLY come by. </p></b>
</font>It is a crown which <i>God Himself </i>will set upon our head. "The 
    Lord, the righteous Judge will give it to me at that day," says the text. 
    Therefore it is come by <i>lawfully</i>. Other crowns are often <i>usurped</i>, 
    as history abundantly witnesses. They may be called crowns of <i>un</i>righteousness 
    because they are <i>un</i>righteously gotten. Julius Caesar was accustomed 
    to say, that for a crown it was lawful to violate any oath. The saints do 
    not have their crown by <i>usurpation, </i>but by <i>election</i>. They are 
    chosen to a crown.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) This crown of righteousness exceeds in PURENESS. </p></b>
</font>Other crowns are of a more foul, drossy metal; they have their <i>
    troubles</i>. A crown of <i>gold </i>cannot be made without <i>thorns</i>. 
    Herein the crown of righteousness excels. It is made of a purer metal—there 
    are no <i>crosses </i>or <i>thorns </i>woven into it. It fills the soul with 
    melody; it banishes all sorrow from the heart; there can be no more sorrow 
    in heaven—than there can be joy in hell.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) This crown of righteousness can never be lost or 
    FORFEITED.</p></b></font> Other crowns may be lost. "The crown has fallen from 
    the head" (Lamentations 5:16). Henry VI was honored with the crowns of two 
    kingdoms, France and England. The first was lost through the faction of his 
    nobles; the other was twice plucked from his head before his death. Earthly 
    crowns have many heirs and successors. How many have been disposed either by
    <i>fraud </i>or <i>force</i>? But this crown of righteousness can never be 
    lost. God will not say, "Remove the diadem, take off the crown" (Ezekiel 
    21:26). This crown is set upon the head of Christ's <i>spouse</i>—and Christ 
    will never depose His spouse!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4) This crown of righteousness is a NEVER-FADING crown.
    </p></b></font>Other crowns are like a garland of flowers which soon withers. 
    "Does the crown endure to all generations?" (Proverbs 27:24). All outward 
    glory passes away as a swift stream or a ship in full sail. Crowns wear away 
    and tumble into the dust—but the crown of righteousness does not fade (1 
    Peter 5:4). <i>Eternity </i>is a <i>jewel </i>of the saint's crown! After 
    millions of years, it will be as bright and resplendent as the first day's 
    wearing.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5) This crown of righteousness does not draw ENVY to it.</p></b></font> 
    David's own son envied him, and sought to take his crown from off his head. 
    A crown of gold is often the mark for envy and ambition to shoot at; but 
    this crown of righteousness is free from envy. The <i>white lily of peace
    </i>is a flower which grows in this crown. One saint in glory shall not envy 
    another—because all are crowned. And though one crown may be <i>larger </i>
    than another—yet everyone shall have as big a crown as he is able to carry!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(6) This crown of righteousness makes a man truly 
    BLESSED. </p></b></font>Earthly crowns have no such <i>virtue </i>in them. They 
    rather make men <i>cursed</i>. They are so <i>heavy </i>that they often sink 
    men into hell! They make men's heads so <i>giddy, </i>that they stumble and 
    fall into hurtful lusts. But this crown of righteousness makes those who 
    wear it, truly blessed. The Hebrew word for "to crown" signifies "to compass 
    round." Because the crown compasses those who wear it with heavenly 
    felicity, the saints shall have a sight of God to all eternity. This is the 
    encompassing crown. But besides, the saints shall have such communications 
    of divine excellencies, as they are capable of taking in. This is the 
    quintessence of blessedness.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Information. </p></b></font>And there are four 
    branches:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 1. It shows us that true religion is not imposed 
    upon hard terms.</p></b></font> God does not put us upon unreasonable things. He 
    does not give us work—and then give us no reward. Behold, there is a crown 
    of righteousness laid up! When we hear of the doctrine of <i>repentance</i>, 
    steeping our souls in briny tears for sin, the doctrine of <i>mortification</i>, 
    calling out the right eye—we are ready to cry out as they did, "This is a 
    hard saying, who can hear it?" No, beloved, God's terms are not 
    unreasonable. He never sets us on work—but we are sure of double pay. He 
    gives us many sweet encouragements while we are doing the work. He often 
    strews our ways with roses, "shedding His <i>love </i>abroad in our hearts" 
    (Romans 5:5), filling us with <i>joy </i>and <i>peace </i>in believing 
    (Romans 15:13).
<p align="justify">He who has the least mercy from God in this way, will die 
    in His debt. When we look upon the recompense of reward, which as far 
    exceeds our thoughts as it surpasses our deserts, then surely we cannot say 
    to God, as the man said in Matthew 25:24, "I knew you that you are a <i>hard
    </i>man." If a king should bid one take up his staff when it is fallen, and 
    for that should settle a rich annuity upon him for life—would not this be a 
    great reward—for a little work? When you have done all, as our Lord Christ 
    said, you are but unprofitable servants (Luke 17:10). What advantage do you 
    bring to God? Yet for this poor, inconsiderable nothing—there is a heavenly 
    crown laid up. Surely God does not invite you to your loss. You can never 
    say that He is a hard master. Will Satan, who would discourage you from a 
    strict, holy life—give bond to assure you of something equivalent to this 
    crown? Saul said in another sense, "Will the son off Jesse give you fields 
    and vineyards, and make you captains of thousands?" So, will Satan, who 
    disparages the ways of God, give you crowns to possess? Will he mend your 
    wages? Alas! You know what wages he pays. His wages are death and hell, and 
    truly—the less of those wages the better!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 2. See here that which may raise in our hearts a 
    holy indignation against sin—which makes us forfeit our crown.</p></b></font> 
    Sin is not only <i>hateful </i>in its own nature—but it is the most <i>
    horrid</i>, <i>ugly</i>, <i>deformed </i>thing. This made holy Anselm say 
    that if he should behold the pains of hell on one side and the deformity of 
    sin on the other, and he must of necessity choose one of these two, he said, 
    "I would rather throw myself into hell—than voluntarily commit one sin 
    against God."
<p align="justify">But besides the intrinsic filth that is in sin (it being 
    the very spirit and quintessence of evil), this may cause in us an 
    abhorrence of it: Sin would degrade us of our honor; it would pluck away our 
    crown from our head. Think what the <i>end </i>of sin will be. As Abner said 
    to Joab, "Will it not be <i>bitterness </i>in the latter end?" (2 Samuel 
    2:26). If men, before they committed sin, would but sit down and rationally 
    consider whether the present gain and sweetness in sin—would make amends for 
    the future loss, I believe it would put them into a cold sweat and give some 
    check to their unbridled lusts. Jacob took Esau by the heel. Oh, do not look 
    upon the smiling face of sin—but take it by the heel! Look at the end of it. 
    It will bereave us of our heavenly crown! And can anything counterbalance 
    this loss?</p>
<p align="justify">When a man is tempted to <i>pride</i>, let him remember 
    that this will swell his head so big—that the crown will not go on! Woe to 
    the crown of pride! The crown of pride, will hinder him from the crown of 
    righteousness. When he is tempted to lust, let him remember that for 
    enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season—he hazards a crown for 
    immorality. And is there as much sweetness in sin—as in a crown? When he is 
    tempted to <i>drunkenness </i>(a sin that not only unChristians him, but 
    unmans him), let him consider here that it would uncrown him of his reason, 
    and afterwards uncrown him of his eternal happiness. When he is tempted to
    <i>swearing</i>, let him think with himself, "This is a sin which has 
    nothing to render it delightful." Other sins have a <i>show </i>of pleasure 
    and profit, which is the bait men are drawn with—but the swearer is brought 
    to the devil's hook without any bait!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh! Is it not madness—for these unfruitful works of 
    darkness—to forfeit heaven? How will the devil reproach and laugh at men! 
    That they should be so <i>stupid </i>as to forego a <i>crown </i>for a <i>
    rattle! </i>They are like those foolish Indians who, for <i>pictures </i>and
    <i>glass beads</i>, will part with their <i>gold</i>. Oh! How should we hate 
    sin—which will take away our heavenly crown from us!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 3. See here the misery of a wicked man.</p></b></font> 
    Though he may flourish in his bravery while he lives—yet when he dies he 
    shall not have a <i>crown of righteousness—</i>but<i> chains of darkness</i>. 
    Death carries him prisoner to hell—it leads him away to be punished. The 
    Egyptians, as Plutarch reports, at their feasts brought in a death's-head 
    with this motto: "Look upon this, and proceed with your banquet." For the 
    sinner who sports himself with sin, and crowns himself with rosebuds in the 
    midst of all his mirth and music, here is a death's-head for him to look on! 
    The day of death to him will not be a day of <i>coronation</i>—but a day of
    <i>execution</i>! How can the wicked rejoice? Theophylact used to say, "His 
    estate is miserable who goes<i> laughing to hell</i>." We may say of this 
    laughter, "It is mad" (Ecclessiastes 2:2).
<p align="justify">Suppose you saw a man sitting in a rotten chair. 
    Underneath him was a burning fire; over his head a sword was hanging by a 
    slender thread; and before him was a table spread with a variety of 
    delicacies. Surely he would have but little appetite to eat—sitting in such 
    a danger. So it is with a sinner. His soul sits in his body as in a rotten 
    chair. Diseases, like worms, breed there. Under him hellfire is burning. 
    Over his head is not a crown—but the sword of Divine justice hanging. When 
    death breaks this chair of the body, he falls into the fire—and this fire is 
    unquenchable. A multitude of tears cannot extinguish it; length of time 
    cannot annihilate it.</p>
<p align="justify">God has the keys of hell. The damned are bound hand and 
    foot (Matthew 22:13), so that there can be no coming out. Oh, that this 
    might frighten and stop men in their wicked courses! When they are dying, 
    the wicked must say to their souls, "O my poor wandering soul, where are you 
    going? What will become of you?" There remains nothing for sinners but a 
    "certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation" (Hebrews 
    10:27). God will not say to them, "Come hither and be crowned," but rather, 
    "Depart from Me—you who are cursed!"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">BRANCH 4. It shows us, as in a Scripture glass, the 
    happiness and nobility of a righteous person. </p></b></font>In this life he 
    wears a<i> robe of righteousness</i>—and after death he wears a <i>crown of 
    righteousness</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In his lifetime he wears a robe of righteousness</p></b></font> 
    (Isaiah 61:10). This is the righteousness of Christ in which he is looked 
    upon <i>as righteous as Christ Himself </i>(2 Corinthians 5:21). We are made 
    the righteousness of God in Him. It is not said that we are made the 
    righteousness of <i>angels</i>—but of <i>God</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. After death he wears a crown of righteousness. </p></b>
</font>This crown encircles all blessedness within it. The saints are not 
    perfectly happy until death—then comes the crown! Here we are but <i>
    candidates </i>and <i>expectants </i>of heaven. This is but <i>seed </i>
    time. We sow the seed of <i>prayer—</i>and water it with our tears; the <i>
    golden harvest </i>is yet to be reaped. The crown is <i>laid up. </i>When 
    Croesus asked Solon who he thought happy, he told him of <i>Tellus</i>—a man 
    who was dead. So a Christian is not perfectly happy until death—then the 
    heavenly crown shall be put on! The Thracians used <i>music </i>in their 
    funerals, and Theocritus observes that the heathens had their funeral <i>
    banquet</i>, because of the <i>felicity </i>which they supposed the deceased 
    parties to participate in. When the mantle of a believer's flesh drops 
    off—then shall his soul ascend in a triumphant chariot, and the garland of 
    glory shall be set upon his head!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Trial.</p></b></font> Examine yourselves whether you 
    are the heirs of this crown.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But how may that be known? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. By this: if you set the crown on Christ's head 
    while you <i>live</i>—He will set the crown on your head when you <i>die!
    </i>Have you wisdom to seek heaven, strength to do duties, resist 
    temptations and bear burdens? You will not assume or arrogate any glory to 
    yourselves—but let Christ wear the crown. Thus Paul said in 1 Corinthians 
    15:10, "I labored more than they all, and yet not I, but the grace of God 
    which was with me." This is the inscription on Christ's vesture and on His 
    thigh, "King of kings" (Revelation 19:16). We do what in us lies to make Him 
    King when we set the crown of all upon His head. A Christian takes the crown 
    of honor and applause from his own head—and sets it upon the head of Christ. 
    This is hard for flesh and blood to stoop to. A proud heart will not easily 
    part with the crown. He will bid others bow the knee. But be assured, 
    there's no way for us to reign with Christ—but to let Christ reign here.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 3. Exhortation. </p></b></font>This exhorts us to three 
    things:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. If there is a crown laid up, it calls for our LOVE 
    toward God.</p></b></font> "Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed 
    upon us" to give us a crown. This is the highest ennobling of a creature. If 
    there is love in a <i>crumb</i>, what is there in a <i>crown! </i>If there 
    is love in <i>pardoning </i>mercy, what is there in <i>crowning </i>mercy? 
    It is a favor that we poor vermin, worms and not men, should be allowed to
    <i>live</i>; but that worms should be made <i>kings</i>, that Christ should 
    be arraigned—and we adorned, that the curse should be laid on His head—and 
    the crown on ours, "Behold, what manner of love is this!" It is beyond all 
    hyperbole. And should this not make our hearts reverberate and echo back 
    love? Oh, Christians! Light your love at this fire! God having shone upon us 
    in love, let our hearts burn in love to Him! 
<p align="justify">Our love to God must be<i> divinely qualified</i>.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First, it must be a GENUINE love. </p></b></font>We must not 
    love Him for something else, as a man loves a potion for health's sake—but 
    as a man loves sweet wine for itself. We must love God for those intrinsic 
    excellencies in Him, which are so alluring and amiable.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, it must be a VOLUNTARY love</p></b></font>, else it 
    is not love but coercion. It must come freely, like water from a spring. It 
    must be a free-will offering, not like the paying of a tax.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, it must be an EXUBERANT love.</p></b></font> It must 
    not be stinted; not a few drops—but a stream. It must, like the Nile, 
    overflow the banks.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Fourth, it must be a TRANSCENDENT love. </p></b></font>It 
    must be of no ordinary extraction—but a choice, superlative love. We must 
    not only give God the <i>milk </i>of our love—but the <i>cream</i>; not only 
    the truth of it—but the <i>quintessence</i>. "I would cause you to drink of 
    spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranates" (Song of Solomon 8:2). If the 
    spouse has a cup which is more juicy and spiced—Christ shall drink of that!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Fifth, it must be a most INTENSE, ARDENT love.</p></b></font> 
    The sun shines as much as it can; such must our love to God be. It must <i>
    boil </i>over. What <i>unparalleled </i>love has God shown us! Oh, 
    Christian! Answer love with love. In love we may, as Bernard said, 
    reciprocate with God. If God is angry—we must not be angry again; but if God 
    loves us—we must love Him again. Oh, love God the Father who has <i>made </i>
    this crown for us! Love God the Son who has <i>bought </i>this crown for us. 
    Love God the Holy Spirit who has made us <i>fit </i>to wear this crown.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Let us pant and breathe after this happy condition.
    </p></b></font>Does not the heir desire to be crowned? Here we have a weight of
    <i>sin</i>—in heaven we shall have a weight of <i>glory</i>. How should our 
    souls be big with desire to be gone hence? What is the world we so dote on? 
    It is but a spacious prison, and should we not be willing to go out of 
    prison to be crowned? The bird desires to go out of the <i>cage</i>, though 
    it is made of gold. Every saint is a true bird of paradise; he is ever 
    flying up towards heaven in ardent and zealous affection; he longs to be out 
    of this earthen cage of the body, when with the Phoenix he shall receive his 
    golden crowns on his head, and shine in glory as the angels of God! 
    Tertullian observes that Scipio, when his father had told him of that glory 
    the soul should be invested with in a state of immortality, that Scipio 
    responded, <i>"Why do I tarry thus long upon the earth? Why do I not hasten 
    to die?"
</i>
<p align="justify">I think that, when we hear of this crown of righteousness 
    which will so infinitely enrich and adorn the soul—it should make us be 
    weary of this world and long for the time of our solemn coronation. How did 
    Paul desire to be depart and be with Christ? Would not man be willing to 
    hoist up sails and cross the waters, though troublesome, if he were sure to 
    be crowned as soon as he came ashore? Why are our souls so earthly? We love 
    to be grazing in the world's full pastures, and are afraid to die. Most men 
    look so ghastly at the thoughts of death, as if they were rather going to 
    the <i>cross </i>than the <i>crown</i>. Oh, long for death! The Apostle 
    calls death a putting off of our earthly clothes (2 Corinthians 5:4). This 
    is all death does to us, if we are in Christ—it puts off our clothes and 
    puts on a <i>crown!</i> This should make us say, as did Hilarion, "Go out, 
    my soul, go out. Why do you tremble? You are going to receive a crown!" A 
    believer, at death, will be the happiest <i>loser</i>—and the happiest <i>
    gainer</i>. He will lose his <i>sins</i>; he will gain eternal <i>glory</i>. 
    The day of death is the saint's coronation day!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Learn to so conduct yourselves, that this crown of 
    righteousness may be set upon your heads when you die.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How do we do that?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Do three things:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. If you would wear the crown of righteousness, find in 
    your hearts the WORK of righteousness</p></b></font>, Isaiah 32:17. This work of 
    grace in you, must be evidenced by a mighty change, which is sometimes 
    called an engrafting, sometimes a transforming. Grace makes a metamorphosis; 
    it produces in the soul a likeness to Christ. First there must be a <i>
    consecrating </i>work before a <i>crowning </i>work. We read in Scripture of 
    the solemn inauguration of their king. First they <i>anointed </i>them and 
    then they <i>crowned </i>them. "Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of 
    the tabernacle, and <i>anointed </i>Solomon" (1 Kings 1:39), and after that 
    he was <i>crowned</i>. So there must be the <i>unction </i>of the Spirit: 
    first God pours on us the <i>anointing oil of grace</i>, and after the horn 
    of oil comes the <i>crown of glory</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. If you would wear the crown of righteousness, then 
    walk in the WAY of righteousness </p></b></font>(Proverbs 12:28). This is called 
    in Scripture a walking after the Spirit (Romans 8:1). The people of Israel 
    walked after the pillar of fire; and the wise men walked after the 
    star—whichever way the star went, they went. And sometimes it is called a 
    walking by <i>rule </i>(Galatians 6:16). Those who expect a <i>golden crown</i>, 
    must walk by a <i>golden rule</i>. Be sure you walk with David's <i>candle
    </i>and <i>lantern </i>in your hand, "Your Word is a lamp for my feet and a 
    light on my path." (Psalm 119:105). He who walks in the dark may soon be out 
    of the way. Walk <i>soberly </i>in acts of temperance, <i>righteously </i>in 
    acts of justice, and <i>godly </i>in acts of piety. Walk as Christ did upon 
    earth. His life was purer than the sunbeams, as one said. Copy His life in 
    yours. Be assured, that you shall never partake of the privilege of Christ's
    <i>death</i>, unless you imitate the pattern of Christ's <i>life</i>. Would 
    you wear the <i>crown </i>of righteousness? Walk in the <i>way </i>of 
    righteousness. But alas, this is a very untrodden way:
<p align="justify">(1) Some <i>know </i>the way of righteousness but do not
    <i>walk </i>in it; like the Grecians of whom Plutarch speaks; they knew what 
    was honest, but did it not.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Others <i>commend </i>the way of righteousness, but 
    do not walk in it; like those who taste and commend the wine but do not buy.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Others walk <i>contrary </i>to the way, instead of 
    walking in the way. They are good only at <i>crossing </i>the way; they <i>
    oppose </i>the way of righteousness. Such are persecutors (2 Timothy 3:8).</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Others walk a few steps in the way—and then go <i>
    back </i>again. These are <i>apostates </i>(2 Timothy 4:10), as if there 
    were any going to heaven backwards!</p>
<p align="justify">(5) Others walk half in the way—and half out of the way. 
    These are loose professors who, under a notion of <i>Christian liberty</i>, 
    walk carelessly and presumptuously, crying up <i>justification </i>so that 
    they may weaken the power of <i>sanctification</i>. They can take that 
    liberty which others tremble to think of. <i>Surely, were there no other 
    Bible read but the lives of some professors, we would read but little 
    Scripture there!</i></p>

<p align="justify">(6) Others walk soberly <i>for a while </i>in the way—but 
    all of a sudden, drinking in the <i>poison of error</i>, begin to be 
    intoxicated with novel and dangerous opinions, who, as the Apostle said, 
    "have turned aside after Satan" (1 Timothy 5:15). Ignatius calls error "the 
    invention of the devil!" Basil calls it a "spiritual drunkenness," and when 
    the <i>head </i>is giddy the <i>feet </i>must reel. Loose <i>principles </i>
    breed loose <i>practices</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">(7) Others, instead of walking in the way, <i>traduce </i>
    and <i>slander </i>the way of righteousness. "The way of truth shall be evil 
    spoken of" (2 Peter 2:2); or, as it is in the Greek, it shall be <i>
    blasphemed</i>. The men of the world say that the way of righteousness is a 
    solitary way, and makes those who walk in it, melancholy; and that they must 
    expect to lose their joy by the way. These forget that golden saying of 
    Augustine that when a man is converted and turned to God, his joy is not <i>
    taken away</i>—but <i>changed</i>. It is more <i>sublime </i>and <i>pure</i>. 
    And does not Solomon tell us that "all the ways of God are pleasantness" 
    (Proverbs 3:17)? Take the most difficult part of the way of piety, and—it is 
    pleasant walking. Holy weeping seems at first very unpleasant and 
    disconsolate—but how often, while the saints weep for <i>sin</i>, does the 
    Lord make them weep for <i>joy! </i>While the water of repentance, like 
    rose-water, drops from the eye—it sends forth a sweet fragrance which 
    refreshes the soul with inward consolation. Oh, what green branches! What 
    full clusters of grapes hang all along as we are walking in the way of 
    righteousness! How, then, dare men besmirch us with their false charges!</p>
<p align="justify">(8) Others <i>creep </i>in the way; they do not walk. 
    They go on but very slowly. Those who look on, can hardly tell whether they 
    make any progress or not. They are dull in their heavenly motion.</p>
<p align="justify">(9) Others walk quite <i>beside </i>the way. These are 
    profane people who dedicate their lives to <i>Bacchus</i>, who border every 
    step they take upon the devil's confines! They are like Asa, diseased in 
    their feet. They walk, as the Apostle said, <i>disorderly</i>, like soldiers 
    who march out of rank and file. Jesus Christ not only sends forth <i>blood
    </i>out of His sides to <i>redeem </i>us—but also <i>water </i>to <i>cleanse
    </i>us (1 John 5:6). They who do not have the power of the one to <i>
    sanctify</i>, question the benefit of the other to <i>save</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Oh! All you who would wear the <i>crown </i>of 
    righteousness, walk in the <i>way </i>of righteousness. Labor to keep up the 
    credit of religion in the world. Walk <i>exactly</i>. <i>Walk so that if we 
    could suppose the Bible to be lost—it might be found again in your lives!</i></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. If you would wear the crown of righteousness, put on 
    the ARMOR of righteousness </p></b></font>(2 Corinthians 6:7). The meaning is 
    this: if you will have this crown—you must <b>fight </b>for it. Paul said, 
    "I have fought the good fight," a metaphor, as Chrysostom and Ambrose 
    observe, taken from wrestlers who, when they had gotten the victory, were 
    crowned. It is the crown of victory; therefore the saints in glory are set 
    forth with palms in their hands in token of victory. Christians must strive 
    like Olympian combatants. They must not only be adorned with the jewel of 
    knowledge—but armed with the breastplate of faith. Satan is a lion in the 
    way, "Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like 
    a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in 
    the faith." 1 Peter 5:8-9.
<p align="justify">This crown is worth <i>contending </i>for. A Christian 
    most shines, in his spiritual armor. This is his sacred warfare. The crown 
    is set upon the head of the conqueror. Those <i>dainty, silken professors
    </i>who live at ease, and will not make the least fight against the enemy, 
    shall have no crown—but will be discarded as cowards. Lycurgus would have no 
    man's name written upon his sepulcher, but he who died manfully in war. God 
    will write no man's name in the book of life, but he who dies fighting. When 
    the saints, after all their spiritual battles, shall come to heaven as 
    conquerors, then shall their ensigns of honor be hung up; then shall the 
    crown of righteousness be set upon their head!</p>
<p align="justify">Let this put spurs to our sluggish hearts and make us act 
    with all our might for God. What, <i>wrestling</i>? What, <i>sweating</i>? 
    How should we provoke ourselves to holiness! How should we spend and be 
    spent for Christ! How should we strive to bring in some crown revenues to 
    our Lord and Master—when we consider how infinitely it shall be rewarded! 
    While we are laying <i>out </i>for God, He is laying <i>up </i>for us; 
    henceforth there is a crown laid up. How should this crown add <i>wings </i>
    to prayer, and <i>oil </i>to the flame of our zeal! O Christian, let your <i>
    head </i>study for Christ; let your <i>tongue </i>plead for Him; let your <i>
    hands </i>work for Him! "What honor and dignity has been done to Mordecai?" 
    said King Ahasuerus (Esther 6:3). Inquire what has been done for God. </p>
<p align="justify">I think we should sometimes go aside into our closets and 
    weep to consider how little work we have done for God. Beloved, what a vast 
    disproportion there is between our <i>work</i>—and our <i>reward</i>; 
    between our <i>sweat</i>—and our <i>crown</i>. And It is but <i>a while</i>, 
    a very <i>little </i>while, before the crown shall be put on. "The time is 
    short!" said the Apostle. We are ready to strike sail—we are almost at 
    shore—and then we shall be crowned. Oh! Improve the present season for the 
    glory of God. The crown is near by; you must <i>sail </i>speedily and <i>
    work </i>rapidly.</p>
<p align="justify">And that I may quicken your obedience, consider this: the 
    more <i>work </i>you do for God, the bigger <i>crown </i>you shall wear. 
    There are <i>degrees of glory</i>. He who with his pound gained five 
    more—was made ruler over five cities. But he who with his pound gained 
    ten—was made ruler over ten cities. As one star differs from another in 
    glory, so one <i>crown </i>differs from another in glory. If there are 
    degrees of torment in hell, thereby, for the same reason, there are degrees 
    of glory in heaven. That there are degrees of torments is evident from Luke 
    20:47: "Who for pretense make long prayers, the same shall receive <i>
    greater </i>damnation." They who wrap sin in a <i>religious mantle</i>, or 
    who blame God for their wickedness, shall have a hotter place in hell. Just 
    so—there are gradations in happiness. How, then, should we abound in work, 
    seeing we shall exceed in reward!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 4. Consolation. </p></b></font>Here is <i>a</i> <i>gospel 
    honeycomb</i>, dropping comfort into the hearts of the godly. How may this 
    alleviate all the afflictions of this life, and make these bitter <i>waters 
    of Marah</i>, become sweet and pleasant to drink of! There is a crown laid 
    up! A Christian in this life has something to <i>grieve </i>him—and yet 
    something to <i>comfort </i>him. A true saint is an heir of the <i>cross</i>. 
    If he wears any <i>robes</i>—they are <i>bloody</i>. If he wears any <i>
    crown</i>—it is one of thorns. But here is that which may sweeten his 
    sufferings; here is <i>sweet wine </i>mingled with his <i>bitter myrrh</i>—he 
    shall be crowned in paradise! This, my brethren, may change our 
    mourning—into melody; and our tears—into triumph! Though we bear the cross, 
    we shall wear the crown! 
<p align="justify">Our sufferings cannot continue long. If our <i>life </i>
    is short—our <i>sufferings </i>cannot be long. Oh, how may this sweeten all 
    the bitter cups we drink of! Cleopatra put a <i>jewel </i>in her cup which 
    contained the price of a kingdom. When we are drinking in our <i>wormwood 
    cup</i>—let this <i>jewel</i> be put into our cup to make it go down more 
    pleasantly—we will shortly have an eternal reward of glory! Though <i>death
    </i>is in the cup—<i>sugar </i>lies at the bottom! </p>
<p align="justify">"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of 
    righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that 
    day!" 2 Timothy 4:8</p>
