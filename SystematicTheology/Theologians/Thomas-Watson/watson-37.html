<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Farewell Prayer</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">(This prayer given by Watson, on the eve of his ejection 
    from his church, because of his non-conformity to the <i>state </i>church.)</p>
<p align="justify">O Lord God, all our springs are in You. It is good for us 
    to draw near to You through Jesus Christ. You are all fullness, the 
    quintessence of all sweetness, the center of all blessedness. You are the 
    Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in Him—our Father. You are our light. 
    You give us these blessed opportunities of enjoying communion with Yourself, 
    God blessed forever.</p>
<p align="justify">These mercies are <i>forfeited </i>mercies. We have 
    abused the blessings of Your house; we have grieved Your blessed Spirit; 
    therefore, it is just with You to deprive us of these comforts, and to make 
    us know the <i>worth </i>of these mercies—by the <i>lack </i>of them.</p>
<p align="justify">Lord, we desire to judge ourselves, that we may not be 
    condemned with the world. Righteous are You, O Lord, and just in all Your 
    judgments. We confess, we are unworthy to have any converse with so holy a 
    God. We are polluted with dust and ashes, not worthy to tread Your 
    courts—and it is of Your mercy that we are not consumed. How often have we 
    plucked fruit from the forbidden tree! We have sinned presumptuously against 
    the clearest <i>light—</i>and always against the dearest <i>love</i>. Your 
    footsteps have dropped fatness. You have shown mercy to us—but the better 
    You have been to us, the worse we have been to You! You have loaded us with
    <i>mercies</i>—and we have wearied You with our <i>sins! </i>When we look 
    into ourselves, O the poison of our natures! Whatever the leper touched, was 
    unclean; thus do we, by our spiritual leprosy, infect our holy things.</p>
<p align="justify">Our <i>prayers </i>need a pardon, and our <i>tears </i>
    need to have the blood of Christ to wash them. How vain are our <i>vows! </i>
    How sensual are our<i> affections! </i>We confess, we are untuned and 
    unstrung for every holy action. We are never out of tune to <i>sin</i>—but 
    always out of tune to <i>pray</i>. We give the world our superior <i>
    affections </i>and our strongest <i>desires</i>. We should use this world as 
    if we used it not; but, alas, we pray as if we prayed not, and serve You as 
    if we served You not. There is not the <i>reverence</i>, nor that <i>
    devotion</i>, nor that activeness of <i>faith </i>that there should be. 
    Lord, if You should say that You would pardon all our sins to this time and 
    only judge us for this prayer—woe unto us! What breathing of <i>unbelief </i>
    and <i>hypocrisy </i>is there now, when we approach unto You!</p>
<p align="justify">We beg You, pardon us for Christ's sake. Who can tell how 
    often he offends? We can as well reckon the drops of the ocean—as number our 
    sins! We are filled up with <i>sins</i>—but have not filled Your bottle with 
    our <i>tears</i>. This is that which exceedingly aggravates our sins—that we 
    cannot <i>mourn </i>for sin. We can grieve for our <i>losses</i>—but we 
    cannot mourn for our <i>unkindnesses </i>to You. Sin has not only <i>defiled
    </i>us—but <i>hardened </i>us. Nothing can <i>melt </i>us—but the love of 
    Christ! Nothing can <i>soften </i>us—but the blood of Christ! O, do not 
    withhold Your mercies from us! O help us to eat the Passover Lamb with 
    bitter herbs. Let us look on Christ—and weep over Him. Let us look on a 
    broken Christ—with broken hearts; and on a bleeding Christ—with bleeding 
    hearts. Let us mourn for our insincerity, and that we should grieve You, who 
    is always doing us good. O humble us for our unkindness and, for Christ's 
    sake, blot out our transgressions! They are more than we can <i>number</i>—but 
    not more than You can <i>pardon!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Though we have lost the obedience of Your children—You 
    have not lost the goodness of a Father. Let us be held forth as <i>patterns 
    of mercy</i>, so shall we trumpet forth Your praise to all eternity! 
    Whatever afflictions You lay upon our <i>bodies</i>—let not our <i>sins </i>
    be unpardoned; let there be peace in heaven—and peace in the court of 
    conscience. We have found this part of Your Word true—in the world we shall 
    have trouble. Let us find the other part true—in Jesus Christ we shall have 
    peace. O let <i>peace </i>and <i>holiness </i>go together. Make us <i>new
    </i>creatures, that we may be <i>glorious </i>creatures! Without faith, 
    Christ will not profit us. When we can call nothing in the world ours—let us 
    call Christ ours.</p>
<p align="justify">Lord, draw Your image every day more lively upon us! Give 
    us a more lively <i>hope</i>, and a more inflamed <i>love </i>to Christ. Let 
    us have a spirit of courage and resolution; keep us from the fallacies of 
    our own hearts; keep us from the defilements of the times; make us pure in 
    heart that we may see You, that we may have <i>gospel </i>spirits, <i>humble
    </i>spirits, and <i>meek </i>spirits.</p>
<p align="justify">As Christ took our flesh, let us partake of His Spirit. 
    You embitter the<i> breast of the creature</i> to us—that we should find the 
    sweetness of the promise. There is as much in the promises as ever. Let us 
    live upon You; let us cast anchor in heaven, and we shall never sink.</p>
<p align="justify">Bless all Your <i>ordinances </i>to us. Make them to be 
    fullness of life to every one before You. We are come this day to partake of 
    them. O pour in wine and oil into our souls. Let us be as a watered garden; 
    let this blessed Sacrament be a poison to our<i> lust</i>—and nourishment 
    for our <i>grace! </i>Hear us—be our God—follow us with mercy—crown us with 
    acceptance. Do all this for Christ's sake, whom not seeing we love, in whom 
    believing we rejoice. </p>
<p align="justify">To the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit—be glory, honor, 
    and praise, now and forever, amen!</p>
