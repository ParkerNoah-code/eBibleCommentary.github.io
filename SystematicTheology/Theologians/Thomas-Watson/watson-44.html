<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>The Loveliness of Christ</b></font></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Yes! <b>He is altogether lovely!</b> This is my Beloved, 
    this my Friend!"</p></i> Song of Solomon 5:16
<p align="justify">In this book, which is <i>a divine marriage song</i>, are 
    all the strains of holy love set forth in the purest allegories and 
    metaphors, such as represent that dear affection and union between Christ 
    and His people. The text is nothing but the breathing forth of the spouse's 
    love to Christ: "He is altogether lovely!" In the preceding verses, she had 
    made her sacred paeans, and had been setting Christ forth in His spiritual 
    embroidery.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"He is dark and dazzling"</p></i> (verse 10). This denotes 
    excellency of complexion; in Him is a mixture of the purest colors. He is of 
    unspotted beauty.
<i>
<p align="justify">"The chief among ten thousand." </p></i>The Hebrew word 
    signifies "the standard-bearer among ten thousand." The standard is a 
    warlike ensign—and he who bore the standard in ancient times was the most 
    eminent person in the army. Just so, Christ is the most glorious person of 
    renown, the standard-bearer; according to Isaiah 11:10, <i>"He shall stand 
    for an ensign of the people."
<p align="justify">"His head is as the most fine gold" </p></i>(verse 11). Kings 
    have <i>crowns </i>of gold; Christ is described with a head of gold. The 
    Hebrew signifies shining gold, or sparkling gold, to set forth the infinite 
    resplendence of Christ's beauty. It is of such a sparkling luster that the 
    angels must wear a veil!
<i>
<p align="justify">"His eyes are as the eyes of doves" </p></i>(verse 12). 
    Christ is described with eyes like a flame of fire in Revelation 1:14. So 
    indeed He is to the wicked. He is a consuming fire; but to His children He 
    has doves' eyes, which are the emblem of meekness. He has eyes dropping 
    tears of love and compassion.
<i>
<p align="justify">"His cheeks are as a bed of spices"</p></i> (verse 13). There 
    is an aromatic perfume coming from Him to refresh a fainting soul. Some 
    expositors understand this bed of spices to mean the fragrancy of His 
    virtues, which are in Scripture compared to sweet perfumes.
<p align="justify">Thus the spouse goes on enumerating Christ's beauty; at 
    last being in a holy rapture of spirit, she winds up all with this 
    passionate strain of affection, <i>"His mouth is most sweet, yes, He is 
    altogether lovely."</i></p>
<p align="justify">"His mouth is most sweet." The Chaldean version 
    paraphrases it, "The words of His mouth are as sweet as honey." In the 
    Hebrew it is, "His mouth is sweetnesses." That mouth must be sweet which has 
    the words of eternal life (John 6:68). That mouth must be sweet, a kiss of 
    whose lips can make death sweet to a believer! Well might the spouse say, <i>
    "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth!" </i>(Song of Solomon 1:2).</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Yes, He is altogether lovely!"</p></i> It is as if the 
    spouse had said, "What do I do to set Christ forth in His several parts? His 
    head of gold, His eyes like doves eyes, His hands as gold rings set with 
    beryl, His belly as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires . . . alas, what is 
    all this that I have been speaking of Christ? How barren is my conception, 
    how dull are my expressions! Whatever I have said of Him falls infinitely 
    short of His worth; but this I affirm: <i>He is altogether lovely!"
</i>
<p align="justify">The original language is, "He is all made up of loves and 
    delights; He is all that may excite desire." So Jerome and Ambrose render 
    it: "He is composed of sweetness and amiableness."</p>
<p align="justify">The text contains a glorious and magnificent description 
    of Christ, <i>"He is altogether lovely!" </i>Behold here a spring full of 
    the water of life; and whoever brings his vessel here—a heart fit to receive 
    this water—may be refreshed, as was the woman of Samaria coming to Jacob's 
    well—for Christ is here! The text is a sacred cabinet which contains in it, 
    first, the <i>jewel</i>—Christ, in this word "He;" second, the <i>value </i>
    of this jewel—"altogether lovely."<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine: Jesus Christ is infinitely and superlatively 
    lovely.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">He is the most amazing and delightful object; the very 
    name of Jesus Christ is as a precious ointment poured forth. It is said that 
    the letters of this name were found engraved on Ignatius's heart. Jesus 
    Christ is in every believer's heart (Colossians 1:27, "<i>Christ in you"</i>); 
    and nothing can do better there, for He is altogether lovely.</p>
<p align="justify">This whole book of the Song of Solomon is bespangled with 
    the praises of Christ. Homer might praise Achilles, and Jerome might commend 
    Nepotian; but who can set forth Christ's praise? All that I can say will be 
    no more than the dark shadow in the picture; and yet it will be so much as 
    may represent him very lovely. That Christ is thus transcendently lovely, 
    will appear in four manner of ways—by titles, by types, by comparisons, and 
    by demonstrations.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ appears lovely by His TITLES.</p></b></font> These 
    are so many jewels hung upon His crown. He is called "The Desire of All 
    Nations" in Haggai 2:7, "The Prince of Peace" in Isaiah 9:6, "The Holy One 
    of God" in Acts 2:27, and "elect and precious" in 1 Peter 2:6. These are 
    lovely titles.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ appears lovely by TYPES.</p></b></font> He was 
    prefigured by such
<p align="justify">types as were lovely—and these types were either of 
    persons or things.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ was typified by most lovely <font color="#0000ff">
<b>persons</b></font>. I will name but three.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">MOSES </p></b></font>prefigured and typified out Christ in 
    four things:
<p align="justify">Moses was a type of Christ in his natural
    <font color="#b07050"><b>beauty</b></font>. He was a lovely child (Exodus 
    2:2). Josephus said, "Moses was so lovely that he drew the eyes of all to 
    him; and those who had seen him were so amazed at his beauty and fed on it 
    with such delight, that they were unwilling to look away again." And herein 
    he was a type of Christ, in whom are all sparkling beauties to be found, <i>
    "He is altogether lovely!"</i></p>

<p align="justify">Moses was a type of Christ in his <font color="#b07050">
<b>education</b></font>. He was bred up a while at court and, as Josephus 
    said, Pharaoh's daughter set a crown of gold upon his head. But leaving the 
    court, he went and lived in the land of Midian (Exodus 2:15). So Christ left 
    the royal court of heaven—to come and live in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">Moses was a type of Christ in his <font color="#b07050">
<b>office</b></font>. He was a PROPHET. Deuteronomy 34:10, "There has never 
    been another prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face." He 
    acquainted Israel with the mind of God; he gave them the two tables of the 
    law. So Jesus Christ is a prophet (Luke 24:19). He reveals to His people the 
    mysteries of salvation. He unseals the book of God's decrees and makes known 
    His will (Revelation 5:5). He is counted worthy of more glory than Moses 
    (Hebrews 3:3).</p>
<p align="justify">Moses was a type of Christ in his noble
    <font color="#b07050"><b>acts</b></font>. </p>
<p align="justify">He was a <i>deliverer </i>of the people from the Egyptian 
    furnace; he was a temporal savior. So Jesus' name signifies a <i>Savior</i>. 
    Matthew 1:21, "You are to name Him Jesus, because He will save His people 
    from their sins."</p>
<p align="justify">Moses was an <i>intercessor </i>for Israel and turned 
    away the wrath of God from them (Numbers 14). So Christ is the saints' 
    advocate. Romans 8:34: "He also rnakes intercession for us."</p>
<p align="justify">Christ was also typified by <font color="#008000"><b>
    DAVID</b></font>. David was a king; so is Christ adorned with regal power. 
    He is a king to <i>govern </i>His people (Revelation 15:3), and to <i>
    conquer </i>His enemies (Psalm 110:1). David was a man after God's own 
    heart. This prefigured Christ, in whom God was well pleased (Matthew 3:17).</p>
<p align="justify">Christ was also typified by <font color="#008000"><b>
    SOLOMON</b></font>, first in his <b>name</b>, which signifies "peaceable." 
    Christ is called "The Prince of Peace" in Isaiah 9:6. The angels proclaimed 
    this at His incarnation. Luke 2:14: "Peace on earth." All his wars tend to 
    peace. And He gives that peace which passes all understanding.</p>
<p align="justify">Solomon typified Christ in his <b>government</b>. His was 
    a most flourishing kingdom (2 Chronicles 9:22). King Solomon surpassed all 
    the kings of the earth in riches. So Christ's kingdom is very glorious; all 
    His subjects are made kings. He reigns in heaven and earth—and of His 
    kingdom there is no end.</p>
<p align="justify">Solomon typified Christ in His <b>wisdom</b>. He was the 
    oracle of his age (1 Kings 4:31) and was wiser than all men. So Christ 
    received the unction from His Father. He had a spirit of wisdom and holiness 
    poured upon Him without measure (John 3:34; Isaiah 11:2). "Behold, one 
    greater than Solomon is here!" (Matthew 12:42). Thus Jesus Christ was 
    prefigured by those persons who were most lovely.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ was typified by most lovely <font color="#0000ff">
<b>things</b></font>.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Type 1. </p></b></font>Christ was typified by the pillar of 
    cloud and fire, which was Israel's guide and conductor in the wilderness 
    (Exodus 13:21). This typified Christ, our pillar of cloud, who guides our 
    feet into the way of peace (Luke 1:79). The cloud was unerring, for God was 
    in it. Such is Christ, who is the way and the truth (John 14:6). How lovely 
    is this pillar to behold!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Type 2. </p></b></font>Christ was typified by the manna. This 
    pointed to Christ, who is like the manna in three things.
<p align="justify">The figure of manna was <i>circular</i>. Exodus 16:14: 
    "There lay a small <i>round </i>thing." The circle is a figure of 
    perfection; this typified Christ, in whom is all perfection.</p>
<p align="justify">The manna was a food <i>prepared </i>for Israel. The 
    Hebrew word (from whence manna seems to be derived) signifies "to prepare." 
    Manna was a food cooked and dressed in heaven. God Himself prepared it—and 
    then served it. Thus Jesus Christ was like manna: He was prepared and set 
    apart by His Father to the blessed work of mediatorship. Hebrews 10:5: "A 
    body have You prepared for Me."</p>
<p align="justify">The Jewish Rabbis say that manna suited itself to 
    everyone's taste; whatever he desired, that he found in manna. So Jesus 
    Christ suits Himself to every Christian's condition. He is full of 
    quickening, strengthening, comforting virtue. What fools are they, who 
    prefer the earthly mammon—before this heavenly manna!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Type 3.</p></b></font> Christ was typified by the mercy seat, 
    which was a sacred emblem representing the mercy of God to His people. There 
    the Lord gave forth His oracles and answers of peace to His people. Exodus 
    25:22: "There will I meet you—and I will commune with you." This mercy seat 
    was a type of Christ, in and through whom God is appeased towards us. 
    Therefore He is called a <i>sacrifice of atonement </i>in Romans 3:25. Oh, 
    how lovely is this mercy seat! We could not speak to God in prayer, nor 
    would He commune with us—were it not for this blessed atoning sacrifice. The 
    Hebrew word for mercy seat signifies a <i>covering</i>—to show that in 
    Christ the sins of believers are covered.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Type 4. </p></b></font>Christ was prefigured by the brazen 
    serpent (Numbers 21:9). The brazen serpent resembled Christ in two ways:
<p align="justify">It was made like a serpent—but it was no real serpent. 
    Just so, Christ was made in the likeness of sinful flesh (Romans 8:3), but 
    He was not a sinner. He was made sin—but He knew no sin. Christ was as void 
    of sin—as the brazen serpent was of a sting!</p>
<p align="justify">When the people of Israel were stung by the fiery 
    serpents, then whoever looked upon the brazen serpent was cured. Thus, when 
    sin stings the souls of men (for it is a serpent with five stings: it stings 
    men with guilt, shame, horror of conscience, death, and the curse of God), 
    then Christ, that brazen serpent, being looked upon with a <i>penitent's 
    believing eye</i>, cures these deadly stings! Oh, how lovely is this brazen 
    serpent! Many of the Jews worshiped the serpent of brass, "He broke into 
    pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made, because the people of Israel 
    had begun to worship it by burning incense to it. The brazen serpent was 
    called Nehushtan." (2 Kings 18:4). Let us in our hearts adore this brazen 
    serpent—the Lord Jesus.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Type 5.</p></b></font> Christ was typified by Noah's ark, 
    which saved Noah and his family from the flood. Thus when the wrath of God, 
    as a deluge, overflows the wicked, Christ is the Ark in which the believer 
    sails above those bloody waves—and is preserved from drowning! 
<p align="justify">And is not the Lord Jesus most lovely? All these types 
    did but serve to shadow forth the divine excellencies of Christ and render 
    Him lovely in our eyes!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. That Christ is this lovely appears by those 
    RESEMBLANCES to which the Scripture compares Him.</p></b></font> He is compared 
    to things that are
<p align="justify">most illustrious. There are seven lovely resemblances of 
    Christ in Scripture:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ is resembled to a ROSE.</p></b></font> Song of 
    Solomon 2:1: <i>"I am the Rose of Sharon." </i>The rose is the <i>queen of 
    flowers</i>; it is most delicious for color and scent—to show that fragrant 
    perfume which Christ sends forth. All roses, though beautiful, have their 
    prickles; only the Rose of Sharon does not! So sweet is this <i>rose of 
    paradise </i>that it makes us become a sweet fragrance to God (2 Corinthians 
    2:15). This rose never loses its color nor fragrancy! Is it not then, very 
    lovely?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ is resembled to a VINE</p></b></font> in John 15:1. 
    The vine, as Pliny says, is the noblest of plants—and to this Christ is 
    compared. Oh, what lovely clusters grow upon this Vine: the <i>fruits </i>of 
    justification, sanctification, and so on! These bunches of grapes hang upon 
    the Lord Jesus. We are indebted to this Vine. Hosea 14:8: "From Me is your 
    fruit found." Nay, Christ excels the vine. For though there are many things 
    on the vinetree besides the fruit that are useful—the leaves, the gum, the 
    ashes of the vine—yet the wood of the vine is useless "Can wood be taken 
    from it to make something useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang 
    things on?" (Ezekiel 15:3). 
<p align="justify">Now herein Christ is more lovely than the vinetree; there 
    is nothing in Christ which is not useful. We have need of His <i>human </i>
    nature; we have need of His <i>divine </i>nature; we have need of His <i>
    offices</i>, <i>influences</i>, <i>privileges</i>—there is nothing in this 
    vine which we can be without. Oh, how blessed are the branches of this Vine! 
    Mary was saved not by <i>bearing </i>the Vine—but by being <i>engrafted </i>
    into the Vine!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is resembled to a CORNERSTONE</p></b></font> in 1 
    Peter 2:6, and that in two respects: 
<p align="justify">First, the whole weight of the building lies upon the 
    cornerstone. Just so, the weight of our salvation lies upon Christ (1 
    Corinthians 3:11-12). </p>
<p align="justify">Second, the cornerstone knits and unites together both 
    parts of the building. Just so, when God and man were at variance, Christ, 
    as the cornerstone, united them together, yes—and cemented them with His own 
    blood! Oh, how lovely and precious is this cornerstone!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Christ is resembled to a ROCK</p></b></font>. 1 
    Corinthians 10:4: "That Rock was Christ." He is a Rock in a threefold sense:
    
<p align="justify">First, He is a rock of <b>offense</b>. A rock breaks the 
    waves. The church, being built upon Christ—all the adversaries that come 
    against her are like a ship coming full sail against a rock. </p>
<p align="justify">Second, He is a Rock for <b>defense</b>. The dove hides 
    in the rock. Song of Solomon 2:14: "O my dove in the clefts of the rock." 
    Christ's wounds are the clefts of the rock where the believing soul, this 
    dove, hides itself! </p>
<p align="justify">Third, He is a rock for <b>comfort</b>. The rock is a 
    screen to shade off the heat; so Christ is called in Isaiah 25:4, "a shade 
    from the heat." He shades a poor sinner from the scorchings of God's wrath! 
    Also, honey came out of the rock in Deuteronomy 32:13: "He made him to suck 
    honey out of the rock—and oil out of the flinty rock." The <i>honey </i>of 
    the promises—and the <i>oil </i>of gladness come out of this blessed Rock!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Christ is compared to a RIVER in a desert. </p></b></font>
    "He will shelter Israel from the storm and the wind. He will refresh her as 
    a<i> <b>river </b>in the desert </i>and as the cool shadow of a large rock 
    in a hot and weary land." (Isaiah 32:2). When by nature we are as a scorched 
    wilderness, dry and barren, Christ sends forth the sacred influences of His 
    blood and Spirit, making us like the fields of Sharon—full of moisture and 
    fertility! Are not these silver streams lovely!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Christ is resembled to a rich TREASURY.</p></b></font> 
    Riches are lovely in men's eyes. Ephesians 3:8 speaks of "the unsearchable 
    riches of Christ." The angels can never dig to the bottom of this golden 
    mine! Christ has the true monopoly, because He has those riches which are 
    nowhere else to be found: the riches of His merit—and the riches of His 
    Spirit. Christ has a partnership with His Father. John 16:15: "All that the 
    Father has, is Mine." He is crowned with the riches of the Deity. Alexander 
    had no regard for the kingdom of Macedonia when he heard of the riches of 
    India. Just so, a Christian will in a manner despise all other riches—when 
    he has Christ's riches (Philippians 3:8).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Christ is resembled to a beautiful ROBE.</p></b></font> 
    Isaiah 61:10: "He has covered me with the <i>robe of righteousness</i>." 
    Christ's righteousness is a lovely robe; no robe of gold or ermine, with 
    which kings are invested, is so honorable as this one. In this robe we shine 
    as angels in God's eyes. The high priest's glorious vestments (Exodus 
    28:2)—the miter, the robe, the ephod of gold, and the breastplate of 
    precious stones—did all serve to set out the beautiful garment of Christ's 
    righteousness, with which a believer is adorned. Thus Christ appears lovely 
    in these several resemblances, which can but faintly shadow out His beauty.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Christ's loveliness appears by His DEMONSTRATIONS.</p></b></font> 
    He is lovely in <i>Himself</i>—and He is lovely in the account of <i>others</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">A. He is lovely in HIMSELF</p></b></font>—and that in five 
    ways.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He is lovely in His person—as He is MAN.</p></b></font> 
    Psalm 45:2: "You are the most excellent of men." The Hebrew is emphatic, 
    denoting <i>excellency of beauty</i>; for though it is said He had no 
    loveliness (Isaiah 53:2), that was in regard of His afflictions, which so 
    disfigured Him and, as it were, drew a veil over His glory. Yet certainly 
    the person of Christ was incomparably fair, as Jerome and Chrysostom 
    observe; and if His body on earth was so beautiful, what is it now in 
    heaven! The apostle calls it a glorious body in Philippians 3:21. If Christ 
    can make a lily of the field more beautiful than Solomon in all his glory, 
    how lovely is He Himself? How white is that lily which grows in paradise?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's person is lovely—as He is GOD-man. </p></b>
</font>He may not unfitly be compared to Jacob's ladder, which reached from 
    earth to heaven. Christ's human nature, which was the foot of the ladder, 
    stood upon the earth; and His divine nature, which was the top of the 
    ladder, reached to heaven. The Arians and Socinians deny His Godhead, as the 
    Valentians do His manhood. If the Godhead is in Him, He must be God; but the 
    Godhead shines in Him. Colossians 2:9: "In Him dwells all the fullness of 
    the Godhead."
<p align="justify">To confirm us in this truth, let us consult with those 
    Scriptures which clearly assert His Godhead:</p>
<p align="justify">1 Corinthians 8:6: "To us there is but one God the 
    Father, of whom are all things—and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all 
    things."</p>
<p align="justify">When Philippians 2:6 uses the phrase "who, being in the 
    form of God," this is as much, Basil said, as to exist in the essence of 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">1 Timothy 3:16: "God was manifest in the flesh."</p>
<p align="justify">1 John 5:20: "We are in Him that is true, even in His Son 
    Jesus Christ. This is the true God."</p>
<p align="justify">Besides these testimonies of Scripture which expressly 
    assert the Godhead of Christ, it may be clearly demonstrated by those 
    incommunicable attributes belonging to the Deity which are ascribed to 
    Christ—and are the flowers of His crown: omnipotence (Hebrews 1:3); 
    omniscience (Mark 2:8); omnipresence (Matthew 28:20); a power to seal 
    pardons (Matthew 9:6); the giving of the Holy Spirit (John 16:7); 
    co-equality with God the Father (Philippians 2:6) in both power (John 5:19, 
    21) and dignity (John 5:23).</p>
<p align="justify">Thus we see His Godhead proved; and as He is God-man, He 
    is altogether lovely. He is the very picture of His Father's glory; 
    therefore He is called the express image and character of His person in 
    Hebrews 1:3. The very effigies and print of God's face are seen in Christ; 
    the glory of God's wisdom, holiness, and mercy most transparently shine 
    forth in Him—thus His person is lovely.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is lovely in His DISPOSITION.</p></b></font> A good 
    nature is able to render deformity itself lovely. Christ is lovely not only 
    in his complexion—but in His disposition. He is of a loving and merciful 
    disposition, and in this sense may he called the delight of mankind. It is 
    reported of Marcus Aurelius, the emperor, that he was of a most affable 
    winning temper, given to clemency—and every day would set one hour apart to 
    hear the causes of the poor. Thus Jesus Christ is of a most sweet 
    disposition. He will not always chide (Psalm 103:9). He is inclined to show 
    mercy to the penitent. He delights in mercy (Micah 7:18). He invites sinners 
    to come to Him (Matthew 11:28). He begs them to be saved (2 Corinthians 
    5:20). He knocks at their hearts by His Spirit, until His head is filled 
    with dew and His locks with the drops of the night (Revelation 3:20). If any 
    poor soul accepts His offer, and arises and goes to Him—how Christ welcomes 
    him. Christ makes the feast (Luke 15:23) and the angels make the music 
    (verse 7). But if men will not receive the offers of grace, Christ grieves 
    (Mark 3:5). He is like a judge who passes the sentence with tears in his 
    eyes. Luke 19:41: "And when He was come near the city, He beheld it and 
    wept." You can hear Christ saying, "Ah, sinners, I come to save you—but you 
    put away salvation from you. I come with healing under My wings—but you bolt 
    from your Physician. I would have you but open your hearts to receive Me and 
    I will open heaven to receive you; but you will rather stay with your sins 
    and die—than come to Me and live." Psalm 81:11: "My people would not listen 
    to me; Israel would not submit to Me." "Well, sinners, I will weep at your 
    funerals." Oh, how lovely Christ is, in His disposition! He comes with His 
    suppling oil to pour into sinners' wounds. He would gladly break their 
    hearts with His mercies. He labors to overcome their evil with His good.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Christ is lovely in His SUFFERINGS</p></b></font> when He 
    makes expiation for our sins. But how can He be lovely in His sufferings? 
    Lovely when He was buffeted, spat upon, and smeared with blood? Oh, yes! He 
    was most lovely upon the cross—because then He showed most love to us. He 
    bled <i>love </i>from every vein! His drops of blood were love-drops. The 
    more bloody—the more lovely. The more Christ endured for us—the more dear He 
    ought to be to us. Osorius, writing of the sufferings of Christ, said that 
    the crown of thorns bored His head with seventy-two wounds; and Tully, when 
    he speaks of the death of the cross, shows his rhetoric best by a silence: 
    "What shall I say of His death?" Though he was a great orator, he lacked 
    words to express it.
<p align="justify">Nor did Christ only endure pain in His body—but agony in 
    His soul. He conflicted with the wrath of God, which He could never have 
    done if He had not been more than a man. We read that the altar of wood was 
    overlaid with brass so that the fire on the altar might not consume the wood 
    (Exodus 27:1-2). This altar was a type of Jesus Christ. The human nature of 
    Christ, which was the wood, was covered with the divine nature, which was 
    like brass, else the fire of God's wrath would have consumed it.</p>
<p align="justify">All that Christ suffered was in our stead (Isaiah 53:5). 
    We ate the sour grapes—-and His teeth were set on edge. We climbed the tree, 
    we stole the forbidden fruit—and Christ goes up the ladder of the cross and 
    dies! Oh, how lovely ought a bleeding Savior to be in our eyes! Let us wear 
    this blessed crucifix always in our heart. <i>"The cross of Christ," </i>
    said Damascen, <i>"is the golden key that opens paradise to us."</i></p>
<p align="justify">How beautiful Christ is upon the cross! The ruddiness of 
    His blood—took away the redness of our guilt. How lovely are those wounds 
    which wounded the red dragon! When this blessed Rock was smitten, water came 
    out of it to cleanse us and blood to cheer us (1 John 5:6). "When Christ was 
    on the cross," said Bernard, "then the vine was cut—and salvation came to us 
    in the blood of the vine." Oh, how lovely is this bleeding Vine! Christ's <i>
    crucifixion</i>—is our <i>coronation!</i></p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Christ is lovely in His GRACES </p></b></font>which, as a 
    divine embroidery, bespangled and set Him off in the eyes of the world. 
    Grace was not in Christ as a quality—but as an essence, as light is 
    intrinsic to the sun and is of the essence of it. Christ opened a box of 
    precious perfume and, because of the fragrance of His ointments, the virgins 
    love Him (Song of Solomon 1:3). In Christ there was a constellation of all 
    the graces; how He shone in wisdom, humility, zeal, heavenly-mindedness, 
    and, which did not adorn Him only a little little, meekness. How lovely was 
    Christ in His graces! 
<p align="justify">He came into the world meek. Matthew 21:5: "Behold your 
    King comes meek." He came not with a sword or scepter in His hand—but with 
    an olive branch of peace in His mouth. He preached tidings of peace (Matthew 
    11:29). Though He was the Lion of Judah—yet He was the Lamb of God.</p>
<p align="justify">When He was in the world, He was a pattern of meekness. 1 
    Peter 2:23: "When He was reviled, He reviled not again." He left His 
    Father's bosom, that hive of sweetness, to come and live here; and truly, He 
    exchanged His palace for a dunghill. How often He was called a <i>friend of 
    sinners</i>; nay, He was charged to have a devil. But. see how mildly He 
    answered (this dove had no gall) in John 8:49: "I have no devil—but I honor 
    My Father." All His words were steeped in <i>honey</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">When He was going out of the world, He showed 
    unparalleled meekness. He prayed for His enemies, "Father forgive them" 
    (Luke 23:34). When the soldiers came to take Him by force, one would have 
    thought that He would have called for fire from heaven, as the man of God 
    did in 2 Kings 1:10. But, behold, grace was poured into His lips (Psalm 
    45:2). See what a mild answer He gave, enough to have made the hardest heart 
    relent. Matthew 26:55: "Am I some dangerous criminal, that you have come 
    armed with swords and clubs to arrest Me?" It is as if He had said, "What 
    wrong, I ask, have I done to you? What have I stolen from the world—but 
    their sins? What have I robbed them of—but the wrath of God?" Oh, the 
    mildness of this Savior! Surely, had not the soldiers' hearts been very hard 
    (for in the whole story of Christ's passion I do not read of one soldier 
    converted; there was a thief indeed converted—but no soldier), Christ's 
    meekness would have melted them into tears of repentance. </p>
<p align="justify">When He was led away to be crucified—He went as a lamb to 
    the slaughter. "He opened not His mouth" (Isaiah 53:7). He opened His <i>
    side</i>—but not His <i>mouth </i>in repining. And was not Christ lovely in 
    His meekness? No wonder the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the likeness 
    of a Dove; not a lion or eagle—but a Dove, which is the emblem of meekness.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Christ is lovely in His CONDUCT.</p></b></font> What was 
    said of Saul and Jonathan in 2 Samuel 1:23 ("they were lovely in their 
    lives") is much more true of Christ. "His life," said Chrysostom, "was purer 
    than the sunbeams." All the ethics of Aristotle and all the wisdom of 
    Greece, could never describe virtue as it was livelily portrayed out in 
    Christ's holy example. He is called "a Lamb without spot" (1 Peter 1:19). 
    His lips never spoke a word amiss. Luke 4:22: "All bore Him witness, and 
    wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth." Thus were 
    His lips like lilies, dripping pure myrrh (Song of Solomon 5:13). His foot 
    never tread a step awry. He who was a way to others—never went out of the 
    way Himself. He was so pure, that no temptation could fasten upon Him. 
    Temptation to Christ was like throwing a burr upon a crystal glass, which 
    will not stick—but glides off. "The prince of this world comes and has no 
    power over Me" (John 14:30). There was no powder for the devil's fire to 
    take. What was Christ's whole life—but a pattern of good works? "He went 
    about doing good" (Acts 10:38). He was either anointing the blind, healing 
    the sick, raising the dead, preaching, or working miracles. Thus He was 
    altogether lovely.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">B. And then Christ is lovely in the account of OTHERS.</p></b>
</font>He is lovely to God His Father, lovely to the saints—and lovely to 
    the angels.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He is lovely to God His Father.</p></b></font> God is 
    infinitely delighted with Him. Christ is called "the Rose of Sharon," and 
    how God delights to smell this rose! Isaiah 42:1: "My Chosen One in whom My 
    soul delights." Surely if there is loveliness enough in Christ to delight 
    the heart of God, there may well be enough in Him to delight us. Christ is 
    the center, where all the lines of His Father's love do meet.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ is lovely in the account and esteem of His 
    saints.</p></b> </font>2 Thessalonians 1:10: "He shall admired by all those who 
    have believed." He is admired now—and He shall be more admired by them. Well 
    may the saints admire to see Christ sitting in the bright robe of their 
    flesh above the angels in glory. Well may they admire to see their nature 
    united with the Deity. Oh, how lovely and beautiful is this sight! Well may 
    Christ be admired by His saints.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is lovely in the esteem of the angels.</p></b>
</font>They adore Him. Hebrews 1:6: "And let all the angels of God worship 
    Him." The cherubim are painted with their faces looking upwards, to show 
    that the angels in heaven all are still looking upward, admiring and being 
    ravished with the amazing beauties of Jesus Christ.<br/>
 
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">APPLICATION</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">A. Information</p></b></font>. There are three branches:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 1. Behold here, as in a Scripture glass—the 
    transcendent excellencies of the Lord Jesus!</p></b></font> "He is altogether 
    lovely." He is a lovely prospect set before us. I do not wonder that Paul, 
    that seraphic saint, desired to know nothing, but Jesus Christ (1 
    Corinthians 2:2). What else would He want to know? He is altogether lovely; 
    no wonder then that the apostles left all—and followed Him (Matthew 19:27). 
    Had I the tongues of angels, I could never set forth Christ in all His 
    lively and lovely colors. Besides what has been said, take a further view of 
    Christ's lovely excellencies in three particulars:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Christ is our LIGHT. </p></b></font>Light is a glorious 
    creation (Ecclesiastes 11:7). Truly the light is sweet; the light pulls off 
    the veil and draws aside the dark curtains of the night, making everything 
    appear in its fresh colors. Thus Jesus Christ is lovely. He is called that 
    true light (John 1:9) and the bright and morning star (Revelation 22:16). 
    When the soul is darkened with ignorance, Christ is the morning star that 
    enlightens it. He is the Sun of Righteousness (Malachi 4:2).
<p align="justify">This Sun of Righteousness is more glorious than the sun 
    in the sky. The sun in the firmament rises and sets—but the Sun of 
    Righteousness, once it rises upon the soul in conversion, never sets finally 
    upon him. It may pull in its beams when the clouds of our sin come 
    between—but it comes out of the cloud again (as it did to David) and never 
    sets finally. The sun in the sky only shines <i>upon </i>us—but the Sun of 
    Righteousness shines <i>within </i>us. Galatians 1:16: "But when it pleased 
    God to reveal His Son <i>in </i>me." The sun in the sky shines only upon our
    <i>faces</i>—but the Sun of Righteousness shines in our <i>hearts</i>. 2 
    Corinthians 4:6: "God has shined in our hearts." And how sweet are these 
    beams! The sun in the sky shines only in the daytime—but the Sun of 
    Righteousness shines in the night; in the night of spiritual desertion and 
    affliction, this Sun shines. Psalm 112:4: "Unto the upright there arises 
    light in darkness." Oh, how lovely in this Sun of Righteousness! By the 
    bright beams of this Sun, we see God.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Christ is our FOOD. </p></b></font>He is not only lovely 
    to the eye—but to the taste. John 6:55: "My flesh is food indeed." This is 
    princely fare; it was never prepared for the angels—but for us. It is lovely 
    feeding here; all the rarities of heaven are served in this dish!
<p align="justify">"And My blood is drink indeed." This blood is better than 
    wine. Wine may be taken in excess. Noah took too much of the wine of the 
    grape—but it is otherwise with the wine of Christ's blood; there is no fear 
    of excess here. Though a drop is sweet—yet the more we drink, the better; 
    the deeper, the sweeter! Drink, yes, drink <i>abundantly</i>, O beloved. 
    Excess here makes us sober!</p>
<p align="justify">Wine, though it cheers the heart—yet at some times, if it 
    is taken, it may be harmful. Give wine in a fever—and it is as bad as 
    poison. But this wine of Christ's blood is best in a fever. When the heart 
    burns as hot as hell in the sense of God's wrath, and, as it were, in a 
    spiritual agony and fever—then a drop of Christ's blood allays the 
    inflammation—and sweetly refreshes the soul. It is lovely drinking at this 
    Fountain!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is our LIFE. </p></b></font>Colossians 3:4: "When 
    Christ who is our life shall appear." Life is sweet; life makes everything 
    comfortable. In this the devil said truly, "skin for skin, yes, all that a 
    man has will he give for his life" (Job 2:4). A man will cast his jewels 
    overboard to save his life; he will lose a leg or an arm to preserve the 
    vital parts. Is life lovely—and is not Christ, who is our life, lovely? 
<p align="justify">He was typified by the <i>tree of life </i>in the garden 
    (Genesis 2:9). That tree was symbolic, as Augustine said; it was a pledge 
    and sign of life—if man had continued in obedience. It was certainly a 
    lovely tree—but it was only a type of Christ, who is called "the tree of 
    life" in Revelation 2:7. This tree of life, the Lord Jesus, is a better tree 
    than that which grew in paradise. Adam's tree in paradise might preserve 
    life—but it could not prevent death; there was dying for all that. But this 
    tree of life, Jesus Christ, prevents death. John 11:26: "Whoever believes in 
    Me shall never die," that is—not die the second death spoken of in 
    Revelation 20:14. This blessed tree is an antidote against death. If there 
    were a tree to be found in the world that could preserve men from dying, how 
    far would they go on pilgrimage to reach it? What vast sums of money would 
    they give for one leaf of that tree? Such a tree is Christ—He will keep you 
    from dying! And is not this tree very lovely?</p>
<p align="justify">In particular, there is a threefold life flowing from 
    Jesus Christ: </p>
<p align="justify">There is a life of GRACE. John 1:16: "We have all 
    received grace after grace from His fullness." This life of grace, is a bud 
    of eternity; it is a life purchased for us by Christ's death. </p>
<p align="justify">There is a life of COMFORT, which is the cream of life. 
    John 16:22: "Your heart shall rejoice." This is a holy jubilation of spirit; 
    so sweet and ravishing is this joy that if David, when he had lost his joy 
    had lost also his crown, and God had put the question to him which of these 
    two he would have restored, David would have said, "Lord, restore unto me 
    the joy of Your salvation" (Psalm 51:12). </p>
<p align="justify">There is also a life of GLORY. (John 17:22). This is the 
    most noble life; this is to live the life of angels, nay, to live the life 
    of God! It is the highest elevation and perfection of the reasonable 
    creature. And may we not cry out with Chrysostom, <i>"What is more lovely 
    than Christ, from whom these golden streams of life flow!" </i>Oh, that all 
    this might make Him amiable in our eyes!</p>
<p align="justify">What else should we admire? What should we rejoice in, 
    but Christ? Christ's beauty, like His coat, is without seam. We read of 
    Absalom (2 Samuel 14:25) that in all Israel there was none to be so praised 
    as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot, even to the crown of 
    his head, there was no blemish in him. This may be far more truly applied to 
    Christ. He is the mirror of beauty, the map of perfection, the paradise of 
    delight! He is the crown of the gospel. If the gospel is the field—Christ is 
    the pearl hidden in the field. If the gospel is the ring—Christ is the 
    diamond in this ring. He is the glory of heaven. Revelation 21:23: "The Lamb 
    is the light thereof." Well might Paul account all things dross and dung, 
    for Christ (Philippians 3:8).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 2. If Christ is altogether lovely, it shows us the 
    true reason why men do not embrace Christ, namely, because they are ignorant 
    of His beauty. </p></b></font>A blind man does not admire the colors in a 
    rainbow; and when the god of this world has blinded men's eyes—they do not 
    see any excellency in Christ. Therefore they cry out, as the watchmen did, 
    "What is your Beloved more than another beloved?" Men do not admire the 
    sun—because the cloud of their <i>ignorance </i>comes between. Christ is a 
    treasure—but a <i>hidden </i>treasure. He is more lovely than the children 
    of men—but to a natural person He is like Moses, with a veil upon His face. 
    The men of the world do not see the stupendous beauty of Christ. He does not 
    lack <i>worth</i>—but they lack <i>eyes! </i>"O unhappy man," said 
    Augustine, "who knows all things—but Christ! Your knowledge will but serve 
    to light you to hell."
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But you will say to me, "What, not know Christ? 
    I hope we are better bred than that! Has Christ been preached so long in our 
    streets—and we not know Him?"</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. I wish there were not many people grossly 
    ignorant of Christ, who understand nothing of His person, offices, or 
    privileges. A minister told me that not long since, he went to visit a 
    neighbor of his parish lying on his deathbed, a man eighty years of age, one 
    who came frequently to church. This minister questioned him about what sin 
    was—and the man said he did not know; he asked him who Christ was—and he 
    told him he did not know. So the minister said to him, "If you do not know 
    Christ, how do you think to go to heaven?" His answer was this, "If I cannot 
    get to heaven, I will just stay here." Oh, gross ignorance! Balaam's donkey 
    spoke better sense to the prophet.</p>
<p align="justify">That people have been very ignorant of Jesus Christ 
    appears by this, because they have been so inclined to error, so greedy to 
    drink in every new opinion as soon as the devil has set it abroach!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Whereas you say, "Can we be ignorant of Christ 
    in this broad daylight of the gospel?" I say, a man may have excellent head 
    notions of Christ—and may be able to make an elegant discourse of Him—and 
    yet not know Him savingly. Though he is not rationally ignorant of 
    Christ—yet he may be spiritually ignorant. There is a threefold defect in 
    the knowledge of most. It is a speculation without conviction, affection, or 
    operation.</p>
<p align="justify">Their supposed knowledge is merely a speculation, without
    <b>conviction</b>. Men are not thoroughly convinced of the excellencies of 
    Christ. John 16:8: "And when He (that is the Holy Spirit) comes, He shall 
    convince the world of sin." Strange! Was not Christ in the world? Had He not 
    made many sermons about sin? It is true, He had; but the Jews were not yet 
    convinced of it. Therefore He shall send His Spirit to convince them. "And 
    of righteousness." Why? Had not Christ told them that there was no 
    righteousness to be found, but in Him—that they could graft their hopes of 
    salvation upon no other stock besides? Yes, they had heard Christ say so—but 
    they were not yet convinced; therefore the Spirit shall come and convince 
    them. Hence I gather that men may have a speculative knowledge of Christ—yet 
    be ignorant of Him, that is, not know Him convincingly. And that they do not 
    have a convincing knowledge is clear; for were they convinced in their 
    consciences of the lovely excellencies of Christ, would they value a lust or 
    trifle? Would they, with Judas, prefer thirty pieces of</p>
<p align="justify">silver before Him?</p>
<p align="justify">Their "knowledge" is a speculation, without <b>affection</b>. 
    Men have notions of Christ—but are not warmed with love for Christ. Their 
    knowledge is like the moon: it has light in it—but no heat. True knowledge 
    of Christ is like fire to the ice—it melts it into water. So this saving 
    knowledge melts the sinner into tears of love. I do the hypocrite no 
    wrong—to tell him that he bears no true affection to Jesus Christ. There is 
    a great deal of difference between the knowledge that the prisoner has of 
    the judge—and the knowledge the child has of the parent. The prisoner knows 
    the judge—but has no affection for him; his knowledge is joined with fear 
    and hatred. But the child's knowledge of his parent is joined with 
    affection; he loves to be in his presence. The hypocrite knows Christ as the 
    prisoner does the judge, or as the devils knew Him (Mark 1:24), with a 
    knowledge of horror and amazement; whereas true knowledge is filial. The 
    affections are drawn forth in an inflamed manner after Him. The apostle has 
    an elegant expression to set forth the nature of true knowledge; he calls it 
    "the <i>savor </i>of the knowledge of Him" (2 Corinthians 2:14). A man 
    tastes a savory sweetness in his meat—but hypocrites have no taste for 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Their "knowledge" is a speculation, without <b>operation</b>. 
    The knowledge that hypocrites have of Christ, has no saving influence upon 
    them; it does not make them more holy. It is one thing to have a <i>notion
    </i>of Christ—another thing to fetch virtue from Christ. The knowledge of 
    hypocrites is a dead, barren knowledge; it does not brings forth the <i>
    child of obedience</i>. There is a great deal of difference between a 
    scholar who studies medicine for the theory and notion—and one who studies 
    medicine to practice it. Hypocrites are not practitioners; they are all head 
    and no feet; they do not walk in Christ (Colossians 2:6). Their knowledge is 
    informing—but not transforming; it does not make them one jot the better; it 
    does not leave a spiritual <i>tincture of holiness </i>behind. Such 
    knowledge is no better than ignorance. </p>
<p align="justify">1 John 2:4: "He who says, 'I know Him,' and keeps not His 
    commandments, is a liar—and the truth is not in him." A man may have a 
    speculative knowledge—and be no better than a devil. This is the reason why 
    men do not embrace Christ, who is infinitely lovely, because they do not 
    know His worth. Though they are not intellectually ignorant of Christ—yet 
    they are spiritually ignorant. To this day the veil is upon their hearts.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 3. If Jesus Christ is so lovely—it shows us the 
    misery of a man who lives and dies without Christ.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Behold his misery who lives without Christ. He is very <b>
    deformed </b>and unlovely; for all loveliness flows from Christ. A sinner in 
    the state of nature is like an infant tumbling in its blood. Ezekiel 16:6: 
    "You were in your blood." In Leviticus 13, the leper in the law was but the 
    sad emblem of a sinner. The leper was to live alone, as being unworthy to 
    come into the congregation of the holy. The leper wore three marks to be 
    known by: his garments torn, his head bare, his mouth covered. He was to 
    cry, "Unclean, unclean." This spiritual leprosy is upon every Christless 
    sinner.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore a man in a state of unregeneracy is in 
    Scripture <b>compared </b>to most vile things most: to a <i>dog </i>
    (Revelation 22:15); to a <i>swine </i>(2 Peter 2:22); to a <i>viper </i>
    (Matthew 3:7); and to a <i>devil </i>(John 6:70). A sinner's heart is a 
    poisoned spring; it is like a piece of muddy ground which defiles the purest 
    water that runs through it. The heathen had this kind of notion engrafted 
    into them for, as authors report, they had their stone pots of water set at 
    the doors of their temple, where they used to wash before they went to 
    sacrifice. </p>
<p align="justify">A sinner is <b>blind </b>(Revelation 3:17)—and the more 
    blind because he thinks he sees. He is <b>dead</b>; and although he may be 
    decked with some moral virtues, this is but like strewing flowers upon a 
    dead corpse (Ephesians 2:1). Dead things have no beauty in them. A sinner 
    out of Christ is a <b>filthy</b>, vile creature; he is nothing but dregs; he 
    is hell epitomized. There is no part of him sound. The man who had his 
    running sore in his flesh (Leviticus 15:2) was but a type of a sinner who 
    has the plague-sores of sin running upon him (1 Kings 8:38). Oh, how ghastly 
    and deformed is every Christless soul! God loathes him. Zechariah 11:8: "My 
    soul loathed them!" So abominable and detestable is a sinner, that God 
    stands afar off (Psalm 138:6). He will not come near the stench of him. </p>
<p align="justify">The sinner is so deformed and diseased that, when he 
    comes to be converted, the first thing he does is to <b>loathe </b>himself. 
    Ezekiel 36:31: "You shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your 
    iniquities." Thus unlovely is every person out of Christ. If he brags of his 
    goodness, it is because he never yet looked at his face in the looking-glass 
    of God's Word so that would discover his spots and blemishes.</p>
<p align="justify">Behold his misery who dies without Christ. Though Jesus 
    Christ is so infinitely beautiful, the sinner shall see none of His beauty. 
    Christ will put a veil upon his face, as Moses did when his face shone 
    (Exodus 34:33). Nay, that is not all; though Christ is so lovely in 
    Himself—yet to an ungodly sinner He will be dreadful to behold. A wicked man 
    shall see nothing in Christ that is lovely. The Sun of Righteousness will be 
    eclipsed to him. His <i>beauty </i>will be changed into <i>fury</i>. The <i>
    Lamb </i>will be turned to a <i>Lion</i>. Christ's visage will strike the 
    heart of a sinner with horror and dread. King Ahasuerus was pleasant to 
    Queen Esther to behold when he held forth the golden scepter; but how 
    dreadful was his visage to Haman, when he arose from the banquet of wine in 
    his wrath! His look carried death in its face. So, though Christ is so 
    lovely in Himself—and full of smiling beauty to His saints—yet to those who 
    reject Him and die in their sins, oh, how ghastly and frightening will His 
    looks be! His eyes will be as a flame of fire! (Revelation 1:14).</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is represented with a <i>bow </i>and a <i>crown
    </i>(Revelation 6:2). He will appear to the saints with a <i>crown</i>—very 
    lovely and glorious to behold; but to the wicked He will appear with His 
    bow—to shoot at them with the arrows of His indignation. We read in Psalm 
    97:2 that "clouds and darkness are round about Him." To believers Christ 
    will shine forth with His rays of majesty and beauty; but to the wicked He 
    will cover Himself with a cloud of displeasure. This will be the <i>hell of 
    hell </i>to the damned—they shall be shut out from a sight of Christ's 
    glory—and shall behold only a sight of His wrath! "And they cried to the 
    mountains and the rocks—<i>Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One 
    who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb!" </i>(Revelation 
    6:16). "Christ," said Jerome, "will be as dreadful to a sinner, as the sight 
    of hell-fire!"</p>

<p align="justify">B. Exhortation.</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Branch 1. If Christ is so infinitely lovely—then let us 
    labor to get a part in Christ </p></font></b>so that the cursed deformity of our 
    nature may be taken away—and the bespangled beauties of holiness may shine 
    in us! It is little comfort for the soul to say, "Christ is altogether 
    lovely," unless it can also say, "My Beloved is mine!" (Song of Solomon 
    2:16). Ignatius did not care what befell him—as long as he had Christ. Clear 
    your interest in Christ; the ground of salvation is union with Christ. 
    "There are," said Bernard, "many professors who have nothing of Christ in 
    them." Oh, labor to be made one with Christ, to have Christ not only in your 
    Bible—but in your heart; renounce your own
<p align="justify">beauty, all your abilities, moralities, and duties. These 
    are a rotten bough to hold on to. Philippians 3:9: "That I may be found in 
    Him, not having my own righteousness." </p>
<p align="justify">When Augustus Caesar desired the senate of Rome to join 
    with him in the consulship, the senate answered that they held it a great 
    disparagement to him to join any consul with him. So Jesus Christ takes it 
    as a great disparagement to Him—to join our duties, with His merits. O 
    sinner, cast away your beggars' rags—so that you may put on Christ's lovely 
    robes. I would not take you off from your duty—but from <i>confidence </i>in 
    your duty. Noah's dove might make use of her wings to fly—but she did not 
    trust her wings—but the ark. A man makes use of his feet to go over a 
    bridge—but he trusts the bridge for safety. Christians, while they walk with 
    the feet of obedience, must trust Christ as the bridge to lead them over the 
    devouring sea of hell. In short, if you should get a saving interest in 
    Christ, rely on Christ by faith—and resign yourself up to Christ by service.
    </p>
<p align="justify">A believer with one hand receives Christ—and with the 
    other hand gives himself up to Christ. Christ says to a believer, "With My 
    body, yes, with My blood, I endow you." And a believer says to Christ, "With 
    my soul I worship You." O Christian, part with all—for a part in this lovely 
    Savior!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 2. If Christ is thus full of sparkling beauties, 
    then fall in love with this lovely object</p></b></font>. With the spouse; be 
    love-sick for Christ. Beauty draws love. Ministers are friends of the 
    bridegroom. This day I come a wooing for your love. Love Him who is so 
    lovely. Let Christ lie as a bundle of myrrh always between your breasts. "If 
    anyone does not love the Lord, that person is cursed!" (1 Corinthians 
    16:22). "Love," said Chrysostom, "is the diamond that only the queen wears," 
    that is, the gracious soul. Oh, that all these surpassing beauties of Christ 
    might kindle a flame of divine love in our hearts. Christ is the very 
    extract and quintessence of beauty. He is a whole paradise of delight. He is 
    the rose of Sharon, enriched with orient colors and perfumed with the 
    sweetest fragrance. Oh, wear this flower not in your bosom—but in your 
    heart—and be always smelling it.
<p align="justify">Show your love to this lovely Savior by the <i>strength
    </i>and <i>effects </i>of it. Love Him above all other things; let Him carry 
    away the crown and the glory from the creature. Love Him more than your <b>
    relations</b>. Matthew 10:37: "He who loves father or mother more than Me is 
    not worthy of Me." Nay, our love to relations must be <i>hatred </i>in 
    comparison with our love to Christ (Luke 14:26). Great is our love to 
    relations. The creatures void of reason have natural affection; the young 
    stork feeds the aged mother stork—and helps to carry her when she is old and 
    cannot fly. Children should exceed and outfly the stork in affection.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ must be dearer to us than all. He must weigh 
    heavier than relations in the balance of our affections, for He is <i>
    altogether </i>lovely. If parents lie as a stumbling block in our way to 
    Christ, if they either come in competition with Christ or stand in 
    opposition against Christ—<i>we must either leap over them or tread upon 
    them!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Love Christ more than your <b>estate</b>. Gold is but <i>
    shining dust</i>; though it may be lovely—yet it is not <i>altogether </i>
    lovely. Gold is <i>worse </i>than yourself; it is of an earthly extract. If 
    you love anything, love something <i>better </i>than yourself; and that 
    alone is Christ, who is altogether lovely. Riches avail nothing in the day 
    of wrath (Proverbs 11:4). Riches are no lifeguard to defend us from divine 
    fury; but how lovely is Christ who can screen off the fire of God's wrath 
    from us! Oh, then love Him more than these perishable things. Christ's <i>
    gleanings—</i>are better than the world's <i>vintage</i>. Do <i>not </i>be 
    like Noah's raven which, when it had found a carrion to feed on, did not 
    care to return home to the ark. He who loses all for Christ—shall find all 
    in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Love Christ more than your <b>life</b>. Revelation 12:11: 
    "They loved not their lives to the death." They carried their sufferings as 
    signs of their glory. They had pangs of <i>love</i>—stronger than the pangs 
    of <i>death</i>. Did the Curtii die for the Romans, the Codri for the 
    Athenians—and shall not we be willing to lay down our lives for Christ, who 
    is so infinitely lovely?</p>
<p align="justify">Show your love to this lovely Savior by the <b>effects
    </b>of love. The first fruit of love, is desire for <i>COMMUNION</i>. Love 
    is a transporting of the affections; lovers desire to be often talking and 
    conversing together before the marriage day. Christ converses with the soul 
    by His Word and Spirit—and the soul converses with Him by prayer and 
    meditation. The soul that loves Christ, desires to be much in His presence. 
    He loves the ordinances; he thinks it is good lying in the way where Christ 
    passes by. Ordinances are the chariots of salvation. Christ rides into the 
    believer's heart in these chariots. Ordinances are the feast of fat things. 
    The soul feasts with Christ here. Song of Solomon 2:4: "He brought me to the 
    banqueting house." In the Hebrew it is, "He brought me to the house of 
    wine." The Word, prayer and the sacraments are to a Christian, the house of 
    wine. Here, often Christ turns the <i>water of tears </i>into wine! How 
    lovely is this house of wine! The ordinances are the lattice where Christ 
    looks forth and shows His smiling face to His saints. Christ's parents found 
    Him in the temple (Luke 2:46). The soul that loves Christ desires conference 
    with Him in the temple.</p>
<p align="justify">Where there is love to Christ, there is <i>SYMPATHY</i>. 
    Friends who love, grieve and rejoice together; they have sympathizing 
    spirits. Lovers grieve together. Thus, if we love Christ, we shall grieve 
    for those things which grieve Him. Psalm 119:158: "I beheld the 
    transgressors—and was grieved." We shall grieve to see truth bleeding, and 
    heretics increasing. We shall grieve to see heresy setting up its mast and 
    topsail—and multitudes sailing in this ship to hell. It was a charge drawn 
    up against the church of Pergamos "You have some there who hold to the 
    teaching of Balaam" (Revelation 2:14). By toleration of heresy, we adopt 
    other men's sins and make them our own. I pray God, that this does not 
    hasten England's funeral. He who loves Christ, will lay these things to 
    heart.</p>
<p align="justify">He who loves Christ will endeavor to preserve His <i>
    MEMORY</i>. Friends will preserve the memory of those people they love, by 
    keeping their pictures, letters, love-tokens, sometimes by preserving their 
    monuments. Herein Artemisia, Queen of Caria, showed an act of singular love 
    to her husband Mausolus; for he being dead, she caused his body to be 
    reduced to ashes and to be mingled in her drink every day, so making her 
    body a living tomb to hold her dead husband. Thus the soul that loves Christ 
    will be often eating His body and drinking His blood in the sacrament, that 
    he may remember Christ's death until He comes. They who live without 
    sacraments show plainly that they have no love to Christ, because they do 
    not desire to preserve His memory among them.</p>
<p align="justify">He who bears love to Christ, this lovely object, will not 
    entertain any other lovers; "What more have I to do with idols?" (Hosea 
    14:8) The Hebrew word is "with sorrows." Indeed, sin raises a tempest of 
    sorrow in the soul; and he who is espoused to Christ has now changed his 
    judgment. Those sins he before looked upon as <i>lovers—</i>he now looks 
    upon as <i>sorrows</i>. He who loves Christ can look a temptation in the 
    face—and turn his back upon it. When Cyrus would have tempted the chaste 
    wife of Tygranes, she took no notice of him, though he was a king; for she 
    had a husband at home. When sin, like Mercury's rod with a snake about it, 
    would wind itself subtly into the soul, he who loves Christ, dares not give 
    it entertainment. He will say, "All the rooms are taken up already for 
    Christ—and a better guest cannot come; for He is altogether lovely!"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Branch 3. If Christ is so lovely in Himself, then you who 
    profess Christ, labor to render Him lovely in the eyes of others.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Commend Him and tell others of His beauty—so that they 
    may admire Him. So the spouse in this chapter labors to portray and set Him 
    forth in His glory: "My Beloved is white and ruddy—the chief among ten 
    thousand!" Tell others that Christ is all marrow, all sweetness. Christ is 
    the richest jewel in the cabinet of heaven! Set up the trophies of His honor 
    and triumph in His praises so that you may entice others to fall in love 
    with Him! The tongue is the organ of praise; it is a pity the organs are so 
    often out of tune in murmuring and complaining. Oh, let these organs be 
    still going; let our tongues sing forth the praises of Him who is altogether 
    lovely! Daughters of the royal blood have the pictures of kings brought to 
    them—and by seeing the pictures they fall in love with their persons and are 
    married to them; by our commendations of Christ, we should so paint out 
    Christ to others and draw His picture that, when they see His picture, they 
    may fall in love with Him—and the match may be presently struck up.</p>
<p align="justify">Render Christ lovely in the eyes of others by adorning 
    His gospel and walking worthy of Him (Colossians 1:10). It is an honor to a 
    master to have good servants—and how it proclaims Christ to be lovely and 
    glorious—when they who profess Him are eminent for piety! Christ appears 
    lovely in the holy lives of His people.</p>
<p align="justify">Brethren, there are some people among us whose scandalous 
    impieties, masked over with religion, have made Christ appear unlovely in 
    the eyes of others; it is enough to make them afraid to have anything to do 
    with Christ, as if He abetted men in their sin, or at least connived with 
    them. The blood of some will not make reparation for the injury which their 
    sins have done to Christ. I have read of certain images which on the outside 
    were covered with gold and pearl, resembling Jupiter and Neptune—but within 
    nothing but spiders and cobwebs. And have not we many who have been covered 
    with the gold and pearl of profession, resembling the saints of the Most 
    High God—but within, as Christ said, are full of uncleanness (Matthew 
    23:27), insomuch that we may see the spiders creeping out of them! Oh, that 
    all who profess the name of Christ might depart from iniquity (2 Timothy 
    2:19), so that they might set a crown of honor upon the head of Christ—and 
    make Him appear lovely in the eyes of others!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">C. Consolation. </p></b></font>Here is comfort to those who 
    are by faith, married to Christ. This is their glorious privilege: Christ's 
    beauty and loveliness shall be put upon them; they shall shine by His beams. 
    This is the apex and crown of honor: the saints shall not only behold 
    Christ's glory—but be transformed into it. 1 John 3:2, "We shall be like 
    Him, for we will see Him as He really is!" That is, we shall be irradiated 
    and enameled with His glory. Christ is compared to the beautiful lily in 
    Song of Solomon 2:1. His lily-whiteness shall be put upon His saints. A 
    glorified soul shall be a perfect mirror or crystal, where the beauty of 
    Christ shall be transparent. Moses married a black woman—but he could not 
    make her complexion white; but whoever Christ marries, He alters their 
    complexion. He makes them altogether lovely. Other beauty causes <i>pride</i>; 
    but no such <i>worm </i>breeds in heaven. The saints in glory shall admire 
    their own beauty—but not grow proud of it. Other beauty is soon lost. The 
    eye weeps to see its furrowed brows, and the cheeks blush at their own 
    paleness; but this is a never-fading beauty. Age cannot wither it; it 
    retains its glossiness, the white and vermillion mixed together to all 
    eternity! 
<p align="justify">Think of this, O you saints, who mourn now for your sins 
    and bewail your spiritual deformities! Remember, by virtue of your union 
    with Christ, you shall be glorious creatures; then shall your clothing be of 
    wrought gold; then shall you be brought unto the King in glorious 
    raiment—and you shall hear Christ pronounce that blessed word from Song of 
    Solomon 4:7: "You are all beautiful, My love—there is no spot in you!"</p>
