<p align="justify">Question 5: Are there more Gods than one?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: There is but one only, the living and true God.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">That there is a God has been proved; and those who will 
    not believe the unity of his essence, shall feel the severity of his wrath. 
    "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord." He is "the only God." "Know 
    therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the Lord he is God 
    in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath, there is none else." "A just 
    God and a Savior; there is none beside me." There are many <i>ceremonial </i>
    gods. <i>Kings </i>represent God; their regal scepter is an emblem of his 
    power and authority. <i>Judges </i>are called gods. "I have said, You are 
    gods," Psalm 82:6, namely," set in God's place to do justice; but these are 
    dying gods. "But in death you are mere men. You will fall as any prince, for 
    all must die." Verse 7. "There are those who are called gods—but to us there 
    is but one God."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. There is but one First Cause that has its Being of 
    itself, and on which all other beings depend.</p></b></font> As in the heavens, 
    the <i>primum mobile </i>moves all the other orbs; so God gives life and 
    motion to everything that exists. There can be but one God, because there is 
    but one First Cause.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. There is but one infinite Being, therefore there is 
    but one God.</p></b></font> There cannot be two infinites. "Do not I fill heaven 
    and earth, says the Lord?" Jer 23:34. If there is one <i>infinite</i>, 
    filling all places at once—how can there be any room for another infinite to 
    subsist?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. There is but one Omnipotent Power.</p></b></font> If 
    there be two Omnipotents, then we must always suppose a contest between 
    these two: that which one would do, the other power, being equal, would 
    oppose, and so all things would be brought into confusion. If a ship should 
    have two pilots of equal power, one would be ever crossing the other; when 
    one would sail, the other would cast anchor; there would be confusion, and 
    the ship must perish. The order and harmony in the world, or the constant 
    and uniform government of all things—is a clear argument that there is but 
    one Omnipotent, one God who rules all. "I am the first, and I am the last, 
    and beside me there is no God." 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: INFORMATION</p></b></font>. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) If there be but one God, then it excludes all other 
    gods. </p></b></font>Some have imagined that there were two gods; others, that 
    there were many gods; as the Polytheists. The Persians worshiped the sun; 
    the Egyptians the lion and elephant; the Grecians worshiped Jupiter. These 
    "are in error, not knowing the Scriptures." Their faith is a fable. "God has 
    given them up to strong delusions, to believe a lie, that they may be 
    damned."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If there be but one God, then there can be but one 
    true true religion in the world.</p></b></font> "One Lord, one <i>faith</i>." If 
    there were many gods, then there might be many religions, and every God 
    would be worshiped in his way; but if there is but one God, there is but one 
    true religion; one Lord, one faith. Some say, we may be saved in any 
    religion; but it is absurd to imagine that God who is One in essence, should 
    appoint many different religions in which he will be worshiped. It is as 
    dangerous to set up a false religion, as to set up a false God. There are 
    many ways to hell; men may go there whichever way their fancy leads them; 
    but there is only one true road to heaven, namely, faith and holiness. There 
    is no way to be saved, but this. As there is but one God, so there is but 
    one true religion.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) If there be but one God, then there is but One whom 
    you need chiefly to study to please—and that is God. </p></b></font>If there 
    were many gods, we would be hard put to it to please them all. One would 
    command one thing, another the contrary; and to please two contrary masters 
    is impossible; but there is only one God. Therefore you have but One to 
    please. As in a kingdom there is but one king, therefore everyone seeks to 
    ingratiate himself into his favor. Just so, there is but one true God; 
    therefore our main work is to please him. Be sure to please God, whoever 
    else you displease. This was Enoch's wisdom. He had this testimony before he 
    died, that "he pleased God."
<b>
<p align="justify">What does this pleasing God imply?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">(1.) We please God when we comply with his <b>will</b>. 
    It was Christ's food and drink to do his Father's will, John 4:44, and so he 
    pleased him, A voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in 
    whom I am well pleased." "It is the will of God that we should be holy." 
    Now, when we are bespangled with holiness, our lives are walking Bibles. 
    This is according to God's will, and it pleases him.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We please God when we do the <b>work </b>that he 
    sets us about. "I have finished the work which you gave me to do," namely, 
    my mediatorial work. Many finish their lives—but do not finish their work. 
    The work God has cut out for us is, to observe the first and second tables 
    of the law. In the <i>first </i>is set down our duty towards God; in the <i>
    second </i>our duty towards man. Such as make morality the chief and sole 
    part of true religion, set the second table above the first; nay, they take 
    away the first table; for, if prudence, justice, temperance, is enough to 
    save, then what need do we have for the first table? Thus our worship 
    towards God will be quite left out; but those two tables which God has 
    joined together, let no man put asunder.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) We please God when we dedicate our <b>hearts </b>to 
    give him the best of everything. Abel gave God the fat of the offering. Gen 
    4:4. Domitian would not have his image carved in wood, or iron—but in <i>
    gold</i>. We please God when we serve him with love, fervency, and alacrity. 
    These are <i>golden </i>services. There is but one God, therefore there is 
    but One whom we have chiefly to please, namely, God.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) If there is but one God, then we must <b>pray </b>to 
    none but God. The Papists pray to saints and angels. </p>
<p align="justify">(a.) The Papists pray to <b>saints</b>. A Popish writer 
    says, "when we pray to the departed saints, they being touched with 
    compassion, say the same prayer to God for us. The saints above know not our 
    needs; even if they did, we have no warrant to pray to them. "Abraham is 
    ignorant of us." Prayer is a part of divine worship, which must be given to 
    God alone. </p>
<p align="justify">(b.) The Papists pray to <b>angels</b>. Angel-worship is 
    forbidden. Col 2:18, 19. That we may not pray to angels is clear from Rom 
    10:14. "How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?" We may 
    not pray to any, but whom we may believe in; but we may not believe in any 
    angel, therefore we may not pray to him. There is but one God, and it is a 
    sin to invoke any but God.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) If there be but one God, who is "above all," then he 
    must be <b>loved </b>above all. We must love him with a love of <b>
    appreciation</b>. This is to set the highest estimate on him, who is the 
    only fountain of being and bliss. We must love him with a love of <b>delight</b>. 
    "The lover's effort to please the beloved, this is love." Aquinas. Our love 
    to other things must be more indifferent. Some <i>drops </i>of love may run 
    to the creature—but the <i>full </i>stream must run towards God. The 
    creature may have the <i>milk </i>of our love—but we must keep the <i>cream
    </i>for God. He who is above all, must be loved above all. "Whom do I have 
    in heaven but You? And I desire nothing on earth but You. My flesh and my 
    heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart, my portion forever." 
    Psalms 73:25-26.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: CAUTION. </p></b></font>If there be but one God, 
    then let us take heed of setting up more gods than one. "Those who chase 
    after other gods will be filled with sorrow. I will not take part in their 
    sacrifices or even speak the names of their gods." Psalm 16:4. God is a 
    jealous God, and he will not endure that we should have other gods. It is 
    easy to commit <b>idolatry </b>with the creature. 
<p align="justify">(1.) Some make a god of <b>pleasure</b>. "Lovers of 
    pleasures more than lovers of God." Whatever we love more than God we make a 
    God. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Others make <b>money </b>their god. The covetous man 
    worships the image of gold, therefore he is called an idolater. Eph 5:5. 
    That which a man trusts to, he makes his God; but he makes the wedge of gold 
    his hope; he makes money his creator, redeemer, and comforter. Money is his
    <i>creator</i>; if he has money, he thinks he is made. Money is his <i>
    redeemer</i>; if he be in danger, he trusts in his money to redeem him. 
    Money is his <i>comforter</i>; if at any time he is sad, the golden harp 
    drives away the evil spirit. It is clear that money is his God.<i> God made 
    man out of the dust of the earth; and man makes a god out of the dust of the 
    earth. </i></p>

<p align="justify">(3.) Another makes a god of his <b>child</b>, sets his 
    child in God's place, and so provokes God to take it away. If you lean too 
    hard upon glass it will break, so many break their children by leaning too 
    hard upon them. </p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Others make a god of their <b>belly</b>. "Whose god 
    is their belly." Phil 3:19. Clement of Alexandria writes of a fish that has 
    its heart in its belly; this is a fit emblem of epicures—their heart is in 
    their belly; they mind nothing but indulging the sensual appetite; their 
    belly is their God, and to this they pour drink-offerings. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus men make many gods. The apostle names the wicked 
    man's trinity, "The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of 
    life," 1 John 2:16. The lust of the flesh is pleasure; the lust of the eye 
    is money; the pride of life is honor. Oh take heed of this! Whatever you 
    deify beside God, will prove a bramble—and fire will come out of it and 
    devour you! Judg 9:15.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: REPROOF.</p></b></font> If the Lord Jehovah is the 
    only true God, it reproves those who renounce the true God, I mean such as 
    seek to familiar spirits, which is too much practiced among those who call 
    themselves Christians. It is a sin condemned by the law of God. "And do not 
    let your people practice fortune-telling or sorcery, or allow them to 
    interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft, or cast spells, or function as 
    mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead. Anyone who does 
    these things is an object of horror and disgust to the Lord." Deuteronomy 
    18:10-12. How common is this! If people have lost any of their goods, they 
    send to wizards to know how they may obtain them again. What is this but 
    consulting with the devil! What! because you have lost your goods, will you 
    lose your souls too? "Thus says the Lord, Is it not because there is not a 
    God in Israel, that you send to enquire of Beelzebub?" So, is it not because 
    you think there is not a God in heaven, that you ask counsel of the devil? 
    If any here are guilty, be deeply humbled, you have renounced the true God. 
    Better be without the goods you have lost, than have the devil help you to 
    them again!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: EXHORTATION.</p></b></font> 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) If there be but one God, as God is one, so let those 
    who serve him be one.</p></b> This is what Christ prayed so heartily for. "That 
    they all may be one." Christians should be—
<p align="justify">(a.) One in <b>judgment</b>. The apostle exhorts to be 
    all of one mind. "Now, dear brothers and sisters, I appeal to you by the 
    authority of the Lord Jesus Christ to stop arguing among yourselves. Let 
    there be real harmony so there won't be divisions in the church. I plead 
    with you to be of one mind, united in thought and purpose." 1 Corinthians 
    1:10. How sad is it to see true religion wearing a coat of many colors; to 
    see Christians of so many opinions, and going so many different ways! It is 
    Satan who has sown these <i>tares of division</i>. "The enemy who planted 
    the weeds among the wheat is the Devil" Matthew 13:39. He first divided men 
    from God, and then one man from another. </p>
<p align="justify">(b.) One in <b>affection</b>. They should have one heart. 
    "The multitude of those who believed were of one heart, and of one soul." As 
    in music, though there are several strings of a violin—yet all make one 
    sweet harmony; so, though there are several Christians—yet there should be 
    one sweet harmony of affection among them. There is but one God, and those 
    who serve him should be one. There is nothing that would render the true 
    true religion more lovely, or make more proselytes to it, than to see its 
    professors tied together with the <i>heart-strings of love</i>. "Behold how 
    good and how pleasant a thing it is, to see brethren live together in 
    unity!" It is as the sweet dew on Hermon, and the fragrant ointment poured 
    on Aaron's head. If God is one, let all who profess him be of one mind, and 
    one heart—and thus fulfill Christ's prayer, "that they all may be one."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If there be but one God, let us labor to make clear 
    the title that this God is ours.</p></b> "This God is our God." What comfort can 
    it be to hear that there <i>is </i>a God, and that he is the <i>only </i>
    God—unless he is <i>our </i>God? What is Deity—without property in him? Oh 
    let us labor to make clear the title! Beg the Holy Spirit. The Spirit works 
    by faith. By faith we are one with Christ, and through Christ we come to 
    have God for our God, and thus all his glorious fullness is made over to us 
    by a deed of gift.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: GRATITUDE. </p></b></font>What cause have we to be 
    thankful—that we have the knowledge of the only true God! How many are 
    brought up in blindness! Some worship Mahomet. Many of the Indians worship 
    the devil; they light a candle to him, that he may not hurt them. Such as 
    know not the true God—must needs stumble into hell in the dark! Oh let us be 
    thankful that we are born in such a land, where the light of the gospel has 
    shone. To have the knowledge of the true God is more than if we had mines of 
    gold, rocks of diamonds, islands of spices; especially if God has savingly 
    revealed himself to us; if he has given us eyes to see the light; if we so 
    know God as to be known of him, to love him, and believe in him. "Blessed 
    are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear." Matthew 
    13:16. We can never be thankful enough to God—that he has hidden the 
    knowledge of himself from the wise and prudent of the world, and has 
    revealed it unto us! "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, 
    because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed 
    them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure." 
    Matthew 11:25-26.

<p align="center">12. The TRINITY.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify">Question 6. How many Persons are there in the Godhead?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: Three persons—yet but one God.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">"There are three who bear record in heaven, the Father, 
    the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one."</p>
<p align="justify">God is but one—yet are there <i>three distinct persons
    </i>subsisting in one Godhead. This is a sacred mystery, which the light 
    within man could never have discovered. As the two natures in Christ—yet but 
    one person, is a wonder; so there are three persons—yet but one Godhead. 
    Here is a great deep—the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is 
    God—yet not three Gods, but one God. The three persons in the blessed 
    Trinity are <i>distinguished</i>—but not <i>divided</i>; three <i>substances</i>—but 
    one <i>essence</i>. This is a divine riddle where one makes three, and three 
    make one. Our narrow thoughts can no more comprehend the Trinity in Unity, 
    than a nut-shell will hold all the water in the sea. Let me shadow it out by 
    a similitude. </p>
<p align="justify">In the body of the sun, there are—<br/>
    the <i>substance </i>of the sun, <br/>
    the <i>beams</i>,<br/>
    and the <i>heat</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">The beams are begotten by the sun, the heat proceeds both 
    from the sun and the beams; but these three, though different, are not 
    divided; they all three make but one sun. Just so in the blessed Trinity—the 
    Son is begotten of the Father, the Holy Spirit proceeds from both; yet 
    though they are three distinct persons, they are but one God. First, let me 
    speak of the Unity in Trinity; then of the Trinity in Unity.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Of the Unity in Trinity. </p></b></font>The Unity of the 
    persons in the Godhead consists of two things.
<p align="justify">[1] The identity of essence.<b> </b>In the Trinity there 
    is a oneness in essence. The three persons are of the same divine nature and 
    substance; so that there are no degrees in the Godhead; one person is not 
    God more than another.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] The Unity of the persons in the Godhead consists in 
    the mutual inbeing of them, or their being in one together. The three 
    persons are so united that one person is in another, and with another. "You, 
    Father, are in me, and I in you."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Let me speak of the Trinity in Unity.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">[1] The <b>first </b>person in the Trinity is God the <b>
    Father</b>. He is called the first person, in respect of order, not dignity: 
    for God the Father has no essential perfection which the other persons have 
    not; he is not more wise, more holy, more powerful than the other persons 
    are. There is a priority—not a <i>superiority</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] The <b>second </b>person in the Trinity is <b>Jesus 
    Christ</b>, who is begotten of the Father before all time. "I was set up 
    from everlasting, from the beginning, before ever the earth was. When there 
    were no depths I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding 
    with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, was I 
    brought forth." This Scripture declares the eternal generation of the Son of 
    God. This second person in the Trinity, who is Jehovah, has become our 
    Jesus. The Scripture calls him the branch of David, and I may call him the 
    flower of our nature. "By him all that believe are justified."</p>
<p align="justify">[3] The <b>third </b>person in the Trinity is the <b>Holy 
    Spirit</b>, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, whose work is to 
    illuminate the mind, and enkindle sacred motions. The essence of the Spirit 
    is in heaven, and everywhere; but his influence is in the hearts of 
    believers. This is that blessed Spirit who gives us the holy unction. "But 
    you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth." 1 
    John 2:20. Though Christ merits grace for us, it is the Holy Spirit who 
    works it in us. Though Christ makes the purchase, it is the Holy Spirit that 
    makes the assurance, and seals us to the day of redemption.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus I have spoken of all the three persons. The Trinity 
    of persons may be proved, "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of 
    the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God 
    descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, 
    "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." Matthew 3:16-17. 
    Here are three names given to the three persons. He who spoke with a voice 
    from heaven was God the Father; he who was baptized in Jordan was God the 
    Son; he who descended in the likeness of a dove was God the Holy Spirit. 
    Thus I have shown you the Unity of essence, and the Trinity of persons.</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Use one: For confutation. </p>
</font><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">(1.) This confutes the Jews and Turks, who believe only 
    the first person in the Godhead.</p></font></b> Take away the distinction of the 
    persons in the Trinity, and you overthrow man's redemption; for God the 
    Father being offended with man for sin, how shall he be pacified without a 
    mediator? This mediator is Christ, who makes our peace. Christ having died, 
    and shed his blood, how shall this blood be applied, but by the Holy Spirit? 
    Therefore, if there are not three persons in the Godhead, man's salvation 
    cannot be wrought out; if there is no second person in the Trinity, there is 
    no redeemer; if no third person, there is no comforter. Thus the plank is 
    taken away by which we get to heaven.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) It confutes the execrable opinion of the Socinians, 
    who deny the Divinity of the Lord Jesus</p></b></font>, and make him to be a 
    creature only—but of a higher rank. As the Papists blot out the second 
    commandment, so the Socinians blot out the second person in the Trinity. If 
    to oppose Christ's members is a sin, what is it to oppose Christ himself? 
    Jesus Christ is co-equal with God the Father. He thought it no robbery to be 
    equal with God. He is co-eternal with God the Father: "I was from the 
    beginning," if not, there was a time when God was without a Son, and so he 
    would be no Father; nay, there was a time when God was without his glory, 
    for Christ is "the brightness of his Father's glory." Jesus is co-essential 
    with God the Father. The Godhead subsists in Christ. "In whom dwells all the 
    fullness of the Godhead bodily." It is said, not only that Christ was with 
    God before the beginning—but that he was God. John 1:1, and 1 Tim 3:16. "God 
    manifest in the flesh." The title of <i>Lord</i>, so often given to Christ, 
    in the New Testament, answers to the title of <i>Jehovah </i>in the Old. 
    Christ has a co-eternity, and co-substantiality with his Father. "I and my 
    Father are one." It were blasphemy for a mere <i>angel </i>to speak thus. 
    Yet further to prove Christ's Godhead, consider:
<p align="justify">(a.) The glorious incommunicable attributes belonging to 
    God the Father, are ascribed to Christ. Is God the Father omnipotent? So is 
    Jesus Christ. He is the almighty, Rev 1:1, and he creates, Col 1:16. Is God 
    the Father infinitely immense, filling all places? So is Jesus Christ. While 
    Christ was on the earth by his bodily presence, he was at the same time in 
    the bosom of the Father by his divine presence.</p>
<p align="justify">(b.) The same royal prerogatives, which belong to God the 
    Father, belong also to Christ. Does God the Father seal pardons? This is a 
    flower of Christ's crown. "Your sins are forgiven." Nor does Christ remit 
    sin as ministers do, by virtue of a power <i>delegated </i>to them from God; 
    but he does it by his own power and authority. Is God the Father the 
    adequate object of faith? Is he to be believed in? So is his Son. "Trust in 
    God; trust also in me." John 14:1 Does adoration belong to God the Father? 
    So it does to the Son. "Let all the angels of God worship him." How 
    sacrilegious therefore is the Socinian, who would rob Christ of his Godhead, 
    the best flower of his crown. They who deny Christ to be God, must greatly
    <i>twist</i>, or else <i>deny </i>the Scripture to be the Word of God.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It confutes the Arians, who deny the Holy Spirit to 
    be God.</p></b></font> The eternal Godhead subsists in the Holy Spirit. "He 
    shall guide you into all truth." Christ speaks not there of an attribute—but 
    of a person. That the Godhead subsists in the person of the Holy Spirit 
    appears in this; that the Spirit, who gives diversity of gifts, is said to 
    be the same Lord, and the same God. The black and unpardonable sin is said, 
    in a special manner, to be committed against the Godhead subsisting in the 
    Holy Spirit. "And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven 
    men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who 
    speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks 
    against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the 
    age to come." Matthew 12:31-32. 
<p align="justify">The mighty power of God is made manifest by the Holy 
    Spirit; for he changes the hearts of men. The devil would have Christ prove 
    himself to be God, by turning stones into bread; but the Holy Spirit shows 
    his Godhead by turning stones into flesh. "I will take away the stony heart; 
    and give you a heart of flesh." Yet further, the power and Godhead of the 
    Holy Spirit appeared in effecting the glorious conception of our Lord Jesus 
    Christ. "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High 
    will overshadow you. Therefore the holy One to be born will be called the 
    Son of God." Luke 1:35. </p>
<p align="justify">The Holy Spirit works miracles, which transcend the 
    sphere of nature; such as raising the dead. To him belongs divine worship; 
    our souls and bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, in which temples he 
    is to be worshiped. We are baptized in the name of the Holy Spirit; 
    therefore we must believe his Godhead, or renounce our baptism in his name. 
    Methinks it were better for such men not to have so much as heard whether 
    there is any Holy Spirit, than to deny his Deity. They who would wittingly 
    and willingly blot out the third person—shall have their names blotted out 
    of the book of life!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: For exhortation.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">(1.) <b>Believe </b>this doctrine of the Trinity of 
    persons in the unity of essence. The Trinity is solely an object of <i>faith</i>; 
    the plumbline of <i>reason </i>is too short to fathom this mystery. But <i>
    where reason cannot wade—there faith may swim! </i>There are some truths in 
    religion that may be demonstrated by reason; as that there is a God. But the 
    Trinity of persons in the Unity of essence, is wholly supernatural, and must 
    be believed by faith. This sacred doctrine is not <i>against </i>reason—but
    <i>above </i>it. Those illuminated philosophers, who could find out the 
    causes of things, and discourse of the magnitude and influence of the stars, 
    the nature of minerals; could never, by their deepest search, find out the 
    mystery of the Trinity. This is of divine revelation, and must be adored 
    with humble faith. We cannot be good Christians, without the firm belief of 
    the Trinity. How can we pray to God the Father but in the name of Christ, 
    and through the help of the Spirit?</p>
<p align="justify">How are the Quakers to be abhorred, who go under the name 
    of Christians, and yet undervalue and renounce Jesus Christ! I have read of 
    some Quakers who speak thus: "We deny the person of him whom you call 
    Christ, and affirm, That they who expect to be saved by that Christ without 
    works, will be damned in that faith!" Could the devil himself speak worse 
    blasphemy? They would pull up all true religion by the roots, and take away 
    that corner stone, on which the hope of our salvation is built.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If there be one God subsisting in three persons, 
    then let us give equal <b>reverence </b>to all the persons in the Trinity. 
    There is not one who is more or less in the Trinity; the Father is not more 
    God than the Son and Holy Spirit. There is an <i>order </i>in the 
    Godhead—but no <i>degrees</i>; one person has not a majority or 
    supereminence above another; therefore we must give equal <i>worship </i>to 
    all the persons. "That all men should honor the Son even as they honor the 
    Father." <i>Adore </i>Unity in Trinity.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) <b>Obey </b>all the persons in the blessed Trinity; 
    for all of them are God. Obey God the FATHER. Christ himself, as man, obeyed 
    God the Father, much more must we.</p>
<p align="justify">Obey God the SON. "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry." Kiss 
    him with a kiss of obedience. Christ's commands are not grievous. Whatever 
    he commands, is for our interest and benefit. Oh then kiss the Son! Why do 
    the elders throw down their crowns at the feet of Christ, and fall down 
    before the Lamb? To testify their subjection, and to profess their readiness 
    to serve and obey him.</p>
<p align="justify">Obey God the HOLY SPIRIT. Our souls are breathed into us 
    by the glorious Spirit. "The Spirit of God has made me." Our souls are 
    adorned by the blessed Spirit. Every grace is a divine spark lighted in the 
    soul, by the Holy Spirit. Nay, more, the Spirit sanctified Christ's human 
    nature; he united it with the divine, and fitted the man Christ to be our 
    Mediator. Well then does this third person in the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, 
    deserve to be obeyed; for he is God, and this tribute of homage and 
    obedience is due to him from us.</p>

<p align="justify">Answer: The decrees of God are his eternal purpose, 
    according to the counsel of his will, whereby, for his own glory, he has 
    foreordained whatever shall come to pass.</p>
<p align="justify">I have already spoken something concerning the decrees of

    decrees the outcome of all things, and carries them on to their

<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 8: What is the work of CREATION?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer: It is God's making all things from nothing, by 
    the word of his power. "In the beginning God created the heaven and the 
    earth."</p>
<p align="justify">The creation is glorious to <i>behold</i>, and it is a 
    pleasant and profitable <i>study</i>. Some think that when Isaac went abroad 
    into the fields to meditate, it was in the <i>book of creation</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Creation is the heathen's Bible, the ploughman's primer, 
    and the traveler's map, through which they receive a representation of the 
    infinite excellencies which are in God. The creation is a large volume, in 
    which God's works are bound up; and this volume has three great pages in 
    it—heaven, earth, and sea.</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>author </b>of the creation is God, as it is in the 
    text, "God created." The world was created in time, and could not be from 
    eternity. The world must have a maker, and could not make itself. If one 
    should go into a far country, and see stately edifices, he would never 
    imagine that they could build themselves—but that there had been some <i>
    artificer </i>to raise such majestic structures. Just so, this great fabric 
    of the world could not create itself, it must have some builder or maker, 
    and that is God. "In the beginning God created." To imagine that the work of 
    the creation was not framed by the Lord Jehovah, is as if we should conceive 
    a beautiful painting to be drawn without the hand of an artist. "God made 
    the world and all things therein."</p>
<p align="justify">In the work of creation there are two things to be 
    considered: </p>
<p align="justify">1. The making. </p>
<p align="justify">2. The adorning.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The MAKING of the world. </p></b></font>Here consider, 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] God made the world without any pre-existent matter.
    </p></b></font>This is the difference between generation and creation. In 
    generation there is suitable material at hand, some matter to work upon; but 
    in creation there is no pre-existent matter. God brought all this glorious 
    fabric of the world, out of the <i>womb of nothing</i>. Our beginning was of 
    nothing. Some brag of their birth and ancestry; but how little cause have 
    they to boast, who came from nothing.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] God made the world with a word.</p></b></font> When 
    Solomon had to build a temple he needed many workmen, and they all had tools 
    to work with—but God wrought without tools. "By the word of the Lord were 
    the heavens made." Psalm 33:3. The disciples wondered that Christ could <i>
    calm </i>the sea with a word; but it was more to <i>make </i>the sea with a 
    word.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] God made all things at first very good, without any 
    defect or deformity.</p></b></font> The creation came out of God's hands as a 
    pure piece; it was a spotless copy, without any blot, written with God's own 
    fingers. His work was perfect.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The ADORNING of the world.</p></b></font> God made this 
    great lump and mass, with neither shape nor order; and then beautified it. 
    He divided the sea and the earth, he decked the earth with flowers, the 
    trees with fruit. But what is beauty when it is masked over? Therefore, that 
    we might behold this glory, God made the <i>light</i>. The heavens were 
    bespangled with the sun, moon, and stars—so that the world's beauty might be 
    beheld and admired. God, in the creation, began with things less noble and 
    excellent, rocks and vegetables; and then the rational creatures, angels and 
    men. Man is the most exquisite piece in the creation. He is a microcosm, or 
    little world. Man was made with deliberation and counsel. "Let us make man." 
    It is the manner of artificers to be more than ordinarily accurate when they 
    are about their masterpieces. Man was to be the masterpiece of this visible 
    world, therefore God consulted about making so rare a piece. A solemn 
    council of the sacred persons in the Trinity was called. "Let us make man, 
    and let us make him in our own image." On the king's coin, his own image is 
    stamped; so God stamped his image on man, and made him partaker of many 
    divine qualities.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] I shall speak of the parts of man's BODY. </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">(1.) The <b>head</b>, the most excellent architectural 
    part, is the fountain of thought, and the seat of reason. In nature the head 
    is the best piece—but in grace the heart excels.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The <b>eye </b>is the beauty of the face; it shines 
    and sparkles like a lesser sun in the body. The eye occasions much sin, and 
    therefore we may well have tears in it. </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The <b>ear </b>is the conduit-pipe through which 
    knowledge is conveyed. Better lose our seeing than our hearing, for "faith 
    comes by hearing." To have an ear open to God is the best <i>jewel </i>on 
    the ear. </p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The <b>tongue</b>. David calls the tongue his glory, 
    because it is an instrument to set forth the glory of God. The soul at first 
    was a violin in tune to praise God, and the tongue made the music. God has 
    given us two ears—but one tongue, to show that we should be swift to 
    hear—but slow to speak. God has set a double fence before the tongue—the 
    teeth, and the lips—to teach us to be wary that we do not sin with our 
    tongue. </p>
<p align="justify">(5.) The <b>heart </b>is a noble part, and the seat of 
    life.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] I shall speak of the SOUL of man. </p></b></font>This is 
    the <i>man </i>of the man. Man, in regard of his soul, partakes with the 
    angels. The understanding, will, and conscience, are a looking-glass which 
    resembles the Trinity. The soul is the diamond in the ring, it is a vessel 
    of honor; God himself is served in this vessel. It is a spark of celestial 
    brightness, says Damascene. David admired the rare context and workmanship 
    of his body. "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my 
    mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; 
    your works are wonderful, I know that full well. Psalms 139:13-14. If the <i>
    cabinet of the body </i>is so wonderfully made, what is the <i>jewel of the 
    soul? </i>How richly is the soul embroidered! Thus you see how glorious a 
    work the creation is, and man especially, who is the epitome of the world.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">But why did God make the world?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Negatively.</p></b></font> Not for himself; for he did 
    not need it, being infinite. He was happy in reflecting upon his own sublime 
    excellencies and perfections before the world was. 
<p align="justify">God did not make the world to be a mansion for us, since 
    we are not to abide here forever. Heaven is our mansion house. The world is 
    only a passage-room to eternity; the world is to us as the wilderness was to 
    Israel, not to rest in—but to travel through to the glorious Canaan. The 
    world is a dressing-room to dress our souls in, not a place where we are to 
    stay forever. The apostle tells us of the world's funeral. "The elements 
    shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein 
    shall be burnt up." 2 Pet 3:10.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Positively. </p></b></font>God made the world to 
    demonstrate his own glory. The world is a looking glass, in which we may see 
    the power and goodness of God shine forth. "The heavens declare the glory of 
    God." The world is like a wonderful piece of tapestry, in which we may see 
    the skill and wisdom of him who made it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Did God create this world? </p>
</b></font><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) This convinces us of the truth of his Godhead.</p></b> 
    To create is proper to a Deity. Plato was convinced of a Deity when he saw 
    that not all the people in the world could not make a fly. Thus God proves 
    himself to be the true God, and distinguishes himself from idols. "Say this 
    to those who worship other gods: Your so-called gods, who did not make the 
    heavens and earth, will vanish from the earth." Jeremiah 10:11. Who but God 
    can create? The creation is enough to convince the heathen, that there is a 
    God. There are two books out of which God will judge and condemn the 
    heathen, namely, the book of <i>Conscience</i>, "Which shows the work of the 
    law written in their hearts," and the book of the Creation, "From the <i>
    creation </i>of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal 
    power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through 
    what He has made. As a result, people are without excuse." Romans 1:20. The 
    world is full of divine emblems and hieroglyphics. Every star in the sky, 
    every bird that flies in the air, is a witness against the heathen. A 
    creature could not make itself.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is a mighty support of faith, that God creates.
    </p></b>He who made all things with a word, what can he not do? He can create 
    strength in weakness; he can create a supply of our needs. What a foolish 
    question was that, "Can he prepare a table in the wilderness?" Cannot he who 
    made the world do much more? "Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made 
    heaven and earth." Rest on this God who made heaven and earth, for help. As 
    the work of creation is a monument of God's power, so it is a support to 
    faith. Is your heart <i>hard</i>? He can with a word create softness. Is it
    <i>unclean</i>? He can create purity. "Create in me a clean heart, O God." 
    Is the church of God low? He can create Jerusalem a praise. There is no such 
    golden pillar for faith to rest upon, as a creating power.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Did God make this world full of beauty and glory, 
    everything very good? Then, what an evil thing is SIN, which has put out of 
    frame the whole creation!</p></b> Sin has much eclipsed the beauty, soured the 
    sweetness, and marred the harmony of the world. How bitter is that gall, a 
    drop whereof can embitter a whole sea! Sin has brought vanity and vexation 
    into the world, yes, a curse. God cursed the ground because of man's sin. 
    There were several fruits of the curse—
<p align="justify">"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful 
    toil you will eat of it all the days of your life." By painful toil is to be 
    understood all the troubles and cares of this life. </p>
<p align="justify">"By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food." In 
    innocence Adam tilled the ground, for he must not live idly; but it was 
    rather a delight than a labor. That tilling was without toiling. The eating 
    in sorrow, and the sweat of the brow, came in after sin. </p>
<p align="justify">"Thorns and thistles shall the ground bring forth." Did 
    the earth in in a state of innocence bear thorns, though they were 
    afterwards threatened as a punishment? It is likely it did bear thorns; for, 
    when God had done creating, he made no new species or kinds of things; but 
    the meaning is—Now, after sin, the earth should bring forth more plentifully 
    of thorns, and now those thorns should be hurtful, and choke the corn, which 
    hurtful quality was not in them before. Ever since the fall, all the 
    comforts of this life have a thorn and a thistle in them! </p>
<p align="justify">The fourth fruit of the curse was the driving of man out 
    of paradise. "So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden." God at 
    first brought Adam into paradise as into a house ready furnished, or as a 
    king into his palace. "Have dominion over every living thing that moves." 
    God's driving Adam out of paradise signified his dethroning and banishing 
    him, that he might look after a heavenly and a better paradise. </p>
<p align="justify">A fifth fruit of the curse was death. "By the sweat of 
    your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from 
    it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return." Death was 
    not natural to Adam—but came in after sin. As the apostle says. "By sin came 
    death." See then how cursed a thing sin is, which has brought so many curses 
    upon the creation. If we will not hate sin for its <i>deformity</i>, let us 
    hate it for the curse it brings!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Did God make this glorious world? Did he make 
    everything good? Was there in the creature so much beauty and sweetness? Oh! 
    then what sweetness is there in God? </p></b>The cause is always more noble than 
    the effect. Think with yourselves—is there so much excellence in house and 
    lands? Then how much more is there in God, who made them! Is there beauty in 
    a rose? What beauty then is there in Christ, the Rose of Sharon! Does oil 
    make the face shine? How will the light of God's countenance make it shine! 
    Does wine cheer the heart? Oh! what virtue is there in the true vine! How 
    does the blood of this grape cheer the heart! Is the fruit of the garden 
    sweet? How delicious are the fruits of the Spirit! Is a gold mine so 
    precious? How precious is he who founded this mine! What is Christ, in whom 
    are hid all treasures?
<i>
<p align="justify">We should ascend from the creature to the Creator. </p></i>If 
    there is any comfort below, how much more is there in God, who made all 
    these things! How unreasonable is it that we should delight in the world, 
    and not much more in him who made it! How should our hearts be set on God, 
    and how should we long to be with God—who has infinitely more sweetness in 
    him than any creature!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of EXHORTATION.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">(1.) Did God create the world? <b>Let us wisely observe 
    the works of creation. </b>God has given us not only the book of the 
    Scriptures to read in—but the book of the creation. Look up to the heavens, 
    for they show much of God's glory. The <i>sun </i>gilds the world with its 
    bright beams. Behold the <i>stars</i>, their regular motion in their orbs, 
    their magnitude, their light and their influence. We may see God's glory 
    blazing in the sun and twinkling in the stars. Look into the <i>sea</i>, and 
    see the wonders of God in the deep. Psalm 107:74. Look into the air, there 
    the birds make melody, and sing forth the praises of their Creator. Look 
    into the <i>earth</i>, there we may wonder at the nature of minerals, the 
    power of the loadstone, the virtue of herbs. See the earth decked as a bride 
    with flowers. All these are the glorious effects of God's power. God has 
    wrought the creation as with curious needlework, that we may observe his 
    wisdom and goodness, and give him the praise due to him. "O Lord, how 
    manifold are your works! in wisdom have you made them all!"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Did God create all things? <b>Let us obey our Maker.
    </b>We are his by right of creation, we owe ourselves to him. If another 
    gives us our <i>maintenance</i>, we think ourselves bound to serve him; much 
    more should we serve and obey God who gives us our <i>life</i>. "In him we 
    live and move and have our being." God has made everything for man's 
    service; the grain for nourishment, the animals for usefulness, the birds 
    for music, that man should be for God's service. The rivers come from the 
    sea—and they run into the sea again. All we have is from God. Let us honor 
    our Creator, and live to him who made us.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Did God make our bodies out of the dust, and that 
    dust out of nothing? <b>Let this keep down pride. </b>When God would humble 
    Adam he uses this expression, "Out of the <i>dust </i>were you taken." Why 
    are you proud, O dust and ashes? You are made but of dirt. "Since you are 
    humble, why do you not walk humbly?" Bernard. David says, "I praise you 
    because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I 
    know that full well." Your being wonderfully made, may make you <i>thankful</i>; 
    but being made of the dust, may keep you <i>humble</i>. If you have <b>
    beauty</b>, it is but well-colored dirt! Your body is but air and dust 
    mingled together, and this dust will deteriorate back into the dust. When 
    the Lord had said of the judges, they were gods, Psalm 82:6, lest they 
    should grow proud he told them they were dying gods. "But you will die like 
    mere men." Verse 7.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Did God create our souls after his image—but we lost 
    it? <b>Let us never rest until we are restored to God's image again. </b>We 
    have now got the <i>devil's image </i>in pride, malice, and envy. Let us get
    <i>God's image </i>restored, which consists in knowledge and righteousness. 
    Grace is our best beauty, it makes us like God and angels. As the sun is to 
    the world, so is holiness to the soul. Let us go to God to restore his image 
    in us. "Lord! you have once made me, make me anew; sin has defaced your 
    image in me, oh draw it again by the pencil of the Holy Spirit!"</p>

    most holy, wise, and powerful <b>government </b>of his creatures, and of 
    their actions.</p>
<p align="justify">Of the work of God's providence Christ says, "My Father 
    is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working." God has 
    rested from the works of <i>creation</i>, he does not create any new species 
    of things. "He rested from all his works;" and therefore it must needs be 
    meant of his works of <i>providence</i>: "My Father is always at his work to 
    this very day, and I, too, am working." "His kingdom rules over all;" that

    distinguish it from his decrees. God's <i>decree </i>ordains things that 
    shall happens, God's <i>providence </i>orders them.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] I call providence the ordering of things after the 
    counsel of God's will.</p>
<p align="justify">[3] God orders all events of things, after the counsel of 
    his will, to his own glory; his glory being the ultimate end of all his 
    actings, and the center where all the lines of providence meet. The 
    providence of God is "the queen and governess of the world." It is the eye 
    which sees, and the hand which turns all the wheels in the universe. God is 
    not like an artificer who builds a house, and then leaves it—but like a 
    pilot, he steers the ship of the whole creation.</p>

<p align="justify">III. Propositions about God's providence.</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[1] God's providence reaches to all places, persons, and 
    affairs.</p>
</font><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">(1.) God's providence reaches to all PLACES. </p></font></b>
    "Am I a God at hand, and not a God afar off?" The diocese where Providence 
    visits, is very large; it reaches to heaven, earth, and sea. "I can never 
    escape from your Spirit! I can never get away from your presence! If I go up 
    to heaven, you are there; if I go down to the place of the dead, you are 
    there. If I ride the wings of the morning, if I dwell by the farthest 
    oceans, even there your hand will guide me, and your strength will support 
    me." Psalm 139:7-10. Now, that the sea, which is higher than the earth, 
    should not drown the earth, is a wonder of Providence. The prophet Jonah saw 
    the wonders of God in the deep, when the very fish which devoured him and 
    swallowed him brought him safe to shore. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) God's providence reaches to all PERSONS</p></b></font>, 
    especially the persons of the godly, who in a special manner are taken 
    notice of. God takes care of every saint in particular, as if he had none 
    else to care for. "He cares for you," that is, God cares for the elect in a 
    special manner. "The But the Lord watches over those who fear him, those who 
    rely on his unfailing love. He rescues them from death and keeps them alive 
    in times of famine." Psalm 33:18-19. God by his providential care shields 
    off dangers from his people, and sets a life-guard of angels about them. 
    "The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers 
    them." Psalm 34:7. God's providence keeps the very bones of the saints. "The 
    righteous face many troubles, but the Lord rescues them from each and every 
    one. For the Lord protects them from harm— not one of their bones will be 
    broken! Psalms 34:19-20. It bottles their tears. "You keep track of all my 
    sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded 
    each one in your book." Psalm 56:8. It strengthens the saints in their 
    weakness. Heb 11:34. It supplies all their needs out of its alms basket. 
    "You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies." Psalm 23:5. Thus 
    Providence wonderfully supplies the needs of the elect. 
<p align="justify">When the Protestants in Rochelle were besieged by the 
    French king, God by his providence sent a great number of small fish to feed 
    them, such as were never seen before in that haven. So the raven, that 
    unnatural creature (that will hardly feed its own young), providentially 
    brought sustenance to the prophet Elijah. The Virgin Mary, through bearing 
    and bringing forth the Messiah, helped to make the world rich—yet she 
    herself was very poor; and now, being warned of the angel to go into Egypt, 
    she had scarce enough to bear her expenses there; but see how God provides 
    for her beforehand. By his providence he sends wise men from the east, who 
    bring costly gifts, gold, myrrh, and frankincense, and present them to 
    Christ; and now she has enough to defray her expenses into Egypt. God's 
    children sometimes scarce know how they are fed, except that providence 
    feeds them. "Truly you shall be fed." Psalm 37:3. If God will give his 
    people a <i>kingdom </i>when they die, he will not deny them <i>daily bread</i> 
    while they live.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) God's providence reaches to all AFFAIRS and 
    occurrences in the world.</p></b></font> There is nothing that stirs in the 
    world but God has, by his providence, the over-ruling of it. Is it the 
    raising of a man to honor? "But it is God who judges: He brings one down, he 
    exalts another." Psalm 75:7. Success and victory in battle is the result of 
    providence. <i>Saul </i>had the victory—but God wrought the salvation. That 
    among all virgins brought before the king, <i>Esther </i>should find favor 
    in the eyes of the king, was not without God's special providence; for, by 
    this means, the Lord saved the Jews alive, who were destined to destruction.
    
<p align="justify">Providence reaches to the least of things, to birds and 
    ants. Providence feeds the young raven, when the mother bird forsakes it, 
    and will give it no food. "He provides food for the cattle and for the young 
    ravens when they call." Psalms 147:9. Providence reaches to the very hairs 
    of our head. "The hairs of your head are all numbered." Matt 10:30. Surely 
    if providence reaches to our hairs, much more to our souls. Thus you have 
    seen that God's providence reaches to all places, to all persons, to all 
    occurrences and affairs. Now there are two objections against this doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">Some say, <b>There are many things done in the world 
    which are very <i>disorderly </i>and <i>irregular</i>; and surely God's 
    providence is not in these things.</b></p>

<p align="justify">Yes, the things that seem to us <i>irregular</i>, God 
    makes use of to his own glory. Suppose you were in a smith's shop, and 
    should see there several sorts of tools, some crooked, some bowed, others 
    hooked, would you condemn all these things, because they do not look 
    handsome? The smith makes use of them all for doing his work. Thus it is 
    with the providences of God; they seem to us to be very crooked and 
    strange—yet they all carry on God's work. I shall make this clear to you in 
    two particular cases.</p>
<p align="justify">God's people are sometimes in a low condition. It seems 
    to be out of order, that those who are best, should be in the lowest 
    condition; but there is much wisdom in this providence, as appears thus: </p>
<p align="justify">1. Perhaps the hearts of the godly were lifted up with 
    riches, or with success; now God comes with a humbling providence to afflict 
    them and fleece them. Better is the loss that makes them humble, than the 
    success that makes them proud. Again, </p>
<p align="justify">2. If the godly were not sometimes afflicted, and given 
    an eclipse in their outward comforts, how could their graces be seen, 
    especially their faith and patience? If it were always <i>sunshine </i>we 
    would see no stars; so if we should have always <i>prosperity</i>, it would 
    be hard to see the acting of men's faith. Thus you see God's providences are 
    wise and regular, though to us they seem very strange and crooked.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is another case. The wicked flourish. This seems to 
    be very much out of order; but God, in his providence, sometimes sees it 
    good, that the worst of men should be exalted; that they may do some work 
    for God, though it be against their will. "But this is not what he intends, 
    this is not what he has in mind; his purpose is to destroy, to put an end to 
    many nations." Isaiah 10:7. <i>God will be in no man's debt. </i>He makes 
    use of the wicked sometimes to protect and shield his church; and sometimes 
    to refine and purify it. "O Lord, you have appointed them to execute 
    judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish." Hab 1:12. As if the 
    prophet had said, "You have ordained the wicked to correct your children." 
    Indeed, as Augustine says well, "We are indebted to wicked men, who against 
    their wills do us good," As the corn is indebted to the flail to thresh off 
    its husks, or as the iron is indebted to the file to brighten it; just so, 
    the godly are indebted to the wicked, though it be against their will, to 
    brighten and refine their graces. Now, then, if the wicked do God's own 
    work, though against their will, he will not let them be losers by it; he 
    will raise them in the world, and give them a full cup of earthly comforts. 
    Thus you see those <i>providences are wise and regular, which to us seem 
    strange and crooked.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But, some may say, "if God has a hand in ordering all 
    things that fall out, he has a hand in the sins of men."</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">I answer, No, by no means, he has no hand in any man's 
    sin. God cannot go contrary to his own nature, he cannot do any unholy 
    action, any more than the sun can be said to be darkened. Here you must take 
    heed of two things:</p>
<p align="justify">you must take heed of making God ignorant of men's sins;</p>
<p align="justify">you must take heed of making God to have a hand in men's 
    sins. </p>
<p align="justify">Is it likely that God is both the <i>author </i>of sin, 
    and the <i>avenger </i>of sin? Is it a likely thing that God should make a 
    law against sin, and then have a hand in breaking his own law? God in his 
    providence <i>permits </i>men's sins. "He allowed all nations to walk in 
    their own ways." Acts 14:16. God permitted their sin, which he never would, 
    if he could not bring good out of it. Had not sin been permitted—God's <i>
    justice </i>in punishing sin, and his mercy in pardoning sin, had not been 
    so well manifested. The Lord is pleased to permit sin—but he has no hand in 
    sin.</p>
<p align="justify">But is it not said that God hardened Pharaoh's heart? 
    Here is more than barely permitting sin.</p>
<p align="justify">God does not infuse evil into men, he withdraws the 
    influence of his graces, and then the heart hardens of itself; even as the 
    light being withdrawn, darkness presently follows in the air? But it would 
    be absurd to say, that therefore the light darkens the air; and therefore 
    you will observe, that Pharaoh is said to harden his own heart. Exod 8:85. 
    God is the cause of no man's sin. It is true God has a hand in the <i>action
    </i>where sin is—but no hand in the <i>sin </i>of the action. A man may play 
    upon a jarring instrument—but the jarring is from itself. Just so here—the 
    actions of men, so far as they are <i>natural</i>, are from God; but so far 
    as they are <i>sinful</i>, they are from the men themselves, and God has no 
    hand at all in them. So much for the first position, that God's providence 
    reaches to all places, to all persons, and to all occurrences.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] A second proposition is, that providences, which are 
    casual and accidental to us, are pre-determined by the Lord.</p></b></font> The 
    falling of a tile upon one's head, the breaking out of a fire, is casual to 
    us—but it is ordered by a providence of God. You have a clear instance of 
    this in I Kings 22:34. "An Aramean soldier, however, <i>randomly </i>shot an 
    arrow at the Israelite troops, and the arrow hit the king of Israel between 
    the joints of his armor." This accident was casual as to the man who drew 
    the bow; but it was divinely ordered by the providence of God. God's 
    providence directed the arrow to hit the mark. Things that seem to happen 
    casually, and by chance, are the outcome of God's decrees, and the 
    interpretation of his will.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] God's providence is greatly to be observed—but we are 
    not to make it the rule of our actions. </p></b></font>"Whoever is wise will 
    observe these things." It is good to observe providence—but we must not make 
    it our rule to walk by. <b>Providence is a Christian's diary—but not his 
    Bible. </b>Sometimes a bad cause prevails and gets ground; but it is not to 
    be liked because it prevails. We must not think the better of what is 
    sinful, because it is successful. Providence no rule for our actions to be 
    directed by.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Divine providence is irresistible. </p></b></font>There 
    is no standing in the way of God's providence, to hinder it. When God's time 
    was come for Joseph's release, the prison could hold him no longer. "The 
    king sent and loosed him." When God would indulge the Jews with liberty in 
    their religion, Cyrus, by a providence, puts forth a proclamation to 
    encourage the Jews to go and build their temple at Jerusalem, and worship 
    God. If God will shield and protect Jeremiah's person in captivity, the very 
    king of Babylon shall nurse up the prophet, and give charge concerning him, 
    that he lack nothing. Jer 39:11, 12.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] God is to be trusted when his providences seem to run 
    contrary to his promises.</p></b></font> God promised to give David the crown, 
    to make him king; but providence ran contrary to his promise. David was 
    pursued by Saul, and was in danger of his life—but all this while it was 
    David's duty to trust God. Pray observe, that the Lord by cross providences, 
    often brings to pass his promise. God promised Paul the lives of all who 
    were with him in the ship; but the providence of God seemed to run quite 
    contrary to his promise, for the winds blew, the ship split and broke in 
    pieces. Thus God fulfilled his promise—upon the broken pieces of the ship 
    they all came safe to shore. Trust God when <i>providences </i>seem to run 
    quite contrary to <i>promises</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] The providences of God are chequer-work, they are 
    intermingled.</p></b></font> In the life to come, there shall be no more 
    mixture; in hell there will be nothing but bitter; in heaven nothing but 
    sweet. But in this life the providences of God are <i>mixed</i>, there is 
    something of the sweet in them, and something of the bitter. Providences are 
    just like Israel's pillar of cloud, which conducted them in their march, 
    which was dark on one side and light on the other. In the ark were laid up 
    the <i>rod </i>and <i>manna</i>, so are God's providences to his children; 
    there is something of the <i>rod </i>and something of the <i>manna</i>; so 
    that we may say with David, "I will sing of <i>mercy </i>and <i>judgement</i>." 
    When Joseph was in prison, there was the <i>dark </i>side of the cloud; but 
    God was with Joseph, there was the <i>light </i>side of the cloud. Asher's 
    shoes were of brass—but his feet were dipped in oil. So affliction is the 
    shoe of <i>brass </i>which pinches; but there is mercy mingled with the 
    affliction, for there is the foot dipped in oil.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] The same action, as it comes from God's providence, 
    may be good; and as it comes from men, may be evil.</p></b></font> For instance, 
    Joseph being sold into Egypt by his brethren was evil, very wicked, for it 
    was the fruit of their envy. But as it was an act of God's providence it was 
    good; for by this means Jacob and all his family were preserved alive in 
    Egypt. Another instance is in Shimei's cursing David. Shimei cursed David, 
    it was wicked and sinful, for it was the fruit of his malice. But as his 
    cursing was ordered by God's providence, it was an act of God's justice to 
    punish David, and to humble him for his adultery and murder. As the 
    crucifying of Christ came from the Jews, it was an act of hatred and malice 
    to Christ; and Judas's betraying him was an act of covetousness. But as each 
    was an act of God's providence, so there was good in it; for it was an act 
    of God's love in giving Christ to die for the world. Thus I have made clear 
    to you, the doctrine of God's providence in these several positions. Let me 
    now speak something by way of application.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: By way of exhortation in these particulars. </p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) ADMIRE God's providence. </p></b></font>The providence 
    of God keeps the whole creation upon the wheels, or else it would soon be 
    dissolved, and the very axle of the world would break in pieces. If God's 
    providence should be withdrawn but for a moment, creatures would be 
    dissolved, and run into their first nothing. Without this wise providence of 
    God, there would be anxiety and confusion in the whole world, just like an 
    army when it is routed and scattered. The providence of God infuses comfort 
    and virtue into everything we enjoy. Our clothes would not warm us, our food 
    would not nourish us, without the special providence of God. And does not 
    all this deserve your admiration of providence?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Learn quietly to SUBMIT to divine providence. </p></b>
</font>Do not murmur at things that are ordered by divine wisdom. We may no 
    more find fault with the works of providence than we may with the works of 
    creation. It is a sin as much to quarrel with God's providence, as to deny 
    his providence. If other people do not act as <i>we </i>would have them act, 
    they shall act as <i>God </i>would have them act. His providence is his 
    master-wheel, which turns these lesser wheels, and God will bring his glory 
    out of all at last. "I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are 
    the one who has done this." Psalm 39:9. It may be, we think sometimes we 
    could order things better, if <i>we </i>had the government of the world in 
    our hands; but alas! should we be left to our own choice, we should choose 
    those things that are hurtful for us! David earnestly desired the life of 
    his child, which was the fruit of his sin—but had the child lived it would 
    have been a perpetual monument of his shame. Let us be content that God 
    should rule the world; learn to acquiesce in his will, and submit to his 
    providence. Does any affliction befall you? Remember God sees it is that 
    which is fit for you, or it would not come. Your clothes cannot be so fit 
    for you as your crosses. God's providence may sometimes be secret—but it is 
    always wise; and though we may not be silent under God's dishonor—yet we 
    should learn to be silent under his displeasure.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) You who are Christians, believe that all God's 
    providence shall conspire for your good at last. </p></b></font>The providences 
    of God are sometimes dark, and our eyes dim, and we can hardly tell what to 
    make of them; but when we cannot unriddle providence, let us believe that it 
    will work together for the good of the elect. Rom 8:28. The wheels in a 
    clock seem to move contrary one to the other—but they help forward the 
    motion of the clock. Just so, the providences of God seem to be cross 
    wheels; but for all that, they shall carry on the good of the elect. The 
    pricking of a vein is in itself evil and hurtful; but as it prevents a 
    fever, and tends to the health of the patient, it is good. Just so, 
    affliction in itself is not joyous—but grievous; but the Lord turns it to 
    the good of his saints. <i>Poverty </i>shall starve their sins, and <i>
    afflictions </i>shall prepare them for a kingdom. Therefore, Christians, 
    believe that God loves you, and that he will make the most cross providences 
    to promote his glory and your good.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Let it be an antidote against immoderate FEAR, that 
    nothing comes to pass but what is ordained by God's decree, and ordered by 
    his providence.</p></b></font> We sometimes fear what the outcome of things will 
    be, when men grow high in their actings; but let us not make things worse by 
    our fear. Men are limited in their power, and cannot go one hair's breadth 
    further than God's providence permits. He might let Sennacherib's army march 
    towards Jerusalem—but they shall not shoot one arrow against it. "Then the 
    angel of the Lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five 
    thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next 
    morning--there were all the dead bodies!" Isa 37:36. When Israel was 
    encompassed between Pharaoh and the Red Sea, no question, some of their 
    hearts began to tremble, and they looked upon themselves as dead men; but 
    Providence so ordered it—that the sea was a <i>safe passage </i>to Israel, 
    and a <i>sepulcher </i>to Pharaoh and all his host.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Let the merciful providence of God cause 
    THANKFULNESS. </p></b></font>We are kept alive by a wonderful-working 
    Providence. Providence makes our clothes to warm us, and our food to nourish 
    us. We are fed every day out of the alms-basket of God's providence. That we 
    are in health, that we have an estate, is not by our diligence—but God's 
    providence. "But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the 
    ability to produce wealth." Deut 8:18. Especially if we go a step <i>higher</i>, 
    we may see cause for thankfulness, that we were born and bred in a gospel 
    land, and that we live in such a place where the Sun of Righteousness 
    shines, which is a signal providence. Why might we not have been born in 
    such places where Paganism prevails? That Christ should make himself known 
    to <i>us</i>, and touch <i>our </i>hearts with his Spirit, when he passes by 
    others; whence is this but from the miraculous providence of God, which is 
    the effect of his free grace?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Comfort in respect of the church of God. </p></b>
</font>God's providence reaches in a more special manner to his church. 
    "Sing about a fruitful vineyard: I the Lord, watch over it; I water it 
    continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it." Isa 
    27:2-3. God waters this vineyard with his blessings, and watches over it by 
    his providence. Such as think totally to ruin the church, must do it in a 
    time when it is neither day nor night, for the Lord keeps it by his 
    providence night and day. What a miraculous conduct of Providence had 
    Israel! God led them by a pillar of fire, gave them manna from heaven, and 
    water from the rock. 
<p align="justify">God by his providence preserves his church in the midst 
    of enemies; as a spark is kept alive in the ocean, or a flock of sheep are 
    kept alive in the midst of wolves. God saves his church strangely. </p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) By giving unexpected mercies to his church, when she 
    anticipated nothing but ruin.</p></b></font> "When the Lord restored his exiles 
    to Jerusalem, it was like a dream! We were filled with laughter, and we sang 
    for joy. And the other nations said, 'What amazing things the Lord has done 
    for them.' Yes, the Lord has done amazing things for us!" Psalm 126:1-3. How 
    strangely did God raise up Queen Esther to preserve alive the Jews, when 
    Haman had got a bloody warrant signed for their execution! 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Strangely, by saving in that very way in which we 
    think he will destroy.</p></b></font> God works sometimes by contraries. He 
    raises his church by bringing it low. The blood of the martyrs has watered 
    the church, and made it more fruitful. Exod 1:12. "The more they afflicted 
    them—the more they multiplied." The church is like that plant which Gregory 
    Nazianzen speaks of—it grows by <i>cutting</i>. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Strangely, in that he makes the enemy to do his 
    work.</p></b></font> When the people of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir came 
    against Judah, God set the enemy one against another. "The Lord caused the 
    armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir to start fighting among themselves. 
    The armies of Moab and Ammon turned against their allies from Mount Seir and 
    killed every one of them. After they had finished off the army of Seir, they 
    turned on each other. So when the army of Judah arrived at the lookout point 
    in the wilderness, there were dead bodies lying on the ground for as far as 
    they could see. Not a single one of the enemy had escaped." 2 Chronicles 
    20:22-24. God made the traitors to be their own betrayers. God can do his 
    work by the enemy's hand. God made the Egyptians send away the people of 
    Israel laden with jewels. The church is the pupil of God's eye, and the <i>
    eyelid of his providence </i>daily covers and defends it.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: See here, that which may make us long for the 
    time when the great <i>mystery </i>of God's providence shall be fully 
    unfolded to us.</p></b></font> Now we scarcely know what to make of God's 
    providence, and are ready to censure what we do not understand; but in 
    heaven we shall see how all his providences (sickness, losses, sufferings) 
    contributed to our salvation. Here we see but some dark pieces of God's 
    providence, and it is impossible to judge of his works by <i>pieces</i>; but 
    when we come to heaven, and see the full body and portrait of his providence 
    drawn out into its living colors—it will be glorious to behold. Then we 
    shall see how all God's <i>providences </i>helped to fulfill his <i>promises</i>. 
    There is no providence, but we shall see a wonder or a <i>mercy </i>in it!
