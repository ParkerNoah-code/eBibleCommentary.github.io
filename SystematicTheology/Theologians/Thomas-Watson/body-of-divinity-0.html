    1. A Preliminary Discourse on Catechizing</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"If you continue in the faith <i>grounded</i> and <i>
    settled</i>." Col. 1:13.</p>
<p align="justify">Intending next Lord's day to enter upon the work of 
    catechizing, it will not be amiss to give you a preliminary discourse, to 
    show you how needful it is for Christians to be well instructed in the 
    grounds of true religion. "If you continue in the faith grounded and 
    settled."</p>
<p align="justify">I. It is the duty of Christians to be settled in the 
    doctrine of faith.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The best way for Christians to be settled is to be 
    well grounded.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. It is the duty of Christians to be settled in the 
    doctrine of faith.</p></b></font> It is the apostle's prayer, "May the God of 
    all grace establish, strengthen, settle you." That is, that they might not 
    be meteors in the air—but fixed stars. The apostle Jude speaks of "wandering 
    stars". They are called wandering stars, because, as Aristotle says, "They 
    do leap up and down, and wander into several parts of the heaven; and being 
    but dry exhalations, not made of that pure celestial matter as the fixed 
    stars are, they often fall to the earth." Now, such as are not settled in 
    true religion, will, at one time or other, prove wandering stars; they will 
    lose their former steadfastness, and wander from one opinion to another. 
    Such as are unsettled are of the tribe of Reuben, "unstable as water," like 
    a ship without ballast, overturned with every wind of doctrine. Beza writes 
    of one Belfectius, who his religion changed as often as the moon. The Arians 
    had every year a new faith. These are not <i>pillars </i>in the temple of 
    God—but <i>reeds </i>shaken every way. The apostle calls them "damnable 
    heresies." <b>A man may go to hell as well for heresy as adultery! 
</b>
<p align="justify">To be unsettled in true religion, argues <i><b>lack of 
    judgment</b></i>. If their heads were not giddy, men would not reel so fast 
    from one opinion to another. </p>
<p align="justify">To be unsettled in true religion, argues <i><b>lightness</b></i>. 
    As feathers will be blown every way, so will feathery Christians. Therefore 
    such are compared to <i>infants</i>. "Then we will no longer be infants, 
    tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind 
    of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful 
    scheming." Ephesians 4:14. Children are fickle sometimes of one mind 
    sometimes of another, nothing pleases them long. Just so, unsettled 
    Christians are childish; the truths they embrace at one time, they reject at 
    another; sometimes they like the Protestant religion, and soon after they 
    have a good mind to turn Papists.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] It is the great end of the word preached, to bring us 
    to a settlement in true religion.</p></b></font> "And he gave some, evangelists; 
    and some, pastors and teachers; for the edifying of the body of Christ; that 
    we henceforth be no more children." The word is called "a hammer". Every 
    blow of the hammer is to fasten the nails of the building; so the preacher's 
    words are to fasten you the more to Christ; they weaken themselves to 
    strengthen and settle you. This is the grand design of preaching, not only 
    for the enlightening—but for the establishing of souls; not only to guide 
    them in the right way—but to keep them in it. Now, if you be not settled, 
    you do not answer God's end in giving you the ministry.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] To be settled in true religion is both a Christian's 
    excellence and honor. </p></b></font>It is his <b>excellence</b>. When the milk 
    is settled it turns to cream; now he will be zealous for the truth, and walk 
    in close communion with God. And his <b>honor</b>. "The hoary head is a 
    crown of glory, if it is found in the way of righteousness." It is one of 
    the best sights to see an old disciple; to see silver hairs adorned with 
    golden virtues.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Such as are not settled in the faith can never suffer 
    for it. </p></b></font>Sceptics in religion hardly ever prove martyrs. Those who 
    are not settled, hang in suspense; when they think of the joys of heaven 
    they will espouse the gospel—but when they think of persecution, they desert 
    it. Unsettled Christians do not consult what is <i>best</i>—but what is <i>
    safest</i>. "The apostate (says Tertullian) seems to put God and Satan in 
    balance, and having weighed both their services, prefers the devil's 
    service, and proclaims him to be the best master: and, in this sense, may be 
    said to put Christ to open shame." He will never suffer for the truth—but be 
    as a soldier that leaves his colors, and runs over to the enemy's side; he 
    will fight on the devil's side for pay.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Not to be settled in the faith is provoking to God.
    </p></b></font>To espouse the truth, and then to fall away, brings an ill report 
    upon the gospel, which will not go unpunished. "They turned back and were as 
    faithless as their parents had been. They were as useless as a crooked bow. 
    They made God angry by building altars to other gods; they made him jealous 
    with their idols." Psalm 78:57-58. The apostate drops as a wind-fall into 
    the devil's mouth!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] If you are not settled in true religion, you will 
    never grow.</p></b></font> We are commanded "to grow up into the head, even 
    Christ." But if we are unsettled there is no growing: "the plant which is 
    continually replanted, never thrives." He can no more grow in godliness, who 
    is unsettled, than a bone which is out of joint can grow in a body.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] There is great need to be settled, because there are 
    so many things to unsettle us.</p></b></font> Seducers are abroad, whose work is 
    to draw away people from the principles of true religion. "These things have 
    I written unto you, concerning those who are trying seduce you." Seducers 
    are the devil's agents. They are of all others, the greatest felons—who 
    would rob you of the truth. 
<p align="justify">Seducers have silver tongues, which can pawn off bad 
    wares; they have a sleight to deceive. "That we henceforth be no more 
    children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, 
    by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to 
    deceive." Ephesians 4:14. The Greek word there is taken from those who can 
    throw dice, and cast them for the best advantage. So seducers are impostors, 
    they can throw a dice; they can so dissemble and sophisticate the truth, 
    that they can deceive others. Seducers deceive by wisdom of words. "By good 
    words and fair speeches they deceive the hearts of the simple." They have 
    fine elegant phrases, flattering language, whereby they work on the weaker 
    sort. </p>
<p align="justify">Another sleight is a <i>pretense </i>of extraordinary 
    piety, so that people may admire them, and suck in their poisonous doctrine. 
    They seem to be men of zeal and sanctity, and to be divinely inspired, and 
    pretend to new revelations. </p>
<p align="justify">A third cheat of seducers is—laboring to vilify and 
    nullify sound orthodox teachers. They would eclipse those who bring the 
    truth, like black vapors which darken the light of heaven; they would defame 
    others, that they themselves may be more admired. Thus the false teachers 
    cried down Paul, that they might be received, Gal 4:17. </p>
<p align="justify">The fourth cheat of seducers is—to preach the doctrine of 
    liberty; as though men are freed from the moral law, the rule as well as the 
    curse, and Christ has done all for them, and they need to do nothing. Thus 
    they make the doctrine of free grace a key to open the door to all license 
    to sin. </p>
<p align="justify">Another means is—to unsettle Christians by persecution. 2 
    Tim 3:12. The gospel is a rose which cannot be plucked without prickles. The 
    legacy Christ has bequeathed, is the CROSS. While there is a devil and a 
    wicked man in the world, never expect a charter of exemption from trouble! 
    How many fall away in an hour of persecution! "There appeared a great red 
    dragon, having seven heads and ten horns; and his tail drew the third part 
    of the stars of heaven." The red dragon, by his power and subtlety, drew 
    away stars, or eminent professors, who seemed to shine as stars in the skies 
    of the church.</p>
<p align="justify">To be unsettled in good, is the sin of the devils. They 
    are called, "falling stars;" they were holy—but mutable. As the vessel is 
    overturned with the sail, so their sails being swelled with pride, they were 
    overturned. 1 Tim 3:3. By unsettledness, men imitate lapsed angels. The 
    devil was the first apostate. The sons of Zion should be like mount Zion, 
    which cannot be removed.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The second proposition is, that the way for 
    Christians to be settled—is to be well grounded.</p></b></font> "If you continue 
    grounded and settled." The Greek word for grounded is a metaphor which 
    alludes to a building that has the foundation well laid. So Christians 
    should be grounded in the essential points of true religion, and have their 
    foundation well laid.
<p align="justify">Here let me speak to two things:</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] That we should be grounded in the knowledge of 
    fundamentals.</p></b></font> The apostle speaks of "the first principles of the 
    oracles of God." In all arts and sciences, logic, physics, mathematics, 
    there are some rules and principles which must necessarily be known for the 
    practice of those arts; so, in divinity, there must be the first principles 
    laid down. <i>The knowledge of the grounds and principles of true religion 
    is exceedingly useful.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Else we cannot serve God aright.</p></b> We can never 
    worship God acceptably, unless we worship him regularly; and how can we do 
    that, if we are ignorant of the rules and elements of true religion? We are 
    to give God a "reasonable service." If we understand not the grounds of true 
    religion, how can it be a reasonable service?
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Knowledge of the grounds of true religion much 
    enriches the mind.</p></b> It is a lamp to our feet; it directs us in the whole 
    course of Christianity, as the eye directs the body. Knowledge of 
    fundamentals, is the golden key which opens the chief mysteries of true 
    religion; it gives us a whole system and body of divinity, exactly drawn in 
    all its lineaments and lively colors; it helps us to understand many of 
    those difficult things which occur in the reading of the word; it helps to 
    untie many Scripture knots.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It furnishes us with unshakable armor; and weapons 
    to fight against the adversaries of the truth.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) It is the holy seed of which grace is formed.</p></b> It 
    is the seed of <i>faith</i>. Psalm 9:10. It is the root of <i>love</i>. 
    "Being rooted and grounded in love." The knowledge of the fundamental 
    principles conduces to the making of a complete Christian.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] This grounding is the best way to being settled</p></b></font>: 
    "<i>grounded </i>and <i>settled</i>." A tree, that it may be well settled, 
    must be well rooted; so, if you would be well settled in true religion, you 
    must be rooted in its principles. We read in Plutarch of one who set up a 
    dead man, and he would not stand. "Oh," said he, "there must be something 
    within." So, that we may stand in shaking times, there must be a principle 
    of knowledge within; first grounded, and then settled. That the ship may be 
    kept from overturning, it must have its anchor fastened. Knowledge of 
    principles is to the soul—as the anchor to the ship, which holds it steady 
    in the midst of the rolling waves of error, or the violent winds of 
    persecution. First grounded and then settled.
<b>
<p align="justify">Use one:</p></b> See the reason why so many people are 
    unsettled, ready to embrace every novel opinion, and dress themselves in as 
    many religions as fashions; it is because they are ungrounded. See how the 
    apostle joins these two together, "unlearned and unstable." Such as are <i>
    unlearned </i>in the main points of divinity, are <i>unstable</i>. As the 
    body cannot be strong which has the sinews shrunk; so neither can that 
    Christian be strong in true religion, who lacks the grounds of knowledge, 
    which are the sinews to strengthen and establish him.
<b>
<p align="justify">Use two:</p></b> See what great necessity there is of laying 
    down the main grounds of true religion in a way of <i>catechizing</i>, that 
    the weakest judgement may be instructed in the knowledge of the truth, and 
    strengthened in the love of it. Catechizing is the best expedient for the 
    grounding and settling of people. I fear one reason why there has been no 
    more good done by preaching, has been because the chief heads and articles 
    in true religion have not been explained in a catechetical way. Catechizing 
    is laying the foundation. To preach and not to catechize, is to build 
    without foundation. This way of catechizing is not novel, it is apostolic. 
    The primitive church had their forms of catechism, as those phrases imply, a 
    "form of sound doctrine," and "the first principles of the oracles of God." 
    God has given great success to catechizing. By thus laying down the grounds 
    of true religion catechistically, Christians have been clearly instructed 
    and wondrously built up in the Christian faith. 
<p align="justify">It is my design, therefore (with the blessing of God); to 
    begin this work of catechizing the next Sabbath day; and I intend every 
    other Sabbath, in the afternoon, to make it my whole work to lay down the 
    grounds and fundamentals of true religion in a catechetical way. If I am 
    hindered in this work by men, or taken away by death, I hope God will raise 
    up some other laborer in the vineyard among you, who may perfect the work 
    which I am now beginning.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><font color="#ff0000">
<p align="center">2. Man's Chief End</p>
</font>
<p align="justify">Question 1. What is the chief end of man?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy 
    him forever.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here are two ends of life specified: </p>
<p align="justify">1. The <b>glorifying </b>of God. </p>
<p align="justify">2. The <b>enjoying </b>of God.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The GLORIFYING of God.</p></b></font> "That God in all 
    things may be glorified." The glory of God is a silver thread which must run 
    through all our actions. "Whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever 
    you do, do all to the glory of God." Everything works to some end and 
    purpose; now, man being a rational creature, must propose some end to 
    himself, and that should be—that he may lift up God in the world. He had 
    better lose his life than the end of his living. The great truth is 
    asserted—is that the end and purpose of every man's living should be to 
    glorify God. Glorifying God has respect to all the persons in the Trinity; 
    it respects God the Father who gave us life; God the Son, who lost his life 
    for us; and God the Holy Spirit, who produces a new life in us. We must 
    bring glory to the whole Trinity.
<p align="justify">When we speak of God's glory, the question will be asked,
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>What are we to understand by God's glory?</b></font> 
    There is a twofold glory: </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The glory that God has in himself, his INTRINSIC 
    glory.</p></b></font> Glory is essential to the Godhead, as light is to the sun: 
    he is called the "God of Glory." Glory is the sparkling of the Deity; it is 
    so natural to the Godhead, that God cannot be God without it. The creature's 
    honor is not essential to his being. A king is a man without his regal 
    ornaments, when his crown and royal robes are taken away; but God's glory is 
    such an essential part of his being—that he cannot be God without it. God's 
    very life lies in his glory. This glory can receive no addition, because it 
    is infinite; it is that which God is most tender of, and which he will not 
    part with. "My glory I will not give to another." God will give <i>temporal
    </i>blessings to his children, such as wisdom, riches, honor; he will give 
    them <i>spiritual </i>blessings, he will give them grace, he will give them 
    his love, he will give them heaven; but his <i>essential glory </i>he will 
    not give to another! King Pharaoh parted with a ring off his finger to 
    Joseph, and a gold chain—but he would not part with his <i>throne!</i> "Only 
    in the throne will I be greater than you." So God will do much for his 
    people; he will give them the inheritance; he will put some of Christ's 
    glory, as mediator, upon them; but his essential glory he will not part 
    with; "in the throne he will be greater." 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The glory which is ascribed to God, or which his 
    creatures labor to bring to him.</p></b></font> "Give unto the Lord the glory 
    due unto his name." "Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit." The 
    glory we give God is nothing else but our lifting up his name in the world, 
    and magnifying him in the eyes of others. "Christ shall be magnified in my 
    body."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">WHAT is it to glorify God?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Glorifying God consists in four things: </p>
<p align="justify">1. Appreciation. </p>
<p align="justify">2. Adoration. </p>
<p align="justify">3. Affection. </p>
<p align="justify">4. Subjection. </p>
<p align="justify">This is the yearly rent we pay to the crown of heaven.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Glorifying God consists in APPRECIATION. </p></b></font>
    To glorify God is to set God highest in our thoughts, and to have a 
    venerable esteem of him. "You, Lord, are most high for evermore!" "You are 
    exalted far above all gods!" There is in God—all that may draw forth both 
    wonder and delight; there is a constellation of all beauties; he is the 
    original and springhead of being, who sheds a glory upon the creature. We 
    glorify God, when we are God-admirers! Admire his attributes, which are the 
    glistening beams by which the divine nature shines forth! Admire his 
    promises which are the charter of free grace, and the spiritual cabinet 
    where the pearl of price is hid! Admire the noble effects of his power and 
    wisdom in making the world, which is called "the work of his fingers." To 
    glorify God is to have God-admiring thoughts; to esteem him most excellent, 
    and search for diamonds in this rock alone!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Glorifying God consists in ADORATION, or worship.</p></b></font> 
    "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the 
    beauty of holiness." There is a twofold worship: 
<p align="justify">(1.) A <b>civil </b>reverence which we give to people of 
    honor. "Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the children of Heth." <i>
    Piety </i>is no enemy to <i>courtesy</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A <b>divine </b>worship which we give to God as his 
    royal prerogative. "They bowed their heads, and worshiped the Lord with 
    their faces towards the ground." This divine worship God is very jealous of; 
    it is the apple of his eye, the pearl of his crown; which he guards, as he 
    did the tree of life, with cherubim and a flaming sword, that no man may 
    come near it to violate it. Divine worship must be such as God himself has 
    appointed, else it is offering <i>strange fire</i>. The Lord would have 
    Moses make the tabernacle, "according to the pattern in the mount." He must 
    not <i>leave out</i> anything in the pattern, nor <i>add </i>to it. If God 
    was so exact and specific about the <i>place </i>of worship, how exact will 
    he be about the <i>matter </i>of his worship! Surely here everything must be 
    according to the pattern prescribed in his word.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Glorifying God consists in AFFECTION. </p></b></font>This 
    is part of the glory we give to God, who counts himself glorified when he is 
    loved. Deut 6:6. "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and 
    with all your soul." There is a twofold love: 
<p align="justify">(1.) A love of concupiscence, which is self-love; as when 
    we love another, because he does us a good turn. A wicked man may be said to 
    love God, because he has given him a good harvest, or filled his cup with 
    wine. This is rather to love God's <i>blessing, </i>than to love <i>God</i>
<i>himself</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A love of delight, as a man takes delight in a 
    friend. This is to love God indeed; the heart is set upon God—as a man's 
    heart is set upon his treasure. This love is <b>exuberant</b>, not a few <i>
    drops</i>—but a <i>stream!</i> This love is <b>superlative</b>; we give God 
    the best of our love, the cream of it. "I would cause you to drink of spiced 
    wine of the juice of my pomegranate." If the spouse had a cup more juicy and 
    spiced, Christ must drink of it. It is <b>intense </b>and <b>ardent</b>. 
    True saints are seraphim, burning in holy love to God. The spouse was in 
    fainting fits, 'sick with love." Thus to love God is to glorify him. He who 
    is the chief of our happiness, has the chief of our affections!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Glorifying God consists in SUBJECTION. </p></b></font>
    This is when we dedicate ourselves to God, and stand ready dressed for his 
    service. Thus the <b>angels </b>in heaven glorify him; they wait on his 
    throne, and are ready to take a commission from him; therefore they are 
    represented by the cherubim with <i>wings displayed</i>, to show how swift 
    they are in their obedience. <b>We </b>glorify God when we are devoted to 
    his service. Our <i>head </i>studies for him, our <i>tongue </i>pleads for 
    him, and our <i>hands </i>relieve his needy members. The wise men who came 
    to Christ did not only bow the knee to him—but presented him with gold and 
    myrrh. So we must not only bow the knee, give God worship—but bring presents 
    of <i>golden obedience</i>. We glorify God when we stick at no service, when 
    we fight under the banner of his gospel against an enemy, and say to him as 
    David to King Saul, "Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine!"
<p align="justify">A good Christian is like the sun, which not only sends 
    forth heat—but goes its circuit round the world. Thus, he who glorifies God, 
    has not only his affections heated with love to God—but he goes his circuit 
    too; he moves vigorously in the sphere of obedience.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">WHY must we glorify God?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Because he gives us our being.</p></b></font> "It is he 
    who has made us." We think it a great kindness in a man to <i>spare </i>our 
    life—but what kindness is it in God to <i>give </i>us our life! We draw our 
    breath from him; and as life, so <i>all the comforts of life are from him.
    </i>He gives us <i>health</i>, which is the sauce to sweeten our life<i>.
    </i>He gives us <i>food</i>, which is the oil that nourishes the lamp of 
    life. If all we receive is from his bounty, is it not reasonable we should 
    glorify him? Should we not live <i>to </i>him, seeing we live <i>by </i>him? 
    "For of him, and through him, are all things." All we have, is of his 
    fullness, all we have is through his free grace; and therefore to him should 
    be all. It follows, therefore, "To him be glory forever!" God is not our 
    only <i>benefactor</i>—but our <i>founder</i>, just as rivers which come 
    from the sea empty their silver streams into the sea again.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] Because God has made all things for his own glory.</p></b></font> 
    "The Lord has made all things for himself:" that is, "for his glory." As a 
    king has tax out of commodities, so God will have glory out of everything. 
    He will have glory out of the <b>wicked</b>. If they will not give him 
    glory, he will get glory upon them. "I will gain glory through Pharaoh." But 
    especially has he made the <b>godly </b>for his glory; they are the lively 
    organs of his praise. "This people have I formed for myself, and they shall 
    show forth my praise." It is true, they cannot <i>add </i>to his glory—but 
    they may <i>exalt </i>it; they cannot raise him in <i>heaven</i>—but they 
    may raise him in the esteem of others here on <i>earth</i>. God has adopted 
    the saints into his family, and made them a royal priesthood, that they 
    should show forth the praise of him who has called them. I Pet 2:2.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Because the glory of God has intrinsic value and 
    excellence</p></b></font>; it transcends the thoughts of <i>men</i>, and the 
    tongues of <i>angels</i>. His glory is his treasure, all his riches lie 
    here; as Micah said. "What have I more?" So, what has God more? God's glory 
    is more worth than heaven, and more worth than the salvation of all men's 
    souls. It would be better that kingdoms be thrown down, better men and 
    angels be annihilated, than God should lose one jewel of his crown, one beam 
    of his glory!

<p align="justify">(1.) Creatures BELOW us glorify God</p></b></font>, the 
    inanimate creatures and the heavens glorify God. "The heavens declare the

    Maker; the sky is beautified and pencilled out in blue and azure colors, 
    where the power and wisdom of God may be clearly seen. "The heavens declare 
    his glory:, we may see the glory of God blazing in the sun, and twinkling in 
    the stars. Look into the air, the birds with their chirping music, sing 
    hymns of praise to God. Every animal in its kind glorifies God. Isa 43:30. 
    "The beast of the field shall honor me." 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Creatures ABOVE us glorify God.</p></b></font> "The 
    angels are ministering spirits." They are still waiting on God's throne, and 
    bring some revenues of glory into the treasury of heaven. Surely man should 
    be much more studious of God's glory than the angels; for God has honored 
    him more than the angels, in that Christ took man's nature upon him, and not 
    the angels. Though, in regard of <i>creation</i>, God made man "a little 
    lower than the angels," yet in regard of <i>redemption</i>, God has set him 
    higher than the angels. He has married mankind to himself; the angels are 
    Christ's <i>friends</i>, not his <i>spouse</i>. He has covered us with the 
    purple robe of righteousness, which is a better righteousness than the 
    angels have. If then the angels bring glory to God, much more should we, 
    being dignified with honor above angelic spirits.

</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] It is glorifying God when we AIM purely at his glory.
    </p></b></font>It is one thing to <i>advance </i>God's glory, another thing to
    <i>aim </i>at it. <b>God must be the ultimate end of all actions. </b>Thus 
    Christ says, "I seek not my own glory—but the glory of him who sent me." A
    <i>hypocrite </i>has a squint eye, for he looks more to his own glory than 
    God's. Our Savior deciphers such, and gives a caveat against them in Matthew 
    6:2, "When you give alms, do not sound a trumpet." A stranger would ask, 
    "What means the noise of this trumpet?" It was answered, "They are going to 
    give to the poor." And so they did not <i>give </i>alms—but <i>sell </i>them 
    for honor and applause, that they might have glory of men. The <i>breath of 
    men </i>was the wind which blew the sails of their charity! "Truly they have 
    their reward." The hypocrite may take his bill and write, "received in full 
    payment." Chrysostom calls vain-glory one of the devil's great nets to catch 
    men. And Cyprian says, "Whom Satan cannot prevail against by intemperance, 
    those he prevails against by pride and vainglory." Oh let us take heed of 
    self-worshiping! Aim purely at God's glory. We do this,
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) When we prefer God's glory above all other things</p></b></font>; 
    above credit, estate, relations; when the glory of God comes in competition 
    with them—we must prefer his glory before them.<b> If relations lie in our 
    way to heaven, we must either leap over them, or tread upon them. </b>
    "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; 
    anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me!" 
    Matthew 10:37. A child must unchild himself, and forget he is a child; he 
    must know neither father nor mother in God's cause. "Who said unto his 
    father and mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his 
    brethren." This is to aim at God's glory.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) We aim at God's glory, when we are content that 
    God's will should take place, though it may cross ours.</p></b></font> "Lord, I 
    am content to be a loser—if you be a gainer. I am content to have less 
    health—if I have more grace, and you more glory. Let it be food or bitter 
    medicine—if only you give it me. Lord, I desire that which may be most for 
    your glory!" Our blessed Savior said, "Not as I will—but as you will." Matt 
    26:69. If God might have more glory by his sufferings, he was content to 
    suffer. "Father, glorify your name."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) We aim at God's glory when we are content to be 
    outshined by others in gifts and esteem—so that his glory may be increased.</p></b></font> 
    A man who has God in his heart, and God's glory in his eye, desires that God 
    should be exalted; and if this be effected, let whoever will be the 
    instrument, he rejoices. "Some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry. 
    But others preach about Christ with pure motives. Those others do not have 
    pure motives as they preach about Christ. They preach with selfish ambition, 
    not sincerely. But whether or not their motives are pure, the fact remains 
    that the message about Christ is being preached, so I rejoice." They 
    preached Christ out of envy, they envied Paul that throng of people, and 
    they preached that they might outshine him in gifts, and get away some of 
    his hearers. "Well," says Paul, "So long as Christ is preached, and God is 
    likely to have the glory, I will rejoice. Let <i>my </i>candle go out, if 
    the Sun of Righteousness may but shine!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] We glorify God by a sincere CONFESSION of sin. </p></b>
</font>The thief on the cross had dishonored God in his life—but at his 
    death he brought glory to God by confession of sin. Luke 23:3I. "We indeed 
    suffer justly." He acknowledged he deserved not only <i>crucifixion</i>—but
    <i>damnation</i>. "My son, give, I beg you, give glory to God, and make 
    confession unto him." A humble confession exalts God. How is God's free 
    grace magnified, in <i>crowning </i>those who deserve to be <i>condemned!
    </i>The excusing and mincing of sin casts a reproach upon God. Adam denied 
    not that he tasted the forbidden fruit—but, instead of a full confession, he 
    blamed God. Gen 3:32. "The woman whom <i>you </i>gave me, she gave me of the 
    tree, and I ate." "If <i>you </i>had not given me the woman to be a 
    tempter—I would not have sinned." Confession glorifies God, because it 
    clears him; it acknowledges that he is holy and righteous, whatever he does. 
    Nehemiah vindicates God's righteousness; chap 9:93. "You are just in all 
    that is brought upon us." A confession is sincere, when it is free, not 
    forced. Luke 15:58. "I have sinned against heaven and before you." The 
    prodigal charged himself with sin, before his father charged him with it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] We glorify God by BELIEVING.</p></b></font> "Abraham was 
    strong in <i>faith</i>, giving <i>glory </i>to God." Unbelief affronts God, 
    it gives him the lie; "he who believes not, makes God a liar." But faith 
    brings glory to God; it sets its seal, that God is true. He who believes 
    flies to God's mercy and truth, as to an altar of refuge; he engarrisons 
    himself in the promises, and trusts all he has with God. "Into your hands I 
    commit my spirit." This is a great way of bringing glory to God. God honors 
    faith—because faith honors him. It is a great honor we do to a man when we 
    trust him with all we have; when we put our lives and estates into his 
    hand—it is a sign we have a good opinion of him. The three Hebrew children 
    glorified God by believing. "The God whom we serve is able to deliver us, 
    and will deliver us." Faith knows there are no impossibilities with God, and 
    will trust his loving heart, where it cannot trace his mysterious 
    providential hand.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] We glorify God, by being tender of his glory. </p></b>
</font>God's glory is as dear to him as the pupil of his eye. An sincere 
    child weeps to see a disgrace done to his father. Psalm 69:9. "The 
    reproaches of those who reproached you are fallen upon me." When we hear God 
    reproached, it is as if we were reproached; when God's glory suffers, it is 
    as if we suffered. This is to be tender of God's glory.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] We glorify God by FRUITFULNESS.</p></b></font> "Hereby is 
    my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit." As it is dishonoring God to 
    be barren, so fruitfulness honors him. "Filled with the fruits of 
    righteousness, which are to the praise of his glory." We must not be like 
    the fig tree in the gospel, which had nothing but leaves—but like the 
    pomecitron, which is continually either ripening or blossoming, and is never 
    without fruit. It is not <i>mere profession</i>—but <i>fruit</i> which 
    glorifies God. God expects to have his glory from us in this way. "Who 
    plants a vineyard, and does not eat the fruit of it?" Trees in the <i>forest
    </i>may be barren—but trees in the <i>garden </i>are fruitful. We must bring 
    forth the fruits of love and good works. "Let your light so shine before 
    men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in 
    heaven." <i>Faith </i>sanctifies our works, and <i>works </i>testify our 
    faith. To be doing good to others, to be eyes to the blind, feet to the 
    lame—much glorifies God. Thus Christ glorified his Father; "he went about 
    doing good." Acts 10:08. By being fruitful, we are <i>beautiful </i>in God's 
    eyes. "The Lord called you a thriving olive tree, <i>beautiful </i>to see 
    and full of good fruit." And we must bear <i>much </i>fruit. It is <i>
    muchness</i> of fruit which glorifies God: "if you bear much fruit." The 
    spouse's breasts are compared to clusters of grapes, to show how fertile she 
    was. Though the lowest degree of grace may bring salvation to you, yet it 
    will not bring much glory to God. It was not a <i>spark </i>of love, which 
    Christ commended in Mary—but <i>much </i>love; "she loved much."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] We glorify God, by being CONTENTED in that state in 
    which Providence has placed us.</p></b></font> We give God the glory of his 
    wisdom, when we rest satisfied with whatever portion he carves out to us. 
    Thus Paul glorified God. The Lord cast him into as great variety of 
    conditions as any man, "I have worked harder, been put in jail more often, 
    been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again. Five 
    different times the Jews gave me thirty-nine lashes. Three times I was 
    beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I 
    spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. I have traveled many weary 
    miles. I have faced danger from flooded rivers and from robbers. I have 
    faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I 
    have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the stormy seas. And 
    I have faced danger from men who claim to be Christians but are not." 2 
    Corinthians 11:23-26. Yet he had learned to be content. Paul could sail 
    either in a <i>storm </i>or a <i>calm</i>; he could be anything that God 
    would have him; he could either <i>lack </i>or <i>abound</i>.
<p align="justify">A good Christian argues thus: "It is God who has put me 
    in this condition; he could have raised me higher, if he pleased—but that 
    might have been a snare to me. He has done it in wisdom and love; therefore 
    I will sit down satisfied with my condition." Surely this glorifies God 
    much; God counts himself much honored by such a Christian. "Here," says God, 
    "is one after my own heart; let me do whatever I will with him—I hear no 
    murmuring—he is content!" This shows abundance of grace. When grace is <i>
    crowning</i>, it is not so much to be content; but when grace is <i>
    conflicting </i>with inconveniences, then to be content is a glorious thing 
    indeed. For one to be content when he is in heaven is no wonder; but to be 
    content under severe trials, greatly glorifies God. This man must needs 
    bring glory to God; for he shows to all the world, that though he has little 
    meal in his barrel, yet he has enough in God to make him content! He says, 
    as David, "The Lord is the portion of my inheritance; the lines have fallen 
    to me in pleasant places."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] We glorify God by working out our own salvation.</p></b></font> 
    God has twisted together, his glory and our good. We glorify him by 
    promoting our own salvation. It is a glory to God to have multitudes of 
    converts; his design of free grace takes effect, and God has the glory of 
    his mercy; so that, while we are endeavoring our salvation, we are honoring 
    God. What an encouragement is this to the service of God, to think, "while I 
    am hearing and praying, I am glorifying God; while I am furthering my own 
    glory in heaven, I am increasing God's glory!" Would it not be an 
    encouragement to a subject, to hear his prince say to him, "You will honor 
    and please me very much, if you will go to yonder mime of gold, and dig as 
    much gold for yourself as you can carry away"? So, for God to say, "Go to 
    the ordinances, get as much grace as you can, dig out as much salvation as 
    you can; and the more happiness you have, the more I shall count myself 
    glorified!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[8] We glorify God by living for God.</p></b></font> "Those 
    who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for 
    them." "Whether we live, we live unto the Lord." The Mammonist lives for his 
    money. The Epicure lives for his belly. The design of a sinner's life is to 
    gratify lust—but we glorify God when we live for God. We live to God when we 
    live to his service, and lay ourselves out wholly for God. The Lord has sent 
    us into the world, as a merchant sends his ambassador beyond the seas to 
    trade for him. We live to God when we trade for his interest, and propagate 
    his gospel. God has given every man a talent; and when a man does not hide 
    it in a napkin—but improves it for God, he lives to God. When a <i>master
    </i>in a family, by counsel and good example, labors to bring his servants 
    to Christ; when a <i>minister </i>spends himself, and is spent, that he may 
    win souls to Christ, and make the crown flourish upon Christ's head; when 
    the <i>magistrate </i>does not wear the sword in vain—but labors to cut down 
    sin, and to suppress vice; this is to live to God, and this is glorifying 
    God. "That Christ might be magnified, whether by life or by death." Paul had 
    three wishes, and they were all about Christ; that he might be found <i>in
    </i>Christ, be <i>with </i>Christ, and <i>magnify </i>Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[9] We glorify God by walking cheerfully.</p></b></font> It 
    brings glory to God, when the world sees a Christian has that within him, 
    which can make him cheerful in the worst times; which can enable him, with 
    the nightingale, to sing with a <i>thorn </i>at his bosom. The people of God 
    have ground for cheerfulness. They are justified and adopted, and this 
    creates inward peace; it makes music within, whatever storms are without. If 
    we consider what Christ has wrought for us by his blood, and wrought in us 
    by his Spirit, it is a ground of great cheerfulness, and this cheerfulness 
    glorifies God. It reflects poorly upon a master when the servant is always 
    drooping and sad; surely—he is kept to hard commons, his master does not 
    give him what is fitting. Just so, when God's people hang their heads, it 
    looks as if they did not serve a good master, or repented of their choice, 
    which reflects dishonor on God. The uncheerful lives of the godly bring a 
    scandal on the gospel. "Serve the Lord with gladness." Your serving him does 
    not glorify him, unless it is with gladness. A Christian's cheerful looks 
    glorify God. True religion does not take away our joy—but refines it; it 
    does not break our violin—but tunes it, and makes the music sweeter.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[10] We glorify God, by standing up for his truths.</p></b></font> 
    Much of God's glory lies in his truth. God has entrusted us with his truth, 
    as a master entrusts his servant with his purse to keep. We have not a 
    richer jewel to trust God with—than our souls; nor has God a richer jewel to 
    trust us with—than his truth. Truth is a beam which shines from God. Much of 
    his glory lies in his truth. When we are advocates for truth we glorify God. 
    "That you should <i>contend </i>earnestly for the truth." The Greek word to
    <i>contend </i>signifies great contending, as one would contend for his 
    land, and not allow his right to be taken from him; so we should contend for 
    the truth. Were there more of this <i>holy contention</i>, God would have 
    more glory. Some contend earnestly for trifles and ceremonies—but not for 
    the truth. We should count him indiscreet that would contend more for a 
    picture—than for his inheritance; more for a box of pennies—than for his box 
    of title deeds.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[11] We glorify God, by praising him. </p></b></font>
    Doxology, or praise, is a God-exalting work. "Whoever offers praise, 
    glorifies me." The Hebrew word Bara, to create; and Barak, to praise; are 
    little different, because the end of creation is to praise God. David was 
    called the sweet singer of Israel, and his praising God was called 
    glorifying God. "I will praise you, O Lord my God, and I will glorify your 
    name." Though nothing can add to God's essential glory, yet praise exalts 
    him in the eyes of others. When we praise God, we spread his fame and 
    renown, we display the trophies of his excellency. In this manner the angels 
    glorify him; they are the choristers of heaven, and trumpet forth his 
    praise. Praising God is one of the highest and purest acts of true religion. 
    In prayer we act like men; but in praise we act like angels! Believers are 
    called "temples of God." When our tongues praise, then the organs in God's 
    spiritual temple are sounding. How sad is it that God has no more glory from 
    us in this way! Many are full of murmuring and discontent—but seldom bring 
    glory to God, by giving him the praise due to his name. We read of the 
    saints having harps in their hands, the emblems of praise. Many have tears 
    in their eyes, and complaints in their mouth—but few have harps in their 
    hand, blessing and glorifying God. Let us honor God this way. Praise is the 
    rent we pay to God; while God renews our lease, we must renew our rent.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[12] We glorify God, by being zealous for his name.</p></b></font> 
    "Phinehas has turned my wrath away, while he was zealous for my sake." Zeal 
    is a mixed affection, a compound of love and anger; it carries forth our <i>
    love to God</i>, and our <i>anger against sin </i>in an intense degree. Zeal 
    is impatient of God's dishonor; a Christian fired with zeal, takes a 
    dishonor done to God, worse than an injury done to himself! "You cannot bear 
    those who are evil." Our Savior Christ thus glorified his Father; he, being 
    baptized with a spirit of zeal, drove the money-changers out of the temple. 
    "Zeal for your house has consumed me."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[13] We glorify God, when we have an eye to God in our 
    natural and in our civil actions.</p></b></font> In our natural actions; in <i>
    eating </i>and <i>drinking</i>. "Whether therefore you eat or drink—do all 
    to the glory of God." A gracious person holds the golden bridle of 
    temperance; he takes his food as a medicine to heal the decays of nature, 
    that he may be the fitter, by the strength he receives, for the service of 
    God; he makes his food, not fuel for lust—but help to duty. 
<p align="justify">In <i>buying </i>and <i>selling</i>, we do all to the 
    glory of God. The wicked live upon unjust gain, by falsifying the balances, 
    "The balances of deceit are in his hands;" and thus while men make their 
    weights lighter, they make their sins heavier, when by exacting more than 
    the commodity is worth. We buy and sell to the glory of God, when we observe 
    that golden maxim, "To do to others as we would have them do to us;" so that 
    when we sell our commodities, we do not sell our consciences also. "Herein 
    do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence towards 
    God, and towards men." We glorify God, when we have an eye to God in all our 
    civil and natural actions, and do nothing that may reflect any blemish on 
    true religion.</p>

    By seeking to convert others, and so make them instruments of glorifying

    grace, and magnets for attractive virtue in drawing others to Christ. Gal 
    4:19. "My little children, of whom I travail," It is a great way of 
    glorifying God, when we break open the devil's prison, and turn men from the 
    power of Satan to God.

    where you do not want to go. Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death 
    by which Peter would glorify God." God's glory shines in the ashes of his 
    martyrs. "Glorify the Lord in the fires." Micaiah was in the prison, Isaiah 
    was sawn asunder, Paul was beheaded, Luke was hanged on an olive tree; thus 
    did they, by their death, glorify God. The sufferings of the primitive 
    saints did honor to God, and made the gospel famous in the world. <i>What 
    would others say? </i>See what a good master they serve, and how they love 
    him, that they will venture the loss of all, in his service. The glory of 
    Christ's kingdom does not stand in worldly pomp and grandeur, as other 
    kings"; but it is seen in the cheerful sufferings of his people. The saints 
    of old "loved not their lives to the death." They embraced <i>torments </i>
    as so many <i>crowns</i>. God grant we may thus glorify him—if he calls us 
    to it. Many pray, "Let this cup of suffering pass away!" Few pray, "May your 
    will be done!"

    glory to himself. "Immediately, because Herod did not give glory to God, an 
    angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died." We 
    glorify God, when we sacrifice the praise and glory of all we do—to God. "I 
    have worked harder than all the other apostles," is a speech, one would 
    think, which savored of pride. But the apostle pulls the crown from his own 
    head, and sets it upon the head of free grace! "Yet it was not I but God who 
    was working through me by his grace." As Joab, when he fought against 
    Rabbah, sent for King David, that David might carry away the crown of the 
    victory; so a Christian, when he has gotten power over any corruption or 
    temptation, sends for Christ, that he may carry away the crown of the 
    victory. As the silkworm, when she weaves her curious work, hides herself 
    under the silk, and is not seen; so when we have done anything praiseworthy, 
    we must hide ourselves under the veil of humility, and transfer the glory of 
    all we have done to God. As one used to write the name of Christ over his 
    door—so should we write the name of Christ over our duties. Let <i>him </i>
    wear the garland of praise!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[17] We glorify God by a holy life. </p></b></font>A bad life 
    dishonors God. "You are a holy nation, that you should show forth the 
    praises of him who has called you." The name of God is blasphemed among the 
    Gentiles through you." Epiphanius says, "That the looseness of some 
    Christians in his time made many of the heathens shun their company, and 
    would not be drawn to hear their sermons." By our exact Bible-lives, we 
    glorify God. Though the main work of true religion lies in the heart, yet 
    our light must so shine that others may behold it. The safety of a building 
    is the foundation—but the glory of it is in the frontispiece. Just so, the 
    beauty of faith is in the godly life. When the saints, who are called 
    jewels, cast a sparkling luster of holiness in the eyes of the world, then 
    they "walk as Christ walked." When they live as if they had seen the Lord 
    with bodily eyes, and been with him upon the mount—they adorn true religion, 
    and bring revenues of glory to the crown of heaven!

<p align="justify">Use one: </p></b></font>Admonition.
<p align="justify">This subject shows us that our chief end should not be to 
    get great estates, nor to lay up treasures upon earth; which is the 
    degeneracy of mankind since the fall. Sometimes they never arrive at an 
    estate, they do not get the venison they hunt for; or if they do, what have 
    they? that which will not fill the heart any more than the mariner's breath 
    will fill the sails of the ship. They spend their time, as Israel, in 
    gathering straw—but remember not, that the end of living is to glorify God. 
    "What profit has he who labors for the wind?" These things are soon gone.</p>

<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It reproves such as bring no glory to God</p></b>; who 
    do not answer the end of their creation; whose time is not time <i>lived</i>—but 
    time <i>lost</i>; who are like the wood of the vine, Ezek 15:5; whose lives 
    are, as Bernard speaks "either sinfulness or barrenness. A useless burden on 
    the earth." God will one day ask such a question as King Ahasuerus did, Esth 
    6:6. "What honor and dignity has been done to Mordecai?" What honor has been 
    done to me? what revenues of glory have you brought into my treasury? There 
    is no one here present, but God has put in some capacity of glorifying him; 
    the health he has given you, the abilities, estate, seasons of grace—all are 
    opportunities put into your hand to glorify him; and, be assured, he will 
    call you to account, to know what you have done with the mercies he has 
    entrusted you with—what glory you have brought to him. The parable of the 
    talents, where the men with the five talents and the two talents are brought 
    to a reckoning, evidently shows that God will call you to a strict account, 
    to know how you have traded with your talents, and what glory you have 
    brought to him. Now, how sad will it be with them who hide their talents in 
    a napkin—who bring God no glory at all! "Cast you the unprofitable servant 
    into outer darkness." It is not enough for you to say, that you have not 
    dishonored God, you have not lived in gross sin. What good have you done? 
    what glory have you brought to God? It is not enough for the servant of the 
    vineyard that he does no damage in the vineyard, that he does not break the 
    trees, or destroy the hedges; if he does not do service in the vineyard—he 
    loses his pay. Just so, if you do not do good in your place, if you do not 
    glorify God—you will lose your pay—you will miss of salvation! Oh, think of 
    this, all you who live worthless lives! Christ cursed the barren fig tree.

<p align="justify">(2.) It reproves such as are so far from bringing glory 
    to God, that they rob God of his glory.</p></b> Mal 3:3. "Will a man rob God? 
    Yet you have robbed me." They rob God, who take the glory due to God to 
    themselves. 
<p align="justify">1. If they have gotten an estate, they ascribe all to 
    their own wit and industry, they set the crown upon their own head, not 
    considering that, "You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is he who 
    gives you power to get wealth." </p>
<p align="justify">2. If they do any duty of religion, they look to their 
    own glory. "Be careful not to do your "acts of righteousness" before men, to 
    be seen by them." They may be set upon a theater for others to admire and 
    canonize them. The oil of vainglory feeds their lamp. How many by the wind 
    of popular breath have been blown to hell! Whom the devil cannot destroy by 
    intemperance, he does by vainglory.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It reproves those who fight against God's glory.</p></b> 
    "Lest you be found to fight against God." Such as oppose that whereby God's 
    glory is promoted, fight against God's glory. His glory is much promoted by 
    the preaching of the word, which is his engine whereby he converts souls. 
    Now, such as would hinder the preaching of the word fight against God's 
    glory. "Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved." 
    Diocletian, who raised the tenth persecution against the Christians, 
    prohibited church meetings, and would have the churches of the Christians to 
    be burned down. Such as hinder preaching—as the Philistines that stopped the 
    wells—stop the well of the water of life. They take away the physicians that 
    would heal sin-sick souls. Ministers are lights, Matt 5:14, and who but 
    thieves hate the light? They directly strike at God's glory; and what an 
    account will they have to give to God, when he shall charge the blood of 
    men's souls upon them! "You have taken away the key of knowledge; you 
    entered not in yourselves, and those who were entering in you hindered." If 
    there is either justice in heaven, or fire in hell—they shall not go

<p align="justify">(1.) Let me speak to <b>magistrates</b>. God has put much 
    glory upon them. "I have said, You are gods;" and will they not glorify him 
    who has put so much glory upon them? </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) <b>Ministers </b>should study to promote God's 
    glory. God has entrusted them with two of the most precious things—his 
    truth, and the souls of his people. Ministers, by virtue of their office, 
    are to glorify God. They must glorify God, by <b>laboring in the word </b>
    and doctrine. "I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall 
    judge the living and the dead: preach the word, be ready in season, out of 
    season," etc. It was Augustine's wish, "that Christ, at his coming, might 
    find him either praying or preaching." Ministers must glorify God by their
    <b>zeal </b>and <b>sanctity</b>. The priests under the law, before they 
    served at the altar, <i>washed </i>in the laver; so, such as serve in the 
    Lord's house, must first be washed from gross sin in the laver of 
    repentance. It is matter of grief and shame to think how many, who call 
    themselves ministers, instead of bringing glory to God, dishonor him. <i>
    Their lives, as well as their doctrines, are heterodox!</i> They are not 
    free from the sins which they reprove in others. Plutarch's servant 
    upbraided him, by saying, "he has written a book against anger—yet he falls 
    into a passion of anger with me." So is a minister who preaches against 
    drunkenness, yet he himself is drunk; he preaches against swearing, yet he 
    himself swears! </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) <b>Masters of families</b> must glorify God, must 
    season their children and servants with the knowledge of the Lord; their 
    houses should be little churches. "I know that Abraham will command his 
    children, that they may keep the way of the Lord." You who are masters have 
    a charge of souls. For lack of the bridle of family discipline, youth run 
    wild.</p>
<p align="justify">It will be a great comfort in a dying hour, to think we 
    have glorified God in our lives. It was Christ's comfort before his death: 
    "I have glorified you on the earth." At the hour of death, all your earthly 
    comforts will vanish. If you think how rich you have been, what pleasures 
    you have had on earth; this will be so far from comforting you, that it will 
    torment you the more. What is one the better, for an estate which is spent? 
    But to have conscience telling you, that you have glorified God on the 
    earth, what sweet comfort and peace will this let into your soul! how will 
    it make you long for death! The servant who has been all day working in the 
    vineyard, longs for the evening, when he shall receive his pay. How can they 
    who have lived, and brought no glory to God, think of dying with comfort? 
    They cannot expect a harvest where they sowed no seed. How can they expect 
    glory <i>from </i>God, who never brought any glory <i>to </i>him? Oh in what 
    horror will they be at death! The worm of conscience will gnaw their souls, 
    before the worms can gnaw their bodies!</p>
<p align="justify">If we glorify God, he will glorify our souls forever. By

<p align="justify"><br/>
    2. Man's chief end is to ENJOY God forever.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">"Whom do I have in heaven but You? And I desire nothing 
    on earth but You. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of 
    my heart, my portion forever!" Psalm 73:25-26. There is a twofold fruition 
    or enjoying of God; the one is in this life, the other in the life to come.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] The enjoyment of God in this life.</p></b></font> It is a 
    great matter to enjoy God's ordinances—but to enjoy God's presence in the 
    ordinances is that which a gracious heart aspires after. Psalm 63:2, "I have 
    seen YOU in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory." This sweet 
    enjoyment of God, is, when we feel his Spirit co-operating with the 
    ordinance, and distilling grace upon our hearts; when in the Word, the 
    Spirit quickens and raises the affections, Luke 24:42, "Did not our hearts 
    burn within us?", when the Spirit transforms the heart, leaving an impress 
    of holiness upon it. "We are changed into the same image, from glory to 
    glory." When the Spirit revives the heart with comfort, it comes not only 
    with its anointing—but with its seal; it sheds God's love abroad in the 
    heart. "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ." 
    In the Word we hear God's <i>voice</i>, in the sacrament we have his <i>kiss</i>. 
    The heart being warmed and inflamed in a duty—is God's answering by fire. 
    The sweet communications of God's Spirit are the first-fruits of glory. Now 
    Christ has pulled off his veil, and showed his smiling face; now he has led 
    a believer into the banqueting-house, and given him of the spiced wine of 
    his love to drink; he has put in his finger at the hole of the door; he has 
    touched the heart, and made it leap for joy. Oh how sweet is it thus to 
    enjoy God! The godly have, in ordinances, had such divine raptures of joy, 
    and soul transfigurations, that they have been carried above the world, and 
    have despised all things here below.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: </p></b></font>Is the enjoyment of God in this life 
    so sweet? How wicked are they who prefer the enjoyment of their lusts before 
    the enjoyment of God! "The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, the pride 
    of life," is the evil trinity they worship. Lust is an inordinate desire or 
    impulse, provoking the soul to that which is evil. There is the <i>
    revengeful </i>lust; and the <i>wanton </i>lust. Lust, like a feverish heat, 
    puts the soul into a flame. Aristotle calls sensual lusts <i>brutish</i>, 
    because, when any lust is violent, reason or conscience cannot be heard. 
    These lusts besot and brutalize the man. "Whoredom and wine take away the 
    heart;" the heart for anything that is good. How many make it their chief 
    end, not to enjoy God—but to enjoy their lusts! As that cardinal who said, 
    "Let him but keep his cardinalship of Paris, and he was content to lose his 
    part in Paradise." Lust first bewitches with pleasure, and then comes the 
    fatal dart. "Until a dart strikes through his liver." This should be as a 
    flaming sword to stop men in the way of their carnal delights. <b>Who for a 
    drop of pleasure—would drink a sea of wrath?
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Use two:</p></font></b> Let it be our great concern, to enjoy 
    God's sweet presence in his ordinances. Enjoying spiritual communion with 
    God is a riddle and mystery to most people. Everyone who hangs about the <i>
    court, </i>does not speak with the king. We may approach God in ordinances, 
    and hang about the court of heaven, yet not enjoy communion with God. We may 
    have the letter without the Spirit, the visible sign without the invisible 
    grace. It is the enjoyment of God in a duty, which we should chiefly look 
    at. "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet 
    with God?" Psalm 42:2. Alas! what are all our worldly enjoyments, without 
    the enjoyment of God! What is it to enjoy good health, a noble estate, and 
    not to enjoy God? Job said, "I went mourning without the sun." So may you 
    say in the enjoyment of all creatures without God, "I went mourning without 
    the sun." I have the <i>starlight </i>of outward enjoyments—but I lack the
    <i>Sun </i>of Righteousness. "I went mourning without the sun."
<p align="justify">It should be our great design, not only to have the 
    ordinances of God—but the God of the ordinances. The enjoyment of God's 
    sweet presence here is the most contented life. <b>God is a hive of 
    sweetness, a treasury of riches, a fountain of delight! </b>The higher the 
    lark flies—the sweeter it sings. Just so, the higher we fly by the wings of 
    faith—the more we enjoy of God. How is the heart inflamed in prayer and 
    meditation! What joy and peace is there in believing! Is it not comfortable 
    being in heaven? He who enjoys much of God in this life, carries heaven with 
    him. Oh let this be the thing we are chiefly ambitious of—the enjoyment of 
    God in his ordinances! The enjoyment of God's sweet presence here, is a 
    pledge of our enjoying him in heaven!</p>
<p align="justify">This brings us to the second thing:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The enjoyment of God in the life to come.</p></b></font> 
    Man's chief end is to enjoy God forever. Before the full fruition of God in 
    heaven, there must be something previous and antecedent; and that is, our 
    being in a state of <i>grace</i>. We must have conformity to him in <i>grace</i>, 
    before we can have communion with him in <i>glory</i>. Grace and glory are 
    linked and chained together. Grace precedes glory, as the morning star 
    ushers in the sun. God will have us qualified and fitted for a state of 
    blessedness. Drunkards and swearers are not fit to enjoy God in glory; the 
    Lord will not lay such vipers in his bosom. Only the "pure in heart shall 
    see God." We must first be, as the king's daughter, glorious within, before 
    we are clothed with the robes of glory. As King Ahasuerus first caused the 
    virgins to be purified and anointed, and they had their sweet fragrances to 
    perfume them, and then went to stand before the king; so must we have the 
    anointing of God, and be perfumed with the graces of the Spirit, those sweet 
    fragrances, and then we shall stand before the king of heaven. Being thus 
    divinely qualified by grace, we shall be taken up to the mount of vision, 
    and enjoy God forever; and what is enjoying God forever but to be put in a 
    state of happiness? As the body cannot have life but by having communion 
    with the soul, so the soul cannot have blessedness but by having immediate 
    communion with God. 
<p align="justify">God is the <i>summum bonum</i>, the <b>chief </b>good; 
    therefore the enjoyment of him is the highest felicity.</p>
<p align="justify">God is a <b>universal </b>good—"a good, in which are all 
    goods." The excellencies of the creature are limited. A man may have health, 
    but not beauty, nor learning, nor parentage, nor riches, nor wisdom. But in 
    God are contained all excellencies. He is a good, commensurate fully to the 
    soul; a sun, a portion, a horn of salvation; in whom dwells "all fullness."</p>
<p align="justify">God is an <b>unmixed </b>good. There is no condition in 
    this life but has its mixture; for every drop of honey there is a drop of 
    gall. Solomon, who gave himself to find out the philosopher's stone, to 
    search out for happiness here below, found nothing but vanity and vexation.
    </p>
<p align="justify">God is perfect, the <b>quintessence </b>of good. He is 
    sweetness in the flower. </p>
<p align="justify">God is a <b>satisfying </b>good. The soul now cries out, 
    "I have enough!" "I shall be satisfied with your likeness." Let a man who is 
    thirsty be brought to an ocean of pure water, and he has enough. If there is 
    enough in God to satisfy the <i>angels</i>, then sure there is enough to 
    satisfy <i>us. </i>The soul is but finite—but God is infinite. Though God is 
    a good which satisfies, yet he does not surfeit. Fresh joys spring 
    continually from his face; and he is as much to be desired after millions of 
    years by glorified souls—as at the first moment! There is a fullness in God 
    which satisfies, and yet so much sweetness, that the soul still desires.</p>
<p align="justify">God is a <b>delicious </b>good. That which is the chief 
    good must ravish the soul with pleasure; there must be in it rapturous 
    delight and quintessence of joy. There is a certain sweetness about God's 
    person which <i>delights</i>, nay, rather, <i>ravishes </i>the soul! The 
    love of God drops such infinite pleasure into the soul as is unspeakable and 
    full of glory. If there is so much delight in God, when we see him only by
    <i>faith</i>—what will the joy of vision be, when we shall see him <i>face 
    to face! </i>If the saints have found so much delight in God while they were
    <i>suffering</i>, oh what joy and delight will they have when they are being
    <i>crowned! </i>If <i>flames </i>are beds of roses, what will it be to lean 
    on the <i>bosom </i>of Jesus! What a bed of roses that will be! </p>
<p align="justify">God is a <b>superlative </b>good. He is better than 
    anything you can put in competition with him. He is better than health, 
    riches, honor. Other things <i>maintain </i>life, he <i>gives </i>life. Who 
    would put anything in balance with the Deity? Who would weigh a feather 
    against a mountain of gold? God excels all other things more infinitely than 
    the sun excels the light of a candle. </p>
<p align="justify">God is an <b>eternal </b>good. He is the Ancient of days, 
    yet never decays, nor waxes old. The joy he gives is eternal, the crown 
    never fades away. The glorified soul shall be ever solacing itself in God, 
    feasting on his love, and sunning itself in the light of his countenance. We 
    read of the <i>river of pleasure </i>at God's right hand; but will not this 
    in time be dried up? No! There is a fountain at the bottom which feeds it. 
    "With the Lord is the fountain of life." </p>
<p align="justify">Thus God is the chief good, and the enjoyment of God 
    forever is the highest felicity of which the soul is capable.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Let it be the chief end of our living to enjoy 
    this chief good hereafter.</p></b></font> Augustine reckons up 288 opinions 
    among philosophers about happiness—but all were short of the mark. The 
    highest elevation of a reasonable soul is to enjoy God forever. It is the 
    enjoyment of God, which makes heaven. "Then shall we ever be with the Lord." 
    The soul trembles as the needle in the compass, and is never at rest until 
    it comes to God. To set out this excellent state of a glorified soul's 
    enjoyment of God: 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It must not be understood in a sensual manner.</p></b> 
    We must not conceive any carnal pleasures in heaven. The <i>Turks</i>, in 
    their Koran, speak of a paradise of pleasure, where they have riches in 
    abundance, and red wine served in golden chalices. The <i>epicures </i>of 
    this age would like such a heaven when they die. Though the state of glory 
    is compared to a feast, and is set out by pearls and precious stones, yet 
    these metaphors are only helps to our faith, and to show us that there is 
    superabundant joy and felicity in the highest heaven; but they are not <i>
    carnal</i>, but <i>spiritual </i>delights. Our heavenly enjoyment will be in 
    the perfection of holiness, in seeing the pure face of Christ, in feeling 
    the love of God, in conversing with heavenly spirits; which will be proper 
    for the soul, and infinitely exceed all carnal voluptuous delights. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) We shall have a lively sense of this glorious 
    estate. </p></b>A man in a lethargy, though alive, is as good as dead, because 
    he is not sensible, nor does he take any pleasure in his life. But we shall 
    have a quick and lively sense of the infinite pleasure which arises from the 
    enjoyment of God. We shall know ourselves to be happy. We shall reflect with 
    joy upon our dignity and felicity. We shall taste every crumb of that 
    sweetness, every drop of that pleasure, which flows from God. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) We shall be made able to bear a sight of that glory.</p></b> 
    We could not now bear that glory, it would overwhelm us, as a weak eye 
    cannot behold the sun; but God will capacitate us for glory; our souls shall 
    be so heavenly, and perfected with holiness, that they may be able to enjoy 
    the blessed vision of God. Moses in a cleft of the rock saw the glory of God 
    passing by. From our blessed rock Christ, we shall behold the beatific sight 
    of God. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) This enjoyment of God shall be more than a bare 
    contemplation of him. </p></b>Some of the learned move the question, Whether the 
    enjoyment of God shall be by way of contemplation only. That is 
    something—but it is one half of heaven only; there shall be a loving of God, 
    an acquiescence in him, a tasting his sweetness; not only inspection, but 
    possession. John 17:24. "That they may behold my glory;" there is 
    inspection: Verse 22. "And the glory you have given me, I have <i>given </i>
    them;" there is possession. "Glory shall be revealed <i>in </i>us," not only 
    revealed to us—but in us. To behold God's glory, there is glory revealed to 
    us; but, to partake of his glory, there is glory revealed in us. As the 
    sponge sucks in the wine—so shall we suck in glory! 
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) There is no intermission in this state of glory. </p></b>
    We shall not only have God's glorious presence at certain special seasons; 
    but we shall be continually in his presence, continually under divine 
    raptures of joy. There shall not be one minute in heaven, wherein a 
    glorified soul may say, "I do not enjoy happiness." The streams of glory are 
    not like the water of a conduit, often stopped, so that we cannot have one 
    drop of water; but those heavenly streams of joy are continually running. Oh 
    how should we despise this <i>valley of tears </i>where we now are, for the 
    mount of transfiguration! how should we long for the full enjoyment of God 
    in Paradise! Had we a sight of that land of promise, we would need patience 
    to be content to live here any longer!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Let this be a spur to duty.</p></b></font> How 
    diligent and zealous should we be in glorifying God, that we may come at 
    last to enjoy him! If Tully, Demosthenes, and Plato, who had but the dim 
    watch-light of <i>reason </i>to see by, imagined a paradise of happiness 
    after this life, and took such herculean pains to enjoy it; oh how should 
    Christians, who have the light of Scripture to see by, bestir themselves 
    that they may attain to the eternal fruition of God and glory! If anything 
    can make us rise off our bed of sloth, and serve God with all our might, it 
    should be this—the hope of our near enjoyment of God forever! What made Paul 
    so active in the sphere of true religion? "I labored more abundantly than 
    they all." His obedience did not move slow, as the sun on the dial; but 
    swift, as light from the sun. Why was he so zealous in glorifying God—but 
    that he might at last center and terminate in him? "Then shall we ever be 
    with the Lord."

<p align="justify">Question 2. What rule has God given to direct us how we 
    may glorify and enjoy him?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: The Word of God, which is contained in the 
    scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, is the only rule to direct us how 
    we may glorify and enjoy him.</p>
<p align="justify">"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God." By 
    Scripture is understood the sacred Book of God. It is given by divine 
    inspiration; that is, the Scripture is not the contrivance of man's 
    brain—but is divine in its origin. The image of Diana was had in veneration 
    by the Ephesians, because they supposed it fell from Jupiter. The holy 
    Scripture is to be highly reverenced and esteemed, because we are sure it 
    came from heaven. The two Testaments are the two lips by which God has 
    spoken to us.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How does it appear that the Scriptures have a divine 
    authority stamped upon them?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Because the Old and New Testament are the foundation of 
    all true religion. If their divinity cannot be proved, the foundation on 
    which we build our faith is gone. I shall therefore endeavor to prove this 
    great truth, that the Scriptures are the very word of God. I wonder whence 
    the Scriptures should come—if not from God. <i>Bad </i>men could not be the 
    authors of it. Would their minds be employed in inditing such holy lines? 
    Would they declare so fiercely against sin? <i>Good </i>men could not be the 
    authors of it. Could they write in such a strain? or could it stand with 
    their grace to counterfeit God's name, and put, "Thus says the Lord," to a 
    book of their own devising? Nor could any <i>angel </i>in heaven be the 
    author of it, because the angels pry and search into the abyss of gospel 
    mysteries, which implies their ignorance of some parts of Scripture; and 
    surely, they cannot be the authors of that book which they themselves do not 
    fully understand. Besides, what angel in heaven dared be so arrogant as to 
    impersonate God and, say, "I create," and, "I the Lord have said it,"? So 
    that it is evident, the pedigree of Scripture is sacred, and it could come 
    from none but God himself.</p>
<p align="justify">Not to speak of the harmonious consent of all the parts 
    of Scripture, there are seven cogent arguments which may evince it to be the 
    Word of God.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] Its ANTIQUITY. </p></b></font>It is of ancient standing. 
    The grey hairs of Scripture make it venerable. No human histories extant 
    reach further than Noah's flood: but the holy Scripture relates matters of 
    fact that have been from the beginning of the world; it writes of things 
    before time. That is a sure rule of Tertullian, "That which is of the 
    greatest antiquity, is to be received as most sacred and authentic."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] We may know the Scripture to be the Word of God by 
    its miraculous PRESERVATION in all ages.</p></b></font> The holy Scriptures are 
    the richest jewel that Christ has left us; and the church of God has so kept 
    these public records of heaven, that they have not been lost. The Word of 
    God has never lacked enemies to oppose, and, if possible, to extirpate it. 
    They have given out a law concerning Scripture, as Pharaoh did the midwives, 
    concerning the Hebrew women's children, <i>to strangle it in the birth</i>; 
    but God has preserved this blessed Book inviolable to this day. The devil 
    and his agents have been blowing at Scripture light—but could never blow it 
    out; a clear sign that it was lighted from heaven. The letter of Scripture 
    has been preserved, without any corruption, in the original tongue. The 
    Scriptures were not corrupted before Christ's time, for then Christ would 
    not have sent the Jews to them. He said, "Search the Scriptures." He knew 
    these sacred springs were not muddied with human fancies.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The Scripture appears to be the Word of God, by the 
    subject MATTER contained in it. </p></b></font>The mystery of Scripture is so 
    abstruse and profound that no man or angel could have known it, had it not 
    been divinely revealed. That <i>eternity—</i>should be born; that he who 
    thunders in the heavens—should cry in the cradle; that he who rules the 
    stars—should suck the breasts; that the Prince of Life—should die; that the 
    Lord of Glory—should be put to shame; that sin should be punished to the 
    full—yet pardoned to the full; who could ever have conceived of such a 
    mystery, had not the Scripture revealed it to us? Just so, for the doctrine 
    of the resurrection; that the same body which is crumbled into a thousand 
    pieces, should rise the same individual body, else it were a creation, not a 
    resurrection. How could such a sacred riddle, above all human disquisition, 
    be known, had not the Scripture made a discovery of it? 
<p align="justify">As the matter of Scripture is so full of goodness, 
    justice and sanctity, that it could be breathed from none but God; so the <b>
    holiness </b>of it shows it to be of God. Scripture is compared to silver 
    refined seven times. The Book of God has no errata in it; it is a beam of 
    the Sun of Righteousness, a crystal stream flowing from the fountain of 
    life. All laws and edicts of men have had their corruptions—but the Word of 
    God has not the least tincture—it is of meridian splendor. Psalm 119:940, 
    "Your word is very pure," like wine which comes from the grape, which is not 
    mixed nor adulterated. It is so pure that it purifies everything else. John 
    17:17, "Sanctify them through your truth." The Scripture presses holiness—as 
    no other book ever did. It bids us live "soberly, righteously, and godly;"
    <i>Soberly</i>, in acts of temperance; <i>righteously</i>, in acts of 
    justice; <i>godly</i>, in acts of piety and devotion. It commends to us, 
    whatever is "just, lovely, and of good report." <b>This sword of the Spirit 
    cuts down vice! </b>Eph 6:67. Out of this tower of Scripture, is thrown a 
    millstone upon the head of sin! The Scripture is the royal law which 
    commands not only the actions—but affections; it binds the heart to good 
    behavior. Where is there such holiness to be found—as is dug out of this 
    sacred mine? Who could be the author of such a book but God himself?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] That the Scripture is the Word of God is evident by 
    its PREDICTIONS. </p></b></font>It <b>prophesies </b>of things to come, which 
    shows the voice of God speaking in it. It was foretold by the prophet, "A 
    virgin shall conceive," and, the "Messiah shall be cut off." Dan 9:96. The 
    Scripture foretells things that would fall out many ages and centuries 
    after; as how long Israel should serve in the iron furnace, and the very day 
    of their deliverance. "At the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even 
    the self-same day, it came to pass that the host of the Lord went out of 
    Egypt." This prediction of future things, merely contingent, and not 
    depending upon natural causes, is a clear demonstration of its divine 
    origin.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] The impartiality of those men of God who wrote the 
    Scriptures, who do not spare to set down their own failings.</p></b></font> What 
    man who writes a history, would blacken his own face, by recording those 
    things of himself which would stain his reputation? <i>Moses </i>records his 
    own impatience when he struck the rock, and tells us, he could not on that 
    account enter into the land of promise. <i>David </i>relates his own 
    adultery and bloodshed, which stands as a blot in his escutcheon to 
    succeeding ages. <i>Peter </i>relates his own cowardliness in denying 
    Christ. <i>Jonah </i>sets down his own angry passions, "I do well to be 
    angry to the death." Surely had their pen not been guided by God's own hand, 
    they would never have written that which reflects dishonor upon themselves. 
    Men usually hide their blemishes, rather than publish them to the world; but 
    the penmen of holy Scripture eclipse their own name; they take away all 
    glory from themselves, and give the glory to God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] The mighty POWER and EFFICACY that the Word has had 
    upon the souls and consciences of men.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">It has <b>changed </b>their hearts. Some by reading 
    Scripture have been turned into other men; they have been made holy and 
    gracious. By reading other books the heart may be <i>warmed</i>—but by 
    reading this book it is <i>transformed</i>. "You are manifestly declared to 
    be the epistle of Christ, written not with ink—but with the Spirit of the 
    living God." The Word was copied out into their hearts, and they became 
    Christ's epistle, so that others might read Christ in them. If you should 
    set a seal upon marble, and it should make an impression upon the marble, 
    and leave a print behind, there would be a strange virtue in that seal; so 
    when the seal of the Word leaves a heavenly print of grace upon the heart, 
    there must needs be a power going along with that Word no less than divine.
    </p>
<p align="justify">It has <b>comforted </b>their hearts. When Christians 
    have sat by the rivers weeping—the Word has dropped as honey, and sweetly 
    revived them. A Christian's chief comfort is drawn out of these <i>wells of 
    salvation</i>. Rom 15:5, "That we through <i>comfort of the Scriptures</i> 
    might have hope." When a poor soul has been ready to faint—it has had 
    nothing to comfort it but <i>a Scripture cordial</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">When it has been <i>sick</i>—the Word has revived it. 
    "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more 
    exceeding and eternal weight of glory." </p>
<p align="justify">When it has been <i>deserted</i>—the Word has dropped in 
    the golden oil of joy. "The Lord will not cast off forever." He may change 
    his providence, not his purpose; he may have the <i>look of an enemy</i>—but 
    he has the <i>heart of a father</i>. Thus the Word has a power in it to 
    comfort the heart. This is my comfort in my affliction; for your word has 
    quickened me." As the spirits are conveyed through the arteries of the body, 
    so divine comforts are conveyed through the promises of the Word. Now, the 
    Scriptures having such an exhilarating, heart-comforting power in them—shows 
    clearly that they are of God—and it is he who has put the milk of 
    consolation into these breasts.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[7] The MIRACLES by which Scripture is confirmed.</p></b></font> 
    Miracles were used by Moses, Elijah, and Christ, and were continued, many 
    years after, by the apostles—to confirm the verity of the holy Scriptures. 
    As props are set under weak vines, so these miracles were set under the weak 
    faith of men, that if they would not believe the writings of the Word, they 
    might believe the miracles. We read of God's dividing the waters, making a 
    pathway in the sea for his people to go over, the iron swimming, the oil 
    increasing by pouring out, Christ's making wine of water, his curing the 
    blind, and raising the dead. Thus God has set a seal to the truth and 
    divinity of the Scriptures by miracles.
<p align="justify">The Papists cannot deny that the Scripture is divine and 
    sacred; but they affirm with respect to us, it receives its divine authority 
    from the church; and in proof of it they bring that Scripture, 1 Tim 3:15, 
    where the church is said to be the ground and pillar of truth.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true, the church is the pillar of truth; but it 
    does not therefore follow that the Scripture has its authority from the 
    church. The king's proclamation is fixed on the pillar, the pillar holds it 
    out, that all may read—but the proclamation does not receive its authority 
    from the pillar—but from the king; so the church holds forth the 
    Scriptures—but they do not receive their authority from the church—but from 
    God. If the Word of God be divine, merely because the church holds it forth, 
    then it will follow, that our faith is to be built upon the church, and not 
    upon the Word, contrary to Eph 2:20. "Built upon the foundation (that is the 
    doctrine) of the apostles and prophets."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Are all the books in the Bible of the same divine 
    authority?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Those which we call canonical.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Why are the Scriptures called canonical?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Because the Word is a <i>rule of faith</i>, to direct our 
    lives. The Word is the judge of controversies, the rock of infallibility. 
    That only is to be received for truth, which agrees with Scripture, as the 
    transcript with the original. All maxims in divinity are to be brought to 
    the touchstone of Scripture, as all measures are brought to the standard.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Are the Scriptures a complete rule?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The Scripture is a full and perfect rule, containing in 
    it all things necessary to salvation. "From a child you have known the holy 
    Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation." The Scripture 
    shows what we are to <i>believe</i>; and what we are to <i>practice</i>. It 
    gives us an exact model of true religion, and perfectly instructs us in the 
    deep things of God. The Papists, therefore, make themselves guilty, who eke 
    out Scripture with their traditions, which they consider equal to it. The 
    Council of Trent says, that the traditions of the church of Rome are to be 
    received <i>pari pietatis affectu</i>, with the same devotion that Scripture 
    is to be received; so bringing themselves under the curse. "If any man shall 
    add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written 
    in this book."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What is the main scope and end of Scripture?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">To reveal a way of salvation. It makes a clear discovery 
    of Christ. "These things are written, that you might believe that Jesus is 
    the Christ, and that believing you might have life through his name." The 
    design of the Word is to be a test whereby our grace is to be tried; a 
    sea-mark to show us what rocks are to be avoided. The Word is to purify and 
    quicken our affections; it is to be our directory and consolatory; it is to 
    waft us over to the land of promise.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Who should have the power of interpreting Scripture?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The Papists assert that it is in the power of the <i>
    church</i>. If you ask whom they mean by the church, they say, The Pope, who 
    is head of it, and he is infallible. But that assertion is false, because 
    many of the Popes have been ignorant and wicked, as Platina affirms, who 
    writes the lives of Popes. Pope Liberius was an Arian, and Pope John XII 
    denied the immortality of the soul; therefore Popes are not fit interpreters 
    of Scripture; who then?</p>
<p align="justify">The Scripture is to be its own interpreter, or rather the 
    Spirit speaking in it. Nothing can cut the diamond but the diamond; nothing 
    can interpret Scripture but Scripture. The sun best discovers itself by its 
    own beams; the Scripture interprets itself to the understanding. But the 
    question is concerning <i>hard places </i>of Scripture, where the weak 
    Christian is ready to wade beyond his depth; who shall interpret here?</p>
<p align="justify">The church of God has appointed some to expound and 
    interpret Scripture; therefore he has given gifts to men. The several 
    pastors of churches, like bright constellations, give light to dark 
    Scriptures. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek 
    the law at his mouth."</p>
<p align="justify">But this is to pin our faith upon men.</p>
<p align="justify">We are to receive nothing as truth, but what is agreeable 
    to the Word. As God has given to his ministers gifts for interpreting 
    obscure places, so he has given to his people so much of the spirit of 
    discerning, that they can tell (at least in things necessary to salvation) 
    what is consonant to Scripture, and what is not. "To one is given a spirit 
    of prophecy, to another discerning of spirits." God has endued his people 
    with such a measure of wisdom and discretion, that they can discern between 
    truth and error, and judge what is sound and what is spurious. "The Bereans 
    searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so." They weighed 
    the doctrine they heard, whether it was agreeable to Scripture, though Paul 
    and Silas were their teachers.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See the wonderful goodness of God, who, besides 
    the light of nature—has committed to us the sacred Scriptures. </p></b></font>
    The heathen are enveloped in ignorance. "As for his judgments, they have not 
    known them." They have the oracles of the Sibyls—but not the writings of 
    Moses and the apostles. How many live in the region of death, where this 
    bright star of Scripture never appeared! We have this blessed Book of God to 
    resolve all our doubts, to point out a way of life to us. "Lord, how is it 
    you will manifest yourself unto us—and not unto the world?"
<p align="justify">God having given us his written Word to be our directory, 
    takes away all excuses from men. No man can say, "I went wrong for lack of 
    light." God has given you his Word as a lamp to your feet; therefore if you 
    go wrong, you do it willfully. No man can say, "If I had known the will of 
    God, I would have obeyed it." You are inexcusable, O man, for God has given 
    you a rule to go by, he has written his law with his own finger; therefore, 
    if you obey not, you have no excuse left. If a master leaves his mind in 
    writing with his servant, and tells him what work he will have done, and the 
    servant neglects the work—that servant is left without excuse. "Now you have 
    no excuse for your sins."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: </p></b></font>Is all Scripture of divine 
    inspiration?
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) </p></b>Is all Scripture of divine inspiration? <b>Then 
    it reproves the PAPISTS</b>, who take away part of Scripture, and so clip 
    the King of heaven's coin. They expunge the second commandment out of their 
    catechisms, because it forbids idols "You shall not make for yourself an 
    idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in 
    the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them." Exodus 
    20:4-5. And it is usual with them, if they meet with anything in Scripture 
    which they dislike, either to put a false gloss upon it, or, if that will 
    not do, to pretend it is corrupted. They are like Ananias, who kept back 
    part of the money. They keep back part of the Scripture from the people. It 
    is a high affront to God to deface and obliterate any part of his Word, and 
    brings us under that curse, "If any man shall take away from the words of 
    the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of 
    life."
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) </p></b>Is all Scripture of divine inspiration? <b>Then 
    it condemns the ANTINOMIANS</b>, who lay aside the Old Testament as useless, 
    and out of date; and call those who adhere to them <i>Old Testament 
    Christians</i>. God has stamped a divine majesty upon both Testaments; and 
    until they can show me where God has repealed the Old, it stands in force. 
    The two Testaments are the two wells of salvation; the Antinomians would 
    stop up one of these wells, they would dry up one of the breasts of 
    Scripture. There is much gospel in the Old Testament. The comforts of the 
    gospel in the New Testament have their rise from the Old. The great promise 
    of the Messiah is in the Old Testament, "A virgin shall conceive and bear a 
    son." Nay, I say more. The moral law, in some parts of it, speaks gospel, "I 
    am the Lord your God;" here is the pure wine of the gospel. The saints" 
    great charter, where God promises to "sprinkle clean water upon them, and 
    put his Spirit within them," is to be found primarily in the Old Testament. 
    So that those who take away the Old Testament, as Samson pulled down the 
    pillars, would take away the pillars of a Christian's comfort. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) </p></b>Is all Scripture of divine inspiration? <b>Then 
    it condemns the ENTHUSIASTS</b>, who, pretending to have the Spirit, lay 
    aside the whole Bible, and say the Scripture is a dead letter, and they live 
    above it. What impudence is this! Until we are above sin, we shall not be 
    above Scripture. Let not men so talk of a revelation from the Spirit—but 
    suspect it to be an imposture. The Spirit of God acts regularly, it works in 
    and by the Word; and he who pretends to a new light, which is either above 
    the Word, or contrary to it, abuses both himself and the Spirit: his light 
    is borrowed from him who transforms himself into an angel of light. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) </p></b>Is all Scripture of divine inspiration? <b>Then 
    it condemns the SLIGHTERS of Scripture</b>; such as those who can go whole 
    weeks and months and never read the Word. They lay it aside as rusty armor; 
    they prefer a play or romance before Scripture. The weighty matters of the 
    Scripture, are to them insignificant. Oh how many can be looking at their 
    faces in a glass all the morning—but their eyes begin to be sore when they 
    look upon a Bible! Heathens die for <i>lack </i>of Scripture, and these in
    <i>contempt </i>of it. They surely must needs go wrong who slight their only 
    guide. Such as lay the reins upon the neck of their lusts, and never use the 
    curbing bit of Scripture to check them, are carried to hell, and never stop!
    
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) </p></b>Is all Scripture of divine inspiration? <b>Then 
    it condemns the ABUSERS of Scripture.</b> Those who muddy and poison this 
    pure crystal fountain with their corrupt glosses, and who <b>twist </b>the 
    Scripture. They give wrong interpretations of it, not comparing Scripture 
    with Scripture; as the Antinomians pervert that Scripture, "He has not 
    beheld iniquity in Jacob;" from which they infer that God's people may take 
    liberty in sin, because God sees no sin in them. It is true, God sees no sin 
    in his people with an eye of <i>revenge</i>—but he sees it with an eye of <i>
    observation</i>. He sees not sin in them, so as to <i>damn </i>them; but he 
    sees it, so as to be angry, and severely to <i>punish </i>them. Did not 
    David find it so, when he cried out of his broken bones? In like manner the 
    Arminians wrest the Scripture in John 5:40, "You will not come to me;" where 
    they bring in free will. This text shows how willing God is that we should 
    have life; and that sinners may do more than they do, they may improve the 
    talents God has given them; but it does not prove the power of free will, 
    for that is contrary to that Scripture, "No man <i>can </i>come to me, 
    except the Father who has sent me draws him." These, therefore, wring the 
    text so hard, that they make the blood come out; they do not compare 
    Scripture with Scripture. 
<p align="justify">Some <b>jest </b>with Scripture. When they are sad, they 
    take the Scripture as their lute or minstrel to play upon, and so drive away 
    the sad spirit; as a drunkard I have read of, who, having drunk off his 
    cups, called to some of his fellows, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are 
    gone out." In the fear of God, take heed of jesting with Scripture. Eusebius 
    tells us of one, who took a piece of Scripture to make a jest of—but was 
    presently struck with a frenzy and ran mad. It is a saying of Luther, "Whom 
    God intends to destroy, he gives them leave to play with Scripture."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three:</p></b></font> If the Scripture be of divine 
    inspiration, then be exhorted, 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) To STUDY the Scripture. </p></b>It is a copy of God's 
    will. Be Scripture-men, Bible-Christians. "I adore the fullness of 
    Scripture," says Tertullian. In the Book of God are scattered many truths as 
    so many pearls. "Search the Scriptures." Search as for a vein of silver. <b>
    This blessed Book will fill your head with knowledge, and your heart with 
    grace! </b>God wrote the two tables with his own fingers; and if he took 
    pains to write, well may we take pains to read. Apollos was mighty in the 
    Scriptures. Acts 18:24. The Word is our Magna Charta for Heaven; shall we be 
    ignorant of our charter? "Let the word of God dwell in you richly." The 
    memory must be a book where the Word is written. 
<p align="justify">There is <b>majesty </b>sparkling in every line of 
    Scripture; take but one instance, "Who is this who comes from Edom, from the 
    city of Bozrah, with his clothing stained red? Who is this in royal robes, 
    marching in the greatness of his strength? It is I, the Lord, announcing 
    your salvation! It is I, the Lord, who is mighty to save!" Here is a lofty, 
    magnificent style. What angel could speak after this manner? Junius was 
    converted by reading one verse of John; he beheld a majesty in it beyond all 
    human rhetoric. </p>
<p align="justify">There is a <b>melody </b>in Scripture. This is that 
    blessed harp which drives away sadness of spirit. Hear the sounding of this 
    harp a little. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, 
    that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." He took not only our 
    flesh upon him—but our sins! And, "Come unto me, all you that are heavy 
    laden—and I will give you rest." How sweetly does this harp of Scripture 
    sound, what heavenly music does it make in the ears of a distressed sinner, 
    especially when the finger of God's Spirit touches this instrument!</p>
<p align="justify">There is <b>divinity </b>in Scripture. It contains the 
    marrow and quintessence of true religion. It is a rock of diamonds, a 
    mystery of piety. The lips of Scripture have grace poured into them. The 
    Scripture speaks of faith, self-denial, and all the graces which, as a chain 
    of pearls, adorns a Christian. It excites to holiness; it treats of another 
    world, it gives a prospect of eternity! Oh, then, search the Scripture! make 
    the Word familiar to you. Had I the tongue of angels, I could not 
    sufficiently set forth the excellency of Scripture. It is a spiritual 
    telescope, in which we behold God's glory; it is the tree of life, the 
    oracle of wisdom, the rule of manners, the heavenly seed of which the new 
    creature is formed. James 1:18. "The two Testaments," says Austin, "are the 
    two breasts which every Christian must suck, that he may get spiritual 
    nourishment." The leaves of the tree of life were for healing. Rev 22:2. So 
    these holy leaves of Scripture are for the healing of our souls. </p>
<p align="justify">The Scripture is <b>profitable </b>for all things. If we 
    are deserted—here is spiced wine that cheers the heavy heart; if we are 
    pursued by Satan—here is the sword of the Spirit to resist him; if we are 
    diseased with sin's leprosy—here are the waters of the sanctuary, both to 
    cleanse and cure. Oh, then, search the Scriptures! There is no danger in 
    tasting this tree of knowledge. There was a penalty laid at first, that we 
    might not taste of the tree of knowledge. "In the day that you eat thereof, 
    you shall surely die." There is no danger in plucking from this tree of holy 
    Scripture; if we do not eat of this tree of knowledge, we shall surely die! 
    Oh, then, read the Scriptures! Time may come when the Scriptures may be kept 
    from us.</p>
<p align="justify">Read the Bible with <b>reverence</b>. Think in every line 
    you read—that God is speaking to you. The ark wherein the law was put was 
    overlaid with pure gold, and was carried on bars, that the Levites might not 
    touch it. Exod 25:14. Why was this—but to give reverence to the law? </p>
<p align="justify">Read with <b>seriousness</b>. It is matter of life and 
    death; by this Word you must be tried; conscience and Scripture are the jury 
    God will proceed by, in judging you. </p>
<p align="justify">Read the Word with <b>affection</b>. Get your hearts 
    quickened with the Word; go to it to fetch fire. Luke 24:42. "Did not our 
    hearts burn within us?" Labor that the Word may not only be a lamp to 
    direct—but a fire to warm. <b>Read the Scripture, not only as a history—but 
    as a love letter sent to you from God, which may affect your hearts. </b>
    Pray that the same Spirit who wrote the Word may assist you in reading it; 
    that God's Spirit would show you the wonderful things of his law. "Go near," 
    says God to Philip, "join yourself to this chariot." Acts 8:29. So, when 
    God's Spirit joins himself with the chariot of his Word, it becomes 
    effectual.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Be exhorted to PRIZE the written Word.</p></b> "I have 
    treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread." Job 23:12. David 
    valued the Word more than gold. What would the martyrs have given for a leaf 
    of the Bible! The Word is the field where Christ the pearl of price is 
    hidden! In this sacred mine we dig, not for a wedge of gold—but for a weight 
    of glory! The Scripture is a sacred eye-salve to illuminate us. "The 
    commandment is a lamp, and the law is light." The Scripture is the chart and 
    compass by which we sail to the new Jerusalem. It is a sovereign cordial in 
    all distresses. What are the promises but the water of life to renew 
    fainting spirits? Is it sin which troubles you? Here is a Scripture cordial. 
    Psalm 65:5, "When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our 
    transgressions." Do outward afflictions disquiet you? Here is a Scripture 
    cordial. Psalm 91:15, "I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him." 
    Thus, as manna was laid up in the ark, so promises are laid up in the ark of 
    Scripture. 
<p align="justify">The Scripture will make us wise. Wisdom is above rubies. 
    "By your precepts I get understanding." What made Eve desire the tree of 
    knowledge? "It was a tree to make one wise." The Scriptures teach a man to 
    know himself. They unmask Satan's snares and stratagems. "They make one wise 
    to salvation." Oh, then, highly prize the Scriptures. I have read of Queen 
    Elizabeth, that at her coronation, she received the Bible presented to her, 
    with both her hands, and kissing it, laid it to her bosom, saying, that that 
    book had ever been her chief delight.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) If the Scripture is of divine inspiration, BELIEVE 
    it. </p></b>The Romans, that they might gain credit to their laws, reported they 
    were inspired by the gods of Rome. Oh give credence to the Word! It is 
    breathed from God's own mouth. Hence arises the profaneness of men, that 
    they do not believe the Scripture. "Who has believed our report?" Did you 
    believe the glorious rewards the Scripture speaks of, would you not give 
    diligence to make your election sure? Did you believe the infernal torments 
    the Scripture speaks of, would it not put you into a cold sweat, and cause a 
    trembling at heart for sin? But people are in part atheists, they give but 
    little credit to the Word, therefore they are so impious, and draw such dark 
    shadows in their lives. Learn to realize Scripture, get your hearts wrought 
    to a firm belief of it. 
<p align="justify">Some think, if God would send an angel from heaven, and 
    declare his mind, they would believe him; or, if he would send one from the 
    damned, and preach the torments of hell all in flames, they would believe. 
    But, "If they believe not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be 
    persuaded though one arose from the dead." Luke 16:61. God is wise, and he 
    thinks the fittest way to make his mind known to us is by writing; and such 
    as shall not be convinced by the Word, shall be judged by the Word. The 
    belief of Scripture is of high importance. It will enable us to resist 
    temptation. I John 2:14. "The Word of God abides in you, and you have 
    overcome the wicked one." It conduces much to our sanctification; therefore 
    sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, are put together. 2 
    Thess 2:13. If the word written is not believed, it is like writing on 
    water, which makes no impression.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) LOVE the Word written.</p></b> "Oh how love I your law!" 
    "Lord," said Augustine, "let the holy Scriptures be my holy delight." 
    Chrysostom compares the Scripture to a garden, every truth is a fragrant 
    flower, which we should wear, not on our bosom—but in our heart. David 
    counted the Word "more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are 
    sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb." There is that in 
    Scripture which may breed delight. It shows us the way to <i>riches</i>, 
    Deut 28:8, Prov 3:30; to long <i>life</i>, Psalm 34:42; to a <i>kingdom</i>, 
    Heb 12:28. Well then may we count those the sweetest hours, which are spent 
    in reading the holy Scriptures; well may we say with the prophet, "Your 
    words were found, and I ate them. Your words became a delight to me and the 
    joy of my heart."
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) CONFORM to Scripture.</p></b> Let us lead Scripture 
    lives. Oh that the Bible might be seen printed in our lives! Do what the 
    Word commands. Obedience is an excellent way of commenting upon the Bible. 
    "I will walk in your truth." Let the Word be the sun-dial by which you set 
    your life. What are we the better for having the Scripture, if we do not 
    direct all our speech and actions according to it? What is a carpenter the 
    better for his rule about him, if he sticks it at his back, and never makes 
    use of it for measuring and squaring his work? So, what are we the better 
    for the rule of the Word, if we do not make use of it, and regulate our 
    lives by it? How many swerve and deviate from the rule! The Word teaches to 
    be sober and temperate—but they are drunk! The Word teaches to be chaste and 
    holy—but they are profane; they go quite from the rule! What a dishonor is 
    it to true religion, for men to live in contradiction to Scripture! The Word 
    is called a "light to our feet." Psalm 119:105. It is not only a light to 
    our eyes to mend our sight—but to our feet to mend our walk. Oh let us lead 
    Bible lives!
<b>
<p align="justify">(6.) CONTEND for Scripture. </p></b>Though we should not be 
    of contentious spirits, yet we ought to contend for the Word of God. This 
    jewel is too precious to be parted with. "Hold on to instruction, do not let 
    it go; guard it well, for it is your life." The Scripture is beset with 
    enemies; heretics fight against it, we must therefore "contend for the faith 
    once delivered to the saints." The Scripture is our book of evidences for 
    heaven; shall we part with our evidences? The saints of old were both 
    advocates and martyrs for truth; they would hold fast Scripture, though it 
    were with the loss of their lives.
<b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Be THANKFUL to God for the Scriptures.</p></b> What a 
    mercy is it that God has not only acquainted us what his will is—but that he 
    has made it known by writing! In the old times God revealed his mind by 
    visions—but the Word written is a surer way of knowing God's mind. "This 
    voice which came from heaven we heard, we have also a <i>more sure</i> word 
    of prophecy." The devil is <i>God's ape</i>, and he can transform himself 
    into an angel of light; he can deceive with false revelations. I have heard 
    of one who had, as he thought, a revelation from God to sacrifice his child, 
    as Abraham had; whereupon, following this impulse of the devil, he killed 
    his child. Thus Satan deceives people with delusion, instead of divine 
    revelations; therefore we are to be thankful to God for revealing his mind 
    to us by writing. We are not left in doubtful suspense that we should not 
    know what to believe—but we have an infallible rule to go by. The Scripture 
    is our pole-star to direct us to heaven, it shows us every step we are to 
    take; when we go wrong, it instructs us; when we go right, it comforts us; 
    and it is matter of thankfulness, that the Scriptures are made intelligible, 
    by being translated into contemporary language.
<b>
<p align="justify">(8.) Adore God's distinguishing grace, if you have felt 
    the power and authority of the Word upon your conscience</p></b>; if you can say 
    as David, "Your word has quickened me." Christian, bless God that he has not 
    only given you his <i>Word </i>to be a rule of holiness—but his <i>grace </i>
    to be a principle of holiness. Bless God that he has not only written his 
    Word—but sealed it upon your heart, and made it effectual. Can you say it is 
    of divine inspiration, because you have felt it to be of lively operation? 
    Oh free grace! that God should send out his Word, and heal you; that he 
    should heal you, and not others! That the same Scripture which to them is a 
    dead letter, should be to you a savor of life!
