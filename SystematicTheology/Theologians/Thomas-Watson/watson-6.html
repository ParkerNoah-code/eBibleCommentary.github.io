    "Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."</p></i> 
    Proverbs 4:23
<p align="justify">This book of <i>Proverbs </i>is full of many divine 
    aphorisms. Other parts of Scripture are like a golden chain—the verses 
    linked together by coherence; but this book is like <i>a heap of golden 
    rings</i>: many precious sentences lie scattered up and down in it like so 
    many jewels or sparkling diamonds!</p>
<p align="justify">That title which some have given to Peter Lombard, "the 
    master of sentences," <i>Solomon</i> might justly challenge. Solomon was the 
    wisest of kings. As his <i>kingdom </i>was a map of the world's glory—so his
    <i>head </i>was the epitome of the world's wisdom. He was endued with a 
    divine spirit; while he wrote, the Holy Spirit dictated. And surely, among 
    all his golden sentences, none is more weighty and important than this: <i>
    "Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."</i></p>

<p align="justify">This text is about matters of life and death. The words 
    are mandatory; for all counsels in Scripture carry in them the force of a 
    command. <i>"Keep your heart." </i>Here is God's solemn charge to every man, 
    like a judge's charge given from the bench. I shall first <i>explain</i> the 
    text—and then <i>apply</i> the text.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Keep." </p></b>The Hebrew word "to keep" has various 
    meanings. Sometimes it means "to arm or fence." A stroke to the <i>heart </i>
    kills—so fence your heart. Sometimes it means "to take care of something so 
    that it is not lost," as someone would take care of a piece of precious 
    metal so that it is not taken away. Sometimes it means to keep in safe 
    custody. So keep your heart; lock it up safely so that it is forthcoming 
    when God calls for it.
<b>
<p align="justify">"Your heart."</p></b> The heart is taken diversely in 
    Scripture. Sometimes it is taken for the <i>vital organ </i>(Judges 19:5), 
    sometimes for the <i>soul </i>(Deuteronomy 13:3), sometimes for the <i>mind
    </i>(Proverbs 10:8), sometimes for the <i>conscience </i>(1 John 3:20), and 
    sometimes for the <i>will </i>and <i>affections </i>(Psalm 119:36). I shall 
    take it in its full latitude—for <i>the whole soul with all its noble 
    faculties and endowments</i>. The heart is the deposit or charge every man 
    is entrusted with.
<b>
<p align="justify">"With all diligence."</p></b> The original word is literally 
    translated "with all keeping." The Hebrew word signifies to keep with watch 
    and ward; a Christian is to set a continual guard around his heart. Some 
    read the words "above all keeping." Nothing requires such strict custody; a 
    Christian's <i>heart </i>must ever be in his <i>eye</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">"For out of it are the issues of life."</p></b> Since the 
    heart is the fountain of life—if the heart lives, the body lives; if the 
    heart is touched, death follows. So the soul is a spiritual fountain: out of 
    it issues either sin or grace. From this spring-head, flow the streams 
    either of salvation or damnation!
<p align="justify">In these words there is:</p>
<p align="justify">    A duty: <i>"Keep your heart."</i></p>

<p align="justify">    The manner: <i>"with all diligence."</i></p>

<p align="justify">    The reason: <i>"for out of it are the 
    issues of life."</i></p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE: It must be a Christian's great care to keep his 
    heart with all diligence, with all keeping.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">We are to keep our <b>eyes</b>, as Job set a watch there. 
    Job 31:1: "I have made a covenant with my eyes." We are to keep our <b>lips</b>, 
    as David bridled his tongue. Psalm 39:1: "I will keep my mouth as with a 
    bridle." But we are especially to look to our <b>hearts</b>. "Keep your 
    heart with all keeping." </p>
<p align="justify">The heart, like <i>Dinah </i>in the Old Testament, will 
    be gadding abroad; and it seldom returns home without being defiled. 
    Christian, your chief work lies with your heart: "Keep your heart." When any 
    danger is near, the serpent keeps his <i>head </i>safe, and to preserve his 
    head will expose his whole body to injury. So a wise Christian should 
    especially keep his heart; he should jeopardize his skin to keep a wound 
    from his heart.</p>
<p align="justify">To amplify this, I will:<br/>
    show that the heart must be kept with all kinds of keeping, <br/>
    show that it must be kept at all times, <br/>
    and then give the reasons that enforce this idea.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The DUTY:<i> "keep your heart." </i></p></b></font>The 
    heart must be kept with all kinds of keeping.
<p align="justify">Keep your heart as you would keep a <font color="#008000">
<b>TEMPLE</b></font>. The temple was a <i>hallowed </i>place, set apart for 
    God's worship. Just so, the heart is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16). 
    This heart-temple must be kept <i>pure </i>and <i>holy</i>—no filth may lie 
    here; sweep the dust out of the temple. The vessels of the temple were <i>
    cleansed </i>(2 Chronicles 29:15). Thus the memory, affections, and 
    conscience, these temple vessels, must be cleansed (2 Corinthians 7:1). 
    Christ whipped the buyers and sellers out of the temple in John 2. The <i>
    cares of the world </i>will be crowding into the heart. Now you must get a 
    whip made of the <i>threatenings of the law, </i>and drive these 
    money-changers out of the temple of your heart. Do not let God's temple be 
    turned into a worldly market. </p>
<p align="justify">The temple had a <i>fire </i>burning on the altar; take 
    heed of strange fire. But keep the fire of zeal and devotion flaming upon 
    the altar of your heart; do <i>temple work </i>and offer up <i>the sacrifice 
    of a broken heart</i>. When the heart is a consecrated place, a holy of 
    holies, then God will walk there. Many a man's heart is a pest-house, a 
    bedlam, being polluted with sin. This is to put <i>swine </i>into God's 
    temple! This is to let the <i>devil </i>come into God's temple! David's 
    heart was a dedicated temple (Psalm 119:38).</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your heart as you would keep a <font color="#008000">
<b>TREASURE</b></font>. A man who has a great treasure of money and jewels, 
    will keep it with lock and bolt so that it is not stolen. Christian, you 
    carry a precious treasure with you, even all that you are worth—a heart! The
    <i>devil </i>and the <i>world </i>would rob you of this jewel. Oh, keep your 
    heart as you would keep your life. If you are robbed of this treasure—you 
    are ruined. </p>
<p align="justify">Few know the <i>value </i>of their hearts. A farmer can 
    set a price on his grain—but not on jewels. Men do not know the worth of 
    that treasure they carry around with them; therefore they prefer other 
    things. Keep your heart like a treasure.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your heart as you would keep a <font color="#008000">
<b>GARDEN</b></font>. Your heart is a garden (Song of Solomon 4:12); weed 
    all <i>sin </i>out of your heart. Among the flowers of the heart, weeds will 
    be growing—the weeds of pride, malice, and covetousness: these grow without 
    planting and cultivating. Therefore be weeding your heart daily by prayer, 
    examination, and repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">Weeds hinder the herbs and flowers from growing; the 
    weeds of corruption—hinder the growth of grace. Where the <i>weed of 
    unbelief </i>grows—it hinders the <i>flower of faith </i>from growing.</p>
<p align="justify">Weeds spoil the walkways. Christ will not walk in a heart 
    overgrown with weeds and briars. Christ was sometimes among the <i>lilies
    </i>(Song of Solomon 6:3)—but never among the <i>thistles</i>. Poor sinner, 
    you complain that you have no communion with God. There was a time when God 
    made Himself known to you—but now He has grown unfamiliar, and never comes 
    near you. This is the reason: Sin has spoiled Christ's walks. Your heart 
    lies like the field of the sluggard (Proverbs 20:4). And will Christ walk 
    there? Indeed, we read that Christ was once in the <i>wilderness </i>when He 
    was tempted (Matthew 4:1)—but He did not go there for delight—but so that he 
    might duel and skirmish with Satan. It is the <i>garden, </i>which Christ 
    delights in. Oh, weed your heart daily; do not let it become a <i>thicket 
    for Satan!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Keep your heart as you would keep a <font color="#008000">
<b>GARRISON</b></font>. The heart of man is a garrison or a royal fortress. 
    This garrison is besieged; the devil shoots his fiery darts of temptation. 
    So keep your heart as a tower or a castle.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Keep a close sentinel on your heart.</p></b> Habakkuk 2:1: "I 
    will stand upon my watch, and set upon the tower." Discover where Satan 
    labors to make a breach—what <i>grace </i>he most shoots at—and there set a 
    double guard and fortify that spot.
<b>
<p align="justify">Make use of all your spiritual ammunition: meditation and 
    prayer.</p></b> Prayer is the great ordinance; discharge this cannon, and be 
    sure to put the <i>bullet of faith </i>in it (Matthew 21:22; 1 Peter 5:9). 
    If the devil takes the garrison by storm, it will be sad. Remember how he 
    tore and tormented that man in whom he was (Matthew 9:18)? It is easier to 
    let Satan <i>in—</i>than it is to get him <i>out! </i>If the devil gets the 
    garrison of your heart, you are his slave; and remember, he gives no 
    quarter.
<p align="justify">Keep your heart as you would a <font color="#008000"><b>
    PRISONER</b></font>. The heart is guilty, and is ready every now and then to 
    break prison. We need to lay bolts and fetters upon it! A prisoner in the 
    jail may promise that he will not stir—but when he sees an opportunity, if 
    you do not watch him, he will file off his fetters and be gone! So the heart 
    promises that it will keep from such sins—but if you are not careful it, 
    will steal out to vanity. Therefore, keep your heart as a prisoner! When you 
    perceive it breaking loose, lay chains and fetters upon it; bind it fast 
    with the <i>terrors of the law</i>; keep it with the <i>flaming sword of a 
    reproof</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">As John the Baptist said to Herod in Mark 6:18, "It is 
    not lawful for you to have your brother's wife!" So say to your heart, "It 
    is not lawful for you to meddle with forbidden fruit! You may not be proud, 
    vain, or worldly!" Lay the commands of God upon your heart. A man may be too 
    jealous of his <i>friend</i>—but he cannot be too jealous of his <i>heart</i>. 
    Let it be kept as a prisoner—closely under guard.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your heart as you would keep a <font color="#008000">
<b>WATCH</b></font>. The heart will unwind to the world; therefore <i>wind 
    it up </i>every morning and evening by prayer. The motion of a watch is not 
    constant: sometimes it goes fast, sometimes slower. And so it is with the 
    heart: sometimes it goes faster in vanity and sometimes it goes slower in 
    duty. Therefore set this spiritual watch by the <i>sundial of the Word.<br/>
 </i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. The MANNER: <i>"with all diligence."</i></p></b></font><i>
</i>The heart must be kept at all times!
<p align="justify">Keep your heart when you are <font color="#008000"><b>
    ALONE</b></font>. It was Satan's subtlety to set upon Eve, when she was 
    alone and less able to resist. He is like a cunning suitor who woos the 
    daughter, when her parents are away from home. The devil breaks through the 
    hedge commonly, where it is weakest. I confess that privacy and retirement 
    is good; if a Christian had a fruitful heart, what sweet thoughts he might 
    have of God when he is alone! (Psalm 139:17) But, alas, by reason of innate 
    corruption, how many vain, proud, impure thoughts will steal into our hearts 
    when we are most secluded from the world! The <i>fowls </i>will be eating at 
    the sacrifice; the <i>devil </i>will he shooting in his <i>fireballs </i>
    and, when we least suspect him, will be tempting us to deliver up the castle 
    of our heart to him.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your heart when you are in <font color="#008000"><b>
    COMPANY</b></font>. Vain company is the bait by which Satan is angling for 
    the heart. Under the Law, he who touched a <i>dead body </i>was unclean 
    (Numbers 5:2). The heart is apt to be defiled by being among those who are 
    dead in sin; it is easy to catch a disease when in <i>company</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, in the state of <i>innocence</i>, the heart might 
    be compared to those plants of paradise which Athanasius said impart an 
    aromatic, sweet savor to the adjoining trees; but, since the <i>fall</i>, 
    our hearts are ready to pollute and infect one another, being like that 
    withered vine the poet speaks of, which took away the fresh color and sap 
    from a neighboring vine. A good eye, by looking at a watery eye, many times 
    falls to watering itself. Just so, often a good heart, by beholding and 
    conversing with a profane one, gathers corruption. If you mingle bright and 
    rusty metal together, the rusty metal will not be made bright—but the bright 
    will become rusty. So an evil companion who is rusted with sin, will always 
    rub some of his unholy rust upon a man who is bright with grace.</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, look to your hearts even in good company. 
    Those who may, like Abijah, have some good thing in them (1 Kings 14:13)—yet 
    find that good thing to be very small, like a <i>pearl </i>in a heap of 
    stones; or like filings of <i>gold </i>among the dirt. There may be much 
    levity of discourse among those who are good, and even if there is no <i>
    filth </i>or <i>scum</i>—yet <i>froth </i>may boil up. These are the most <i>
    dangerous</i>, because they are the least <i>suspicious</i>. Who would 
    suspect the <i>plague, </i>in perfumed linen? Though the lungs are sound, 
    the breath may not be sweet. Such as we hope have sound hearts, yet may lack 
    some grains of solidity, and are not as sweet and heavenly in their 
    speeches, as they should be (Colossians 4:6). </p>
<p align="justify">The devil does harm by a <i>good </i>instrument 
    sometimes, which he cannot do by a bad one; he hands over a temptation by 
    such: he tempted Christ by an apostle. The devil once crept into a serpent, 
    and here he crept into a dove; but Christ spied his cloven hoof. "Get behind 
    Me, Satan!" (Matthew 16:23). How watchful, then, we need to be in company!</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your heart especially after good
    <font color="#008000"><b>DUTIES</b></font>. When Christ had been praying and 
    fasting, then the devil came and tempted Him (Matthew 4:2-3). When we have 
    been most enlarged in our services, then Satan will tempt us to pride and 
    carnal security. Many Christian's hearts, like bows, stand unbent after <i>
    shootings</i>; they are apt to grow more remiss, as if duty were a 
    sufficient spell and antidote against temptation. Do we not know that Satan 
    always lies waiting to temp? He is more angry with us after duty; those 
    prayers which appease God—incense Satan, and if we lay down our weapons, he 
    will attack us and wound us!</p>
<p align="justify">After David's victory over the Assyrians, he grew 
    lustful, and defiled Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11:4). After we have gotten a 
    victory over Satan in duty, then let us fear, lest our hearts give us the 
    slip. When God had driven Adam out of the garden, He placed a flaming sword 
    at the east of it, to guard the Tree of Life (Genesis 3). When we have cast 
    out the devil by prayer and fasting, let us set a strong guard about our 
    hearts to keep them, so that the enemy does not make a re-entry.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your heart in times of <font color="#008000"><b>
    ADVERSITY</b></font>. The devil makes use of all <i>winds</i>, to toss the 
    soul and make it suffer shipwreck. Adversity has its temptations; many souls 
    have been cast away in a <i>storm</i>. In adversity the devil tempts to 
    unbelief and desperation. Job 2:9: "Do you still retain your integrity?" 
    Satan used Job's wife as a ladder by which he would have scaled the 
    impregnable tower of Job's faith. "Do you still retain your integrity?" was 
    a cutting kind of speech, as if the devil had said, "God has pulled down 
    your hedge. He has smitten you in your children. And are you so senseless as 
    to still serve and worship God? What have you gotten by His service? Where 
    are your earnings? What have you to show but your boils? Throw off religion. 
    Curse God and die!" </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Satan's medicines </p></i>are always poisons. Malachi 3:14: 
    "You have said it is vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have 
    kept His ordinances?" They have mourned and fasted and almost fasted away 
    all they had. When a man's estate is low and his spirit is troubled, then 
    Satan begins to throw in his <i>hooks </i>of temptation. And oftentimes 
    Satan makes use of poverty to put a man upon indirect courses. Agur feared 
    for his heart in poverty (Proverbs 30:8-9). Oh, keep your heart in 
    adversity; beware of taking the forbidden fruit!
<p align="justify">Keep your heart in time of <font color="#008000"><b>
    PROSPERITY</b></font>. The <i>fuller </i>the moon is, the more <i>remote </i>
    it is from the sun; and oftentimes the more full a man is of the <i>world</i>, 
    the further his heart is from God. Deuteronomy 32:15: "Jesurun waxed fat—and 
    kicked." It is hard to abound in prosperity—and not abound in sin. A <i>full 
    cup </i>is hard to carry, without spilling. The trees are never more in 
    danger of the wind, than when they <i>blossom</i>. Pride, idleness, and 
    luxury, are the three daughters which are bred by prosperity. Samson fell 
    asleep in Delilah's lap; millions have slept their way to hell, in the lap 
    of prosperity. Agur prayed, "Give me not riches" (Proverbs 30:8). He knew 
    his heart would  run wild into sin. <i>The world's golden apple, </i>bewitches. 
    When God sets a <i>hedge of prosperity </i>around us, we need to set a hedge 
    of caution and circumspection.<br/>
 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. The REASON: "for out of it are the issues of life."</p></b></font> 
    The reasons for keeping the heart are these:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The heart is a <i>slippery </i>substance—it is <i>
    deceitful</i>.</p></b></font> Jeremiah 17:9: "The heart is deceitful above all 
    things." In the Hebrew it is "the heart is a <i>Jacob </i>above all things," 
    a <i>supplanter</i>. If we are not very cautious and watchful, our hearts 
    will cheat us. There is deceit in money, in friends, and in books; but the 
    heart has an art of deceiving beyond all these! "The heart is a desperate 
    impostor," said Augustine. The way of the heart, is like a <i>serpent </i>
    upon a rock. Oh, the pleats and folds, the subtleties and labyrinths of a 
    self-deceiving heart! Let us trace a little, the heart in its fallacies and 
    strategies, and see if there is not reason to keep a sentinel continually, 
    and to set a strong guard around it. The heart will deceive us about <i>
    sinful </i>things, <i>lawful </i>things, and <i>religious </i>things.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First, the heart will deceive us about SINFUL things. </p></b>
</font>The heart will tell us that sin is but small—and, being small, it is 
    venial. The heart will apologize for sin, masking bad transactions over with
    <i>golden </i>pretenses. The heart will tell a man that he may keep his <i>
    sin</i>—and yet keep his <i>religion </i>too. 2 Kings 17:33: "They feared 
    the Lord—<i>and</i> served their idols." The heart will secretly suggest to 
    a man that, as long as he goes to church and gives alms, he may secretly 
    indulge corruption, as if religious duties gave a man a right and license to 
    sin.
<p align="justify">The heart will even quote Scripture to justify sin! 1 
    Corinthians 9:20, 22: "To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the 
    Jews. I am made all things to all men." The heart will bring this text out 
    for sinful compliance. Oh, subtle and deceitful heart, which can find a 
    Scripture to damn yourself with! Though Paul would conform to others in 
    things which were indifferent in order that he might save their souls—yet he 
    would not violate a law or deny an article of his creed, to gratify them. 
    And if the heart is so treacherous (being always more ready to <i>excuse </i>
    sin than <i>examine </i>it), what care and circumspection should we use in 
    keeping our hearts, so that they do not decoy us into sin before we are 
    aware of it!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, the heart will deceive us about LAWFUL things</p></b></font> 
    in two cases. The heart will tell us that it is lawful to endeavor to 
    preserve our reputation. A good name is a precious ointment—but under a 
    pretense of preserving our good name, the heart is ready to tempt a man to 
    self-seeking and make him do all to get such a name. John 12:43: "They loved 
    the praise of men, more than the praise of God."
<p align="justify">The heart will tell us that it is lawful to take comfort 
    in estate and relations (Deuteronomy 26:11). But the heart will be ready 
    here to <i>overshoot</i>. How often the wife and child are put in God's 
    place. The full stream of the affections runs out to the <i>creature—</i>and 
    scarcely a drop of love is left for Christ! This is the deceit of the 
    heart—it makes us offend in lawful things. More are killed with <i>wine, </i>
    than <i>poison</i>; they are afraid of poison—but take wine in excess. Gross 
    sins frighten—but how many go to excess in lawful things? When we overdo, we 
    undo.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, the heart will deceive us about RELIGIOUS 
    things—our duties and graces.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">With regard to our <b>duties</b>, the heart will tell us 
    that it is enough to come to the Word and the Sacrament, though the <i>
    affections </i>are not at all wrought upon. This is like the salamander, 
    which lives in the fire—but (as naturalists say) is never the hotter. Will 
    it be any plea at God's bar—to tell the Lord how many sermons you have 
    heard? Surely it will be like bringing Uriah's letter: it will be evidence 
    against you! How treacherous the heart is—to plot its own death—and bring a 
    man to hell by way of duty!</p>
<p align="justify">With regard to our <b>graces</b>, the heart is like a <i>
    flattering mirror </i>which will make a hypocrite look good. The foolish 
    virgins thought they had <i>oil</i>; many strongly think that they have <i>
    grace, </i>when they have none. The hypocrite's knowledge is no better than 
    ignorance (1 John 2:4). He has <i>illumination</i>—but not <i>assimilation</i>; 
    he has not been made like Christ. He 'believes'—but his heart is not 
    purified. He pretends to trust God in greater matters—but dares not trust 
    Him in lesser ones. He will trust God with his soul—but not with his estate.</p>
<p align="justify">Well, if the heart is this deceitful, see what need we 
    have to keep the heart with all diligence! Do with the heart as you would do 
    with a cheater. We will trust a cheater no further than we can see him. The 
    heart is a grand cheater; it will supplant and delude; test it—but do not 
    trust it. Proverbs 28:26: "He who trusts in his own heart is a fool!"</p>
<p align="justify">We must keep the heart with watch and ward, because it is 
    not only <i>false</i>—but <i>fickle!</i> God complains of Israel that their 
    goodness was as the early dew (Hosea 6:4). The sun rises and the dew 
    vanishes. The heart sometimes seems to be in a good frame—but it soon 
    alters. The heart is changeable like water. Set water on a fire and it 
    boils; set it in the frigid air and it freezes. Those good affections which 
    boil in the church—often freeze in the shop. One day a Christian is quick 
    and lively in prayer, another day he is like the disciples, heavy and 
    sleeping (Luke 22:45).</p>
<p align="justify">At one time a Christian is like David, when he danced 
    before the ark with all his might (2 Samuel 6:14); at another time he is 
    like Samson when his hair was shaved and his strength left him (Judges 
    16:19). When the <i>gold </i>has been made pure in the fire, it remains 
    pure; but it is not so with the heart. When the heart has been purified in 
    an ordinance, it does not remain pure—but soon gathers new dirt and dross. 
    The heart is humble one day—and proud the next; it is meek one day—and angry 
    the next; it is quick in its motions towards heaven one day—and the next 
    day, the affections are worldly. It is with the heart as with a sick man's 
    pulse, which alters by the moment. Since the heart is so full of variation 
    and inconstancy, it is needful to keep the heart with all keeping. Like a 
    violin, the heart will soon be out of order; therefore we must often keep 
    the instrument in tune, so that we may make melody in our heart to the Lord 
    (Ephesians 5:19).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The heart must especially be looked to and watched 
    over, because the heart is the fountain of all our actions and purposes.</p></b></font>
<i>The heart either sweetens or poisons all that we do!</i> The heart is the 
    spring which makes the current of our life, run either pure or muddy; the 
    heart is the throne of either sin or grace. If the <i>root </i>is sour, no 
    sweet <i>fruit </i>can grow upon it—for if there is a root of bitterness 
    springing up in the heart, it is impossible that our services should give a 
    sweet relish!
<p align="justify">In the natural body, the heart is the fountain of life; 
    if the heart lives, the whole body lives; if the heart is diseased and 
    poisoned, the body dies. So it is in a spiritual sense: if the inner man of 
    the heart is holy, then the thoughts and actions are holy. But if the soul 
    is earthly and impure, the actions receive a bad tincture. In religion, the 
    heart is everything. <i>We </i>judge men's hearts by their actions. <i>God
    </i>judges men's actions by their hearts. The heart distinguishes actions. 2 
    Chronicles 25:2: "Amaziah did that which was right in the sight of the 
    Lord—but not with a perfect heart." But of Asa it is said, "His heart was 
    perfect all his days" (2 Chronicles 15:17). It is the heart which gives the 
    meaning to a thing. Now if the heart is the spring which makes our actions 
    good or bad—then the heart is chiefly to be watched over and tended. Keep 
    the <i>spring </i>pure; "keep your heart with all diligence."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="center">APPLICATION</p>
</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. INFORMATION. </p></b></font>This shows the difference 
    between the godly and the wicked. The hypocrite looks most to <i>externals</i>. 
    He keeps his external actions from blotting; he sets a watch before his 
    lips. But the godly man sets a watch before his <i>heart</i>—his main work 
    lies within doors; he sees the first risings of sin and grieves for them; he 
    labors to set his heart right. The heart is the altar that sanctifies the 
    gift.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. REPROOF.</p></b></font> If we are to keep our hearts with 
    all keeping, then this <i>reproves </i>four kinds of people.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First it reproves such as have no care at all about their 
    hearts.</p></b></font> They will have a care to keep their <i>land </i>so that 
    it is not mortgaged—but no care to keep their hearts! Salvation and 
    blessedness depend upon keeping the heart—yet how few mind their hearts; 
    they let the devil get into them! The <i>shepherd </i>keeps his flock; the
    <i>physician </i>keeps his prescriptions; the <i>lawyer </i>keeps his 
    evidence; the <i>merchant </i>keeps his wares, and the <i>covetous </i>man 
    keeps his gold—but few keep their hearts!
<b><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">QUESTION. Why do men not keep their hearts?</p>
</font>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. Men do not keep their hearts, because they do 
    not study the preciousness of them.</p></b> What a treasure is the heart! It is 
    divinely ennobled; it is capable of glory—but few know the worth of this 
    jewel!
<b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Men do not keep their hearts, because they are 
    taken up with keeping other things.</p></b> Song of Solomon 1:6: "My own 
    vineyard have I not kept." Many a man may say, "I have been encumbered with 
    the <i>world</i>. I have been keeping my <i>estate </i>and tending my <i>
    lusts</i>; but my own heart has been neglected! My own vineyard I have not 
    kept!" Judas was keeping the money bag—when he should have been keeping his 
    heart!
<b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. Men do not keep their hearts, because they keep 
    themselves in sloth. </p></b>To keep the heart requires <i>diligence</i>—and how 
    few are willing to put themselves to the trouble. But would not a merchant 
    keep his account books—even though it were difficult to do so?
<b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. Some think that their hearts are so good, that 
    they do not need to spend time keeping them.</p></b> Many a bold sinner is 
    presumptuously confident of heaven; he thinks that he needs to do nothing 
    but take possession of it. Hence he never looks into his heart or searches 
    for <i>evidence of salvation</i>, until it is too late.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Second, this reproves those who, when they should be 
    keeping their hearts, fall asleep.</p></b></font> Matthew 13:25: "While men 
    slept, the enemy came and sowed tares." When men are asleep and neglect 
    their spiritual watch, the devil comes and sows poisonous seeds in their 
    hearts—seeds of malice, pride, and lust. It is death for a soldier to fall 
    asleep while on guard.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Third, this reproves those who, instead of keeping their 
    hearts, allow them to be stolen away. </p></b></font>The love of the world has 
    stolen away men's hearts. <i>Satan catches men's hearts with golden bait!
    </i>This is the reason why preaching the Word does so little good: ministers 
    preach to men's hearts—but the world has stolen their hearts away!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Fourth, this reproves those who keep <i>half </i>of their 
    heart—but not all</p></b></font>; they have desire for some good things—but let 
    out some rooms of their heart to sin. Herod did many good things—but he let 
    out one room of his heart to the devil—he lived in immorality! The true 
    mother would not have the <i>child </i>divided, and God will not endure to 
    have the <i>heart </i>divided. He will have the <i>whole </i>heart kept for 
    Himself.<br/>
 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. EXHORTATION.</p></b></font> This exhorts Christians to 
    keep their hearts. Merchants complain of their losses at sea; but whatever 
    we lose, if we can keep our hearts, we shall do well enough. "Keep your 
    heart with all diligence." This, I confess, is a <i>hard </i>work. Elijah 
    found it easier to shut heaven by prayer—than to shut his heart from evil 
    thoughts. But this is the work every sincere Christian must set himself 
    upon—keeping his heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But if my heart is evil, must I keep the evil 
    in it?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. No, cast away the evil of it—and keep that which 
    is good. When we preserve fruit—we pare off the <i>skin</i>, cut out the <i>
    core</i>, and preserve that which is best. Do the same with your heart: what 
    is evil in it cast away—what is good preserve. If your heart is <i>hard</i>, 
    cast away the <i>stone </i>and keep it soft. If your heart is <i>
    hypocritical</i>, cut out the rotten part and keep that which is sound. 
    Separate between the <i>precious </i>and the <i>vile</i>. Throw the <i>sin
    </i>in your heart away; keep and nourish the <i>grace</i>. In a word, do 
    with your heart as they did with the fish in the parable in Matthew 13:48: 
    "They gathered the good fish into vessels—but cast the bad fish away."</p>
<p align="justify">This is the great Christian duty: heart-keeping. Sinners, 
    look to your hearts; do not let your hearts be bewitched and stolen away 
    with the pleasures of the world! Hosea 4:11: "Whoredom and wine take away 
    the heart." Many have drowned their hearts in wine! Clement Alexandrius 
    reports that there is a certain fish that is different from other fish, 
    because it has its <i>heart </i>in its <i>belly</i>. Worldlings are like the 
    Epicureans: they have their heart in their belly.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What is the holy frame and posture in which I 
    should keep my heart?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. Keep your heart <font color="#b07050"><b>AWAKE</b></font>. 
    Song of Solomon 5:2: "My heart awakes!" Psalm 108:2: "I will awaken early." 
    Though we have been sluggish—yet now it is high time to awake out of our 
    sleep! Take heed of sleeping in ignorance, impenitence, and carnal security; 
    the heart is naturally asleep, and sin may be compared to sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">A man who is asleep has his senses tied up. Just so, a 
    sinner whose heart is asleep in sin has his spiritual senses tied up. He is 
    not sensible of <i>sin </i>or <i>wrath </i>(Ephesians 4:9). He is going to 
    hell—but does not know it; he sleeps himself into hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Though the senses are bound fast in sleep—yet the 
    imagination is let loose, and the man dreams he is at a banquet. So when the 
    heart of a sinner is asleep in sin—yet his fancy is still quickened. He 
    imagines that he is an heir of the promise, that God loves him.</p>
<p align="justify">Sleep hinders from action. He who is asleep cannot work. 
    So a sinner who has fallen asleep in sin, cannot work out his salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">A man who is asleep is in danger of being robbed; his 
    money or jewels may be taken away. So while the sinner is asleep, he may be 
    robbed of his precious soul. Oh, therefore keep your heart awake; let the 
    judgment of God on sinners be as a drum to awaken you! Make David's prayer 
    from Psalm 13:3 your own: "Enlighten my eyes, that I sleep not the sleep of 
    death."</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. Keep your heart <font color="#b07050"><b>
    JEALOUS</b></font>. Towards others exercise <i>charity</i>; towards yourself 
    exercise <i>jealousy</i>. The better the heart is, the more <i>suspicious
    </i>it is. Satan has a party within us; the heart is not true to itself, 
    therefore it needs guarding and caution. Little did Hazael know what was in 
    his heart (2 Kings 8:13). Had one come to Noah and said, "Noah, you will be 
    drunk shortly!" he would have sternly defied him. <i>There is the seed of 
    all sin—in every person's heart!</i> Where will the heart not run—if we do 
    not guard it? It will run to idolatry, atheism, and immorality! Be ever 
    jealous. Jealousy breeds vigilance, and vigilance breeds safety. Let your <i>
    heart </i>be ever in your <i>eye!</i> Keep it in with the curb and bit of 
    mortification!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. Keep your heart <font color="#b07050"><b>
    SERIOUS</b></font>. Take heed of a <b>light </b>heart. Zephaniah 3:11: "His 
    prophets are light." The heart of the wicked is vain, and in this sense is 
    said to be worth little (Proverbs 10:20). If you put a feather on the scale, 
    it weighs nothing; just so "feathery" is the heart of a sinner. Vanity swims 
    on the top—and deceit lies at the bottom of a sinner's heart! Christ said of 
    the sparrows, "Are not <i>two </i>of them sold for a farthing?" (Matthew 
    10:29). <i>Thousands </i>of the sinner's thoughts, are not worth a farthing! 
    A light heart is like a ship without a ballast—it soon overturns. </p>
<p align="justify">A vain heart will be <b>unstable</b>. Light things are 
    blown in every which way. A flashy professor is not broken for sin; sin 
    seldom lies heavy on a light heart. Keep the heart serious; fix it upon God. 
    Psalm 57:7: "O God, my heart is fixed." Grace solidifies the heart, and 
    keeps it from floating in levity. Balance your heart with the thoughts of 
    hell and judgment!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. Keep your heart <font color="#b07050"><b>HUMBLE
    </b></font>(1 Peter 5:5). That is the best frame of heart, which fits a man 
    for God's presence. The humble heart is the <i>valley </i>where God delights 
    to walk. The humble heart is the house where He will take up residence. The 
    humble heart has a low esteem of itself—and a high esteem of others 
    (Philippians 4:3). The more humble the heart is—the more fertile in grace it 
    is; those meadows which lie <i>low </i>are the richest grounds. Keep your 
    heart humble; view your own deficiencies—and others abilities. The <i>
    abscess of pride </i>kills. The eagle lifts up the tortoise into the air—and 
    then throws it down upon a rock and breaks it. Just so, the devil lifts the 
    heart up in pride—and so destroys it!</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 5. Keep your heart <font color="#b07050"><b>
    HEAVENLY</b></font>. Colossians 3:1-2: "Seek those things which are above." 
    Keep your heart down with the weight of humility—yet mount it up with the 
    wing of heavenly-mindedness. When the heart is touched with the influence of 
    the Spirit, it ascends. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus you have seen the holy frame and posture, the heart 
    is to be kept in.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What MEANS are to be used to keep the heart?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. If you would keep your heart, keep the WORD in 
    your heart.</p></b></font> Psalm 119:11: "Your Word have I hid in my heart—that 
    I might not sin against You." The Word is a <i>preservative </i>and <i>
    antidote—</i>to keep the heart from spiritual infection. What are all the 
    golden precepts of the Word of God—but various prescriptions for keeping the 
    heart? If a mariner would keep his ship, he must have his eye on the stars 
    and the compass; the best way to keep our heart is to sail by a <i>Scripture
    </i>compass.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. If you would keep your heart, have a care what 
    COMPANY you keep</p></b></font>; incorporate yourselves into the society of the 
    saints. When the people of God are together, they heat and quicken one 
    another; their counsels are seasonable and their prayers are helpful. That 
    ship is most likely to be preserved from pirates—which goes with a <i>convoy</i>. 
    Christian, would you keep your heart safe on your voyage to heaven? Then let 
    the fellowship of saints be your convoy; take heed of coming near such as 
    are impious; they are <i>infectious </i>and will poison your heart! Let your 
    delight be in those who excel in virtue (Psalm 16:3). The saints carry the 
    lantern of the Word along with them, and it is good to walk with those who 
    carry a light.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 3. If you would keep your heart, watch over your 
    PASSIONS.</p></b></font> The heart is ready to be destroyed by its own passion, 
    just as a ship is ready to be overturned by its sail. The heart sometimes 
    sinks in <i>sorrow</i>, swells with <i>anger</i>, and abounds excessively 
    with <i>carnal joy. </i>Diagoras, seeing his three sons crowned conquerors 
    in one day, died for joy. Passion transports beyond the bounds of reason; it 
    is a kind of <i>temporary madness </i>which possesses a person. Lay the <i>
    bit of restraint </i>upon your passions—or your heart will run wild in sin; 
    take heed of inflaming your spirits. Cut off all occasions that may awaken 
    this <i>fury</i>. Take away the <i>fuel </i>which feeds this <i>fire!</i> 
    When this <i>viper of passion </i>begins to gather heat, pray it down. 
    Luther said that prayer takes down the swelling of the soul—and abates the 
    heat of inordinate affections. How dangerous these fiery passions are! In a 
    passion, Moses spoke unadvisedly with his lips (Psalm 106:33). A man in a 
    rage is like a ship in a tempest—which has neither pilot, sails, or oars to 
    help—but is exposed to the waves and the rocks. How many have lost their 
    souls in such a storm!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 4. If you would keep your heart, keep all the 
    passages to your heart. </p></b></font>He who would keep a <i>city</i>, keeps 
    the <i>forts </i>and <i>outworks</i>. Especially keep the two portals of the 
    heart safe, the eye and the ear.
<p align="justify">Keep your <font color="#b07050"><b>EYE</b></font>. The 
    eye often sets the heart on fire. Job made a covenant with his eyes in Job 
    31:1. The serpent sometimes creeps into the house, through a <i>window</i>. 
    That old serpent the devil, creeps into the heart—through the window of the 
    eye! The eye is the tempter for the appetite. First Eve <i>saw </i>the tree 
    was good for food, then she <i>took </i>of the fruit! (Genesis 3:6). Look to 
    your eyes! Some of the heathens have pulled out their eyes, because they did 
    not want to be enticed by impure objects. I say do not pull out the 
    eye—but keep the <i>portal </i>shut! The Romans never let their prisoners go 
    abroad, without their <i>guards </i>going with them. Just so, never send 
    your eyes abroad, without sending their <i>guards </i>with them.</p>
<p align="justify">Keep your <font color="#b07050"><b>EAR</b></font>. Much 
    sin is conveyed to the heart through the ear. The apostle calls it <i>
    corrupt communication </i>in Ephesians 4:29 because impure discourse 
    corrupts and poisons the heart. Keep your ear open to God—and shut out sin! 
    Deafen your ears to the lies of the slanderer and the heretic. Do not let 
    him have your ear—who comes to rob you of your heart!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 5. If you would keep your heart, get CHRIST into 
    your heart.</p></b></font> Ephesians 3:17: "That Christ may dwell in your 
    heart." Nothing can truly hurt us—but sin. If Christ is in the heart, He 
    will <b>purify </b>it. His Spirit is the refiner's fire spoken of in Malachi 
    3:2. If Christ is in the heart, He will <b>adorn </b>it. He will bring in 
    the rich furniture of His graces, and so beautify the hidden man of the 
    heart. If Christ is in the heart, He will <b>defend </b>it; the castle of 
    the heart can never be captured, if Christ is in it. Let Satan dig his 
    mines, lay his snares and traps, and shoot his fire-balls of temptation—yet 
    if the Lord Almighty pitches His tent in the heart, it can never be taken by 
    storm!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 6. If you would keep your hearts, be careful to 
    keep your THOUGHTS. </p></b></font>Jeremiah 4:14: "How long shall <i>vain 
    thoughts </i>lodge within you?" What will it matter—if you set a guard 
    before the door of the lips—if you let your heart run out in vain, impure 
    thoughts? The heart is the presence chamber which is to be kept for God; 
    vain thoughts defile the room and make it unfit for God to come into. The <i>
    thoughts </i>make way for <i>sin</i>. While the mind is musing, the heart 
    burns. David let his heart rove into impure thoughts—and that made way for 
    the act of adultery (2 Samuel 11:4). Thoughts are <i>scouts for sin</i>; 
    they first start looking for sin—and then the heart hunts it!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 7. If you would keep your heart, keep your close 
    ACCOUNTS.</p></b></font> Bring your heart often to trial; put searchings 
    questions to your heart: "O my heart, what are you doing? Where are you 
    going?" See what work lies undone, what sin you have to bewail, what grace 
    to strengthen; search your evidences for heaven, and examine your title to 
    Christ (2 Corinthians 13:5). Carefully scrutinize your soul; see if there is 
    any sin nourished there; search your heart—as Israel did for leaven; keep a 
    diary in your heart; see how things go with your soul; do not be a stranger
    <i>at home</i>. For lack of this parlaying with the heart, many are kept in 
    the dark and do not understand the true state of their souls. They live 
    known to others—but die unknown to themselves!
<p align="justify">Oh, what wisdom it is, for a Christian to be much 
    acquainted with his own heart. He who would keep his estate, must keep his 
    account books well. Christian, redeem time every day to turn over the book 
    of conscience; examine your own heart. It will be stealing out to sin; call 
    it to account often. Every night when Seneca's candle was out, he would ask 
    himself what he had done that day. Frequent reckonings keep God and the 
    conscience friends.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 8. If you would keep your heart, set FENCES around 
    your heart. </p></b></font>Those who would keep fruit or flowers, fence them in. 
    There are <b>four fences </b>which we should set around our hearts to keep 
    them:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The FEAR of God.</p></b></font> Proverbs 23:17: "Be in the 
    fear of the Lord all the day long." As natural fear guards and preserves 
    the body—so the fear of God preserves the heart. Fear puts a holy awe upon 
    the soul and keeps it from sinful excursions; fear bolts the door of the 
    heart against vanity. Proverbs 16:6: "By the fear of the Lord men depart 
    from evil." As a nobleman's porter stands at the gate to keep out everything 
    that is harmful from being brought into the house—so the fear of God stands 
    as an armed man at the gate of the heart, to keep temptations from entering. 
    Fear lies as a sentinel; it stands as a watchman on the tower and looks 
    every way to see what danger is approaching. The fear of God will not admit 
    anything into the soul, which is dishonorable to God.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. LOVE to God. </p></b></font>This is the most forcible 
    argument to prevail with a sincere spirit. Love without fear, makes us 
    presume. And fear without love, makes us despair. Love argues like this: 
    "Has God given me Christ? Has He included me in the promises? Has He settled 
    heaven upon me? And shall I walk unworthy of this love? Shall I voluntarily 
    sin against this God? No! I will rather die than sin!" This made Anselm say, 
    "Let me rather fall into hell—than into sin!" Would you keep your heart? 
    Then surround it with love! Even death cannot break this fence!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. FAITH in God.</p></b></font> This is called a <i>shield
    </i>in Ephesians 6:16. The shield guards the head and the vital parts; this 
    blessed shield of faith preserves the heart from danger. The shield defends 
    all the armor, the helmet and the breastplate. The shield of faith defends 
    the other graces: the breastplate of love, the helmet of hope, and the belt 
    of truth. When Satan strikes at a Christian's heart—faith beats back the 
    blow and wounds the head of the old serpent! 1 Peter 5:9: "Whom resist 
    steadfast in faith." Faith is the best safeguard; faith brings in peace. 
    Romans 15:13: "Peace in believing." And peace fortifies the heart. 
    Philippians 4:7: "The peace of God shall keep your heart."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. A good CONSCIENCE before God.</p></b></font> The heart is 
    placed in the midst of the body and, as it is strongly secured with ribs 
    around it, so it has a bulwark around it in which it is kept. To the ribs 
    around the heart which fence it in—I may compare the graces; to the bulwark 
    in which the heart is kept—I may compare a good conscience. This keeps the 
    heart, so that nothing can annoy it. A good conscience is a brazen wall around 
    the castle of the heart.
<p align="justify">These are the fences which keep the heart.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 9. If you would keep your heart, beseech God to 
    keep it for you.</p></b></font> Do not set about this work in your own 
    strength—but look higher—go to God. He is <i>the great Lord Keeper</i>. 
    Psalm 121:5: "The Lord is your Keeper." It is good to always go with such a 
    Keeper, and this is the reason none of the saints are lost—because the Lord 
    is their Keeper. 1 Peter 1:5: "Who are kept by the power of God." Every ward

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">There are MOTIVES which may persuade us to look after the 
    keeping of our hearts:</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. If we do not keep our hearts—the devil will 
    keep them.</p></b></font> Shall we let Satan have them! When an invading army 
    gets into a town, what a horrible devastation they do: rapes, plunderings, 
    and massacres. When Satan possesses hearts, he carries them at last 
    violently into the sea of hell, as he did with the swine.
<p align="justify">Satan is both crafty and cruel. He is <b>crafty</b>: his 
    work is to fish for men's hearts, and he is very subtle. He has deceitful 
    schemes and strategies (2 Corinthians 2:11).</p>
<p align="justify">He observes the tempers of the body and soul—and lays 
    suitable baits and traps. The devil cannot know the heart—but he may observe 
    the temper and constitution of the body. He tempts a lustful man with 
    beauty, and a covetous man with gold. Satan is like the farmer who knows 
    what ground is fit for barley and what ground is fit for wheat. He has been 
    a tempter so long, that by this time he has gained experience, and has 
    become a master of his black art.</p>
<p align="justify">Satan can bait his hook with religion; he tempts to sin 
    under a pretext of piety, thus transforming himself into an angel of light. 
    He tempts some to do away with themselves so that they will not live any 
    longer to sin against God. Who would suspect Satan when he comes as a 
    theologian, and quotes Scripture? Just so cunningly does the devil angle for 
    hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">Once he has gotten his prey, he is <b>cruel</b>. His 
    cruelty exceeds the rage of all earthly tyrants. We read of Nero, who 
    covered the Christians with tar and brimstone, and then burned them all 
    night so that they might be a living torch to those who passed by. This is 
    nothing to the unparalleled barbarism and cruelty of Satan! His name is 
    Apollyon, or Devourer. He tore and tormented the man in whom he dwelt, and 
    threw him into the fire (Matthew 17:15). If Satan was so fierce when he was 
    chained, what will he do when he has full power? When he had taken away all 
    Job's estate, smitten his body full of sores, and thrown the house down upon 
    his children and killed them—yet all this was, in the devil's account—but a
    <i>touch of the finger </i>(Job 1:11). If the touch of his finger is so 
    heavy, what will the weight of his arms be? </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, then, if Satan is so <i>subtle </i>and deceitful in 
    fishing for hearts, and so <i>savage </i>and cruel when he gets men's 
    hearts, let us take care to keep our hearts. If we do not keep them, Satan 
    will keep them for us! And then see what havoc he will make!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. He who keeps his heart, keeps his peace.</p></b></font> 
    Where do our distressess and disquiets come from, but the neglect of our 
    spiritual watch? He who keeps his heart all day, may lie down in peace at 
    night. What a comfort this will be to a Christian in every condition! In a
    <i>poor </i>condition he may think: "Though I have lost my friends and 
    estate—yet I have kept my heart." In a <i>sick </i>condition he may think: 
    "I am chained to a sickbed—but it comforts me that I have kept my heart." In 
    a dying condition he may think: "Death may take away my life—but not my 
    heart."
<p align="justify">The heart is a jewel that God lays claim to—and it is 
    kept for Him!</p>
