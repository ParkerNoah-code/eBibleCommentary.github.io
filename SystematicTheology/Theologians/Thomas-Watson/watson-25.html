    Cure</font></b></p>
<p align="center">by Thomas Watson</p>
<p align="center"><br/>
    "It is not the healthy who need a doctor — but the <i>sick</i>." Luke 5:31<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">The occasion of the words is set down in the context. 
    Levi was called from the receipt of taxes (he was a tax collector); but 
    Christ called him, and there went out power with the Word, such that "Levi 
    left all, rose up, and followed him" (verse 28). Levi did not consult with 
    flesh and blood; he did not say, "How shall I live and maintain my charge? I 
    shall lose many a sweet bit at the tax booth; poverty is likely to be my 
    inheritance. Nay, if I follow Christ, I must espouse persecution." He does 
    not reason thus but, having a call, he hastened away after Christ. He rose 
    up and followed him; and, that he might give Christ a pledge and specimen of 
    his love, he made him a feast. Verse 29: "And Levi made him a great feast in 
    his own house." A better guest he could not invite.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ always came with His payment. Levi feasted Christ 
    with his food — and Christ feasted him with salvation. Well, Christ being at 
    this feast, the Pharisees began to murmur. Verse 30: "Why do you eat and 
    drink with tax collectors?" The Pharisees were offended at Him that He would 
    go in and eat with tax collectors. The tax collectors were counted the worst 
    of sinners, sinners of the deepest dye; yet the Pharisees were not so much 
    offended at the sins of the tax collectors, as they had a mind to pick a 
    quarrel with Christ. He who was the <i>horn of salvation </i>to some was a
    <i>rock of offense </i>to these Jews. Others <i>fed </i>on Him; these 
    religious leaders <i>stumbled </i>at Him. They accused Christ for eating 
    with sinners; <i>malice will never lack matter of accusation. </i>Though the 
    devils proclaimed Christ's holiness (Luke 4:34: "Let us alone, I know You 
    who You are, the Holy One of God") — yet the Pharisees taxed Him for a 
    sinner. See what malice will do; it will make a man speak that which the 
    devil himself will not speak. The devils justified Christ; the Pharisees 
    accused Him. And Christ, who was a Lamb without spot, could not escape the 
    world's censures; no wonder that His people are loaded with the calumnies 
    and censures of the wicked.</p>
<p align="justify">But let us examine the matter of the charge they bring 
    against Christ, and see how groundless it was. They indicted Christ for 
    joining in with sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Christ did nothing but what was according to His 
    commission. The commission He received from His Father was that He should 
    come to save sinners (1 Timothy 1:15).</p>
<p align="justify">Second, Christ went in with sinners not to <i>join </i>
    with them in their sins — but to <i>heal </i>them of their sins. To accuse 
    Christ was, as Augustine said, as if the physician should be blamed because 
    he goes among those who are sick of the plague. This groundless accusation 
    Christ overheard, and in the text He gives these envious Pharisees a 
    silencing answer: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor — but the sick." 
    It is as if Christ had said, "You Pharisees think yourselves righteous 
    people; and that you need no Savior. But these poor tax collectors are sick 
    and ready to die, and I come as a physician to cure them. Therefore do not 
    be angry at a work of mercy; though you will not be healed — yet do not 
    hinder Me from healing others. Those who are whole do not need a physician — 
    but those who are sick do."</p>
<p align="justify">In the words there are two general parties: The <i>dying 
    patients</i> and the <i>healing Physician</i>. The dying patients are "those 
    who are sick."</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b>DOCTRINE 1: Sin is a soul 
    disease. </b></font>Isaiah 53:4: "He has borne our griefs." In the Hebrew it 
    is "our sicknesses." Man at first was created in a healthy temper; he had no 
    sickness of soul; he ailed nothing. The soul had its perfect beauty and 
    glory. The <i>eye </i>was clear, the <i>heart </i>pure, and the <i>
    affections </i>tuned with the finger of God into a most sweet harmony. "God 
    made man <i>upright</i>" (Ecclesiastes 7:29); but Adam, by eating the 
    forbidden fruit, fell sick and would have died forever — had not God found 
    out a way for his recovery. For the amplification of this doctrine, there 
    are three things to be considered:</p>
<p align="justify">In what sense sin is like sickness;<br/>
    what the diseases of the soul are; <br/>
    and that sin-sickness is the worst sickness.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">A. In what sense is <i>sin</i> likened to <i>sickness</i>?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>1. Sin may be compared to 
    sickness, for the manner of its being caught.</b></font> First, sickness is 
    caught often through carelessness. Some catch cold by leaving off clothes. 
    So when Adam grew careless of God's command and left off the garment of his 
    innocence, he caught a sickness. He could stay no longer in the garden — but 
    lay bed-ridden. His sin has turned the world, which was a <i>paradise</i>, 
    into a <i>hospital!</i></p>
<p align="justify">Sickness is caught sometimes through excess or 
    intemperance. Excess produces sickness. When our first parents ate of the 
    forbidden tree, they and all their posterity surfeited on it and took sick. 
    The tree of knowledge had sickness and death under the leaves! It was fair 
    to the eye (Genesis 3:6) but poisonous to the taste. We all grew desperately 
    sick by eating of this tree. Adam's intemperance has brought us to fasting 
    and weeping; and besides that disease at first by propagation, we have added 
    to it by actual perpetration. We have increased our sickness; therefore 
    sinners are said to wax worse and worse (2 Timothy 3:13).</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>2. Sin may be likened to 
    sickness — for its nature.</b></font> Sickness is of a <i>spreading </i>
    nature; it spreads all over the body; it works into every part — the head, 
    stomach, and so on; it disorders the whole body. Sin does not rest in one 
    part — but spreads into all the faculties of the soul and members of the 
    body. Isaiah 1:5-6: "The whole head is sick, the whole heart is faint; from 
    the sole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no soundness in it — but 
    wounds and bruises, and putrefying sores."</p>
<p align="justify">Sin corrupts the <font color="#b07050"><b>understanding</b></font>. 
    Gregory Nazianzen calls the understanding "the lamp of reason." But this 
    lamp burns dim. Ephesians 4:18: "Having their understanding <b><i>darkened</i></b>." 
    Sin has drawn a veil over the understanding; it has cast a mist before our 
    eyes so that we neither know <i>God </i>nor <i>ourselves</i>. Naturally we 
    are only wise to do evil (Jeremiah 4:22). We are witty at sin — and wise to 
    damn ourselves! The understanding is <i><b>defiled</b> </i>(1 Corinthians 
    2:14). We can no more judge spiritual objects until the Spirit of God 
    anoints our eyes — than a blind man can judge colors. Our understandings are 
    subject to <i>mistakes</i>; we call evil good — and good evil; we put bitter 
    for sweet — and sweet for bitter (Isaiah 5:20). A straight stick under water 
    seems crooked. Just so, to a natural understanding the straight line of 
    truth, seems crooked.</p>
<p align="justify">The <font color="#b07050"><b>memory </b></font>is 
    diseased. The memory at first was like a golden cabinet in which divine 
    truths were locked up safely; but now it is like a colander or leaking 
    vessel — which lets all that is good run out. The memory is like a sifter, 
    which sifts out the flour — but keeps the husks. So the memory lets saving 
    truths go — and holds nothing but froth and vanity. Many a man can remember 
    a silly story, when he has forgotten Scripture truth. Thus the memory is <i>
    diseased</i>. The memory is like a bad stomach — all the good food is 
    vomited out. So the most precious truths will not stay in the memory — but 
    are gone again.</p>
<p align="justify">The <font color="#b07050"><b>will </b></font>is diseased. 
    The will is the soul's commander-in-chief; it is the master-wheel; but how 
    irregular and disordered it is! The will in the creation was like that 
    golden bridle which Minerva was said to put upon Pegasus, to guide and rule 
    him: it answered to God's will. This was the language of the will in 
    innocence: "I delight to do Your will, O God" (Psalm 40:8). But now it is 
    distempered and disordered; it is like an iron sinew which refuses to yield 
    and bend to God. John 5:40: "You <i>will </i>not come to Me, that you may 
    have life." Wicked men would rather die, than come to their Physician. The 
    Arminians talk of <i>free </i>will — but the will is <i>sick</i>. What 
    freedom does a palsied man have to walk? The will is a rebel against God. 
    Acts 7:51: "You <i>always resist</i> the Holy Spirit" because the will is 
    diseased.</p>
<p align="justify">The <font color="#b07050"><b>affections </b></font>are 
    sick. First, the affection of <b>desire</b>: a sick man desires that which 
    is hurtful for him; he calls for wine in a fever. So the natural man, being 
    sick, desires that which is bad for him; he has no desire after Christ; he 
    does not hunger and thirst after righteousness, but desires poison. He 
    desires to take his fill of sin; he loves death (Proverbs 8:36).</p>
<p align="justify">The affection of <b>grief </b>is sick. A man grieves for 
    lack of an estate — but not for the lack of God's favor! He grieves to see 
    the plague or cancer in his body — but not for the plague of his heart!</p>
<p align="justify">The affection of <b>joy </b>is sick. Many can rejoice in 
    a wedge of gold — but not in the cross of Christ. The affections are sick 
    and distempered.</p>
<p align="justify">The <font color="#b07050"><b>conscience </b></font>is 
    diseased. Titus 1:15: "Their mind and conscience is defiled." Conscience is 
    erroneous, binding to that which is sinful (John 16:2). Acts 26:9: "I truly 
    thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of 
    Jesus." Conscience can lead out of the right way. Conscience is often <i>
    silent</i>, and will not tell men of sin; it is a silenced preacher. And 
    conscience is <i>dead </i>(Ephesians 4:19). Conscience is <i>stupefied </i>
    and <i>senseless</i>; the <i>custom </i>of sinning — has taken away the <i>
    sense</i> of sinning. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus the sickness of sin has gone over the whole soul, 
    like that cloud which overspread the face of the heavens in 1 Kings 18:45.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>3. Sickness debilitates and 
    weakens.</b></font> A sick man is unfit to walk. So this sickness of sin 
    weakens the soul. Romans 5:6: "When we were <i>without strength</i>, Christ 
    died." </p>
<p align="justify">In innocence Adam was, in some sense, like the angels: he 
    could serve God with a winged swiftness and a filial cheerfulness. But sin 
    brought sickness into the soul, and this sickness has cut the lock where his 
    strength lay; he is now disarmed of all ability for serving God. And where 
    grace is wrought, though a Christian is not so heart-sick as before — yet he 
    is very <i>faint</i>. The saints' prayers do but <i>whisper </i>in God's 
    ears, and if Christ did not pray them over again, God could not hear them. 
    We <i>sin </i>fervently — but <i>pray </i>faintly. As David said in 2 Samuel 
    3:39, "I am this day <i>weak</i>, though anointed <i>king</i>." So 
    Christians, though they have the oil of grace poured upon them, and are 
    anointed spiritual <i>kings</i> — yet they are <i>weak</i>. Sin has made 
    them feeble; they have spiritual shortness of breath, and cannot put forth 
    such strong desires after God as they ought. When we find ourselves dead in 
    duty and our holy affections languishing, we should think thus: "This is my 
    sickness; sin has made me weak!" As Jephthah said to his daughter in Judges 
    11:35, "Alas, my daughter, you have brought me very low," so may the soul 
    say, "Alas, my sin, you have brought me very low; you have brought me almost 
    to the gates of death."</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>4. Sickness eclipses the BEAUTY 
    of the body.</b></font> This I ground on Psalm 39:11: "When You with rebukes 
    do correct man, You make his beauty to consume away like a moth." The moth 
    consumes the beauty of the cloth; so a fit of sickness consumes the beauty 
    of the body. Thus sin is a soul sickness; it has eclipsed the glory and 
    splendor of the soul; it has turned ruddiness into paleness. Of that beauty 
    of grace which once sparkled as gold, it may now be said, "How this gold has 
    become dim!" (Lamentations 4:1). That soul which once had an orient 
    brightness in it, it was more ruddy than rubies; its polishing was of 
    sapphire, the <i>understanding </i>bespangled with knowledge, the <i>will
    </i>crowned with liberty, the <i>affections </i>like so many seraphim, 
    burning in love to God — but now, the glory has departed. Sin has turned 
    beauty — into deformity! </p>
<p align="justify">As some faces by sickness are so disfigured and look so 
    ghastly that they can hardly be known — so the soul of man is by sin so 
    sadly changed (having lost the image of God) that it can hardly be known. 
    Joel 2:31: "The sun shall be turned into darkness." Sin has turned that <i>
    sun of beauty </i>which shined in the soul — into a stygian darkness; and 
    where grace is begun to be wrought — yet the soul's beauty is not quite 
    recovered — but is like the sun under a cloud.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>5. Sickness takes away the 
    TASTE.</b></font> A sick man does not taste the sweetness in his food. Just 
    so, the sinner, by reason of soul-sickness, has lost his taste for spiritual 
    things. The Word of God is <i>bread </i>to strengthen, and <i>wine </i>to 
    comfort; but the sinner tastes no sweetness in the Word. A child of God who 
    is spiritualized by grace, tastes a savoriness in ordinances. The <i>promise
    </i>drops as a honeycomb (Psalm 19:10) — but a natural man is sick and his 
    taste is gone. Since tasting of the forbidden tree, he has lost his taste 
    for spiritual dainties.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>6. Sickness takes away the 
    COMFORTS of life.</b></font> A sick person has no joy of anything; his life 
    is a burden to him. So the sin-sick soul is void of all true comfort, and 
    his laughter is but the pleasing dream of a sick man. He has no true title 
    to comfort; his sin is not pardoned, and for all he knows, he may be in hell 
    before nightfall!</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>7. Sickness ushers in DEATH</b></font>; 
    it is the prologue to death. Sickness is, as it were, the chopping of the 
    tree; death is the falling of the tree. So this disease of sin (if not cured 
    in time) brings the second death.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What the DISEASES of the soul are:</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Adam, by breaking the box of original righteousness, has 
    filled the soul with diseases. The body is not subject to so many diseases, 
    as the soul. "I cannot reckon them all up" (Psalm 40:12). "Who can 
    understand his errors?" (Psalm 19:12). I shall name some of the worst of 
    these diseases. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Pride </b>is the arrogance of the soul, <b><br/>
    lust </b>is the fever of the soul, <br/>
<b>error </b>is the gangrene of the soul, <br/>
<b>unbelief </b>is the plague of the soul, <br/>
<b>hypocrisy </b>is the scurvy of the soul, <br/>
<b>hardness of heart </b>is<b> </b>the stone in the soul, <br/>
<b>anger </b>is the madness of the soul, <br/>
<b>malice </b>is the wolf in the breast, <br/>
<b>covetousness </b>is the cancer of the soul, <br/>
    spiritual <b>sloth </b>is the soul's nausea, and <br/>
<b>apostasy </b>is the epilepsy of the soul. </p>
<p align="justify">Here are eleven soul-diseases, and when they come to 
    their full height, they are dangerous and most frequently prove mortal.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Why sin is the worst sickness:</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">To have a <i>body </i>full of plague sores is sad; but to 
    have the <i>soul</i>, which is the more noble part, spotted with sin is far 
    worse:</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>1. The body may be diseased and 
    yet the conscience be quiet.</b></font> Isaiah 33:24: "The inhabitant of the 
    land shall not say, I am sick." He should scarcely feel his sickness because 
    sin was pardoned; but when the soul is sick of any reigning lust, the 
    conscience is troubled. Isaiah 57:21: "There is no peace to the wicked." 
    When Spira had abjured his former faith — his conscience burned as hell, and 
    no spiritual medicine that divines applied could ever allay that 
    inflammation.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>2. A man may have bodily 
    diseases — yet God may love him.</b></font> Asa was diseased in his feet (2 
    Kings 15:23) — yet he was a favorite with God. God's <i>hand </i>may go out 
    against a man — yet His <i>heart </i>may be towards him. Diseases are the 
    arrows which God shoots; pestilence is called God's arrow in Psalm 91:5. 
    This arrow (as Gregory Nazianzen said) may be shot from the hand of an 
    indulgent father; but <b>soul-diseases are symptoms of God's anger. </b>As 
    He is a holy God, He cannot but hate sin. "He beholds the proud afar off" 
    (Psalm 138:6). God hates a sinner for his plague-sores. Zechariah 11:8: "My 
    soul loathed them."</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>3. Sickness, at worst, does but 
    separate from the society of friends; but this disease of sin, if not cured, 
    separates from the society of God and angels. </b></font>The leper was to be 
    shut out of the camp; this leprosy of sin, without the interposition of 
    mercy, shuts men out of the camp of heaven! This is the misery of those who 
    die in their sins: they are allowed neither friend nor physician to come to 
    them; they are excluded from God's favorable presence forever, in whose 
    presence is fullness of joy.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    APPLICATION</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>INFORMATION</b></font>. See into 
    what a sad condition sin has brought us; it has made us desperately sick. 
    Nay, we die away in our sickness, until we are fetched again with the water 
    of life. Oh, how many sick, bedridden souls there are in the world — sick 
    from pride, sick from lust. Sin has turned our houses and churches into <i>
    hospitals</i>; they are full of sick people. What David's enemies said 
    reproachfully of him is true of every natural man. Psalm 41:8: "An evil 
    disease cleaves fast unto him." 1 Kings 8:38: "He has the plague of his own 
    heart!" And even those who are regenerate are cured but in part; they have 
    some remnants of the disease, some ebullitions and stirrings of corruption. 
    Nay, sometimes this evil breaks forth to the scandal of religion, and from 
    this sin-sickness arises all other diseases — plague, gout, stone, fever. 1 
    Corinthians 11:2930: "He who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks 
    damnation to himself; for this cause many are weak and sickly among you."</p>
<p align="justify">If sin is a soul-sickness, then how foolish they are who 
    hide their sins; it is folly to hide a disease! Job 31:33, 40: "If I covered 
    my transgression as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom." The wicked 
    take more care to have sin <i>covered, </i>than <i>cured</i>; if they can 
    but sin in private and not be suspected — they think all is well. There is a 
    curse belonging to him who sins in a secret place (Deuteronomy 27:15). 
    Hiding and concealing a disease, proves mortal. Proverbs 28:13: "He who 
    covers his sins shall not prosper."</p>
<p align="justify">If sin is a soul-sickness, then see what need there is of 
    the ministry. Ministers are physicians under God, to cure sick souls. God 
    has set in His church pastors and teachers (Ephesians 4:11). The ministers 
    are a <i>college of physicians</i>; their work is to find out diseases and 
    apply remedies. This is a hard work; while ministers are curing others, they 
    themselves are near unto death (Philippians 2:30). They find their people 
    sick with various diseases: some have poisoned themselves with <i>error</i>; 
    some are surfeited with the <i>love of the creature</i>; and some have 
    stabbed themselves in the heart with gross sin! Oh, how hard it is to heal 
    all these sick, gangrened souls! Many ministers sooner kill themselves by 
    preaching, than cure their patients; but though the work of the ministry is 
    a <i>laborious </i>work, it is a <i>needful </i>work. While there are 
    sin-sick souls, there will be need for spiritual physicians. How unworthy 
    then they are, who malign and persecute the ministers of God! Oh, unkind 
    world, thus to abuse your physicians. Can there be a greater injury to 
    souls? Would it not be a piece of the highest cruelty and barbarism, if 
    there were a law passed that all physicians should be banished out of the 
    land? And is it not worse to see multitudes of sick souls lie bleeding, and 
    to have their spiritual physicians removed from them, who should under God 
    heal them? This is wrath-procuring sin. 2 Chronicles 36:16: "They misused 
    His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, until 
    there was no remedy." </p>
<p align="justify">See what is inscribed in Deuteronomy 33:8, 11: "Smite 
    through the loins of those who rise against him, and of those who hate him, 
    that they rise not again." The Lord will wither that arm which is stretched 
    out against His prophets.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>EXHORTATION</b></font>. </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>1. If sin is a soul-disease — 
    then let this serve to HUMBLE us.</b></font> The Scripture often calls upon 
    us to humility. 1 Peter 5:5: "Be clothed with humility." If anything will 
    humble, this consideration may: sin is a soul-disease. If a woman had a 
    lovely face — but a cancer in her breast, it would keep her from being proud 
    of her beauty. So Christian, though you are endued with knowledge and 
    morality, which are fair to look upon — yet remember that you are diseased 
    in your soul; here is a cancer in the breast to humble you! This certainly 
    is one reason why God leaves sin in His own children (for though sin is 
    healed as far as the <i>guilt </i>of it — yet not as far the pollution of 
    it), that the sight of their sores, may make their plumes of pride fall off! 
    There are two humbling sights: a sight of God's glory and a sight of our 
    soul-diseases.</p>
<p align="justify">Uzziah the king had no cause to be proud; for though he 
    had a <i>crown of gold on his head</i>, he had the <i>leprosy on his 
    forehead </i>(2 Chronicles 26:19). Though the saints have their <i>golden 
    graces</i> — yet they have their <i>leprous spots</i>. Seeing sin has made 
    us <i>vile — </i>let it make us <i>humble</i>; seeing it has taken away our
    <i>beauty</i> — let it take away our <i>pride</i>. Augustine said, <i>"If 
    God did not spare the proud angels, will He spare you, who are but dust and 
    rottenness?" </i>Oh, look upon your spiritual boils and ulcers — and be 
    humbled. Christians are never more lovely in God's eyes — than when they are 
    loathsome in their own eyes! Those sins which <i>humble — </i>shall never <i>
    damn!</i></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>2. If sin is a soul-disease, and 
    the most damnable disease — then let us be AFRAID of it. </b></font>Had we 
    diseases in our bodies, a cancer in the lungs or a hectic fever, we would 
    fear lest they should bring death. Oh, fear sin-sickness, lest it bring the 
    second death. You who are a drunkard or a swearer, tremble at your 
    soul-maladies.</p>
<p align="justify">I am amazed to see sinners like the leviathan, made 
    without fear. Why do not men fear sin? Why do they not <i>shake </i>with 
    this disease? Surely the reason is stupidity; as they have the fever of sin, 
    so withal a spiritual lethargy. 1 Timothy 4:2: "Having their conscience 
    seared with a hot iron." If a man has an unbelieving heart and a seared 
    conscience, you may as well ring out the death bell; that man's case is 
    desperate indeed!</p>
<p align="justify">Another reason for not fearing is presumption. Many 
    imagine that they can lay a fig upon the boil; though they are sick, they 
    think that they can make themselves well. It is but saying a few prayers; it 
    is but a sigh or a tear — and they shall immediately recover. But is it so 
    easy to be healed of sin? Is it easy to make <i>old Adam </i>bleed to death? 
    Is it easy when the <i>pangs of death </i>are on you, in an instant to have 
    the pangs of the new birth? Oh, take heed of a spiritual lethargy; fear your 
    disease, lest it prove mortal and damnable! Physicians tell of a disease 
    that makes men die laughing. Just so, Satan tickles many with the pleasure 
    of sin — and they die laughing!</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>3. If sin is a soul distemper — 
    then account them your best friends who would reclaim you from your sins.
    </b></font>The patient is thankful to the physician who tells him of his 
    disease and uses means to recover him. When ministers tell you in love of 
    your sins, and would reclaim you — take it well; the worst they intend is to 
    cure you of your sickness. David was glad for a healing reproof. Psalm 
    141:5: "Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him 
    reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head." 
    Ministers are charged by virtue of their office, to reprove (2 Timothy 4:2). 
    They must as well come with corrosives as healing balms. Titus 1:13: "Rebuke 
    them <i>sharply</i>, that they may be sound in the faith." The Greek word is 
    "cuttingly," as a surgeon searches a wound and then lances it, cutting out 
    the gangrened flesh; but it is to restore him to health. So must the 
    ministers of Christ rebuke sharply so that they may help to save their dying 
    patients. Who is angry with the physician for prescribing a bitter remedy? 
    Why should any be angry with Christ's ministers for reproving when, in 
    regard of their office, they are <i>physicians</i>, and in regard of their 
    concerns they are <i>fathers</i>? But how few are those who will take a 
    reproof kindly! Amos 5:10: "They hate him who rebukes in the gate."</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Why do men not love a reproof for sin? </b></p>
<p align="justify">One reason is because they are in love with their sins. 
    It is a strange thing that any should love their disease — but so it is. 
    Proverbs 1:22: "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?" Sin is 
    the poison of the soul — yet men love it; and he who loves his sin hates a 
    reproof. </p>
<p align="justify">Another reason is because sin possesses men with a lunacy 
    (Luke 15:7). People are mad in sin. Jeremiah 50:38: "They are mad on their 
    idols." When sickness grows so violent that men lie raving and are mad, they 
    then quarrel with their physician and say that he comes to kill them. So 
    when sin has grown to a head, and the disease has turned into a frenzy, then 
    men quarrel with those who tell them of their sin, and they are ready to do 
    violence to their physicians. It shows wisdom, to receive a reproof. 
    Proverbs 9:8: "Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you." A wise man would 
    rather drink a sharp remedy — than die of his disease.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>4. If sin is a soul-sickness — 
    then do not FEED this disease.</b></font> He who is wise will avoid those 
    things which will increase his disease: If he is feverish, he will avoid 
    wine which would inflame the disease. He will forbear a dish he loves, 
    because it is bad for his disease. Why should men not be as wise for their 
    souls? You who have a <i>drunken </i>lust, do not feed it with wine; you who 
    have a <i>malicious </i>lust, do not feed it with revenge; you who have an
    <i>unclean </i>lust, make no provision for the flesh (Romans 13:14). He who 
    feeds a disease — feeds an enemy. Some diseases are starved; starve your 
    sins by fasting and humiliation. <i>Either kill your sin — or your sin will 
    kill you!</i></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>5. If sin is a soul-disease, and 
    worse than any other — then labor to be SENSIBLE of this disease. </b>
</font>There are few who are sensible of their soul-sickness; they think 
    they are well and have no spiritual sicknesses; they are whole and need no 
    physician. It is a bad symptom to hear a sick, dying man say that he is 
    well. The church of Laodicea was a sick patient — but she thought she was 
    well. Revelation 3:17: "You say I am rich, and have need of nothing." Come 
    to many a man and feel his spiritual pulse, ask him about the state of his 
    soul, and he will say that he has a good heart and does not doubt that he 
    shall be saved.</p>
<p align="justify">How can men be so desperately sick in their souls and 
    ready to drop into hell — and yet think themselves in a very good condition?</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>1. There is a spiritual cataract 
    upon their eyes;</b></font> they do not see their sores. Laodicea thought 
    herself rich because she was blind (Revelation 3:17). <i>The god of this 
    world blinds men's eyes so that they can neither see their disease, nor 
    their Physician. </i>Many bless God that their estate is good, not from the 
    knowledge of their happiness — but from the <i>ignorance of their danger</i>. 
    When Haman's face was covered, he was near execution. Oh, pray with David, 
    "Enlighten my eyes, that I sleep not the sleep of death" (Psalm 13:3).<font color="#b07050"><b><br/>
<br/>
    2. Men who are sick think themselves well — from the haughtiness of their 
    spirits. </b></font>Alexander thought himself for a while to be the son of 
    Jupiter, and no less than a god. What an arrogant creature man is! Though he 
    is sick unto death, he thinks it too much a disparagement to acknowledge a 
    disease. He thinks that either he is not sick, or he can heal himself. If he 
    is poisoned, he runs to the herb, or rather weed, of his own righteousness 
    to cure him.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>3. Men who are sick think of 
    themselves as well — through self-love. </b></font>He who loves another will 
    not believe any evil report of him. Men are self-lovers (2 Timothy 3:2). 
    Every man is a <i>dove </i>in his own eye, and therefore does not suspect 
    himself of any disease. He will rather question the Scripture's verity — 
    than his own malady.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>4. Self-deceit, and the deceit 
    of the heart appears in hiding the disease</b></font>; the heart hides sin 
    as Rachel did her father's images (Genesis 31:34). Hazael did not think that 
    he was as sick as he was; he could not imagine that so much wickedness, like 
    a disease, should lie lurking in him. 2 Kings 8:13: "Is your servant a dog 
    that I should do this vile thing?" As the viper has his teeth hidden in his 
    gums — so that if one should look into his mouth he would think it a 
    harmless creature — so though there is much corruption in the heart — yet 
    the heart hides it and draws a veil over so that it is not seen.</p>
<p align="justify">The heart holds a false looking-glass before the eye, 
    making a man appear fair, and his estate very good. The heart can deceive 
    with counterfeit grace; hence men are insensible of their spiritual 
    condition, and think themselves well — when they are sick unto death.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>5. Men take up a good opinion of 
    themselves, and imagine their spiritual estate better than it is through 
    mistaken reasoning.</b></font> Because they enjoy glorious privileges; they 
    were born within the sound of Aaron's bells; they were baptized with holy 
    water; they have been fed with manna from heaven, therefore they hope they 
    are in a good condition. Judges 17:13: "Then Micah said, Now I know the Lord 
    will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest." But alas! This is a 
    mistake; outward privileges do not save. What is any man the better <i>for
    </i>the ordinances, unless he is the better <i>by </i>the ordinances? A 
    child may die with the breast in its mouth. Many of the Jews perished, 
    though Christ Himself was their preacher.</p>
<p align="justify">The other mistake is set down by the apostle in 2 
    Corinthians 10:12: "They, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing 
    themselves with others, are not wise." Here is a double error or mistake.
    </p>
<p align="justify">First, they measure themselves by <b>themselves</b>, that 
    is, they see they are not so bad as they were, therefore they judge that 
    their condition is good. A dwarf may be taller than he was — yet a dwarf 
    still; the patient may be less sick than he was — yet far from well; a man 
    may be better than he was — yet not godly. </p>
<p align="justify">Second, they compare themselves with <b>others</b>. They 
    see they are not so heinous and profane as others; therefore they think 
    themselves well — because they are not as sick as others. This is a mistake; 
    one may as well die of a <i>consumption, </i>as the <i>plague</i>. One man 
    may not be as far off heaven as another — yet he may never enter heaven. One 
    line may not be as crooked as another — yet not be straight. To the law and 
    to the testimony; the Word of God is the true standard and measure by which 
    we are to judge of the state and temper of our souls.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, let us take heed of this rock — imagining our 
    condition better than it is; let us take heed of a spiritual apoplexy, to be 
    sick in our souls yet not sensible of this sickness. Why do men talk of<i> a 
    light within them? </i>The light within them by nature is not sufficient to 
    show them the diseases of their souls; this light tells them they are whole 
    and have no need of a Physician.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, what infinite mercy it is — for a man to be made 
    sensible of sin and, seeing himself sick, to cry out with David in 2 Samuel 
    12:13, "I have sinned against the Lord." Would it not be a mercy for a 
    person who is demented, to be restored to the use of his reason? So it is 
    for him who is spiritually distempered and in a lethargy — to come to 
    himself, and see both his wound and his remedy. Until the sinner is sensible 
    of his disease, the <i>medicine of mercy </i>does not belong to him.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>6. If sin is a soul sickness, 
    then labor to get this disease healed.</b></font> If a man had a disease in 
    his body, a pleurisy or a cancer, he would use all the means available, for 
    a cure. The woman in the gospel who had a hemmorage spent her whole estate 
    upon the physicians (Luke 8:43). Be more earnest to have your <i>soul</i> 
    cured, than your <i>body</i>. Make David's prayer from Psalm 41:4: "Heal my 
    soul, for I have sinned!" Do you have a consumptive body? Pray to God rather 
    to heal the consumption in your soul; go to God first for the cure of your 
    soul. James 5:14: "Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the 
    church, and let them pray over him." The apostle does not say, "Let him call 
    for the physician," but "the elders," that is, the ministers. Physicians are 
    to be consulted in their due place — but not in the first place. Most men 
    send first for the physician and then for the minister; which shows they are 
    more desirous and anxious for the recovery of their bodies — than their 
    souls. But if soul diseases are more dangerous and deadly, then we should 
    prefer the spiritual cure before the bodily one; "Heal my soul, for I have 
    sinned!"</p>
<p align="justify">Until we are cured, we are not fit to do God any service. 
    A sick man cannot work; and while the disease of sin is violent, we are not 
    fit for any heavenly employment. We can neither work for God nor work out 
    our salvation. The philosopher defines happiness, as the operation of the 
    mind about virtue. To be working for God is both the end and the perfection 
    of our life. Would we be active in our sphere? Let us labor to have our 
    souls cured. As long as we are diseased with sin, we are lame and bedridden; 
    we are unfit for work. We read indeed of a sinner's works — but they are <i>
    dead </i>works (Hebrews 6:1).</p>
<p align="justify">If we are not <i>cured</i>, we are <i>cursed</i>; if our 
    spiritual diseases abide on us — the wrath of God abides on us.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But how shall we get this disease of sin cured? 
    This brings us to the second thing in the text — the healing Physician: "the 
    whole need not a physician." Whence observe:<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>DOCTRINE 2: Jesus Christ is a 
    soul Physician.</b> </font>Ministers (as was said before) are physicians 
    whom Christ, in His name, delegates and sends abroad into the world. He said 
    to the apostles, and in them to all His ministers, "Lo, I am with you to the 
    end of the world" (Matthew 28:20). That is, "I am with you to assist and 
    bless you, and to make your ministry healing." But though ministers are 
    physicians — yet but under-physicians. Jesus Christ is the chief Physician. 
    It is He who teaches us all our remedies, and goes forth with our labors, 
    else the medicine we prescribe would never work. All the ministers under 
    heaven could not do any cure, without the help of this great Physician. To 
    amplify this I shall show:</p>

<p align="justify"><i>That</i> Christ is a soul-Physician. </p>
<p align="justify"><i>Why</i> He is a soul-Physician.</p>
<p align="justify">That He is the <i>only</i> soul-Physician. </p>
<p align="justify"><i>How</i> He heals His patients. </p>
<p align="justify">That He is the <i>best</i> Physician.</p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>1. Christ is a soul-Physician.</b></font> 
    It is one of His titles. Exodus 15:26: "I am the Lord who heals you." He is 
    a Physician for the <i>body</i>. He anointed the blind, cleansed the lepers, 
    healed the sick, and raised the dead (Matthew 8:16). It is He who puts 
    virtue into medicine and makes it healing, and He is a physician for the <i>
    soul</i>. Psalm 147:3: "He heals the broken in heart." We are all as so many 
    impotent, diseased people: one man has a fever, another a palsy, another a 
    cancer; we are under the power of some hereditary corruption. But Christ is 
    a Soul-Physician. He heals these diseases. Therefore in Scripture the Lord 
    Jesus, to set forth His healing virtue, is typified by the <i>brazen serpent
    </i>(Numbers 21:9). Those who were stung were cured by looking on the brazen 
    serpent. Just so, when the soul is stung by the old serpent, it is cured by 
    that healing under Christ's wings.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is typified by the <i>Good Samaritan</i>. Luke 
    10:30, 33-34: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell 
    into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and 
    went away, leaving him half dead. But a <i>Samaritan</i>, as he traveled, 
    came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to 
    him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine." We have wounded 
    ourselves by sin, and the wound would have been incurable had not Christ, 
    that Good Samaritan, poured in His wine and oil.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ as a Physician is typified by the <i>trees of the 
    sanctuary</i>. Ezekiel 47:12: "The fruit thereof shall be for food, and the 
    leaf thereof shall be for medicine." Thus the Lord Jesus, that tree of life 
    in paradise, has a curative virtue. He heals our pride, unbelief, and so on. 
    As He feeds our graces, so He heals our corruptions.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>2. WHY Christ is a 
    soul-Physician.</b></font> </p>
<p align="justify">First, it is in regard of His call. God the Father called 
    Him to practice medicine. He anointed Him to the work of healing. Luke 4:18: 
    "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the 
    gospel. He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted." Christ came into the 
    world as into a hospital, to heal sin-sick souls. Though this was a glorious 
    work — yet Christ would not undertake it until He was commissioned by His 
    Father. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me — He has sent Me." Christ was 
    anointed and appointed to the work of a soul-Physician.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ undertook this healing work because of the
    <i>need </i>we were in of a physician. Christ came to be our Physician not 
    because we <i>deserved </i>Him — but because we <i>needed </i>Him; it was 
    not our <i>merit</i> — but our <i>misery — </i>which<i> </i>drew Christ from 
    heaven. Had He not come, we must of necessity have perished and died of our 
    wounds. Our disease was not minor; it had seized on every part. It made us 
    not only <i>sick — </i>but <i>dead!</i> And such remedies were necessary, as 
    none but Christ could give.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ came as a Physician, out of the sweetness of His 
    nature. He is like the Good Samaritan who had compassion on the wounded man 
    (Luke 10:33). A physician may come to the patient only for gain — not so 
    much to help the patient — as to help himself; but Christ came purely out of
    <i>sympathy</i>. There was nothing in us to entice Christ to heal us; for we 
    had no <i>desire </i>for a physician, nor had we anything to pay our 
    physician. As sin made us <i>sick</i> — so it made us <i>poor</i>. So that 
    Christ came as a Physician not out of hope to receive anything from us — but 
    was prompted to it out of His own goodness. Hosea 14:4: "I will heal their 
    backslidings, I will love them <i>freely</i>." Love set Christ to work — not 
    only His Father's commission — but His own <i>compassion</i> moved Him to 
    His spiritual healing. King David <i>banished </i>the blind and lame out of 
    the city in 2 Samuel 5:8. Christ <i>comes </i>to the blind and lame and 
    cures them. In love and mercy, He comes with healing under His wings.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>3. Christ is the ONLY 
    soul-Physician.</b></font> Acts 4:12: "Neither is there salvation in any 
    other." There is no other soul-physician besides. The papists would have 
    other healers besides Christ. They would make angels their physicians — but 
    all the angels in heaven cannot heal one sin-sick soul. Indeed, they are 
    described by their wings in Isaiah 6:2 — but they have no healing under 
    their wings. Papists would heal themselves by their own merits. Adam ate 
    that apple which made him and his posterity sick — but he could not find any 
    herb in paradise to cure him. Our <i>merits </i>are rather damning — than 
    healing. To make use of other physicians and medicines is as if the 
    Israelites, in contempt of that brazen serpent which Moses set up, had 
    erected other brazen serpents. Oh, let us take heed of such false 
    physicians.</p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, in bodily sickness it is lawful to multiply 
    physicians; when the patient has advised with one physician, he desires to 
    have others joined with him. But the sick soul, if it joins any other 
    physician with Christ, it surely dies.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>4. HOW Christ heals His 
    patients.</b></font> There are four things in Christ, which are healing.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>His WORD is healing.</b></font> 
    Psalm 107:20: "He sent His Word and healed them." His Word in the mouth of 
    His ministers is healing; when the heart is wounded in desertion, Christ 
    creates the lips which speak peace (Isaiah 57:19). The Word written — is a 
    repository in which God has laid up sovereign oil and balsams to recover 
    sin-sick souls; and the Word preached — is the pouring out of these oils, 
    and applying them to the sick patient. "He sent His Word and healed them." 
    We look upon the Word as a weak thing. What is the breath of a man to save a 
    soul? But the power of the Lord is present to heal (Luke 5:17). Christ makes 
    use of His Word as a healing medicine; the remedies which his ministers 
    prescribe, He Himself applies. He makes His Word convincing, converting, and 
    comforting.</p>
<p align="justify">But the Word does not heal all; to some it is not a <i>
    healing — </i>but a <i>killing </i>Word. 2 Corinthians 2:16: "To the one we 
    are a savor of death unto death." Some patients die of their disease. Such 
    people as sin <i>presumptuously </i>die, though they know a thing to be sin 
    (Job 24:13). They are of those who rebel against the light, and this is 
    dangerous. David prayed in Psalm 19, "Keep back Your servant from 
    presumptuous sins." Such people as sin <i>maliciously </i>die. When the 
    disease comes to this head, the patient will die (Hebrews 10:29). But to 
    those who belong to the election of grace, the Word is the healing medicine 
    which Christ uses. "He sent His Word, and healed them."</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>Christ's WOUNDS are healing. </b>
</font>Isaiah 55:5: "With His stripes — we are healed." Christ made a 
    medicine of His own body and blood. <i>The Physician died to cure the 
    patient!</i> The pelican, when her young ones are bitten by serpents, feeds 
    them with her own blood to recover them. Thus, when we were bitten by the 
    old serpent, then Jesus Christ prescribes His own blood to heal and restore 
    us. The blood of Christ, being the blood of Him who was God as well as man, 
    had infinite merit to appease the holiness of God, and infinite virtue to 
    heal us. </p>
<p align="justify">This is the <i>balm of Gilead</i>, which recovers a soul 
    which is sick even unto death. This <i>balm of Gilead</i>, as naturalists 
    say, is a juice which a little shrub, being cut with glass, weeps out. This 
    was anciently of very precious esteem; the savor of it was odoriferous, the 
    virtue of it sovereign; it would cure ulcers and the stinging of serpents. 
    This balm may be an emblem of Christ's blood; it has a most sovereign virtue 
    in it. It heals the ulcer of sin and the stinging of temptation; it merits 
    for us justification (Romans 5:9). Oh, how precious this balm of Gilead is! 
    By this blood we enter into heaven.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>Christ's SPIRIT is healing.</b></font> 
    The blood of Christ heals the <i>guilt </i>of sin; the Spirit of Christ 
    heals the <i>pollution </i>of sin. The Spirit is compared to oil; it is 
    called the <i>anointing </i>of the Spirit in Isaiah 61, to show the healing 
    virtue of the Spirit. Christ by His Spirit heals the rebellion of the will, 
    the stone of the heart; though sin is not fully removed, it is subdued.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>Christ's ROD is healing.</b></font> 
    Christ never wounds but to heal; the <i>rod of affliction </i>is to recover 
    the sick patient. David's bones were broken — so that his soul might be 
    healed. God uses affliction as the surgeon does his lance, to let out the 
    venom and corruption of the soul, and make way for a cure.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>QUESTION. But if Christ is a Physician, why are not 
    all healed?</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER 1. Because all do not know they are sick.</b> 
    They do not see the sores and ulcers in their souls. And will Christ cure 
    those who see no need of Him? Many ignorant people thank God that they have 
    good hearts; but that heart can no more be good which lacks grace, than that 
    body can be sound which lacks health.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER 2. All are not healed because they love their 
    sickness.</b> Psalm 52:3: "You love evil." Many men hug their disease. 
    Augustine said that, before his conversion, he prayed against sin — but his 
    heart whispered, "Not yet, Lord." He was loath to leave his sin too soon.</p>
<p align="justify">How many love their disease more than their Physician! 
    While sin is loved, Christ's medicines are loathed.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER 3. All are not healed because they do not look 
    for a Physician.</b> If they have any bodily distemper upon them, they 
    immediately send for the physician. Yet their souls are sick — but they will 
    not go to their Physician, Christ. John 5:40: "You will not come unto Me 
    that you may have life." Christ takes it as an undervaluing of Him — that we 
    will not send for Him. Some send for Christ when it is too late; when other 
    physicians have given them over and there is no hope of life, then they cry 
    to Christ to save them. But Christ refuses such patients as make use of Him 
    only for a shift. <i>You who scorn Christ in time of health — Christ may 
    despise you in the time of sickness!</i></p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER 4. All are not healed because they would be 
    self-healers.</b> They would make their duties their saviors. The papists 
    would be their own physicians; their daily sacrifice of the mass is a 
    blasphemy against Christ's priestly office. But Christ will have the honor 
    of the cure, or He will never heal us; not <i>our tears</i> — but <i>His 
    blood </i>saves.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER 5. All are not healed because they do not take 
    the medicine which Christ prescribes for them.</b> They would be cured — but 
    they are loath to take the curing medicines. Christ prescribes them to drink 
    the bitter potion of <i>repentance </i>and to take the pill of <i>
    mortification</i> — but they cannot do this; they would rather die than take 
    these! If the patient refuses to take the course the physician prescribes, 
    it is no wonder that he is not healed. </p>
<p align="justify">Professors — you have had many prescriptions to take; 
    have you taken them? Ask your conscience. There are many hearers of the Word 
    who, like foolish patients, send to the doctor for medicines — but when they 
    have it, they put it up in the cupboard — but do not take it. It is probable 
    you have not taken the prescription which the gospel prescribes, because the 
    Word has no operation on your hearts. You are as proud, as earthly, and as 
    malicious as ever!</p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER 6. All are not healed, because they have no 
    confidence in the Physician.</b> It is observable that when Christ came to 
    work any cure, He first put this question, "Do you believe that I am able to 
    do this?" (Matthew 9:28). This undoes many. "Oh," says the sinner, "there is 
    no mercy for me. Christ cannot heal me." Take heed, your <i>unbelief</i> is 
    worse than all your other diseases. Did not Christ pray for those who 
    crucified Him? "Father, forgive them." Some of those were saved, who had a 
    hand in shedding His blood (Acts 2:36-37). Why then do you say Christ cannot 
    heal you? Unbelief dishonors Christ; it hinders from a cure; it closes the 
    orifice of Christ's wounds; it staunches His blood. Millions die of their 
    disease, because they do not believe in the Physician.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>5. Christ is the BEST Physician.</b>
</font>That I may set forth the praise and honor of Jesus Christ, I shall 
    show you wherein He excels other physicians; no physician is like Christ.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>He is the most SKILLFUL 
    Physician. </b></font>There is no disease too hard for Him. Psalm 103:3: 
    "Who heals all your diseases." The pool of Bethesda might be an emblem of 
    Christ's blood (John 5:5). Whoever first after the troubling of the water 
    stepped in, was made whole of whatever disease he had. There are certain 
    diseases that physicians cannot cure, such as a consumption in the lungs, 
    some kinds of obstructions and gangrenes. Some diseases are the reproach of 
    physicians. But there is no disease which can oppose Christ's skill. He can 
    cure the gangrene of sin — even when it comes to the heart. He healed Mary 
    Magdalene, an unchaste sinner. He healed Paul, who breathed out threatenings 
    against the church, insomuch that Paul stands and wonders at the cure: "But 
    I obtained mercy!" literally, "I was bemercied!" (1 Timothy 1:13). </p>
<p align="justify">Christ heals <i>head </i>distempers and <i>heart </i>
    distempers, which may keep poor trembling souls from despair. "Oh," says the 
    sinner, "never was any so diseased as I!" But look up to your Physician, 
    Christ, who has healing under His wings. He can melt a <i>heart of stone,
    </i>and wash away black sins in the crimson of His blood! There are no 
    desperate cases with Christ. He has those salves, oils, and balsams which 
    can cure the worst diseases. </p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, there is one disease which Christ does not heal, 
    namely, the sin against the Holy Spirit. There is no healing of this 
    disease; not but that Christ could cure this — but the sinner himself <i>
    will </i>not be cured. The king may pardon a traitor — but if he will 
    obstinately refuse the pardon, he must die. The sin against the Holy Spirit 
    is unpardonable because the sinner will have no pardon. He scorns Christ's 
    blood and despises His Spirit; therefore this sin has no sacrifice (Hebrews 
    10:26, 29).</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ is the best Physician 
    because he cures the BETTER part, the soul.</b></font> Other physicians can 
    cure the liver or spleen — but Christ cures the <i>heart</i>. They can cure 
    the <i>blood </i>when it is tainted — but Christ cures the <i>conscience </i>
    when it is defiled. Hebrews 9:14: "How much more shall the blood of Christ 
    purge your conscience from dead works?" Galen and Hippocrates might cure 
    kidney-stones — but Christ cures heart-stones. He is the best physician who 
    cures the most excellent part. The soul is immortal and angelic. Man was 
    made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), not in regard of his body — but his 
    soul. Now if the soul is so divine and noble, then the cure of the soul far 
    exceeds the cure of the body.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ is the best Physician, 
    for He causes us to FEEL our disease.</b></font> The disease of sin, though 
    it is most <i>damnable</i> — yet is least <i>discernible</i>. Many a man is 
    sin-sick — but the devil has given him such stupefying drug, that he sleeps 
    the sleep of death, and all the thunders of the Word cannot awaken him. But 
    the Lord Jesus, this blessed Physician, awakens the soul out of its 
    lethargy, and then it is in a hopeful way of recovery. The jailor was never 
    so near a cure as when he cried out, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" 
    (Acts 16:30).</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ shows more LOVE to His 
    patients than any other physician. </b></font>This appears so in that long 
    journey He took from heaven to earth. It appears so in that He comes to His 
    patients without being sent for. The sick send for their physicians, and use 
    many entreaties; but Christ comes unsent for. Isaiah 65:1: "I was found by 
    those who did not seek Me." He meets us with mercy. He entreats us to be 
    healed. If Christ had not first come to us, and, with the good Samaritan, 
    poured in wine and oil, we would have died of our wounds.</p>
<p align="justify">This Physician lets Himself bleed — to cure His patient! 
    Isaiah 53:5: "But He was wounded for our transgressions." Through His wounds 
    — we may see His great love.</p>
<p align="justify">Our repulses and unkindnesses do not drive Christ away 
    from us. Physicians, if provoked by their patients, go away in a rage and 
    will come no more. We abuse our Physician and thrust Him away; we bolt out 
    our Physician — yet Christ will not forsake us — but comes again and applies 
    His sovereign oils and balsams. Isaiah 65:2: "I have spread out My hands all 
    the day unto a rebellious people." Christ puts up with wrongs and 
    incivilities, and is resolved to go through with the cure. Oh, the love of 
    this heavenly Physician!</p>
<p align="justify">Christ Himself drank that bitter cup which we should have 
    drunk, and by His taking the potion we are healed and saved.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus Christ has shown more love than any physician ever 
    did to the patient.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ is the CHEAPEST 
    Physician.</b></font> Sickness is not only a consumption to the body — but 
    the purse! (Luke 8:43). Physicians charge fees — but Jesus Christ gives us 
    our medicine freely. He takes no fee. Isaiah 55:1: "Come without money and 
    without price." He desires us to bring nothing to Him but broken hearts; and 
    when He has cured us, He desires us to bestow nothing upon Him but our love 
    — and one would think that was very reasonable.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ heals with more EASE than 
    any other. </b></font>Other physicians apply pills, potions, or remedies. 
    Christ cures with more ease. Christ made the devil go out with a word spoken 
    (Mark 9:25). So when the soul is spiritually possessed, Christ can heal with 
    a word, nay, He can cure with a <i>look</i>. When Peter had fallen into a 
    relapse, Christ looked on Peter — and he wept. Christ's look melted Peter 
    into repentance; it was a healing look. If Christ but casts a look upon the 
    soul, He can recover it. Therefore David prayed to have a look from God in 
    Psalm 119:132: "Look upon me — and be merciful unto me."</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ is the most 
    TENDER-HEARTED Physician.</b></font> He has ended His passion — yet not His 
    compassion. How He pities sick souls! He is not more full of skill, than of 
    sympathy, Hosea 11:8: "My heart is turned within Me." Christ shows His 
    compassion in that He proportions His medicine to the strength of the 
    patient. If medicine is too sharp for the constitution, it endangers the 
    life. Christ gives such gentle medicine as works kindly and savingly. Though 
    He will <i>bruise </i>sinners — yet He will not <i>break </i>the bruised 
    reed. Oh, the mercy of Christ to poor souls, who feel themselves heart-sick 
    with sin! He holds their head and heart when they are fainting. He brings 
    the cordials of His promises to keep the sick patient from fainting away.</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, you perhaps may have hard thoughts of your 
    Physician, Christ, and think that He is cruel and intends to destroy you. 
    But, oh, the workings of His heart towards humble, broken-hearted sinners! 
    Psalm 147:3: "He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds." 
    Every groan of the patient — goes to the heart of this Physician!</p>
<p align="justify">Physicians often prescribe medicine which is harmful to 
    the patient. Sometimes they cannot find the cause of the disease; and 
    sometimes they may give that which is harmful. Or if they do find the cause, 
    they may give that which is good for one thing — but bad for another. When 
    the liver and spleen are both distempered, the medicine which helps the 
    liver, may hurt the spleen. But Christ always prescribes that medicine which 
    is suitable, and withal He blesses it. If the disease of the soul is <i>
    pride</i>, He humbles it with affliction. God turned Nebuchadnezzar to eat 
    grass like an animal — to cure him of his arrogance. If the disease of the 
    soul is <i>sloth</i>, Christ applies some awakening Scriptures (Matthew 
    12:11; Luke 13:24; 1 Peter 4:18). If the disease is the <i>stone of the 
    heart</i>, Christ uses proper medicines. Sometimes the terrors of the law, 
    sometimes mercies, and sometimes He dissolves the stone in His own blood! If 
    the soul is <i>faint </i>through unbelief, Christ brings some Scripture 
    cordial to revive it. Matthew 12:20: "A bruised reed He will not break." 
    Isaiah 57:16: "I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; 
    for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made." Thus 
    the Lord Jesus always prescribes that medicine which is proper for the 
    disease, and shall work effectually for the cure.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ NEVER FAILS to succeed.</b></font> 
    Physicians may have skill — but not always success; patients often die under 
    their hands. But Christ never undertakes to heal any, but He makes a certain 
    cure. John 17:12: "Those whom You gave Me, I have kept, and none of them is 
    lost." Judas was not given to Christ to be healed; but never any who was 
    given to Christ, has ever miscarried.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How shall I know then that I am given to Christ 
    to be cured?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Is it with you as with a sick patient, who sees 
    himself dying without a physician. Are you undone without Christ? Do you 
    perceive yourself as bleeding to death without the balm of Gilead? Then you 
    are one of Christ's sick patients, and you shall never miscarry under His 
    hands. How can any of those be lost, whom Christ undertakes to cure? As He 
    pours in the balsam of His blood, so He pours out the perfume of His prayers 
    for them. John 17:11: "Holy Father, keep through Your own name, those whom 
    You have given Me." Satan could never upbraid Christ with this, that any of 
    His sick patients were lost.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Other physicians can only cure 
    those who are sick — but Christ cures those who are DEAD!</b></font> 
    Ephesians 2:1: "You has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins." 
    A sinner has all the signs of death on him: the pulse of his affections does 
    not beat; he is without breath; he does not breathe after holiness. He is 
    dead — but Christ is a Physician for the dead! Of every one whom Christ 
    cures, it may be said, "He was dead — and is alive again" (Luke 15:32).</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Christ cures not only our 
    diseases — but our DEFORMITIES. </b></font>The physician can make the sick 
    man well; but if he is deformed he cannot make him lovely. Christ gives not 
    only <i>health</i> — but <i>beauty</i>. Sin has made us ugly and misshapen. 
    Christ's medicines do not only take away our <i>sickness</i> — but our <i>
    spots</i>. He not only makes us <i>whole</i> — but lovely. Hosea 14:4: "I 
    will heal their backslidings." Verse 6: "His <i>beauty </i>shall he as the 
    olive-tree." Jesus Christ never thinks that He has fully healed us, until He 
    has drawn His own beautiful image upon us! Song of Solomon 2:13: "Arise, my 
    lovely one," lovely with justification, lovely with sanctification. Christ 
    not only <i>heals</i> — but <i>adorns</i>. He is called the Sun of 
    Righteousness in Malachi 4:2, not only because of the healing under His 
    wings — but because of those rays of beauty which He puts upon the soul 
    (Revelation 12:1).</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#b07050"><b>Last, Christ is the most 
    bountiful Physician.</b></font> Other patients enrich their physicians — but 
    here the Physician enriches the patient! Christ advances all His patients. 
    He not only <i>cures </i>them — but <i>crowns </i>them! (Revelation 2:10). 
    Christ not only raises from the bed — but to the throne! He gives the sick 
    man not only <i>health</i> — but <i>heaven!</i></p>
<p align="justify">Good news this day — there is balm in Gilead! There is a 
    Physician to heal sin-sick souls! The angels that fell had no physician sent 
    to them; we have. There are but few in the world to whom Christ is revealed; 
    those who have the gold of the Indies, lack the blood of the Lamb. But the 
    Sun of Righteousness is risen in our hemisphere with healing in His wings. 
    If a man were poisoned, what a comfort it would be to him to hear that there 
    was an herb in the garden which could heal him! If he had a gangrene in his 
    body, and were given up by all his doctors, how glad he would be to hear of 
    a physician who could cure him! O sinner, you are full of deadly cancer — 
    you have a gangrened soul. But there is a Physician who can recover you. 
    There is hope! Though there is an old serpent to sting us with his 
    temptations — yet there is a brazen serpent to heal us with His blood.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>If Christ is a Physician, then 
    let us make use of this Physician for our diseased souls.</b></font> Luke 
    4:40: "When the sun was setting, all those who were sick with divers 
    diseases were brought unto Him, and He laid His hands on everyone of them 
    and healed them." You who have neglected a Physician all this while, now 
    when the sun of the gospel and the sun of your life are setting, bring your 
    sick souls to Christ to be cured. Christ complains that though men are sick 
    even to death — yet they will not come or send for the Physician. John 5:40: 
    "You will not come to Me that you might have life." In bodily diseases the 
    physician is the first one who is sent for; in soul diseases the Physician 
    is the last one who is sent for.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Objections Answered</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">But there may be many sad objections that poor souls make 
    as to why they do not come to Christ, their soul-Physician.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>OBJECTION 1. Alas, I am discouraged to go to Christ to 
    cure me — because of my unworthiness.</b> I am just like the centurion who 
    sent for Christ about his sick servant in Luke 7:6: "Lord, do not trouble 
    Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof." Christ 
    was coming to heal his servant — but the centurion would have staved off 
    Christ from coming. "I am not worthy." So many a trembling soul says, 
    "Christ is a Physician — but who am I that Christ should come under my roof 
    or heal me? I am unworthy of mercy." Just as Mephibosheth said to King David 
    in 2 Samuel 9:8, "What is Your servant, that You should look upon such a 
    dead dog as I am?"</p>
<p align="justify"><b>ANSWER</b>. Now to such as have their hearts broken 
    with a sense of their unworthiness, and are discouraged from coming to 
    Christ to heal them, let me say these five things by way of reply:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Who did Christ shed His blood for — but such as are 
    unworthy? 1 Timothy 1:15: "Jesus Christ came into the world to save <i>
    sinners</i>." Christ came into the world as into a hospital, among a company 
    of lame, bed-ridden souls.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Though we are not legally worthy, we may be 
    evangelically worthy. It is part of our worthiness — to see our 
    unworthiness. Isaiah 41:14: "Fear not, you worm Jacob." You may be a <i>worm
    </i>in your own eyes — yet a <i>dove </i>in God's eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Though <i>we </i>are unworthy — yet <i>Christ </i>is 
    worthy. We do not <i>deserve </i>a cure — but Christ has merited mercy for 
    us. He has a store of blood, to supply our lack of tears.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Who was ever saved, because he was worthy? What man 
    could ever plead this title, "Lord Jesus, heal me because I am worthy?" What 
    worthiness was in Paul before his conversion? What worthiness was there in 
    Mary Magdalene, out of whom seven devils were cast? But free grace pitied 
    and healed them. God does not <i>find </i>us worthy — but <i>makes </i>us 
    worthy.</p>
<p align="justify">5. If we never come to Christ to be healed until we are 
    worthy, we must never come. And let me tell you, this talking of worthiness 
    savors of pride; we would have something of our own to offer. Had we such 
    preparations and self-excellencies, then we think Christ should accept us, 
    and we might come and be healed. This is to pay our Physician a fee to be 
    healed. Oh, do not let the sense of unworthiness discourage you. Go to 
    Christ to be healed. "Arise, He calls you!" (Mark 10:49).</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 2. But I fear I am not within Christ's 
    commission. I am not of the number that shall be saved; and then, though 
    Christ is a Physician, I shall not be healed.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. We must take heed of drawing desperate 
    conclusions against ourselves; it is high presumption for us to make 
    ourselves wiser than the angels. All the angels in heaven are not able to 
    resolve the question of who are elect and who are reprobates.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. You who say that you are not within Christ's 
    commission, read over Christ's commission and see who it is He comes to 
    heal. Luke 4:18: "He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted." Has God 
    touched your heart with remorse? Do you lay to heart your gospel 
    unkindnesses? Do you weep more out of love for Christ than out of fear of 
    hell? Then you are a brokenhearted sinner, and are within Christ's 
    commission. <i>A bleeding Christ will heal a broken heart!</i></p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 3. But my sins are so many that surely I shall 
    never be healed. I am sick with many diseases at once.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. You have the more need of a Physician. One would 
    think that was a strange speech of Peter to Christ in Luke 5:8: "<i>Depart
    </i>from me, for I am a <i>sinful </i>man," Should it not rather be, "Lord, 
    come near me"? Is it a good argument to say to a physician, "I am diseased, 
    therefore depart from me"? No, rather, "Come and heal me!" Our sins should 
    serve to humble us — not to beat us away from Christ. I tell you if we had 
    no diseases, Christ would have no work to do in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 4. But my disease is inflamed and grown to a 
    paroxysm; my sin is greatly heightened.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. <i>The plaster of Christ's blood — is broader 
    than your sore!</i> 1 John 1:7: "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
    <i>all </i>sin." The <i>blood of the Lamb </i>takes away the <i>poison of 
    the serpent</i>. All diseases are alike to Christ's blood. He can cure the 
    greatest sin as well as the least. Have you a bloody issue of sin running? 
    The issue of blood in Christ's side can heal you!</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 5. But mine is an old inveterate disease — and 
    I fear it is incurable.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Though your disease is chronic — Christ can heal 
    it. Christ does not say, "If this disease had been found in time, it might 
    have been cured." He is good at <i>old </i>sores. The <i>thief on the cross
    </i>had an old festering disease — but Christ cured it; it was well for him 
    that His Physician was so near. <i>Zaccheus</i>, an old sinner, a tax 
    collector, had wronged many a man in his time — but Christ cured him. Christ 
    sometimes grafts His grace upon an old stock. We read that Christ cured at 
    sunset (Luke 4:40). He heals some sinners at the <i>sunset </i>of their 
    lives.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 6. But after I have been healed, my disease has 
    broken out again. I have relapsed into the same sin, and therefore I fear 
    there is no healing for me.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is rare that the Lord leaves His children to 
    these relapses, though through the suspension of grace and the prevalency of 
    temptation, it is possible they might fall back into sin. These sins of 
    relapse are sad. It was an aggravation of Solomon's offense that he sinned 
    after the Lord had appeared to him twice (1 Kings 11:9). These sins after 
    healing, open the mouth of conscience to accuse, and stop the mouth of God's 
    Spirit which should speak peace. These sins exclude from the comfort of the 
    promise; it is as it were sequestrated. But if the soul is deeply humbled, 
    if the relapsing sinner is a repenting sinner, let him not cast away the 
    anchor of hope — but have recourse to his soul-Physician. </p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ can cure a relapse. He healed David's and 
    Peter's relapse. 1 John 2:1: "If any man sins, we have an advocate with the 
    Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous." Christ appears in the court, as the 
    Advocate for the client. As He poured out His blood upon the brazen altar of 
    the cross, so He pours out His prayers at the golden altar in heaven. 
    Hebrews 7:25: "He ever lives to make intercession for us." In the golden 
    work of intercession, Christ presents the merits of His blood to His Father 
    — and so obtains our <i>pardon</i>. He applies the virtue of His blood to us 
    — and so works our <i>cure</i>. Therefore, do not be discouraged from going 
    to your physician; though your disease has broken out again — yet Christ has 
    fresh sprinklings of His blood for you. He can cure any relapse!</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 7. But there is no healing for me. I fear I 
    have sinned the sin against the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. The fear of sinning it is a sign that you have 
    not sinned it. Why do you think that you have sinned the sin against the 
    Holy Spirit? Every grieving of the Spirit of God, is not that fatal sin. We 
    grieve the Spirit when we sin against His illumination. The Spirit being 
    grieved may depart for a time, and carry away all its honey out of the hive, 
    leaving the soul in darkness (Isaiah 50:10). But every <i>grieving </i>of 
    the Spirit is not the <i>sin </i>against the Holy Spirit. When a child of 
    God has sinned, his heart smites him; and he whose heart smites him for sin 
    has not committed the unpardonable sin. </p>
<p align="justify">A child of God, having grieved the Spirit, does as Noah 
    did when the dove flew out of the ark: he opened the windows of the ark to 
    let it in again. A godly man does not shut his heart against the Spirit as a 
    wicked man does (Acts 7:51). A gracious soul opens his heart to let in the 
    Spirit, as Noah opened the door of the ark to let in the dove. Christian, is 
    it so with you? Then be of good comfort, you have not sinned the sin against 
    the Holy Spirit. That sin is a malicious despising of the Spirit, which you 
    tremble to even think of.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, laying aside these arguments and disputes, 
    whatever the diseases of the soul are — come to Christ for a cure! Believe 
    in His blood and you may be saved. You see what a <i>skillful</i> and <i>
    able</i> Physician Christ is, what sovereign oils and balsams He has, and 
    how willing He is to cure sick souls. Oh, then, what remains but that you 
    cast yourselves upon His merits to heal and save you! Of all sins, <i>
    unbelief </i>is the worst because it casts disparagement on Christ, as if He 
    were not able to work a cure. O Christian, believe in your Physician. John 
    3:15: "Whoever believes in Him shall not perish." </p>
<p align="justify">Say as Queen Esther did in Esther 4:16: "I will go in 
    unto the king, which is not according to the law, and if I perish, I 
    perish." So say, "The Lord Jesus is a Physician to heal me. I will adventure 
    on His blood, and if I perish, I perish. Queen Esther ventured against the
    <i>law</i>; she had no promise that the king would hold out the golden 
    scepter. But I have a <i>promise </i>which invites me to come to Christ: "He 
    who comes unto Me I will never cast out." (John 6:37).</p>
<p align="justify">Faith is a healing grace. We read that, when the 
    Israelites were burying a man, for fear of the soldiers of the Moabites, 
    they cast him hastily into the grave of Elisha. Now the man, as soon as he 
    was down and had touched the dead body of the prophet, revived and stood up 
    on his feet (2 Kings 13:21). So if a man is dead in sin — yet let him be but 
    cast into Christ's grave and by faith touch Christ, who was dead and buried. 
    That man will revive, and his soul will be healed.</p>
<p align="justify">Remember, there is no way for a cure, but by believing. 
    Christ Himself will not avail us otherwise. Romans 3:25: "Whom God has set 
    forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood." Faith is the 
    applying of Christ's merits. A plaster, though it is ever so rare and 
    excellent — yet if it is not <i>applied </i>to the wound, it will do not 
    good; though the plaster is made of Christ's blood — yet it will not heal 
    unless applied by faith. The brazen serpent was a sovereign remedy for the 
    cure of those who were stung; but if they had not looked upon it, they would 
    have received no benefit. So though there is a healing virtue in Christ — 
    yet unless we look upon Him by the eye of faith, we cannot be cured. Above 
    all things labor for faith; this is the all-healing grace. This hand 
    touching Christ, fetches virtue from Him.</p>
<p align="justify">Not that faith has more worthiness than other graces; but 
    only it is influential as it makes us one with Christ. If a man had a stone 
    in a ring that could cure many diseases, we would say that this ring heals. 
    But it is not the ring — but the stone in that ring, which does the curing. 
    So faith saves and heals not by its own virtue — but as it lays hold of 
    Christ and fetches down His sacred influences into the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 2. If Jesus Christ is a spiritual Physician, let 
    us labor to hasten the cure of our souls. Consider:</p>
<p align="justify">1. What a little time we have to stay here, and let that 
    hasten the cure. Solomon said, "There is a time to be <i>born</i> — and a 
    time to <i>die</i>" (Ecclesiastes 3:2). But he mentions no time of <i>living</i>, 
    as if that were so short that it was not worth naming. The body is called a
    <i>vessel </i>in 1 Thessalonians 4:4. This vessel is filled with breath; 
    sickness broaches it — and death draws it out! Oh, hasten your soul's cure; 
    death is upon its swift march, and if it surprises you suddenly, there is no 
    cure to be wrought in the grave. Ecclesiastes 9:10: "There is no work, nor 
    device, nor wisdom in the grave where you go."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Now is properly the time of healing; now it the day of 
    grace; now Christ pours out His healing balsams; now He sends abroad His 
    ministers and Spirit. 2 Corinthians 6:2: "Now is the accepted time." There 
    were certain healing days wherein the king healed those who had the evil. 
    The day of grace is a healing day; if we neglect the day of grace, the next 
    day will be a day of wrath! (Romans 2:5). Oh, therefore hasten the cure of 
    your soul. Neglect your food rather than your cure. Sin will not only <i>
    kill </i>you — but <i>damn </i>you!</p>
<p align="justify">To get a cure, come to the healing pool of the sanctuary. 
    The Spirit of God may all of a sudden stir these waters; the next Sabbath, 
    for all you know, may be a healing day to your soul.</p>
<p align="justify">Ask others to pray for you. When any disease is upon your 
    body, you desire the prayers of others. The prayers of the saints are 
    precious balms and medicines to cure sick souls.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>3. Is Jesus Christ a soul 
    Physician? Then let me speak to you who are in some measure healed of your 
    damnable disease. </b></font>I have four things to say:</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>First, break forth into 
    thankfulness.</b></font> Though sin is not quite <i>cured </i>(there are 
    still some remnants of the disease) — yet the <i>reigning power </i>of it is 
    taken away. You are so healed that you shall not die (John 3:16; 11:26). 
    Those who were cured by the brazen serpent afterwards died; but such as are 
    healed by Christ shall never die. Sin may molest you — but it shall not damn 
    you. Oh, then, what cause you have to admire and love your Physician! The 
    Lord Jesus has taken out the core and the curse of your disease; publish 
    your experiences. Psalm 66:16: "I will tell you what God has done for my 
    soul." As a man who has been cured of a lingering disease, how glad and 
    thankful is he? He will tell others of the medicine which cured him. So say, 
    "I will tell you what God has done for my soul: He has cured me of an old 
    disease — a hard, unbelieving heart — a disease which has sent millions to 
    hell." Truly we may cheerfully bear any other sickness — if this 
    soul-sickness is cured. Luther said, "Lord, strike and wound where You will 
    — if my sin is pardoned." Oh, let the high praises of God be in your mouth 
    (Psalm 149:6). God expects thankfulness as a tribute. He wonders why men do 
    not bring their thank-offering. Luke 17:17: "Were there not ten cleansed — 
    but where are the nine?"</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>Second, are you healed? Take 
    heed of coming into infected company lest you take their infection.</b></font> 
    The wicked are devils to tempt to sin. Lot was the world's wonder, who lived 
    in Sodom when it was a pest-house — yet did not catch the disease.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font color="#008000">Third, take heed of relapses.</font>
</b>Men are afraid of a relapse after they are cured; beware of soul 
    relapses. Has God softened your heart? Take heed of hardening it. Has He 
    cured you in some measure of deadness? Do not relapse into a drowsy 
    security. You may have such an uproar and agony in your conscience as may 
    make you go weeping to your grave. Oh, take heed of falling sick again. "Sin 
    no more, lest a worse thing come unto you" (John 5:14).</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><b>Four, pity your friends who are 
    sick unto death</b></font>; show your piety in your pity. Have you a <i>
    child </i>who is well and healthy — but has a sick soul? Pity him and pray 
    for him. David wept and fasted for his sick child (2 Samuel 12:16). Your 
    child has the plague-sore of the heart, and <i>you </i>have conveyed the 
    plague to him; weep and fast for that child. Have you a <i>wife </i>or a <i>
    husband </i>who, though they are not sick in their bed — yet the Lord knows 
    they are soul-sick; and are under the raging power of sin? Oh, let your 
    affections yearn over them; lift up a prayer for them. The prayer of faith 
    may save a sick soul. <i>Prayer is the best medicine which can be used in a 
    desperate case</i>; you who have felt the disease of sin and the mercy of 
    your Physician — learn to pity others.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><b>4. Last, is Christ a soul 
    Physician? Then let us go to Christ to cure this sick, dying nation.</b></font> 
    Britain, God knows, is a sick patient. The whole head is sick, the whole 
    heart is faint. The nation is ill all over; magistracy, ministry, and the 
    common people are diseased. And those who pretend to be our healers, are 
    physicians of no value. We have spent our money upon these physicians — yet 
    our sores are not healed. Jeremiah 14:19: "Why have you smitten us, and 
    there is no healing for us?" Instead of healing us, those who should have 
    been our physicians have increased the nation's malady by giving false 
    remedies. This is like giving a medicine in a fever which more inflames the 
    disease. Ah, Britain is <i>sick </i>because Britain is <i>sinful! </i>Sick 
    with error, uncleanness, and drunkenness; so sick that we may fear our 
    funerals are approaching. And, which is the worst symptom, though balm has 
    been poured into our wounds, the precious ordinances of God have been 
    applied — yet we are not healed. It is a sign of a fatal disease, that it is 
    too ill to be cured.</p>
<p align="justify">This sin-sickness in the land has produced many dire 
    effects: division, oppression, and bloodshed. The very core of the nation is 
    almost torn asunder, so that now God has fulfilled that threatening upon us 
    from Micah 6:13: "I will make you sick with smiting you." We had made 
    ourselves sick with sinning, and God has made us sick with smiting.</p>
<p align="justify">Now what remains but that we should go to the Great 
    Physician, whose blood sprinkles many nations; that He should apply some 
    healing medicines to dying Britain. God can heal with a word. He can give <i>
    repentance </i>as well as <i>deliverance</i>. He can put us in joint again. 
    Let all the people of the land lie between the porch and the altar, saying, 
    "Spare Your people, O Lord" (Joel 2:17). Our prayers and tears may set 
    Christ a-work to heal us. Psalm 106:23: "Therefore He said that He would 
    destroy them, had not Moses His servant stood in the breach to turn away His 
    wrath." Let us never stop imploring our heavenly Physician, until He lays a 
    fig on England's boil and causes it to recover.</p>
