<p align="center">by Thomas Watson<br/>
 </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Be wise as serpents—and harmless as doves."</p></i> Matthew 
    10:16
<p align="justify">The Apostle says, "All Scripture is given by 
    inspiration," 2 Timothy 3:16. God's Word is compared to a <i>lamp </i>for 
    its enlightening quality, Psalm 119:105, and to refined <i>silver </i>for 
    its enriching quality, Psalm 12:6. Among other parts of Sacred Writ, this 
    text is not the least:<i> "Be wise as serpents—and harmless as doves." </i>
    This is the speech of our blessed Savior. His lips were a tree of life which 
    fed many. His <i>works </i>were miracles. His <i>words </i>were oracles—and 
    deserve to be engraved upon our hearts as with the point of a diamond. This 
    is a golden sentence, "Be wise as serpents—and harmless as doves." Our Lord 
    Jesus, in this chapter:</p>

<p align="justify">first, gives His Apostles their <i>commission</i>;</p>
<p align="justify">second, He foretells their <i>danger</i>; </p>
<p align="justify">third, He gives them several <i>instructions</i>.</p>

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Christ gives His Apostles their COMMISSION.</p></b></font> 
    Before they went abroad to preach, Christ ordained them, verse 5, "These 
    twelve, Jesus sent forth." Those who exercise in the ministerial function 
    must have a lawful call. Hebrews 5:4, "No one takes this honor upon himself; 
    he must be called by God." Christ gave not only the Apostles and Prophets a 
    call to their office (who were <i>extraordinary </i>ministers)—but even 
    pastors and teachers, (who are <i>ordinary </i>ministers) Ephesians 4:11.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But if one has gifts, is this not sufficient to 
    the ministerial office?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. No. As grace is not sufficient to make a 
    minister, so neither are gifts. Therefore it is observable that the 
    Scripture puts a difference between <i>gifting </i>and <i>commissioning</i>. 
    Romans 10:15, "How shall they preach unless they are <i>sent</i>?" If gifts 
    were enough to constitute a minister, the Apostle would have said, "How 
    shall they preach unless they are gifted?" But he says, "Unless they are <i>
    sent</i>," which denotes a lawful call into the office. The attorney who 
    pleads at the bar, may have as good gifts as the judge who sits upon the 
    bench—but he must have a lawful commission before he sits as a judge. If it 
    is thus in civil matters, much more in church matters which are of higher 
    concern. Those, therefore, who usurp the work of the ministry without being 
    solemnly set apart for it, reveal more pride than zeal—and they can expect 
    no blessing. Jeremiah 23:32 says, "I did not send or appoint them. They do 
    not benefit these people in the least." So much for the first, the Apostles' 
    commission; "Those twelve, Jesus sent forth."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Christ foretells their DANGER.</p></b></font> Verse 16, 
    "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves!" The Apostles were 
    going about a <i>glorious</i>, but <i>hazardous </i>work. They would meet 
    with enemies as fierce and savage as wolves. As all who will live godly in 
    Christ shall meet with sufferings, so commonly Christ's ambassadors 
    encounter the deepest trials. Most of the Apostles died by the hands of 
    tyrants. Peter was crucified with his head downwards. Luke the Evangelist 
    was executed on an olive-tree. John was cast by Domitian into a vessel of 
    scalding oil. The emperor Maximinus gave charge to his officers to put none 
    to death, but the leaders and pastors of the church.
<p align="justify">The ministers are Christ's ensign-bearers to carry His 
    colors; therefore, they are most shot at. They hold forth His truth. 
    Philippians 1:17, "I am set for the defense of the gospel." The Greek word 
    alludes to a soldier who is set in the forefront of the battle, and has all 
    the bullets flying about his ears. The minister's work is to part between 
    men and their sins—and this causes opposition! When Paul preached against 
    Diana, all the city was in an uproar, Acts 29. This may stir up prayer for 
    Christ's ministers—that they may be able to withstand the assaults of the 
    enemy, 2 Thessalonians 3:2.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Christ gives the Apostles their INSTRUCTIONS</p></b></font>, 
    whereof this text was one, "Be wise as serpents—and harmless as doves." 
    Note:
<p align="justify">1. The exhortation, "Be wise."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The simile, "as serpents."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The qualification of this wisdom, a wisdom mixed with 
    innocence, "harmless as doves."</p>
<p align="justify">This union of the <i>dove </i>and the <i>serpent </i>is 
    hard to find. Matthew 24:45, "Who then is a wise and faithful servant?" On 
    which place, said Chrysostom, it is a hard matter to find one who is both 
    faithful and wise. Faithful, there is the dove; wise, there is the serpent. 
    It is hard to find both. If one would seek for a faithful man, no doubt, he 
    may find many. If one would seek for a wise man, he may find many. But, if 
    he seeks for one both wise and faithful—it is hard to find. It is possible, 
    though not common. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Moses </p></b>was a man "<i>learned </i>in all the wisdom of 
    the Egyptians," Acts 7:22. There was the <i>wisdom </i>of the serpent. And 
    he was the <i>meekest </i>man alive. Numbers 12:3, "Now Moses was a very 
    humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth." There 
    was the <i>innocence </i>of the dove. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Daniel </p></b>was an excellent person. Daniel 5:14, 
    "Excellent <i>wisdom </i>is found in you." There was the prudence of the 
    serpent. Daniel 6:4, "The administrators and princes began searching for 
    some fault in the way Daniel was handling his affairs, but they couldn't 
    find anything to criticize. He was faithful and honest and always 
    responsible." Behold, here, the innocence of the dove.
<p align="justify">Look at <b>Paul</b>, Acts 23:6, "When Paul realized that 
    some members of the high council were Sadducees and some were Pharisees, so 
    he shouted, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, as were all my ancestors!" By this 
    speech, Paul got all the Pharisees on his side. Here was the <i>wisdom </i>
    of the serpent; and verse 1, "I have always lived before God in all good 
    conscience!" Here was the <i>innocence </i>of the dove. How lovely is this 
    union of the <i>dove </i>and <i>serpent! </i></p>

<p align="justify">The Scripture joins these two together, meekness and 
    wisdom, James 3:13. <i>Wisdom</i>, there is the serpent; <i>meekness</i>, 
    there is the dove. This beautifies a Christian, when he has the <i>serpent's 
    eye </i>in the <i>dove's head. </i>We must have <i>innocence </i>with our <i>
    wisdom</i>—else our wisdom is but craftiness. And we must have <i>wisdom </i>
    with our <i>innocence</i>—else our innocence is but weakness. We must have 
    the innocence of the dove—that we may not harm others; and we must have the 
    wisdom of the serpent—that others may not harm us. We must have the 
    innocence of the dove—that we may not betray the truth; and the wisdom of 
    the serpent—that we may not betray ourselves. In short, innocence without 
    wisdom is too weak to be safe. Wisdom without innocence is too subtle to be 
    good. When wisdom and innocence appear together, they preview the soul's 
    happiness.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Christians must be both wise and innocent. </p>
<font color="#ff0000">
<p align="justify">I. Firstly, Christians must be WISE.</p></font></b> "Be <i>
    wise </i>as serpents."
<p align="justify">Concerning wisdom in GENERAL. Solomon said, "Wisdom is 
    the principal thing," Proverbs 4:7. Wisdom is better than riches, "Happy is 
    the person who finds wisdom and gains understanding. For the profit of 
    wisdom is better than <i>silver</i>, and her wages are better than <i>gold</i>. 
    Wisdom is more precious than <i>rubies</i>; nothing you desire can compare 
    with her!" Proverbs 3:13-15. If the mountains were pearls, if every sand of 
    the sea was a diamond—they would not be comparable to wisdom. Without 
    wisdom, a person is like a ship without a pilot, in danger of wrecking upon 
    the rocks. Job sets forth the eulogy and praise of wisdom, Job 28:13,18, 
    "The price of wisdom is above rubies." The ruby is a precious stone, 
    transparent, of a red fiery color. But wisdom casts a more sparkling color 
    than the ruby. It makes us shine as angels. No chain of pearl you wear so 
    adorns you—as wisdom. Wisdom consists chiefly in three things: </p>
<p align="justify">Knowledge to discern wherein happiness lies; </p>
<p align="justify">skill to judge what will be the fittest means to conduce 
    to it; </p>
<p align="justify">activity to prosecute those things which will certainly 
    accomplish that end. So much for wisdom in general.</p>
<p align="justify">More PARTICULARLY, wisdom is variously distinguished. It 
    is either natural, moral, or sacred.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A <b>natural </b>wisdom is seen in finding out the 
    secrets of nature. Aristotle was, by some of the ancients, called an eagle 
    fallen from the clouds; because he had so profound an insight into the 
    causes of things. This natural wisdom is adorning—but it is not sufficient 
    to salvation. Jerome brings in Aristotle with his syllogisms, and Tully with 
    his rhetoric, <i>crying out in hell.</i></p>

<p align="justify">2. A <b>moral </b>wisdom consists in two things—the 
    rejection of those things which are harmful; and the choosing of those 
    things which are beneficial. This is called prudence. Knowledge without 
    prudence may do harm; many a man's wit has undone him, for lack of wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A <b>sacred </b>wisdom is knowing God, who is the 
    supreme and sovereign Good. Greece was counted the <i>eye of the world </i>
    for wisdom, and Athens the eye of Greece; but neither of them knew God, Acts 
    17:23, "I found an altar with this inscription—<i>To the unknown God.</i>" 
    To know God, in whom is both truth and goodness, is the masterpiece of 
    wisdom. 1 Chronicles 28:9, "And you, Solomon my son—know the God of your 
    father." And this knowledge of God is through Christ. Christ is the 
    looking-glass in which the face of God is seen, Colossians 1:15. </p>
<p align="justify">We know God rightly, when we know Him not only with a 
    knowledge of <i>speculation</i>, but <i>appropriation</i>, Psalm 48:14, 
    "This God is <i>our </i>God." This knowledge of God is the most sublime 
    wisdom, therefore, it is called wisdom from above, James 3:17.</p>
<p align="justify">But to come nearer to the text and speak of the wisdom of 
    the serpent: "Be wise as serpents."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. But must we in <i>everything, </i>be like the 
    serpent?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. No, our Savior did not mean that in everything we 
    should imitate the serpent. I shall show you how we should <i>not </i>be 
    like the serpent—and how we should be <i>like </i>the serpent.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How we should NOT be like the serpent</p></b></font>:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The serpent <i>eats dust</i>.</p></b></font> Isaiah 65:25, 
    "Dust shall be the serpent's food." It was a curse upon the serpent. Thus we 
    should not be like the serpent, feeding immoderately upon <i>earthly </i>
    things. It is absurd for him who has a heaven-born soul, capable of 
    communion with God—to greedily eat the serpent's food. A Christian has 
    better food to feed on—the heavenly manna, the precious promises, the body 
    and blood of Christ. It is counted a miracle to find a diamond in a gold 
    mine; but it is as great a miracle to find Christ, the pearl of great price, 
    in an earthly heart. The <i>lap-wing </i>wears a little coronet on its 
    head—yet feeds on dung. To have a crown of profession on the head—yet feed 
    inordinately on these dunghill-comforts, is unworthy of a Christian.
<p align="justify">What a poor contemptible thing is the world! It cannot 
    fill the heart. If Satan should take a Christian up to the top of the 
    pinnacle and show him all the kingdoms and glory of the world—what could he 
    show him but a <i>pleasant delusion</i>? There is a lawful use which God 
    allows of these outward things—but the sin is in the excess. The bee may 
    suck a little honey from the flower—but put it in a <i>barrel </i>of honey, 
    and it is drowned. The wicked are thus characterized. Philippians 3:19, "Who 
    mind <i>earthly </i>things." They are like Saul, "hidden among the <i>stuff</i>." 
    We should be like <i>eagles</i>—<i>flying </i>aloft towards heaven; and not 
    as <i>serpents</i>—<i>creeping </i>upon the earth and licking the dust!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The serpent is <i>deceitful</i>. </p></b></font>The 
    serpent uses many shifts, and glides so cunningly that we cannot trace him. 
    This was one of those four things which wise Agur could not find out, "the 
    way of the serpent upon a rock," Proverbs 30:19. The serpent is a deceitful 
    creature. We should not, in this sense, be like the serpent, deceitful. 
    Naturally, we too much resemble the serpent for fraud and collusion. 
    Jeremiah 17:9, "The heart is deceitful above all things."
<p align="justify">First, deceit towards <b>man</b>: </p>
<p align="justify">(1) To pretend <i>friendship</i>—to cover malice with 
    pretenses of love—to commend and detest; to flatter and hate; to have a 
    Judas' kiss and a Joab's sword! </p>
<p align="justify">(2) To pretend <i>honesty</i>—to pretend just dealing—yet 
    use false weights.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, deceit towards <b>God</b>. To draw near to God 
    with the lips, while the heart is far from Him. To serve God—and seek 
    ourselves; to pretend to love God—and yet be in league with sin. We should 
    not in this sense, be like the serpent—deceitful and given to shifts. Oh, be 
    upright! <i>Be what you seem to be! </i>God loves plainness of heart, Psalm 
    51:6. The plainer the diamond is, the more it sparkles; the plainer the 
    heart is, the more it sparkles in God's eye! What a commendation Christ gave 
    Nathaniel! John 1:47, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no 
    deceit."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The serpent cast the coat—but another new coat comes 
    in its place.</p></b></font> In this we should not be like the serpent, to cast 
    the coat, to cast off one sin, and have another sin as bad, come in its 
    place. The drunkard leaves his drunkenness because it impairs his health, 
    his credit, his purse—and falls to the sin of deceit. The prodigal leaves 
    his prodigality—and turns miser. This is as if one disease should leave a 
    man—and he should fall into a worse disease. Oh, do not be like the serpent, 
    who casts one coat—and another comes in its place! This is like the man in 
    the gospel, who had one devil go out of him—and seven worse demons came in 
    its place! Matthew 12:45.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The serpent is a <i>venomous </i>creature;</p></b></font> 
    it is full of <i>poison</i>, Deuteronomy 33:24. In this, do not be like the 
    serpent. It is said of wicked men that their poison is like the poison of a 
    serpent, Psalm 58:4. What is this poison? It is the poison of <i>malice</i>. 
    Malice is the devil's picture. Lust makes men brutish—and malice makes them 
    devilish! Malice carries in it its own punishment. A malicious man, to hurt 
    another, will injure himself. Quintillian speaks of one who had a garden of 
    flowers, and he poisoned his flowers that his neighbor's bees, sucking from 
    them, might be poisoned and die. Oh, do not be venomous like the serpent!
<p align="justify">Malice is mental murder; you may kill a man and never 
    touch him. I John 3:15, "Whoever <i>hates </i>his brother is a murderer." 
    Malice spoils all your good duties. The malicious man defiles his prayer, 
    poisons the sacramental cup, and eats and drinks his own damnation. I have 
    read of one who lived in malice and, being asked how he could say the Lord's 
    prayer, he answered, "I leave out those words—<i>As we forgive those who 
    trespass against us.</i>" Augustine brings in God replying thus to him, 
    "Because you do not say My prayer, therefore, I will not hear your prayer." 
    The malicious man is not likely to enjoy either earth or heaven; not the 
    earth, for the "meek shall inherit the earth," Matthew 5:5; nor is he likely 
    to enjoy heaven, for God "will beautify the meek with salvation," Psalm 
    149:4. The malicious man is cut off both from earth and heaven.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The serpent is given to <i>hissing</i>. </p></b></font>In 
    this, do not be like the serpent, hissing out reproaches and invectives 
    against the saints and people of God. They are the <i>seed of the serpent—</i>who 
    hiss at godliness. The Lord will one day reckon with men for all their hard 
    speeches, Jude 15. Lucian was such a one who hissed out and scoffed against 
    religion; and, as a just judgment of God, he was afterwards torn in pieces 
    by dogs.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The serpent stops her ear.</p></b></font> It is an 
    obstinate deafness, Psalm 58:4, "They are like the deaf adder, that stops up 
    its ears." In this, do not be like the serpent, obstinately stopping up your 
    ears to the voice of God's Word. While God calls you to repent of sin, do 
    not be as the serpent to stop your ear, Zechariah 7:11, "They refused to 
    hearken, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear." The Word 
    denounces threatenings against sin—but many, instead of being like the 
    publican, smiting on their breast—are as deaf adders, stopping their ears! 
    If you shut your ear against God's Word, take heed that God does not shut 
    heaven against you! If God cries to you to repent—and you will not hear; 
    when you cry for mercy—God will not hear. Zechariah 7:13, "Since they 
    refused to listen when I called to them, I would not listen when they called 
    to me, says the Lord Almighty."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. The serpent casts her coat—but keeps her sting.</p></b></font> 
    In this sense, do not be like the serpent, casting off the outward acts of 
    sin—and keeping the love of sin. He whose heart is in love with any sin, is 
    a hypocrite.
<p align="justify">A man may <i>forbear </i>sin—yet retain the <i>love </i>
    of it. He may forbear the act of gross sin—for fear of hell. This is like 
    the man who forbears a dish he loves—for fear it should bring a disease or 
    ailment upon him. A man may forsake sin—yet keep the love of sin. He may 
    forsake sin either out of policy or necessity.</p>
<p align="justify">First, <b>policy</b>. Vice will impair his health—and 
    eclipse his credit. Therefore, out of policy, he will forsake it.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, <b>necessity</b>. Perhaps he can follow the trade 
    of sin no longer. The adulterer has grown old—and the prodigal has grown 
    poor. Either the <i>purse </i>fails—or the strength. Thus, a man may refrain 
    from the <i>act </i>of sin—yet retain the <i>love </i>of sin. This is like 
    the serpent which casts off her coat—but keeps her sting!</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, take heed of this! Herein do not be like the serpent. 
    Remember that saying of Jerome, "It is worse to <i>love </i>sin—than to <i>
    commit </i>it." A man may commit sin through a strong temptation, or out of 
    ignorance. And, when he knows it to be a sin—he is sorry for it. But he who
    <i>loves </i>sin, his <i>will </i>is in the sin—and that aggravates it, and 
    is like the dye which makes the wool of a crimson color.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Serpents are chased away with sweet perfumes.</p></b></font> 
    The sweet odor of the storax tree will drive the serpent away. In this, do 
    not be like the serpent, being driven away with the sweet perfumes of 
    holiness. Carnal hearts are only for things which delight the senses. They 
    will discourse of news or money. Here they are in their element; but let a 
    man bring with him the sweet perfume of pious discourse, let him talk of 
    Christ, of living by faith—and this spiritual perfume will drive them away! 
    Oh, do not be in this like the serpent! How do you think to live with the 
    saints in heaven—if you cannot endure their company here? You hate the sweet 
    savor of their ointments—the fragrant perfume of their graces.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. The serpent no sooner casts his skin—but he eats it up 
    again</p></b></font> (as is noted of the <i>stellio</i>, a kind of serpent). In 
    this, do not be like the serpent, to forsake sin—and then take it up again. 
    2 Peter 2:22, "A dog returns to its own vomit, and, a sow, after washing 
    itself, wallows in the mud." Such were Demas and Julian. Many, after a 
    divorce from sin, espouse their sins again. This is as if one's fever should 
    leave him a while—and then come back again. The devil seemed to be cast 
    out—but came again the second time; and the end of that man is worse than 
    his beginning, Luke 11:26, because his sin is greater. He sins knowingly and 
    willfully—and his damnation will be greater.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. Serpents are great lovers of wine. </p></b></font>Pliny, 
    who writes the natural history, said, "If serpents come where wine is, they 
    drink insatiably." In this, do not be like the serpent. Though the Scripture 
    allows the <i>use </i>of wine, 1 Timothy 5:23—yet it forbids the <i>excess</i>, 
    Ephesians 5:18, "Do not be drunk with wine, wherein is excess." Do not be 
    like the serpent in this, being "lovers of wine."
<p align="justify">Because this sin of drunkenness so abounds in this age, I 
    shall enlarge upon <font color="#b07050"><b>the evils of drunkenness</b></font>. 
    It is said of the old world, "people went on eating and drinking—until the 
    flood came and destroyed them all!" Luke 17:27. Drinking is not a sin—but 
    the meaning is they drank to intemperance. They disordered themselves with 
    drink and God let them have liquor enough. First they were drowned in <i>
    wine</i>—and then in <i>water!</i></p>

<p align="justify">There is no sin which more defaces God's image, than 
    drunkenness. It disguises a person and even unmans him. Drunkenness makes 
    him have the throat of a fish, the belly of a swine, and the head of an 
    donkey! Drunkenness is the shame of nature, the extinguisher of reason, the 
    shipwreck of chastity, and the murder of conscience. Drunkenness is hurtful 
    for the body. The <i>cup </i>kills more than the <i>cannon</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Drunkenness fills the eyes with fire, the legs with 
    water, and turns the body into a hospital! But the greatest hurt is what it 
    does to the soul. Excess of wine breeds the worm of conscience. The drunkard 
    is seldom reclaimed by repentance, and the ground of it is partly because, 
    by this sin—the senses are so enchanted, reason is so impaired, and lust is 
    so inflamed. Partly, it is <i>judicial</i>, the drunkard being so besotted 
    with this sin. God says of him, as of Ephraim, Hosea 4:17, "Ephraim is 
    joined to idols—let him alone!" "This man is joined to his cups—let him 
    alone! Let him drown himself in liquor, until he scorches himself in fire!"</p>
<p align="justify">How many woes has God pronounced against this sin. Isaiah 
    28:1, "Woe to the drunkards of Ephraim!" Joel 1:5, "Howl you drinkers of 
    wine!" Drunkenness excludes a person from heaven. 1 Corinthians 6:10, 
    "Drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of God." A man cannot go <i>reeling</i> 
    to heaven. King Solomon makes an oration full of invectives against this 
    sin, Proverbs 23:29-30, "Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who 
    has babbling? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? Those who 
    linger over wine!" </p>
<p align="justify">"Who has strife?" Excessive drink breed quarrels.</p>
<p align="justify">"Who has babbling?" When one is drunk, his tongue runs; 
    he will reveal any secrets of his friend.</p>
<p align="justify">"Who has bloodshot eyes?" Bloodshot eyes comes sometimes 
    from weeping—but too often from drinking; and what is the outcome? verse 32. 
    "In the end it bites like a poisonous serpent; it stings like a viper!" The 
    wine smiles in the glass—but stings in the conscience!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Drunkenness is a sin against all the Ten Commandments.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">1. Drunkenness casts off the true God. Hoses 4:11, "Wine 
    takes away the heart"; it takes the heart off from God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It makes the belly a <i>god</i>. Philippians 3:19. To 
    this <i>god</i>, the drunkard pours drink-offerings; there is a breach of 
    the second commandment.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The drunkard in his cups takes God's name in vain by 
    his oaths.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The drunkard makes no difference of day. He is seldom 
    sober on a Sabbath. On that day, he worships Bacchus.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The drunkard honors neither his natural father, nor 
    the magistrate, his civil father. He will be drunk, though the laws of the 
    land forbid it.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The drunkard commits murder. Alexander killed his 
    friend Clytus when he was drunk, for whom he would have given half his 
    kingdom when he was sober.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The drunkard's wine proves lust. Augustine calls wine 
    the enflamer of lust. "I never believe a drunken man to be chaste," said 
    Jerome.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The drunkard is a thief. He spends that money upon his 
    drunken lust, which should have been given to charitable uses. So he robs 
    the poor.</p>
<p align="justify">9. The drunkard is a slanderer. He cares not, when he is 
    on the ale-bench, how he defames and belies others. When he has taken his 
    full cups, he is now fit to take a false oath.</p>
<p align="justify">10. The drunkard sins against the tenth commandment, for 
    he covets to get another's estate, by circumvention and extortion, that he 
    may be the better able to follow his drunken trade. Thus he sins against the 
    ten commandments.</p>
<p align="justify">If this sin of drunkenness is not reformed, I pray God, 
    the sword is not made drunk with our blood. And, whereas some will go to 
    shift off this sin from themselves, that they are no drunkards, because they 
    have not drunk away their reason and senses, they are not so far gone in 
    drink that they cannot go. He is a drunkard, said Solomon, who <i>tarries 
    long at the wine</i>, Proverbs 23:30. He who sits at it from morning to 
    night, who drinks away his precious time—though he does not drink away his 
    reason. He is a drunkard who drinks more than does him good, and that, 
    though he is not himself drunk—yet he makes another drunk, Habakkuk 2:15, 
    "Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin 
    till they are drunk!"</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, I beseech you, do not be in this like the serpent, <i>
    lovers of wine! </i>This, I fear, is one cause why the Word preached does so 
    little good to many in this city. They drink away sermons. They do as the 
    hunted deer. When it is wounded—it runs to the water and drinks. So, when 
    they have been at a sermon, and the arrows of reproof have wounded their 
    conscience—they run presently and drink away those convictions. They steep 
    the sermon in wine. The tavern bell does them more harm—than the sermon-bell 
    does them good. Thus you have seen wherein we should <i>not </i>be like 
    serpents.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How we should be LIKE the serpent</p></b></font>:
<p align="justify">We should be like the serpent in prudence and wisdom. "Be 
    wise as serpents." The serpent is a most prudent creature; therefore, the 
    devil made use of the serpent to deceive our first parents because it was 
    such a subtle creature. Genesis 3:1, "The serpent was more subtle than any 
    beast of the field." There is a natural wisdom and subtlety in every part of 
    the serpent, and we should labor to imitate them and be wise as serpents.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The serpent has a prudence and subtlety in his EYE.</p></b></font> 
    He has a singular sharpness of sight. Therefore, among the Grecians, a <i>
    serpent's eye </i>was a proverbial speech for one of a quick understanding. 
    In this, we should be like the serpent. Get the serpent's eye; have a quick 
    insight into the mysteries of the Christian religion. Knowledge is the 
    beauty and ornament of a Christian. Proverbs 14:18, "The prudent are crowned 
    with knowledge." Get the serpent's eye, be divinely illuminated. Faith 
    without knowledge is presumption; zeal without knowledge is blind passion, 
    Proverbs 19:2. Without knowledge, the heart is not good. For one to say he 
    has a good heart who has no knowledge, is as if one should say he has a good 
    eye when he has no sight. In this, be like the serpent—of a quick 
    understanding.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The serpent has a prudence and subtlety in his EAR.</p></b></font> 
    The serpent will not be deluded with the voice of the charmer, but stops its 
    ear. In this, we must be wise as serpents, stopping our ears to false 
    teachers who are the devil's charmers.
<p align="justify">We must stop our ears to <b>Arminian </b>teachers who 
    place the chief power in the will, as if that were the helm that turns about 
    the soul in conversion. 1 Corinthians 4:7, "Who makes you to differ from 
    another?" Said one, "I have made <i>myself </i>to differ." Be as the 
    serpent: stop your ears to such doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">We must stop our ears to <b>Socinian </b>teachers who 
    raze the foundation of all religion, and deny Christ's divinity. This the 
    Apostle calls a damnable heresy, 2 Peter 2:1.</p>
<p align="justify">We must stop our ears to <b>Popish </b>teachers who teach 
    merit, indulgences, and transubstantiation; who teach that the pope is the 
    head of the church. Christ is called "the head of the church," Ephesians 
    5:23. For the pope to be head is to make the church monstrous—to have two 
    heads. Popish teachers teach the people nonsense and blasphemy; they cause 
    the people to <i>pray </i>without understanding, to <i>obey </i>without 
    reason, and to <i>believe </i>without sense. It is a damnable religion; 
    therefore, worshiping the beast and drinking the cup of God's indignation 
    are put together, Revelation 14:9. Oh, in this be "wise as serpents." Stop 
    your ears to the <i>charming </i>of false teachers! God has given His people 
    this wisdom to stop their ears to heretics. John 10:5, "A stranger they will 
    not follow—but will flee from him."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The serpent has a chief care to defend his HEAD</p></b></font>—a 
    blow there is deadly! So in this we should be wise as serpents; our chief 
    care should be to defend our head from error. The <i>plague in the head </i>
    is worst. Loose <i>principles </i>breed loose <i>practices</i>. If the head 
    is tainted with erroneous opinions, such as—that believers are free from the 
    moral law, that there is no resurrection, that we may do evil that good may 
    come of it—what sin will this not lead to? Oh, keep your head! Error is a 
    spiritual gangrene, 2 Timothy 2:17, which spreads, and if not presently 
    cured, is mortal. Heresies destroy the doctrine of faith; they rend the 
    mantle of the church's peace, and eat out the heart of religion.
<p align="justify">The Gnostics, as Epiphanius observes, not only perverted 
    the minds of their proselytes—but brought them at last to immorality. <i>
    Error damns as well as vice. Vice is like killing with a pistol; and error 
    killing with poison. Oh, be wise as serpents; defend your head! </i>"Be wise 
    as serpents—and harmless as doves." Our Savior Christ here commends to us 
    the wisdom of the serpent and the innocence of the dove. The elect are 
    called <i>wise virgins</i>, Matthew 25:4. <i>Virgins</i>, there is the dove;
    <i>wise</i>, there is the serpent. We must have innocence with our wisdom—or 
    else our wisdom is but craftiness; and we must have wisdom with our 
    innocence—or else our innocence is but weakness. We must have the innocence 
    of the dove that we may not harm others and we must have the wisdom of the 
    serpent that others may not harm us.</p>
<p align="justify">This union of the <i>dove </i>and <i>serpent </i>is hard 
    to find—but it is possible. The most famous instance of <i>wisdom </i>and <i>
    innocence </i>was in our <i>Savior</i>. When the Jews came to Him with an 
    ensnaring question, Mark 12:14, "Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or 
    not?" Christ answered wisely, verse 17, "Render to Caesar the things that 
    are Caesar's—and to God the things that are God's." Do not deny Caesar his 
    civil right—nor God His religious worship. Let your loyalty be mixed with 
    piety. Here He showed the wisdom of the serpent.</p>
<p align="justify">And would you see Christ's innocence? 1 Peter 2:22, 
    "There was no deceit found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled 
    not again." He opened His mouth in praying for His enemies—but not in 
    reviling them. Behold here the innocence of the dove.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Christians must be HARMLESS.</p></b></font> The second 
    thing I am to speak of is the dove: "be harmless as doves." The dove is an 
    excellent creature. It was so acceptable that, in the old law, God would 
    have the dove offered in sacrifice. The Holy Spirit, when He would appear in 
    a visible shape, assumed the likeness of a dove, Matthew 3:16.
<p align="justify">We should be as doves in three respects: </p>
<p align="justify">(1) In respect of meekness; </p>
<p align="justify">(2) In respect of innocence; </p>
<p align="justify">(3) In respect of purity.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. In respect of MEEKNESS.</p></b> </font>The dove is the 
    emblem of meekness; it is without gall. We should be as doves for meekness; 
    we must avoid unruly anger, which is a <i>temporary madness</i>. We must be 
    without the gall of bitterness and revenge. We must be of mild spirits, 
    praying for our enemies. So did Stephen, Acts 7:60, "Lord, lay not this sin 
    to their charge." This dove-like meekness is the best jewel and ornament we 
    can wear. 1 Peter 3:4, "The ornament of a meek spirit, which in the sight of 
    God, is of great price." Anger disfigures; meekness adorns.
<b><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">2. We should be as doves for INNOCENCE.</p></font> </b>The 
    innocence of the dove is seen in two things: Not to deceive and not to hurt.
<p align="justify">Not to <b>deceive</b>. As the dove is without <i>gall</i>, 
    so it is without <i>guile</i>. It does not deceive. Thus we should be as the 
    dove, without fraud and craft. A <i>holy simplicity </i>is commendable, 
    Romans 16:19, "I would have you simple concerning evil." To be a <i>bungler 
    at sin</i>, not to have the art to beguile, is a good simplicity; as 
    Nathaniel, in whose spirit there is no guile, John 1:47. Where is this 
    dovelike innocence to be found? We live in an age where there are more <i>
    foxes </i>than <i>doves</i>. People are full of guile; they study nothing 
    but deceit, so that one knows not how to deal with them. Psalm 12:2, "With a 
    double heart do they speak."</p>
<p align="justify">Not to <b>hurt</b>. The dove has no horns or talons to 
    hurt—only wings to defend itself by flight. Other creatures are commonly 
    well-armed: the lion has its paw, the boar its tusk, the ram its horns—but 
    the dove is a most harmless creature. It has nothing with which to offend. 
    Thus we should be as doves for harmlessness. We should not do wrong to 
    others—but rather suffer wrong ourselves. Such a dove was Samuel, 1 Samuel 
    12:3, "Whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or whom have I 
    defrauded?" He did not get men's estates into his hands, or raise himself 
    upon the ruins of others. How rare is it to find such doves! Surely, they 
    are flown away! How many birds of prey are there! Micah 7:2, "Godly people 
    have vanished from the land; there is no one upright among the people." 
    These are not <i>doves </i>but<i> vultures!</i> They travail with mischief, 
    and are in pain until they bring forth.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. We should be as doves for PURITY.</p></b></font> The dove 
    is the emblem of purity. It loves the purest air; it feeds on pure grain. 
    The raven feeds on the carcass—but the dove feeds pure. Thus, let us be as 
    doves for sanctity, cleansing ourselves from all pollution both of flesh and 
    spirit, 2 Corinthians 7:1. Christ's dove is pure, Song of Solomon 5:2, "My 
    dove, my undefiled one." Let us keep <i>pure, </i>among <i>dregs</i>. 1 
    Timothy 5:22, "Keep yourself pure." Better have a rent in the flesh—than a 
    hell in the conscience! The dove is a chaste, pure creature; let us be doves 
    for purity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 1.</p></b></font> See here the nature of a godly 
    Christian: he is both <i>wise </i>and <i>innocent</i>. He has so much of the
    <i>serpent </i>that he does not forfeit his discretion—and so much of the <i>
    dove </i>that he does not defile his conscience. A godly man is looked upon 
    by a carnal eye—as weak and naive—as having something of the dove, but 
    nothing of the serpent. To believe in unseen realities, to choose <i>
    sufferings </i>rather than <i>sin</i>—is counted as folly. But the world is 
    mistaken in a believer. He has his eyes in his head—he knows what he does. 
    He is prudent as well as holy; he is wise who finds the pearl of great 
    price. He is wise who provides for eternity. He is the wisest man who has 
    wit to save his soul; he is wise who makes him his friend—who shall be his 
    judge. The godly man acts both the politician and the divine; he retains his 
    ingenuity—yet he does not part with his integrity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 2.</p></b></font> Reproof. It reproves them who have too 
    much of the serpent—but nothing of the dove. Jeremiah 4:22, "Wise to do 
    evil—but to do good they have no knowledge." These are like the devil who 
    retains his subtlety—but not his innocence.
<p align="justify">We have many in this age, like the serpent for <b>
    craftiness</b>. Men have the headpiece of subtlety—but lack the breastplate 
    of honesty. They are wise to contrive sin and to forge plots—to study 
    compliance rather than conscience. The <i>port </i>they aim at is 
    preferment; the <i>compass </i>they sail by is policy; the <i>pilot </i>that 
    steers them is Satan! These have the craftiness of the serpent, "They are 
    wise to do evil."</p>
<p align="justify">They are like the serpent for <b>harm</b>. You know the 
    fiery serpents stung Israel. These have the sting of the serpent. They have 
    a sting in their tongues, stinging the people of God with bitter slanders 
    and invectives. Such stinging serpents were Nero, Diocletian, and Julian, 
    and their spirit is yet alive in the world. These have too much of the 
    serpent in them—but nothing of the dove. 2 Peter 2:3, "their damnation does 
    not slumber."</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">USE 3.</p></b></font> Exhortation. To put in practice our 
    Savior's counsel in the text, join the <i>serpent </i>and the <i>dove </i>
    together: wisdom and holiness. Here lies the knot; this is the great 
    difficulty—to unite these two together, the serpent and the dove, prudence 
    and innocence. If you separate these two, you spoil all.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. <font color="#0000ff"><b>How does a Christian 
    join these two together—the serpent and the dove, prudence and holiness?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">ANSWER. This I shall answer in twelve particulars:</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1.</p></b></font> To be wise and innocent consists in this:<font color="#0000ff"><b> 
    to be sensible of an injury—yet not revenge it. </b></font>A Christian is 
    not a stoic—nor yet a fury. He is so wise that he knows when an injury is 
    done him—but so holy that he knows how to pass it by. This is a most <i>
    excellent </i>temper of soul. I almost said "angelic." As the <i>wind </i>
    allays the heat of the air, so <i>grace </i>allays the heat of revenge. 
    Moses herein showed a mixture of the serpent and the dove. Miriam murmured 
    against him, Numbers 12:2, "Has the Lord indeed spoken <i>only </i>by 
    Moses?" Is he the <i>only </i>prophet to declare God's mind to us? Moses was 
    so wise as to discern her pride and slighting of him—yet so meek as to bury 
    the injury. When God struck her with leprosy, he prayed for her. Numbers 
    12:13, "Heal her now, O God, I beseech You." And, upon his prayer, she was 
    cured of her leprosy. A godly Christian has so much <i>wisdom </i>as to 
    discern his enemy's malice—but so much <i>grace </i>as to conquer his own 
    malice. He knows it is the glory of a man to pass by a transgression, 
    Proverbs 19:11. Though a Christian has so much prudence as to vindicate 
    himself—yet he has so much goodness as not to avenge himself. Behold here 
    the serpent and the dove united—sagacity and innocence.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. </p></b></font>The mixing of wisdom and innocence is seen 
    in this<font color="#0000ff"><b>: to be humble—but not base. </b></font>
    Humility is part of the dove's innocence. 1 Peter 5:5, "Be clothed with 
    humility." Paul, though the chief of the Apostles, calls himself the least 
    of saints. A gracious soul has low thoughts of himself, and carries himself 
    lowly toward others; but, though he is humble—he is not base. Though he will 
    not saucily resist his superiors—he will not sinfully humor them. Though he 
    will not do such proud actions as to make his enemies hate him—yet he will 
    not do such sordid actions as to make them despise him. Here is the serpent 
    and the dove united.
<p align="justify">A godly Christian is so humble as to oblige others—but 
    not so unworthy as to disobey God. Paul, as far as he could with a good 
    conscience, became "all things to all, that he might save some," 1 
    Corinthians 9:20, 22; but he would not break a commandment to gratify any 
    person. When God's glory lay at stake, who was more resolute than Paul? 
    Galatians 2:5. The three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace were humble; 
    they gave the king his title of honor—but they were not sordidly timorous. 
    Daniel 3:18, "Be it known unto you, O king, that we will <i>not </i>serve 
    your gods!" Though they showed reverence to the king's person—yet no 
    reverence to the idol he had set up. A godly Christian will not do anything 
    below himself—nor ever cater to men's lusts. He is humble (there he shows 
    the innocence of the dove); but not base (there he shows the wisdom of the 
    serpent).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. </p></b></font>The prudence of the serpent and innocence 
    of the dove is seen in this:<font color="#0000ff"><b> to reprove the sin—yet 
    love the person. </b></font>We are commanded to reprove, Leviticus 19:17, 
    "'Do not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly—so 
    you will not share in his guilt." Not to <i>reprove </i>sin—is to <i>approve
    </i>it; but this <i>sword of reproof </i>is a dangerous weapon, if it is not 
    well-handled. To reprove and yet love is to act both the serpent and the 
    dove.
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How may a Christian so reprove sin, as to show 
    love to the person? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. In taking a <i>fit season </i>to reprove another; 
    that is, when his anger is over. For example, when God rebuked Adam, He came 
    to him, in the <i>cool </i>of the day, Genesis 3:8. So, when we are to 
    reprove any, we are to come to them when their spirits are more cool and fit 
    to receive a reproof. To reprove a man when he is in a passion, is to give 
    strong drink in a fever—it does more harm than good. By observing a fit 
    season, we show both prudence and holiness; we reveal <i>discretion </i>as 
    well as <i>affection</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Reproving sin so as to show love to the person is seen in 
    this: when, though we tell him plainly of his sin—yet it is <i>in mild, not 
    provoking words</i>. 2 Timothy 2:25, "Instructing his opponents with <i>
    gentleness</i>." Peter tells the Jews plainly of their sin in crucifying 
    Christ—but uses persuasives and gospel promises to allure and encourage them 
    to believe. Acts 2:23, "Him you have taken, and by wicked hands have 
    crucified"; verse 38, "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ 
    for the remission of sin: for the promise is to you and to your children." 
    Reproof is a <i>bitter pill</i>, and hard to swallow; therefore, we must dip 
    it in sugar! Use those sweet mollifying expressions that others may see <i>
    love </i>coming along with the <i>reproof</i>. David compares reproof to <i>
    oil</i>, Psalm 141:5. Oil supplies the joints when they are hard and stiff. 
    Our reproofs, being mixed with the <i>oil of compassion</i>, work most 
    kindly and most soften stiff, obdurate hearts!</p>
<p align="justify">Reproving sin—yet loving the person, is when the end of 
    our reproof is not to <i>revile </i>him—but to <i>reclaim </i>him. While we 
    go to heal men's <i>consciences</i>, we must take heed of wounding their <i>
    names</i>. The surgeon, in opening a vein, shows both skill and love: skill 
    in cutting an artery, and love in letting out the bad blood. Here is the 
    mixing of the serpent and the dove. The wisdom of the serpent is seen in not 
    reproaching the sinner; the innocence of the dove is seen in reclaiming him 
    from sin.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">4. </p></b></font>Prudence and holiness is seen in this:<font color="#0000ff"><b> 
    to know what we should do, and do what we know. </b></font>To know what we 
    should do is the wisdom of the serpent; to do what we know is the innocence 
    of the dove, John 13:17.
<p align="justify">Knowledge is a jewel which adorns him who wears it; it is 
    the enriching and bespangling of the mind. Knowledge is the <i>eye of the 
    soul </i>to guide it in the right way—but this <i>knowledge </i>must be 
    joined with holy <i>practice</i>. To separate practice from knowledge—is to 
    separate the dove from the serpent. Many illuminated heads can discourse 
    fluently in matters of religion—but they do not live up to their knowledge. 
    This is to have good <i>eyes</i>—but to have the <i>feet </i>cut off! They 
    know they should not defame nor defraud; but they do not practice what they 
    know. Here they separate the dove from the serpent, virtue from knowledge. 
    How vain is knowledge without practice! As if one should know a sovereign 
    medicine—but not apply it. Satan is a knowing spirit; he has enough of the 
    serpent. But that which makes him a devil, is that he lacks the dove! He 
    does not practice holiness.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">5. To mix the serpent and dove is to keep two trades 
    going.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">To understand worldly affairs is the wisdom of the 
    serpent; yet to not neglect the soul is the innocence of the dove. God has 
    said, "Six days shall you labor," Exodus 20:9. Religion never granted a 
    patent to <i>idleness</i>. There is a lawful care to be had about secular 
    things. To have knowledge in one's vocation, is a commendable wisdom—but, 
    with this wisdom, join the dove's innocence—follow your vocation, as not to 
    neglect your soul. The soul is a precious thing; it would beggar the angels, 
    to give half the price of a soul. Our greatest care should be to get grace. 
    While you put <i>gold in your bag</i>—do not forget to put <i>oil in your 
    vessel</i>. Trade <i>beyond </i>the East Indies; drive a trade of holiness. 
    "For she is more profitable than silver, and her revenue is better than 
    gold. She is more precious than jewels; nothing you desire compares with 
    her!" Proverbs 3:14, 15. Live in a vocation—but especially live by <i>faith</i>. 
    Look to providing for your <i>families—but </i>especially to the saving of 
    your <i>souls</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul is the angelic part; the loss of the soul can 
    never be made up. God has given a man two eyes. If he loses one, he has 
    another; but he has but one soul. If he loses that, it is irrecoverable! It 
    can never be made up again. Oh, unite the serpent and the dove, prudence and 
    holiness! Use the <i>world</i>—but love your <i>soul</i>; trade on earth—but 
    beware of failing in your trade for heaven. How many part these two, the 
    serpent and the dove? They are wise for the <i>world</i>—but fools for their
    <i>souls! </i>It is too often seen that men pull down their souls—to build 
    up a worldly estate.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">6. </p></b></font>To join the serpent and the dove, prudence 
    and innocence, consists in this: <font color="#0000ff"><b>to know how to <i>
    give </i>counsel—and how to <i>keep </i>counsel. </b></font>He has the 
    wisdom of the serpent who can give counsel. He knows how to advise another 
    in difficult cases, and speak a word in due season. 2 Samuel 16:23, "Every 
    word Ahithophel spoke, seemed as wise as though it had come directly from 
    the mouth of God."
<p align="justify">But this is not enough to have the wisdom of the serpent 
    in being able to give counsel. There must be the innocence of the dove, too, 
    in keeping counsel. If a friend's secret is imparted to us, unless in case 
    of harm, we are not to reveal it. A friend is as one's own soul, Deuteronomy 
    13:6; and what he imparts of his heart, should be kept under lock and key, 
    Proverbs 25:9-10, "Do not betray another man's confidence." To disclose a 
    friend's secret, though it is not treason, is treachery. It is most 
    unchristian; a word may be spoken in secret, which, when it is trumpeted 
    out, may occasion quarrels or law-suits. He who cannot keep a matter 
    committed to him, is like a vessel which leaks out, or a sick stomach which 
    cannot keep the food—but vomits it up again. He who publishes his friend's 
    secret, publishes his own shame.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">7.</p></b></font> To mix these two, prudence and holiness, is
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>to know the seasons of grace—and improve them</b></font>. 
    To know the seasons of grace is the wisdom of the serpent. It is wisdom in 
    the farmer to know the fit time for pruning of trees, and sowing of seed. 
    Just so, it is no less wisdom to know the golden seasons of grace. While we 
    hear the joyful sound, while we have praying hours, while the Spirit of God 
    blows on our hearts—here is a gale for heaven. The day of grace will not 
    always last; the shadows of the evening seem to be stretched out. Things 
    look as if the gospel is tending towards a decline. Be wise as serpents—know 
    what a treasure is put in your hands. And with the serpent, join the 
    dove—that is, in improving the seasons of grace. Doves not only know their 
    season but improve it. They fly to the warmer climate in the spring. Here is 
    the serpent and dove united, knowing and improving the day of grace. When we 
    profit by ordinances, when we mix the word with faith, when an ordinance has 
    stamped holiness upon us, as the seal leaves its print upon the wax. This is 
    to improve the seasons of grace.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">8. </p></b></font>The serpent and the dove, wisdom and 
    innocence, is <font color="#0000ff"><b>to be moderate—yet zealous</b></font>. 
    Moderation is good in some cases. Philippians 4:5, "Let your moderation be 
    known to all." Moderation is good in case of <i>anger</i>. When the passions 
    are up, moderation sits as queen and governess in the soul. It allays the 
    heat of passion. Moderation is the bridle of anger.
<p align="justify">Moderation is good in case of <i>lawsuits</i>. If there 
    is a dispute in law between us and others, we are not to take the extremity 
    of the law, but use Christian equity and mildness. Nay, for peace's sake 
    rather part with some of our rights—than oppress others. This much honors 
    the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">Moderation is good in <i>things indifferent</i>. 
    Moderation and Christian forbearance in things indifferent would much tend 
    to the peace and unity of the church. All this moderation is commendable and 
    shows the wisdom of the serpent; but remember to join the dove with the 
    serpent. We must so exercise moderation, as still to nourish zeal. Paul, in 
    some things, was moderate. Acts 15:25. He was sensitive of laying a yoke 
    upon the consciences of the disciples; but he had zeal with his moderation. 
    When he saw their idolatry at Athens, the fire of his zeal broke forth. Acts 
    17:16, "He was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols!" 
    To be cool and silent when God's blessed truths are undermined or 
    adulterated, is not moderation but lukewarmness, which is to God a most 
    hateful temper. Revelation 3:15, "I would you were cold or hot", anything 
    but lukewarm. This is to show prudence and holiness, when we are <i>moderate
    </i>yet <i>zealous</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">9.</p></b></font> To unite serpent and dove consists in this:
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>when we defend the truth by argument and adorn it 
    by life. </b></font>Defending the truth is the serpent's wisdom. An 
    intelligent Christian can convince gainsayers. This wisdom of the serpent 
    was eminent in Stephen. Acts 6:9-10: "None of them was able to stand against 
    the wisdom and Spirit by which Stephen spoke." We read of John Fryth, 
    martyr, being opposed by three papists. He, like another Hercules, fighting 
    with all the three at once, by his wisdom so convinced them that one of them 
    turned from popery and became a zealous Christian. Herein is the wisdom of 
    the serpent: not only to love those who profess the truth—but to silence 
    those who oppose it. 
<p align="justify">But with this wisdom of the serpent—there must be joined 
    the innocence of the dove. Together with defending the truth by argument, 
    there must be <i>adorning it by life</i>. Titus 2:10, "That they may adorn 
    the <i>doctrine </i>of God our Savior." There are some who can dispute for 
    the truth—but disgrace it by their bad living. This is to act both the 
    serpent and the dove, when we not only plead for the truth but walk in the 
    truth, like Nazianzen, of whom it was said he had thunder in his 
    doctrine—and lightning in his life.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">10.</p></b></font> The uniting the serpent and the dove is
    <font color="#0000ff"><b>to be serious in religion—yet cheerful</b></font>. 
    Seriousness puts the heart in a holy frame; it fixes it on God. Seriousness 
    is to the soul as ballast to the ship: it keeps the soul from being 
    overturned with vanity. The heart is ever best when it is serious—but this 
    seriousness in religion must be mixed with cheerfulness. Cheerfulness 
    conduces to health, Proverbs 17:22. It honors religion; it proclaims to the 
    world that we serve a good Master. Cheerfulness is a friend to grace; it 
    puts the heart in tune to praise God, Psalm 71:21. Uncheerful Christians, 
    like the spies—bring an evil report on the good land. Others suspect there 
    is something unpleasant in religion, when those who profess it hang their 
    harps upon the willows, and walk so dejectedly. Be serious—yet cheerful. 
    Philippians 4:4, "Rejoice in the Lord always." Why was Christ anointed, but 
    to give "a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of 
    mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair!" Isaiah 
    61:3. Joy is as much a fruit of the Spirit, as faith, Galatians 5:22. One 
    way of grieving the Spirit, is by an uncheerful walking. If you would render 
    the gospel lovely, mix the dove and the serpent; be <i>serious </i>yet <i>
    cheerful </i>in God.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">11.</p></b></font> The uniting of the serpent and the dove, 
    wisdom and holiness, consists in this: <font color="#0000ff"><b>when we so 
    lay up—as we lay out</b></font>. It is a duty to provide for our family. 1 
    Timothy 5:8, "If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially 
    for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an 
    unbeliever." To lay up for our family is the wisdom of the serpent; but we 
    must lay out for the poor too—here is the mixture of the dove. 1 Timothy 
    6:17,18, "Charge those who are rich in the world, that they do good, that 
    they be rich in good works." The poor man is, as it were, an altar. If we 
    bring our alms and lay upon it, with such sacrifices God is well-pleased. 
    Faith, though it sometimes has a <i>trembling </i>hand—must not have a <i>
    withered </i>hand—but must stretch forth itself to works of mercy. There's 
    nothing lost by charitableness. Proverbs 11:25, "The liberal soul shall be 
    made fat." Psalm 41:1, "Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor. The 
    Lord rescues them in times of trouble." While men so remember their 
    family—that they do not forget the poor—they show both prudence and piety; 
    they unite the serpent and the dove.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">12.</p></b></font> The serpent's wisdom and the dove's 
    innocence is seen in this: <font color="#0000ff"><b>so to avoid danger—as 
    not to commit sin; to preserve our liberty—yet keep our integrity</b></font>. 
    There is a sinful escaping danger, namely, when we are called to suffer for 
    the truth and we decline it. And there is an escaping danger, without sin. 
    For example, when we do not betray ourselves into the enemies hands by 
    rashness, nor yet betray the truth by cowardice. We have a pattern of this 
    in our Savior. He avoided His enemies in one place that He might preach the 
    gospel in another place. Luke 4:29-30, "They led Him unto the brow of the 
    hill, that they might cast Him down headlong; but He passing through the 
    midst of them, went His way." There was Christ's wisdom in not betraying 
    Himself to His enemy; and verse 43, "I must preach the kingdom of God to 
    other cities also." There was His holiness. Christ's securing Himself, was 
    in order to preach of the gospel. This is to mix prudence and innocence, 
    when we so avoid danger—yet do not commit sin.
<p align="justify">Thus I have, as briefly and as clearly as I could, shown 
    you how we must unite these two, the serpent and the dove, prudence and 
    holiness. For lack of coupling these two together, true religion suffers 
    much in the Christian world. "What Christ has joined together, let no man 
    put asunder." Observe these two: prudence and holiness. Here is the <i>
    serpent's eye </i>in the <i>dove's head</i>. When these two, wisdom and 
    innocence appear together, they are a preview of much good and happiness, 
    which will befall a Christian.</p>
