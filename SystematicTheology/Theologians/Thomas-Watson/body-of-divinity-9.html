<p align="center">7. PEACE</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"May grace and <b>peace </b>be multiplied to you." 1 
    Peter 1:2</p>
<p align="justify">Having spoken of the first fruit of sanctification, 
    assurance, I proceed to the second, namely, Peace. "May <b>peace </b>be 
    multiplied to you."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the several KINDS of peace?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. There is an external peace</p></b></font>, and that is,
    
<p align="justify">(1.) Domestic—or peace in a family. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Political—or peace in the state. Peace is the nurse 
    of plenty. How pleasant it is, when the waters of blood begin to assuage, 
    and we can see the windows of our ark open, and the dove returning with an 
    olive branch of peace! </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Ecclesiastical—or peace in the church. Unity in 
    truth, is the greatest mercy on earth. Ecclesiastical peace stands in 
    opposition to schism and persecution.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. There is a spiritual peace</p></b></font>, which is 
    twofold; peace <i>above </i>us, or peace with God; and peace <i>within </i>
    us, or peace with conscience, which is superlative: other peace may be 
    lasting—but this is everlasting.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Where does this peace come from?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">It has the whole Trinity for its author. God the <i>
    Father </i>is "the God of peace." God the <i>Son </i>is the "Prince of 
    peace." Peace is said to be the "fruit of the <i>Spirit</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) God the <b>Father </b>is the God of peace. As he is 
    the God of order, so he is the God of peace. I Cor 14:33, and Phil 4:9. This 
    was the form of the priest's blessing upon the people. "May the Lord show 
    you his favor and give you his peace." Numbers 6:26.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God the <b>Son </b>is the purchaser of peace. He 
    made peace by his blood. "Having made peace by the blood of his cross." The 
    atonement which Aaron made for the people, when he entered into the holy of 
    holies, with blood, was a type of Christ our high priest, who by his 
    sacrifice pacified his angry Father, and made atonement for us. Christ 
    purchased our peace upon hard terms; for his soul was in an agony, while he 
    was travailing to bring forth peace to the world.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Peace is a fruit of the <b>Spirit</b>. He seals up 
    peace to the conscience. The Spirit clears up the work of grace in the 
    heart, from whence arises peace. There was a well of water near Hagar—but 
    she did not see it, therefore she wept. A Christian has grace—but does not 
    see it, therefore he weeps. Now the Spirit discovers this well of water; he 
    enables conscience to witness to a man who has the real work of grace, and 
    so peace flows into the soul. </p>
<p align="justify">Thus you see whence this peace comes—<br/>
    the Father decrees it, <br/>
    the Son purchases it, <br/>
    the Holy Spirit applies it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">May such as are destitute of grace, have peace?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No! Peace flows from sanctification—but they being 
    unregenerate, have nothing to do with peace. "There is no peace," says my 
    God, "for the wicked." Isaiah 57:21. They may have a <i>truce</i>—but no <i>
    peace</i>. God may forbear the wicked a while, and stop the roaring of his 
    cannon; but though there be a truce—yet there is no peace. The wicked may 
    have something which looks like peace—but it is not. They may be <i>fearless
    </i>and <i>stupid</i>; but there is a great difference between a <i>
    stupified </i>conscience, and a <i>pacified </i>conscience. "When a strong 
    man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace." This is the devil's 
    peace; he rocks men to sleep in the cradle of carnal security; he cries, 
    "Peace, peace!" when men are on the precipice of hell. The seeming peace, 
    which a sinner has, is not from the knowledge of his eternal happiness—but 
    the ignorance of his danger.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the signs of a false peace?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) A false peace has much confidence in it—but this 
    confidence is a false hope. </p></b></font>The sinner does not doubt of God's 
    mercy; and from this <i>presumptuous confidence</i> arises some kind of 
    quiet in the mind. The same word in the Hebrew, <i>cassal</i>, signifies 
    both confidence and folly. Indeed a sinner's confidence is folly. How 
    confident were the foolish virgins!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) False peace separates those things which God has 
    joined together.</p></b></font> God joins holiness and peace—but he who has a 
    false peace, separates the two. He lays claim to peace—but banishes 
    holiness. "I shall have peace, even though I am walking in my own stubborn 
    way." The wicked are loose and vain, and yet thank God that they have peace; 
    what a delusion! <i>You may as well suck health out of poison—as peace out 
    of sin!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) False peace is not willing to be tried.</p></b></font> 
    It is a sign they are bad wares—which will not endure the light. It is a 
    sign a man has stolen goods—when he will not have his house searched. A 
    false peace cannot endure to be tried by the word. The word speaks of a 
    humbling and refining work upon the soul, before peace; but false peace 
    cannot endure to hear of this. The least trouble will shake this peace; it 
    will end in despair. In a false peace, conscience is asleep; but when this
    <i>lion of conscience </i>shall be awakened at death, it will roar upon a 
    man; he will be a terror to himself, and be ready to lay violent hands upon 
    himself.
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">How shall we know that ours is a true peace?</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) True peace flows from union with Christ.</p></font></b> 
    The branch must first be ingrafted into the tree, before it can receive sap 
    or nourishment from it. Just so, we must first be ingrafted into Christ, 
    before we can receive peace from him. Have we faith? By holiness we are made 
    like Christ; by believing we are made one with Christ, and being in Christ 
    we have peace. John 16:33.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) True peace flows from subjection to Christ.</p></b></font> 
    Where Christ gives peace, there he sets up his government in the heart. "Of 
    his government and peace, there shall be no end." Christ is called "a <i>
    priest </i>upon his <i>throne</i>." Christ as a priest makes peace; but he 
    will be a priest upon his <i>throne</i>—he brings the heart in subjection to 
    him. If Christ is our <i>peace</i> in salvation, he is our <i>prince</i> to 
    rule us! Isa 9:6. Whenever Christ pacifies the conscience, he subdues the 
    lust!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) True peace is after trouble. </p></b></font>First, God 
    lets loose a spirit of bondage, he convinces and humbles the soul; then he 
    speaks peace. Many say they have peace—but is this peace before a storm, or 
    after it? True peace is after trouble. First there was the earthquake, and 
    then the fire, and then the still small voice. I Kings 19:12. You who never 
    had any legal bruisings, may suspect your peace. God pours the<i> golden oil 
    of peace</i>, into <i>broken </i>hearts.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Have all sanctified people this peace?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">They have a <i>title </i>to it; they have the <i>ground
    </i>of it. Grace is the seed of peace, and it will in time turn to peace; as 
    the blossoms of a tree turn into fruit, or as milk turns to cream. They have 
    a <i>promise </i>of it. "The Lord will bless his people with peace." They 
    may have peace with <i>God</i>, though not peace in their own conscience; 
    they have the principle and beginnings of peace. There is a secret peace 
    which the heart has in serving God; such meltings and enlargements in duty 
    as revive the soul, and bear it up from sinking.</p>
<p align="justify">But why have not all believers the full enjoyment and 
    possession of peace? Why is not this flower of peace, fully ripe and 
    fruit-bearing?</p>
<p align="justify">Some of the godly may not have so full a degree of peace.
    </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Through the fury of temptation. Though the devil 
    cannot <i>destroy </i>us, he will <i>disturb </i>us. </p></b></font>He disputes 
    against our adoption; he would make us question the work of grace in our 
    hearts, and so disturb the waters of our peace. He is like a subtle cheater, 
    who, if he cannot make a man's title to his land void—yet will put him to 
    many troublesome suits in law. If Satan cannot make us <i>ungodly</i>, he 
    will make us <i>unquiet</i>. Violent winds make the sea rough and stormy. 
    Just so, the winds of temptation blowing, disturb peace of spirit, and put 
    the soul into a commotion.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The godly may not enjoy peace—through mistake and 
    misapprehension about sin.</p></b></font> They find so much corruption, that 
    they think surely, if there were grace, there would not be such strong 
    working of corruption. Whereas this should be so far from discouraging 
    Christians, and hindering their peace, that it is an argument <i>for </i>
    them. Let me ask, Whence is it—that you feel sin? No man can feel sin—but by 
    grace. A wicked man is insensible. Lay a hundred pound weight upon a dead 
    man, he does not complain. Being <i>sensible </i>of corruption, argues a 
    gracious principle. Rom 7:21. Again, Whence is it—that there is a combat 
    with sin—but from the life of grace? Gal 5:17. Dead things cannot combat. 
    Whence is it—that the saints weep for sin? What are these tears, but seeds 
    of faith? The not understanding of this principle, hinders a Christian's 
    peace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The godly may not enjoy peace—through remissness in 
    duty; they may leave their first love. </p></b></font>When Christians abate 
    their fervency—God abates their peace. If you slacken the strings of a 
    violin—the music is spoiled. Just so, if Christians slacken in duty, they 
    spoil the sweet music of peace in their souls. As the <i>fire </i>decays—the 
    cold increases. Just so, as fervency in duty abates—our peace cools.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: Labor for this blessed peace—peace with God and 
    conscience. </p></b></font>Peace with neighbor-nations is sweet. One peace is 
    better than innumerable triumphs. The Hebrew word shalom, peace, comprehends 
    all blessings. Peace is the glory of a kingdom. A prince's crown is more 
    beautiful, when it is hung with the white lily of peace, than when it is set 
    with the red roses of a bloody war. Oh, then, how sweet is peace of 
    conscience! It is a bulwark against the enemy. Phil 4:7. Peace shall keep 
    you as in a garrison; you may throw down the gauntlet, and bid defiance to 
    enemies. Peace is the golden pot and the manna. It is the first fruits of 
    paradise. It is quiet music, for lack of which, a Christian is in continual 
    fear, and does not take comfort in ordinances. Hannah went up to the feast 
    at Jerusalem—but she wept and did not eat. I Sam 1:7; so, a poor dejected 
    soul goes to an ordinance—but does not eat of the feast; he weeps and does 
    not eat. He cannot take comfort in worldly blessings, health, estate, 
    relations; he lacks that inward peace, which should be a sauce to sweeten 
    his comforts. Oh, therefore, labor for this blessed peace. <b>Consider the 
    noble and excellent EFFECTS of peace. 
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) It gives boldness at the throne of grace. </p></font>
</b>Guilt of conscience clips the wings of prayer, it makes the face blush, 
    and the heart faint! But when a Christian has some lively apprehensions of 
    God's love, and the Spirit whispers 'peace,' he goes to God with boldness, 
    as a child to his father. "Unto you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul." Time 
    was, when David's soul was bowed down. "I am bowed down greatly." Psalm 
    38:8. Now the case is altered, and he will lift up his soul to God in a way 
    of triumph. Whence was this? God has spoken peace to his soul. "Your 
    loving-kindness is before my eyes."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) This divine peace fires the heart with love to 
    Christ. </p></b></font>True peace, is the result of pardon. He who has a pardon 
    sealed, cannot choose but love his prince. How endeared is Christ to the 
    soul! Now Christ is precious indeed. "Oh," says the soul, "how sweet is this
    <i>Rose </i>of Sharon! Has Christ waded through a sea of blood and wrath, to 
    purchase my peace? Has he not only made peace—but spoken peace to me? How 
    should my heart ascend in a fiery chariot of love! How willing should I be 
    to live and suffer for Christ!" 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) This peace quiets the heart in trouble.</p></b></font> 
    "This <i>man </i>shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our 
    land, and when he shall tread in our palaces." The enemy may invade our 
    palaces—but not our peace; this man Christ shall be the peace. When the head 
    aches, the heart may be well; and when worldly troubles assault a Christian, 
    his mind may be in peace and quiet. "I will lay me down in peace, and 
    sleep." It was a sad time with David, he was fleeing for his life from 
    Absalom; it was no small affliction to think that his own son should seek to 
    take away his father's life and crown. David wept and covered his head. Yet 
    at this time he says, "I will lay me down in peace, and sleep." He had 
    trouble from his son—but peace from his conscience. David could sleep upon
    <i>the soft pillow of a good conscience</i>. This is a peace worth getting.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What shall we do to attain this blessed peace?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Let us ask it of God.</p></b></font> He is the God of 
    peace; he beats back the roaring lion; he stills the raging of conscience. 
    If we could call all the angels out of heaven, they could not speak peace 
    without God. The stars cannot make day without the sun; none can make day in 
    a dark deserted soul—but the Sun of Righteousness. As the wilderness cannot 
    water itself—but remains dry and parched until the clouds drop their 
    moisture; so our hearts cannot have peace, until God infuses it, and drops 
    it upon us by his Spirit. Therefore pray, "Lord, you who are the God of 
    peace, create peace; you who are the Prince of peace, command it. Give me 
    that peace which may sweeten trouble, yes, even the bitter cup of death."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If you would have peace, make war with sin.</p></b></font> 
    Sin is the Achan which troubles us. Sin is the Trojan horse which brings 
    trouble with it. "King Joram demanded, "Do you come in peace, Jehu?" Jehu 
    replied, "How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of 
    your mother, Jezebel, are all around us?" 2 Kings 9:22. What peace can there 
    be—so long as sin remains unmortified? If you would have peace with God, 
    break the league with sin; give battle to sin, for it is a most just war. 
    God has proclaimed it: nay, he has promised us victory. "Sin shall not have 
    dominion over you." No way to <i>peace</i>—but by maintaining a <i>war </i>
    with sin. "Our peace is a war against the Devil," Tertullian. When Samson 
    had slain the lion—honey came out of the lion. Just so, by slaying sin—we 
    get the honey of peace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Go to Christ's blood for peace.</p></b></font> Some go 
    to fetch their peace from their own righteousness—not Christ's 
    righteousness. They go for peace to their holy life—not Christ's death. If 
    conscience is troubled, they strive to quiet it with their duties. This is 
    not the right way to peace. Duties must neither be <i>neglected</i>—nor <i>
    idolized</i>. Look to the blood of sprinkling. Heb 12:24. That blood of 
    Christ which pacified God, must pacify conscience. Christ's blood being 
    sucked in by faith, gives peace. "Being justified by faith, we have peace 
    with God." No balm to cure a wounded conscience—but the blood of Christ!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Walk closely with God. </p></b></font>Peace flows from 
    purity. "As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them." In the 
    text, grace and peace are put together; <i>grace </i>is the root—and <i>
    peace </i>is the flower. Divine peace is distilled out of a gracious heart. 
    Walk very holily. God's Spirit is a <i>refiner</i>, before a <i>comforter</i>.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: You who have this peace, peace above, peace 
    within— labor to keep it. Peace is a precious jewel—do not lose it.</p></b></font> 
    It is dreadful to have the league of national peace broken—but it is worse 
    to have the peace of conscience broken. Oh, preserve this peace! 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">First, take heed of relapses</p></b></font>. Has God spoken 
    peace? Do not turn again to folly. "I listen carefully to what God the Lord 
    is saying, for he speaks peace to his people, his faithful ones. But<i> let 
    them not return to their foolish ways</i>." Psalm 85:8. Besides <i>
    ingratitude</i>, there is <i>folly </i>in relapses. It was long before God 
    was reconciled and the breach made up—and will you again eclipse and forfeit 
    your peace? Has God healed the wound of conscience—and will you tear it open 
    again? Will you cut a new artery? This is returning indeed to folly. <i>What 
    madness is it to meddle again with that sin—which will breed the worm of 
    conscience! 
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, make up your spiritual accounts daily; see how 
    matters stand between God and your souls.</p></b></font> "I commune with my own 
    heart." <i>Frequent reckonings </i>keep God and conscience friends. Do with 
    your hearts as you do with your watches—wind them up every morning by 
    prayer, and at night examine whether your hearts have gone true all that 
    day, whether the wheels of your affections have moved swiftly towards 
    heaven. Oh, call yourselves often to account! Keep your reckonings even—for 
    that is the way to keep your peace.
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">8. JOY</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"The fruit of the Spirit is <b>joy</b>." Gal 5:22.</p>
<p align="justify">The third fruit of justification, adoption, and 
    sanctification—is <b>joy in the Holy Spirit</b>. Joy is setting the soul 
    upon the top of a pinnacle—it is the cream of the sincere milk of the word. 
    Spiritual joy is a sweet and delightful passion, arising from the 
    apprehension and feeling of some good, whereby the soul is supported under 
    present troubles, and fenced against future fear.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Joy is a delightful passion.</p></b></font> It is contrary 
    to sorrow, which is a perturbation of mind, whereby the heart is perplexed 
    and cast down. Joy is a sweet and pleasant affection—which eases the mind, 
    and exhilarates and comforts the spirits.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Joy arises from the feeling of some good.</p></b></font> 
    Joy is not a mere imagination; but is rational, and arises from the feeling 
    of some good, as the sense of God's love and favor. Joy is so real a thing, 
    that it makes a sudden change in a person; and turns mourning into melody. 
    As in the spring-time, when the sun comes to our horizon, it makes a sudden 
    alteration in the face of the universe—the birds sing, the flowers appear, 
    the fig-tree puts forth her green figs; everything seems to rejoice and put 
    off its mourning, as being revived with the sweet influence of the sun. Just 
    so, when the Sun of Righteousness arises on the soul, it makes a sudden 
    alteration, and the soul is infinitely rejoiced with the golden beams of 
    God's love.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">III. By joy, the soul is supported under present 
    troubles.</p></b></font> Joy stupefies and swallows up troubles; it carries the 
    heart above them, as the oil swims above the water.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">IV. By joy, the heart is fenced against future fear.</p></b></font> 
    Joy is both a <i>cordial </i>and an <i>antidote</i>. It is a cordial which 
    gives present relief to the spirits when they are sad; and an antidote, 
    which fences off the fear of approaching danger. "I will fear no evil, for 
    you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How is this joy wrought?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It arises partly from the promise.</p></b></font> As the 
    bee lies at the breast of the flower, and sucks out its sweetness; just so, 
    faith lies at the breast of a promise, and sucks out the quintessence of 
    joy. "Your comforts delight my soul;" that is, the comforts which distill 
    from the promises.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The Spirit of God who is called the 'Comforter', 
    sometimes drops this golden oil of joy into the soul.</p></b></font> John 
    14:26. The Spirit whispers the remission of his sin to a believer—and sheds 
    God's love abroad in the heart, whence flows infinite joy and delight. Rom 
    5:5.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the SEASONS in which God usually gives his 
    people divine joys?</p></b></font> There are five Seasons. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Sometimes at the blessed Supper.</p></b></font> The soul 
    comes <i>weeping after Christ </i>in the Lord's Supper, and God sends it 
    away <i>weeping for joy</i>. The Jews had a custom at their feasts, of 
    pouring ointment on their guests and kissing them; in the Lord's Supper, God 
    often pours the oil of gladness on the saints, and kisses them with the 
    kisses of his lips. There are two grand ends of the Lord's Supper—the 
    strengthening of faith, and the flourishing of joy. Here, in this ordinance, 
    God displays the banner of his love; here believers taste not only 
    sacramental bread—but hidden manna. Not that God always meets the soul with 
    joy. He may give increase of <i>grace</i>, when not increase of <i>joy</i>. 
    But oftentimes he pours in the <i>oil of gladness</i>, and gives the soul a 
    secret seal of his love; as Christ made himself known in the breaking of 
    bread to the two disciples.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Before God calls his people to suffering.</p></b></font> 
    "Be of good cheer, Paul." Acts 23:11. When God was about to give Paul a cup 
    of <i>blood </i>to drink—he spiced it with <i>joy</i>. "As the <i>sufferings
    </i>of Christ abound in us, so our <i>consolation </i>also abounds." 2 Cor 
    1:5. This made the martyrs' flames, to be beds of roses to them. When 
    Stephen was being stoned he saw heaven open, and the Sun of Righteousness 
    shone upon his face. God candies our wormwood, with sugar.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) After sore conflicts with Satan. </p></b></font>He is 
    the red dragon who troubles the waters; he puts the soul into frights, makes 
    it believe that it has no grace, and that God does not love it. Though he 
    cannot blot out a Christian's evidence for heaven—yet he may cast such a 
    mist before his eyes, that he cannot read it. When the soul has been bruised 
    with temptations, God will comfort the bruised reed by giving joy—to confirm 
    a Christian's title to heaven. After Satan's <i>fiery darts, </i>comes the
    <i>white stone</i>. No better balm to heal a tempted soul, than the oil of 
    gladness! After Christ was tempted, an angel came to comfort him.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) After spiritual desertion.</p></b></font> Desertion is a 
    poisoned arrow which shoots to the heart. "For the Almighty has struck me 
    down with his arrows. He has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my spirit. 
    All God's terrors are arrayed against me!" Job 6:4. God is called a fire and 
    a light: the deserted soul feels the fire—but does not see the light; it 
    cries out, as Asaph, "Has the Lord rejected me forever? Will he never again 
    show me favor? Is his unfailing love gone forever? Have his promises 
    permanently failed? Has God forgotten to be kind? Has he slammed the door on 
    his compassion?" Psalms 77:7-9. When the soul is in this case, and ready to 
    faint away in despair, God shines upon it, and gives it some apprehension of 
    his favor, and turns the <i>shadow of death </i>into the <i>light of the 
    morning</i>. God keeps his cordials for a time of fainting. Joy after a time 
    of desertion, is like a resurrection from the dead.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) At the hour of death. </p></b></font>Of those even who 
    have had no joy in their lifetime. God puts this <i>sugar </i>in the <i>
    bottom </i>of the cup—to make their death sweet. At the last hour, when all 
    other comforts are gone, God sends the Comforter; and when their appetite to 
    food fails, he feeds them with hidden manna. As the wicked before they die, 
    have some apprehensions of hell and wrath in their conscience; so the godly 
    have some foretastes of God's everlasting favor, though sometimes their 
    diseases may be such, and their bodies so oppressed, that they cannot 
    express what they feel. Jacob laid himself to sleep on a stone and saw a 
    vision of a ladder, and the angels ascending and descending upon it. Just 
    so, when saints lay themselves down to sleep the sleep of death, they have 
    often a vision—they see the light of God's face, and have the evidences of 
    his love sealed up to them forever.

<p align="justify">What are the differences between <i>worldly </i>joys and
    <i>spiritual </i>joys?</p></b></font> The <i>gleanings </i>of spiritual joys, 
    are better than the <i>vintage </i>of the worldly joys.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Spiritual joys help to make us BETTER, worldly joys 
    often make us worse.</p></b></font> "I spoke unto you in your prosperity—but you 
    said, I will not hear." Jer 22:21. <i>Pride </i>and <i>luxury </i>are the 
    two worms which are bred from worldly pleasures. Wine is the inflamer of 
    lust. As Satan entered in the <i>sop</i>, so often in the <i>cup</i>. But 
    spiritual joy makes one better; it is like cordial medicine, which, as 
    physicians say, not only cheers the heart—but purges out the noxious humours. 
    Just so, divine joy is cordial medicine, which not only comforts but 
    purifies; it makes a Christian more holy; it causes an antipathy against 
    sin; it infuses strength to live and suffer for Christ. "The joy of the Lord 
    is your strength." Some colors not only <i>delight </i>the eye—but <i>
    strengthen </i>the sight. Just so, the joys of God not only <i>refresh </i>
    the soul—but <i>strengthen </i>it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Spiritual joys are INWARD, they are heart joys</p></b></font>. 
    "Your heart shall rejoice." John 16:22. True joy is hidden within, worldly 
    joy lies on the outside, like the dew which wets the leaf. We read of those 
    who "rejoice in appearance," in the Greek, in the face. 2 Cor 5:12. It goes 
    no farther than the face, it is not within. "Laughter can conceal a heavy 
    heart; when the laughter ends, the grief remains." Proverbs 14:13. Like a 
    house which has a gilded frontispiece—but all the rooms within are hung in 
    mourning. But spiritual joy lies most <i>within</i>. "Your <i>heart </i>
    shall rejoice." Divine joy is like a spring of water which runs underground! 
    Others can see the sufferings of a Christian—but they see not his joy. "Each 
    heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can fully share its joy." 
    Prov 14:10. His joy is hidden manna—hidden from the eye of the world; he has 
    joyful music which others cannot hear. The marrow lies <i>within</i>, the 
    best joy is within the heart.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Spiritual joys are SWEETER than worldly joys. </p></b>
</font>"Your love is sweeter than wine!" Song of Songs 1:2. Spiritual joys 
    are a Christian's festival; they are the golden pot and the sweet manna, 
    they are so sweet, that they make everything else sweet! Spiritual joys 
    sweeten health and estate, as sweet water poured on flowers makes them more 
    fragrant and aromatic. Divine joys are so delicious and ravishing, that they 
    put our mouth out of taste for earthly delights; just as he who has been 
    drinking cordials tastes little sweetness in water. Paul had so tasted these 
    divine joys, that his mouth was out of taste for worldly things; the world 
    was crucified to him, it was like a dead thing, he could find no sweetness 
    in it. Gal 6:14.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Spiritual joys are more PURE, they are not tempered 
    with any bitter ingredients.</p></b></font> A sinner's joy is mixed with dregs, 
    it is embittered with fear and guilt—he drinks wormwood wine. But spiritual 
    joy is not muddied with guilt—but like a crystal stream, it runs pure. It is 
    a rose without prickles; it is honey without wax.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) Spiritual joys are SATISFYING joys. </p></b></font>"Ask, 
    that your joy may be full." Worldly joys can no more fill the heart than a 
    drop can fill an ocean; they may please the palate or imagination—but cannot 
    satisfy the soul. "No matter how much we <i>see</i>—we are never satisfied. 
    No matter how much we <i>hear</i>—we are not content." Ecclesiastes 1:8. But 
    the joys of God satisfy. "Your comforts delight my soul." Psalm 94:19. There 
    is as much difference between spiritual joys and earthly joys—as between a 
    banquet which is <i>eaten</i>—and one which is <i>painted </i>on the wall!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) Spiritual joys are STRONGER joys than worldly joys.
    </p></b></font>"Strong consolation." Heb 6:18. They are strong joys indeed, 
    which can bear up a Christian's heart in trials and afflictions. "Having 
    received the word in much affliction, with joy." These joys are <i>roses 
    which grow in winter!</i> These joys can sweeten the bitter waters of Marah! 
    He who has these joys, can gather grapes from thorns, and fetch honey out of 
    the carcass of a lion! "As sorrowing—yet always rejoicing." 2 Cor 6: 10. At 
    the end of the <i>rod—</i>a Christian tastes <i>honey!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) Spiritual joys are UNWEARIED joys.</p></b></font> Other 
    joys, when in excess, often cause loathing; too much honey nauseates. One 
    may be tired of <i>pleasure</i>, as well as <i>labor</i>. King Xerxes 
    offered a reward to him who could find out a <i>new </i>pleasure! But the 
    joys of God, though they satisfy—yet they never glut. A <i>drop </i>of joy 
    is sweet—but the more of this wine the better! Such as drink of the joys of 
    heaven—are never glutted. Their satiety is without loathing, because they 
    still desire more of the joy with which they are satiated.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(8.) Spiritual joys are ABIDING joys. </p></b></font>Worldly 
    joys are soon gone. Such as crown themselves with rosebuds, and bathe in the 
    perfumed waters of pleasure—may have joys which seem to be <i>sweet</i>—but 
    they are <i>swift</i>. They are like meteors, which give a bright and sudden 
    flash, and then disappear. But the joys which believers have are abiding; 
    they are a blossom of eternity—a pledge of those <i>rivers of pleasure </i>
    which run at God's right hand! "In Your presence is abundant joy; in Your 
    right hand are eternal pleasures!" Psalm 16:11
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Why is this joy to be labored for?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because it is self-existent.</p></b></font> Spiritual 
    joy can exist in the absence of all other carnal joy. This joy does not 
    depend upon outward things. As the philosophers said, when the musicians 
    came to them, "Philosophers can be merry without music;" so he who has this 
    spiritual joy can be cheerful in the deficiency of carnal joys; he can 
    rejoice in God, in sure hope of glory! "Even though the fig trees have no 
    blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vine; even though the olive crop 
    fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in 
    the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will <i>rejoice </i>in the 
    Lord! I will be <i>joyful </i>in the God of my salvation!" Habakkuk 3:17-18. 
    Spiritual joy can go without <i>silver crutches </i>to support it. Spiritual 
    joy is built higher, than upon creatures, for it is built on the love of 
    God, on the promises of Scripture, and on the blood of Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because spiritual joy carries the soul through duty 
    cheerfully. </p></b></font>Religion becomes a recreation. Fear and sorrow hinder 
    us in the discharge of duty; but a Christian serves God with activity, when 
    he serves him with joy. The <i>oil of joy </i>makes the <i>wheels of 
    obedience </i>move faster. How fervently did they pray, whom God made joyful 
    in the house of prayer! "I will bring them also to my holy mountain of 
    Jerusalem and will fill them with joy in my house of prayer." Isaiah 56:7.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It is called the kingdom of God, because it is a <i>
    taste </i>of that which the saints have in the kingdom of God.</p></b></font> 
    "For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of 
    living a life of goodness and peace and <i>joy in the Holy Spirit</i>." 
    Romans 14:17. What is the heaven of the angels—but the smiles of God's face, 
    the sensible perception and feeling of those joys which are infinitely 
    ravishing and full of glory! 
<p align="justify">To encourage and quicken us in seeking after them, 
    consider, that Christ died to purchase this joy for his saints. He was a man 
    of sorrows—that we might be full of joy; he prayed that the saints might 
    have this divine joy. "And now I am coming to you. I have told them many 
    things while I was with them so they would be<i> filled with my joy</i>." 
    John 17:13. Christ knows we never love him so much—as when we <i>feel </i>
    his love; which may encourage us to seek after this joy. We pray for that 
    which Christ himself is praying for, when we pray that his joy may be 
    fulfilled in us.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What shall we do to obtain this spiritual joy?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Walk consistently and spiritually. God gives joy after 
    long and close walking with him. </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Observe your hours. Set time every day apart for 
    God. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Mourn for sin. "Mourning is the seed," as Basil 
    says, "out of which the flower of spiritual joy grows." "I will comfort 
    those who mourn." Isa 57:18.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Keep the <i>book of conscience</i> fair written. Do 
    not by presumptuous sins, blur your evidences. A good conscience is the <i>
    ark </i>in which God puts the hidden manna!</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Be often upon your knees—pray with life and 
    fervency. The same Spirit who fills the heart with sighs—fills it with joys. 
    The same Spirit who inspires the prayer—seals it. When Hannah had prayed, 
    her countenance was no longer sad. I Sam 1:18. Praying Christians have much 
    fellowship with God; and none are so likely to have the secrets of his love 
    imparted, as those who hold correspondence with him. By close walking with 
    God, we get clusters of Eshcol's grapes along the way, which are the pledge of 
    future happiness.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How shall we comfort those who lack joy?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Such as walk in close communion with God, have more joy 
    than others.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Initial joy, joy in the seed. "Light is shed upon 
    the righteous, and joy on the upright in heart." Psalm 97:11. Grace in the 
    heart, is a seed of joy. Though a Christian lacks the <i>sun</i>, he has a 
    day-star in his heart.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A believer has <i>real </i>joy—though not <i>royal
    </i>comforts. He has, as Aquinas says, "joy <i>in </i>God, though not <i>
    from </i>God." Joy in God, is the delight and pleasure the soul takes in 
    God. "My soul shall be glad in the Lord." He who is truly gracious, is so 
    far joyful as to take comfort in God. Though he cannot say that God rejoices 
    in him; he can say that he rejoices in God.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He has supporting joy—though not transporting 
    comforts. He has as much as keeps him from sinking. "You strengthen me with 
    strength in my soul." Psalm 138:3. If a Christian has not God's arm to <i>
    embrace </i>him—yet he has it to <i>uphold </i>him. Thus a Christian who 
    walks with God has something which bears up his heart from sinking; and it 
    is but waiting awhile, and he is sure of those eternal joys which are 
    unspeakable and full of glory!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See that true religion is no melancholy thing—it 
    brings joy. </p></b></font>The fruit of the Spirit is joy. Joy may vary—but it 
    is never totally destroyed. A poor Christian who exists on bread and water, 
    may have purer joy than the greatest monarch. Though he <i>fares </i>hard—he
    <i>feeds </i>high. He has a table spread from heaven—angels' food, and the 
    hidden manna. He has sometimes sweet raptures of joy—which cause jubilation 
    of spirit; he has that which is better <i>felt—</i>than can be <i>expressed</i>. 
    "But I do know that I was caught up into paradise and heard things so 
    astounding that they cannot be told." 2 Corinthians 12:4.
<p align="justify"></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: If God gives his people such joy in this life, 
    oh! then, what glorious joy will he give them in heaven! </p></b></font>"Enter 
    into the joy of your Lord!" Matt 25:21. Here on earth—joy begins to enter 
    into us; there in heaven—we shall enter into joy. God keeps his best wine 
    until last. Heliogabalus bathed himself in sweet perfumed waters. What joy 
    will that be—when the soul shall forever bathe itself in the pure and 
    pleasant fountain of God's love! What joy will that be—to see the orient 
    brightness of Christ's face, and have the kisses of those lips which drop 
    sweet-smelling myrrh! "The Bride will rejoice in the embrace of her Lord," 
    Augustine. Oh! if a cluster of grapes here is so sweet, what will the <i>
    full vintage</i> be! How may this set us all longing for that place where 
    sorrow cannot live—and where joy cannot die!

<p align="center">9. Growth in Grace</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"But grow in grace." 2 Peter 3:18</p>
<p align="justify">True grace is progressive—of a spreading and growing 
    nature. It is with grace as with light; first, there is the daybreak; then 
    it shines brighter to the full meridian. A good Christian is like the 
    crocodile—which continues to grow as long as it lives. The saints are not 
    only compared to <i>stars </i>for their light—but to <i>trees </i>for their 
    growth. Isa 61:3, and Hos 14:5. A good Christian is not like Hezekiah's sun, 
    which went <i>backwards</i>, nor Joshua's sun that <i>stood still</i>—but is 
    always advancing in holiness, and increasing with the increase of God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">In how many ways may a Christian be said to grow in 
    grace?</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">(1.) He grows in the <b>exercise </b>of grace.</p></i> His 
    lamp is burning and shining; therefore we read of a living hope. I Pet 1:1. 
    Here is the activity of grace. The church prays for the blowing of the 
    Spirit, that her spices (that is—her graces) might flow forth. Cant 4:16.
<i>
<p align="justify">(2.) A Christian grows in the <b>degree </b>of grace.</p></i> 
    He goes from strength to strength, from one degree of grace to another. 
    Psalm 84:7. A saint goes from faith to faith. Rom 1:17. His love abounds 
    more and more. Phil 1:9.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What is the right manner of a Christian's growth?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><i><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is to grow less in one's own eyes. </p></b></i>
</font>"I am a worm, and no man." Psalm 22:6. The sight of his corruption 
    and ignorance, makes a Christian grow into a dislike of himself; he vanishes 
    in his own eyes. Job abhorred himself in the dust. Job 42:6. It is good to 
    grow out of conceit with one's self.
<font color="#008000"><i><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The right manner of growth is to grow 
    proportionately, to grow in one grace as well as another.</p></b></i></font> 2 
    Pet 1:5. To grow in knowledge—but not meekness, brotherly love, or good 
    works—is not the right growth. A thing may <i>swell </i>and not <i>grow</i>; 
    a man may be swelled with knowledge—yet may have no spiritual growth. The 
    right manner of growth is uniform, growing in one grace as well as another. 
    As the beauty of the body consists in a <i>symmetry </i>of parts, in which 
    not only the head grows—but the arms and legs. Just so, spiritual growth is 
    most beautiful, when there is <i>symmetry </i>and <i>proportion</i>, and 
    every grace thrives.
<font color="#008000"><i><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) The right manner of growth is, when a Christian has 
    grace suitable to his several employments and occasions</p></b></i></font>. When 
    corruptions are strong—and he has grace able to give check to them. When 
    burdens are heavy—and he has patience able to bear them. When temptations 
    are fierce—and he has faith able to resist them. Then grace grows in the 
    right manner.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Whence is it, that true grace <i>must </i>grow?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is proper for grace to grow; it is an enduring 
    seed, the seed of God. I John 3:9. It is the nature of seed to grow: grace 
    does not lie in the heart, as a <i>stone </i>in the earth—but as <i>seed </i>
    in the earth, which will spring up, first the blade, then the ear, and then 
    the full corn in the ear.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Grace <i>must </i>grow—from its sweetness and 
    excellence. He who has grace is never weary of it—but would have more. The 
    delight he has in it causes thirst. Grace is the image of God, and a 
    Christian thinks he can never be enough like God. Grace instills peace; a 
    Christian, therefore, strives to grow in grace, that he may grow in peace.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Grace <i>must </i>grow—from a believer's ingrafting 
    into Christ. He who is a scion, ingrafted into this noble, generous stock, 
    cannot but grow. Christ is so full of sap, and vivifying influence, that he 
    makes all who are grafted into him, grow fruitful. "From me is your fruit 
    found."</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">What MOTIVES or INCENTIVES are there to make us grow in 
    grace?</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) Growth is the end of the ordinances. </p></font></b>Why 
    does a man lay out cost on ground, fertilize and water it—but that it may 
    grow? The sincere milk of the word is given, that we may grow thereby. 1 Pet 
    2:2. The table of the Lord is on purpose for our spiritual nourishment and 
    increase of grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The <i>growth </i>of grace—is the best evidence of 
    the <i>truth </i>of it.</p></b></font> Things that have no life will not grow: a 
    picture will not grow, a stake in the hedge will not grow; but a plant that 
    has a vegetative life grows. The growing of grace shows it to be alive in 
    the soul.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Growth in grace is the beauty of a Christian. </p></b>
</font>The more a child grows, the more it comes to its maturity, and looks 
    more ruddy. Just so, the more a Christian grows in grace, the more he comes 
    to his spiritual maturity, and looks fairer. Abraham's faith was beautiful 
    when in its infancy—but at last it grew so vigorous and eminent, that God 
    himself was in love with it, and crowned Abraham with this honor, to be the 
    "father of the faithful."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) The more we grow in grace—the more glory we bring to 
    God.</p></b></font> God's glory is more worth than the salvation of all men's 
    souls. This should be our design—to raise the trophies of God's glory; and 
    how can we better do it, than by growing in grace? "Hereby is my Father 
    glorified—if you bring forth <i>much fruit</i>." Though the least grain of 
    grace will bring salvation to us—yet it will not bring so much glory to God. 
    "<i>Filled </i>with the fruits of righteousness, which are to the praise of 
    his glory." It commends the skill of the farmer—when his plants grow and 
    thrive; it is a praise and honor to God—when we thrive in grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5.) The more we grow in grace—the more will God love us.</p></b></font> 
    Is it not that which we pray for? The more growth, the more God will love 
    us. The farmer loves his thriving plants; the thriving Christian is God's <i>
    Hephzibah</i>, or chief delight. Christ loves to see the vine flourishing, 
    and the pomegranates budding. Cant 6:11: He accepts the <i>truth </i>of 
    grace—but commends the <i>growth </i>of grace. "I have not found so <i>great
    </i>faith, no, not in Israel." Would you be as the beloved disciple, who lay 
    in Christ's bosom? Would you have much love from Christ? Labor for much 
    growth, let faith flourish with good works, and love increase into zeal.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(6.) We <i>need </i>to grow in grace. </p></b></font>There is 
    still something lacking in our faith. 1 Thess 3:10. Grace is but in its 
    infancy and minority, and we must still be adding an inch to our spiritual 
    stature. The apostles said, "Lord, increase our faith." Luke 17:5. Grace is 
    but weak. "I am this day weak, though anointed king." So, though we are 
    anointed with grace—yet we are but weak, and had need arrive at further 
    degrees of sanctity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(7.) The growth of grace—will hinder the growth of 
    corruption.</p></b></font> The more health grows, the more the distempers of the 
    body abate. Just so, in spirituals—the more humility grows, the more the 
    swelling of pride is assuaged. The more purity of heart grows—the more the 
    fire of lust is abated. The growth of flowers in the garden does not hinder 
    the growing of weeds—but the growing of the flower of grace does hinder the 
    sprouting of corruption. As some plants have an antipathy, and will not 
    thrive if they grow near together, as the vine and the bay tree; just so, 
    where grace grows, sin will not thrive so fast.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(8.) We cannot grow too much in grace</p></b></font>; there 
    is no excess there. The body may grow too great, as in the dropsy; but faith 
    cannot grow too great. "Your faith grows exceedingly." Here was 
    exceeding—yet not excess. As a man cannot have too much <i>health</i>; just 
    so—he cannot have not too much <i>grace</i>. Grace is the beauty of 
    holiness. Ps 110:3. We cannot have too much spiritual beauty; it will be the 
    only trouble at death, that we have grown no more in grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(9.) Such as do not <i>grow </i>in grace—<i>decay </i>in 
    grace.</p></b></font> "Not to go forward in the Christian life is to turn back," 
    Bernard. There is no standing still in piety—either we go forward or 
    backward. If faith does not grow, unbelief will. If heavenly-mindedness does 
    not grow, covetousness will. A man who does not increase his stock, 
    diminishes it. Just so, if you do not improve your stock of grace, your 
    stock will decay. The angels on Jacob's ladder were either <i>ascending </i>
    or <i>descending</i>. Just so, if you do not <i>ascend </i>in true religion, 
    you <i>descend</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(10.) The more we grow in grace—the more we shall 
    flourish in glory.</p></b></font> Though every vessel of glory shall be full—yet 
    some vessels hold more than others. He whose pound gained ten, was made 
    ruler over ten cities. Luke 19:17. Such as do not grow much, though they 
    lose not their glory, they lessen it. If any shall follow the Lamb in whiter 
    and larger robes of glory than others, they shall be such as have shone most 
    in grace here.

<p align="justify">Use: Lament the lack of growth. </p></b></font>Religion in 
    many, has grown into a <i>form </i>and <i>profession </i>only; this is to 
    grow in <i>leaves</i>—not in <i>fruit</i>. Many Christians are like a body 
    in an atrophy, which does not thrive. They are not nourished by the sermons 
    they hear. Like the angels who assumed bodies, they ate—but did not grow. It 
    is to be suspected where there is no growth—that a vital principle is 
    lacking. Some instead of growing better, grow worse; they grow more earthly, 
    more profane. "Evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse." 2 Tim 
    3:13. Many grow hell-ward; they grow past shame. Zeph 3:5. They grow more 
    rotten.

<p align="justify">How shall we know whether we grow in grace? </p></b>For 
    deciding this question, I shall show:
<p align="justify">1. The signs of our not growing; </p>
<p align="justify">2. The signs of our growing.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The signs of our NOT growing in grace—but rather 
    falling into a spiritual decline.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] </p></b></font>We are a spiritual decline—<font color="#008000"><b>when 
    we have lost our spiritual appetite. </b></font>A consumptive person does 
    not have that appetite for his food, as formerly. Perhaps, Christian, you 
    can remember the time when you hungered and thirsted after righteousness, 
    you came to the ordinances with such an appetite, as to a feast; but now it 
    is otherwise, Christ is not so prized, nor his ordinances so loved. This is 
    a dreadful presage that grace is on the decline; and you are in a deep 
    decline. It was a sign that David was near his grave when they covered him 
    with clothes, and he got no warmth, 1 Kings 1:1. Just so, when a person is 
    covered with the warm clothes of ordinances, and yet has no warmth of 
    affection to spiritual things, it is a sign that he is declining in grace.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] </p></b></font>We are a spiritual decline—<font color="#008000"><b>when 
    we grow more worldly. </b></font>Perhaps we once mounted into higher orbs, 
    we set our hearts on things above, and spoke the language of Canaan; but now 
    our minds are taken off from heaven, we dig our comfort out of the lower 
    mines, and like Satan, we <i>compass the earth</i>. This is a sign we are 
    going down the hill apace, and our grace is in a decline. It is observable 
    when nature decays, and people are near dying, they grow more <i>stooping</i>; 
    and truly, when men's hearts grow more <i>stooping </i>to the earth, and 
    they can hardly lift up themselves to a heavenly thought, if grace is not 
    dead—yet it is ready to die. Rev 3:2.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] </p></b></font>We are a spiritual decline—<font color="#008000"><b>when 
    we are less troubled about sin.</b></font> Time was, when the least sin 
    grieved us, as the least hair makes the eye weep; but now we can commit sin 
    without remorse. Time was, when we were troubled if we neglected closet 
    prayer; now we can omit family-prayer. Time was, when vain <i>thoughts </i>
    troubled us; now we are not troubled for loose <i>practices</i>. Here is a 
    sad declension in piety; and truly grace is so far from growing, that we can 
    hardly perceive its pulse to beat!
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">II. The SIGNS of our growing in grace.</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[1] When we have got beyond our former measures of grace.</p></font></b> 
    It is a sign a child thrives, when he has outgrown his clothes. That 
    knowledge which would serve us before, will not serve us now; we have a 
    deeper insight into Scripture, our <i>light </i>is clearer, our spark of <i>
    love </i>is increased into a flame; there is a sign of growth. That 
    competency of grace we once had, is too scanty for us now; we have outgrown 
    ourselves!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] When we are more firmly rooted in piety.</p></b></font> 
    "Rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith." Col 2:7. The 
    spreading of the root, shows the growth of the tree. When we are so strongly 
    fastened on Christ, that we cannot be blown down with the breath of 
    heretics, it is a blessed sign of growth. Athanasius was called <i>Adamas 
    ecclesiae</i> [the Adamant of the Church,] an adamant that could not be 
    removed from the love of the truth.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] When we have a more spiritual frame of heart.</p></b></font>

<p align="justify">(1.) When we are more spiritual in our <b>principles</b>; 
    when we oppose sin out of love to God, and because it strikes at his 
    holiness. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When we are more spiritual in our <b>affections</b>. 
    We grieve for the first rising of corruption, for the bubbling up of vain 
    thoughts, and for the hidden spring which runs underground. We mourn not 
    only for the <i>penalty </i>of sin—but for its <i>pollution</i>. Sin is a 
    coal which not only <i>burns</i>—but which <i>blackens</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When we are spiritual in the performance of <b>duty</b>. 
    We are more serious, reverent, fervent; we have more <i>life </i>in prayer, 
    we put <i>fire </i>to the sacrifice. "Fervent in spirit." We serve God with 
    more <i>love</i>, which ripens and mellows our duty, and makes it come off 
    with a better relish.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] When grace gains ground by opposition.</p></b></font> The 
    fire burns hottest, in the coldest season. Peter's courage increased, by the 
    opposition of the high priest and the rulers. Acts 4:8, 11. The martyr's 
    zeal was increased by persecution. Here was grace of the first magnitude.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What shall we do to grow in grace?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Take heed of that which will hinder growth</p></b></font>, 
    as the love of any sin. The body may as well thrive in a fever, as grace can 
    where any sin is cherished.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Use all means for growth in grace.</p></b></font> 
<p align="justify">First. "<i>Exercise </i>yourselves unto godliness." The 
    body grows stronger by exercise. Trading of money makes men grow rich. Just 
    so, the more we trade our faith in the promises, the richer in faith we 
    grow. </p>
<p align="justify">Secondly. If you would be growing Christians, be <i>
    humble </i>Christians. It is observed in some countries, as in France, the 
    best and largest grapes, which make wine, grow on the <i>lower </i>sort of 
    vines. Just so, the humble saints grow most in grace. "God gives grace to 
    the <i>humble</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly. <i>Pray </i>to God for spiritual growth. Some 
    pray that they may grow in gifts. It is better to grow in <i>grace</i>, than
    <i>gifts</i>. Gifts are for <i>ornament</i>, grace is for <i>nourishment</i>. 
    Gifts edify others; grace saves ourselves. Some pray that they may grow 
    rich; but a fruitful heart is better than a full purse. Pray that God would 
    make you grow in grace, though it be by affliction. Heb 12:10. The vine 
    grows by <i>pruning</i>. God's pruning-knife is to make us grow more in 
    grace!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How may we comfort such as complain that they do not grow 
    in grace?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">They make mistake; for they may grow, when they think 
    they do not. "There is that makes himself poor—yet has great riches." Prov 
    13:7. The sight Christians have of their defects in grace, and their thirst 
    after greater measures of grace—make them think they do not grow, when they 
    actually are growing. He who covets a great estate, because he has not so 
    much as he desires, thinks himself to be poor. Indeed Christians should seek 
    after the grace they <i>lack</i>—but they must not therefore overlook the 
    grace they <i>have</i>. Let Christians be thankful for the least growth. If 
    you do not grow so much in <i>assurance</i>, bless God if you grow in <i>
    sincerity</i>; if you do not grow so much in <i>knowledge</i>, bless God if 
    you grow in <i>humility</i>. If a tree grows in the <i>root</i>, it is a 
    true growth. Just so, if you grow in the root-grace of humility—that is as 
    needful for you as any other growth.</p>

<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">10. PERSEVERANCE</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Who are <b>kept </b>by the power of God through faith 
    unto salvation." I Peter 1:5.</p>
<p align="justify">The fifth and last fruit of sanctification, is <i>
    perseverance in grace</i>. The heavenly inheritance is kept for the 
    saints—and they are kept for the inheritance. The apostle asserts a saint's 
    stability and permanence in grace. The saint's perseverance is much opposed 
    by Papists and Arminians; but it is not the less true because it is opposed. 
    A Christian's main comfort, depends upon this doctrine of perseverance. Take 
    this away, and you harm piety, and cut the sinews of all cheerful endeavors. 
    Before I come to the full handling and discussing of this great point, let 
    me first clear the sense of it.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. The NATURE of perseverance.</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] I grant, that such as are so only in mere profession, 
    may fall away. </p></b></font>"Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present 
    world." Blazing <i>comets </i>soon evaporate. A building on <i>sand </i>will 
    fall. Matt 7:26. <i>Seeming </i>grace may be lost. It is no wonder to see a 
    branch fall from a tree, which has only been <i>tied </i>on. Hypocrites are 
    only <i>tied on</i> Christ by an external profession, they are not <i>
    ingrafted</i>. Who ever thought artificial motions would hold long? The 
    hypocrite's motion is only artificial, not vital. All <i>blossoms </i>do not 
    ripen into fruit.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] I grant that if believers were left to stand on their 
    own legs, they might fall finally.</p></b></font> Some of the <i>angels</i>, who 
    were stars full of light and glory, actually lost their grace! And if those 
    pure angels fell from grace, much more would the godly, who have so much sin 
    to betray them—<i>if they were not upheld by a superior power!
</i><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] I grant that, although true believers do not fall 
    away actually, and lose all their grace—yet their grace may fail in degree</p></b></font>, 
    and they may make a great breach upon their sanctification. Grace may be 
    dying—but not dead. "Strengthen the things which are ready to die." Grace 
    may be like fire in the embers; though not quenched—yet the flame has gone 
    out. This <b>decay of grace </b>I shall show in two particulars.
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) The lively actings of grace may be suspended. </p></b>
    "You have left your first love." Grace may be like a sleepy habit; the godly 
    may act faintly in piety, the pulse of their affections may beat low. The <i>
    wise </i>virgins <i>slumbered</i>. Matt 25:5. The <i>exercise </i>of grace 
    may be hindered; as when the course of water is stopped. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Instead of grace working in the godly, corruption 
    may work</p></b>; instead of patience, murmuring; instead of heavenliness, 
    earthliness. How did <i>pride </i>put forth itself in the disciples, when 
    they strove who should be the greatest! How did <i>lust </i>put forth itself 
    in David! Corruption may be so lively and vigorous in the regenerate, that 
    they may fall into enormous sins! But though all this is granted—yet they do 
    not <i>finally </i>fall away from grace. David did not quite lose his grace: 
    for then, why did he pray, "Do not take your Holy Spirit from me." He had 
    not quite lost the Spirit. As Eutychus, when he fell from a window (Acts 20) 
    and all thought he was dead—"No, says Paul, there is life in him!" So David 
    fell foully—but there was the life of grace in him. Though the saints may 
    come to that point where they have but <i>little </i>faith—yet cannot come 
    to that point where have <i>no </i>faith. Though their grace may be drawn <i>
    low</i>—yet it is not drawn <i>dry</i>; though grace may be <i>abated</i>, 
    it is not <i>abolished</i>; though the wise virgins <i>slumbered</i>—yet 
    their lamps were not quite gone out. Grace, when at the lowest, shall revive 
    and flourish; just as when Samson had lost his strength—his hair grew again, 
    and his strength was renewed. Having thus explained the proposition, I come 
    now to amplify this great doctrine of the saint's perseverance.
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">II. By what MEANS do Christians come to persevere?</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[1] We persevere by the help of ORDINANCES, as of prayer, 
    the word, and the sacraments.</p></font></b> Christians do not arrive at 
    perseverance when they sit still and do nothing. It is not with us as with 
    passengers in a ship, who are carried to the end of their voyage while they 
    sit still in the ship; or, as it is with noblemen, who have their rents 
    brought in without their toil or labor. But we arrive at salvation in the 
    use of means; as a man comes to the end of a race by <i>running</i>; or to a 
    victory by <i>fighting</i>. "Watch and pray." As Paul said, "unless you 
    remain in the ship, you cannot be saved." Acts 27:31. Believers shall come 
    to shore at last, arrive at heaven; but "unless they remain in the ship," 
    namely," in the use of ordinances, "they cannot be saved." The ordinances 
    nourish grace; as they beget grace, so they are the breast-milk by which 
    grace is <i>nourished </i>and <i>preserved </i>to eternity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] We persevere by the sacred influence and concurrence 
    of the SPIRIT.</p></b></font> The Spirit of God is continually at work in the 
    heart of a believer, to carry on grace to perfection. He drops in <i>fresh 
    oil</i>, to keep the <i>lamp of grace </i>burning. The Spirit excites, 
    strengthens, increases grace—and makes a Christian go from one step of faith 
    to another, until he comes to the end of his faith, which is salvation. I 
    Pet 1:9. It is a fine expression of the apostle, "The Holy Spirit who dwells 
    in us." He who dwells in a house, keeps the house in repair. Just so, the 
    Spirit dwelling in a believer, keeps grace in repair. Grace is compared to a 
    river of the water of life. John 7:38. This river can never be dried up, 
    because God's Spirit is the spring that continually feeds it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Grace is carried on to perfection by Christ's daily 
    INTERCESSION. </p></b></font>As the Spirit is at work in the <i>heart</i>, so is 
    Christ at work in <i>heaven</i>. Christ is ever praying that the saint's 
    grace may hold out. "Father, keep those whom you have given me." Keep them 
    as the stars in their orbs: keep them as jewels, that they may not be lost. 
    "Father keep them." John 17:2. That prayer which Christ made for Peter, was 
    the copy of the prayer he now makes for believers. "I have prayed for you, 
    that your faith fail not," that it be not totally eclipsed. How can the 
    children of such prayers perish?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Arguments to prove the saint's perseverance.</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[1] From the TRUTH of God.</p></b></font> God has both 
    asserted it, and promised it. 
<p align="justify">(1.) God has <b>asserted </b>it. "His seed <i>remains </i>
    in him." "The anointing you have received from him <i>abides </i>in you."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As God has asserted it, so he has <b>promised </b>
    it. The <i>truth </i>of God, the most orient pearl of his crown, is laid as 
    a pawn in the promise. "I will give unto them eternal life, and <i>they 
    shall never perish!"</i> "I will make with them an everlasting covenant: I 
    will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put fear of Me in 
    their hearts so they will never again turn away from Me." Jeremiah 32:40. 
    God will so love his people, that <i>he </i>will not forsake them; and they 
    shall so fear him, that <i>they </i>shall not forsake him. If a believer 
    should not persevere, God would break his promise. "I will betroth you unto 
    me <i>forever</i>, in righteousness and loving-kindness." God does not marry 
    his people unto himself, and then divorce them; he hates divorce. Mal 2:16. 
    God's love ties the marriage-knot so fast, that neither death nor hell can 
    break it asunder!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] The second argument is from the POWER of God.</p></b></font> 
    The text says, we "are kept by the <i>power </i>of God unto salvation." Each 
    Person in the Trinity has a hand in making a believer persevere. God the <i>
    Father </i>establishes salvation, 2 Cor 1:21. God the <i>Son </i>confirms 
    salvation, 1 Cor 1:8. God the <i>Holy Spirit </i>seals salvation, Eph 1:13. 
    So it is the power of God which keeps us. We are not kept by our own power. 
    The Pelagians held that man by his own power might overcome temptation and 
    persevere. Augustine confutes them. "Man," says he, "prays unto God for 
    perseverance, which would be absurd, if he had power of himself to 
    persevere." "And," says Augustine, "if all the power is inherent in a man's 
    self, then why should not one persevere as well as another? Why not Judas as 
    well as Peter?" So that it is not by any other than the power of God, that 
    we are kept. The Lord preserved Israel from perishing in the <i>wilderness</i>, 
    until he brought them to <i>Canaan</i>; and the same care will he take, if 
    not in a miraculous manner—yet in a spiritual invisible manner—in preserving 
    his people in a state of grace, until he brings them to the celestial 
    Canaan. As the heathens feigned of Atlas—that he bears up the heavens from 
    falling; so the power of God is that Atlas which bears up the saints from 
    falling. It is disputed, whether grace of itself may not perish, as Adam's; 
    yet I am sure that <i>grace kept by the power of God cannot perish.
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] The third argument is taken from God's ELECTING LOVE.</p></b></font> 
    Such as God has from all eternity elected to glory, cannot fall away 
    finally! Every true believer is elected to glory, therefore he cannot fall 
    away. What can frustrate election, or make God's decree void? This argument 
    stands like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved. "The foundation of God stands 
    sure, having this seal, the Lord knows those who are his." The foundation of 
    God is nothing else but God's decree in election; and this stands sure; God
    <i>will </i>not alter it, and others <i>can</i> not.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] The fourth argument is taken from believers' UNION 
    WITH CHRIST. </p></b></font>They are knit to Christ as the members to the head, 
    by the nerves and ligaments of faith, so that they cannot be broken off. Eph 
    5:23. What was once said of Christ's natural body is true of his mystical 
    body—"A bone of it shall not be broken." As it is not possible to sever the
    <i>leaven </i>and the <i>dough </i>when they are once mingled and kneaded 
    together; so it is impossible for Christ and believers, when once united, 
    ever to be separated. Christ and his members make one body. Now, is it 
    possible that any part of Christ should perish? How can Christ lose any 
    member of his mystic body, and remain perfect? If one believer may be broken 
    off from Christ, then, by the same rule—why not another? Why not all? And so 
    Christ would be a head without a body!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[5] The fifth argument is taken from the nature of a 
    PURCHASE.</p></b></font> A man will not lay down his money for a purchase which 
    will be lost. Christ died that he might purchase us as a people to himself 
    forever. "Having obtained eternal redemption for us." Would Christ have shed 
    his blood, that we might believe in him for a while, and then fall away? Do 
    we think Christ will lose his purchase?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[6] The sixth argument is from a believer's victory over 
    the WORLD. </p></b></font>The argument stands thus: He who overcomes the world 
    perseveres in grace; a believer overcomes the world; therefore a believer 
    perseveres in grace. "This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our 
    faith." A man may lose a <i>single battle </i>in the field—yet win the <i>
    victory </i>at last. A child of God may be foiled in a single battle against 
    temptation, as Peter was—but he is victorious at last. Now, if a saint is 
    crowned victor, if the world is conquered by him—he must needs persevere.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">IV. I come next to answer some OBJECTIONS of the 
    Arminians.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">[1] The <b>first </b>objection of Arminians is—If a 
    believer shall persevere in grace, to what purpose are admonitions in 
    Scripture, such as "Let him take heed lest he fall;" and, "Let us fear, lest 
    any of you seem to come short." Such admonitions seem to be superfluous, if 
    a saint shall certainly persevere.</p>
<p align="justify">These admonitions are necessary to caution believers 
    against carelessness; they are as goads and spurs to quicken them to greater 
    diligence in working out their salvation. They do not imply the saints <i>
    can </i>fall away—but are preservatives to keep them <i>from </i>falling 
    away. Christ told some of his disciples they would abide in him—yet he 
    exhorts them to abide in him. John 15:4. His exhorting them was not in the 
    least to question their abiding in him—but to awaken their diligence, and 
    make them pray the harder, that they might abide in him.</p>
<p align="justify">[2] The <b>second </b>objection is—"It is impossible for 
    those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who 
    have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of 
    God and the powers of the coming age, <i>if they fall away</i>, to be 
    brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the 
    Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace." Hebrews 
    6:4-6.</p>
<p align="justify">This place of Scripture has no force in it, for the 
    apostle here speaks of hypocrites; he shows how far they may go, and yet 
    fall away. </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They who were once enlightened. Men may have great 
    illuminations—yet fall away. Was not Judas enlightened? </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit; 
    the <i>common gifts </i>of the Spirit, not the <i>special grace</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They have tasted the good word of God. <i>Tasting
    </i>here is opposed to <i>eating</i>: the hypocrite may have a kind of taste 
    of the sweetness of religion—but his taste does not nourish. There is a 
    great deal of difference between one who takes a <i>gargle</i>, and a one 
    who takes a <i>cordial</i>. The <i>gargle </i>only washes his mouth—he 
    tastes it, and spits it out again; but a <i>cordial </i>is drunk down, which 
    nourishes and cherishes the spirits. The hypocrite, who has only some smack 
    or taste of true religion—as one tastes a gargle—may fall away. </p>
<p align="justify">(4.) And have felt the powers of the world to come; that 
    is, they may have such apprehensions of the glory of heaven as to be 
    affected with it, and seem to have some joy in the thoughts of it—yet fall 
    away; as in the parable of the stony ground. Matt 13:20. </p>
<p align="justify">All this is spoken of the <i>hypocrite</i>; but it does 
    not therefore prove that the true believer, who is effectually wrought upon, 
    can fall away. Though comets fall, it does not follow that true stars fall. 
    That this Scripture does not speak of sound believers, is clear from verse 
    9: "But we are persuaded better things of <i>you</i>—and things which 
    accompany salvation."</p>

<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) See the excellence of grace. </p></b></font>It 
    perseveres. Other things are but for a season; health and riches are 
    sweet—but they are but for a season. But grace is the blossom of eternity. 
    The seed of God remains. I John 3:9. Grace may suffer an <i>eclipse</i>, not 
    a <i>dissolution</i>. It is called substance, for its solidity, Prov 8:21; 
    and durable riches, for its permanence. Prov 8:18. It lasts as long as the 
    soul. It lasts as long as heaven lasts. Grace is not like a lease which soon 
    expires—but it runs parallel with eternity.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) See here that which may excite everlasting love and 
    gratitude to God in the saints.</p></b></font> What can make us love God more 
    than the fixedness of his love to us? He is not only the <i>author </i>of 
    grace—but <i>finisher</i>; his love is perpetual and carried on to our 
    salvation. "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I 
    give them eternal life, and they shall never perish." John 10:27-28. <i>"My 
    sheep"</i>—there is election; "<i>hear my voice"</i>—there is effectual 
    calling;<i> "I know them</i>"—there is justification;<i> "and they follow me</i>"—there 
    is sanctification; "<i>I give them eternal life</i>"—there is glorification;
    <i>"they shall never perish"—</i>there is preservation. How may this make us 
    love God, and set up the monuments and trophies of his praise! How much have 
    we done to cause God to withdraw his Spirit, and allow us to fall finally! 
    Yet that he should keep us—let his name be blessed, and his memorial 
    eternalized, who keeps the feet of his saints. I Sam 2:9.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) See whence it is, that saints persevere in holiness.
    </p></b></font>It is to be ascribed solely to the power of God; we are kept by 
    his power, kept as in a garrison. It is a wonder that any Christian 
    perseveres, if you consider: 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1:) Corruption within. </p></b>The <i>tares </i>are mingled 
    with the <i>wheat</i>; there is more <i>sin </i>than <i>grace</i>—yet grace 
    is habitually predominant. Grace is like a spark in the sea—it is a wonder 
    that it is not quenched! It is a wonder that sin does not destroy grace.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2:) Temptations without. </p></b>Satan envies us happiness, 
    and he raises his militia, and stirs up persecution. He shoots his fiery 
    darts of temptations, which are called <i>darts </i>for their swiftness, <i>
    fiery </i>for their terribleness. We are every day beset with devils. As it 
    was a wonder that Daniel was kept alive in the midst of the roaring lions, 
    so there are many roaring devils around us, and yet we are not torn in 
    pieces. Now, whence is it that we stand against these powerful temptations? 
    We are kept by the power of God!
<b>
<p align="justify">(3:) The world's old snares—riches and pleasure.</p></b> "How 
    hard it is for rich people to get into the Kingdom of God! It is easier for 
    a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter 
    the Kingdom of God!" Luke 18:24-25. How many have been shipwrecked upon 
    these golden rocks! "Demas has deserted me, because he loved this present 
    world." 2 Timothy 4:10. What a wonder any soul perseveres in holiness—that 
    the <i>earth </i>does not choke the fire of all holy affections! Whence is 
    this—but from the power of God? We are kept by his power.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: For CONSOLATION. </p></b></font>This doctrine of 
    perseverance is as a magic stone; it is a sovereign cordial to keep up the 
    spirits of the godly from fainting. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is nothing that more troubles a child of God, 
    than that he fears he shall never hold out.</p></b></font> "These weak legs of 
    mine," he says, "will never carry me to heaven." But perseverance is an 
    inseparable fruit of sanctification. Once in Christ—forever in Christ. A 
    believer may fall from some <i>degrees </i>of grace—but not from the <i>
    state </i>of grace. An Israelite could never wholly sell or alienate his 
    inheritance. Lev 25:23. So our heavenly inheritance cannot be wholly 
    alienated from us. How despairing is the Arminian doctrine of falling from 
    grace! Today a saint—tomorrow a reprobate; today a Peter—tomorrow a Judas. 
    This must needs cut the sinews of a Christian's endeavor, and be like boring 
    a hole in a vessel—to make all the wine of his joy run out. Were the 
    Arminian doctrine true, how could the apostle say that the seed of God 
    remains in him, and the anointing of God abides? I John 3:9; I John 2:27. 
    What comfort would it be—to have one's name written in the book of life—if 
    it might be blotted out again? But be assured, for your comfort—that grace, 
    if it is true, though ever so weak, shall persevere. Though a Christian has 
    but little grace to trade with—yet he need not fear breaking, because God 
    not only gives him a stock of grace—but will keep his stock for him. 
    Augustine, "Grace may be shaken with fears and doubts—but it cannot be 
    plucked up by the roots." 
<p align="justify">Do not fear of finally falling away. If anything should 
    hinder the saints' perseverance, it must be either <i>sin </i>or <i>
    temptation</i>; but neither of these can. </p>
<p align="justify">(1:) Not the <b>sin </b>of believers. Their sins humble 
    them. That which humbles them shall not damn them. They gather grapes off <i>
    thorns</i>; from the <i>thorn of sin </i>they gather the <i>grape of 
    humility</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(2:) Not <b>temptation</b>. The devil lays his temptation 
    to blow up the fort of a saint's grace; but he cannot do it. Temptation is a
    <i>medicine </i>for security; the more Satan tempts—the more the saints 
    pray! When Paul had the messenger of Satan to buffet him, he said, "Three 
    times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me." 2 Corinthians 12:8. 
    Thus nothing can break off a believer from Christ, or hinder his 
    perseverance. Let this wine be given to such as are of a heavy heart.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) This perseverance is comfort: </p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1:) In the loss of worldly comforts.</p></b></font> While 
    our <i>goods </i>may be taken away—our <i>grace </i>cannot. "Mary has chosen 
    the better part, which cannot be taken from her."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2:) In the hour of death.</p></b></font> When all things 
    fail, and friends take their farewell of us—yet still grace remains. Death 
    may separate all things from us—except for grace. A Christian may say on his 
    death-bed, "Sight is gone, speech and hearing are departing—but the 
    loving-kindness of God will never depart."
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">Use three: For EXHORTATION.</p></font> What MOTIVES and 
    incentives are there to make Christians persevere?
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">(1.) It is the crown and glory of a Christian to 
    persevere.</p></font></b> It is not the <i>beginning </i>of the Christian life 
    which gets glory, but the <i>end </i>of it. "Gray hair is a crown of glory; 
    it is gained by living a godly life." Prov 16:31. When <i>grey hairs</i> 
    shine with <i>golden virtues</i>, it is a crown of glory! The church of 
    Thyatira was best at <i>last</i>. "I know your works—your love, 
    faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the 
    first." Rev 2:19. The excellence of a building is not in having the <i>first
    </i>stone laid—but when it is <i>finished</i>. Just so, the glory and 
    excellence of a Christian is when he has finished the work of faith.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) You are within a few days' march of heaven. </p></b>
</font>Salvation is near to you. "Our salvation is nearer now than when we 
    first believed." Romans 13:11. Christians, it is but a little while, and you 
    will have done <i>weeping </i>and <i>praying</i>—and be <i>triumphing!</i> 
    You shall put off your mourning garments, and put on white robes! You shall 
    put off your battle armor, and put on a victorious crown! You who have made 
    a good progress in piety, you are almost ready to commence and take your 
    degree of glory! "Our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed." 
    When a man is almost at the <i>end </i>of a race, will he tire, or faint 
    away? O labor to persevere, your salvation is now nearer; you have but a 
    little way to go—and you will set your foot in heaven! Though the way is 
    up-hill and full of thorns—yet you have gone the greatest part of your way, 
    and shortly shall rest from your labors! "Do not be afraid, little flock, 
    for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom!" Luke 12:32.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) How sad is it not to persevere in holiness! </p></b>
</font>You expose yourself to the reproaches of men, and the rebukes of God.
    
<p align="justify">First, to <b>the reproaches of men. </b>They will deride 
    both you and your profession. "This man began to build, and was not able to 
    finish." Such is he who begins in religion, and does not persevere: he is 
    the ridicule and derision of all. </p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, to <b>the rebukes of God</b>. God is most 
    severe against such as fall away, because they bring an evil report upon 
    true religion. Apostasy breeds a bitter worm in the conscience; and it 
    brings swift damnation; it is a drawing back to perdition. "You need to 
    persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what 
    he has promised." Hebrews 10:36. God will make his sword drunk with the 
    blood of apostates.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) The promises of mercy are annexed only to 
    perseverance.</p></b></font> "He who <i>overcomes </i>will, like them, be 
    dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but 
    will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels." Revelation 3:5. 
    The promise is not to him who <i>fights</i>—but who <i>overcomes</i>. "You 
    are those who have <i>continued </i>with me in my trials. And I confer on 
    you a kingdom." Luke 22:28, 29. "The promise of a kingdom," says Chrysostom, 
    "is not made to those who merely <i>heard </i>Christ—but to those who <i>
    continued </i>with him. Perseverance carries away the garland! No man has 
    the crown set upon his head—but he who holds out to the <i>end </i>of the 
    race. O therefore, be persuaded by all this, to persevere. God does not 
    receive those who do not persevere. Who values <i>corn </i>which withers 
    before harvest; or <i>fruit </i>which falls from the tree before it is ripe?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What expedients or MEANS may be used for a Christian's 
    perseverance?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Take heed of those things which will make you 
    stumble and fall away.</p></b></font> 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">First. Take heed of PRESUMPTION. </p></b></font>Do not 
    presume upon your own strength; exercise a holy fear and jealousy over your 
    own hearts. "Be not high-minded—but fear." "Let him that thinks he stands 
    take heed, lest he fall." It was Peter's sin that <i>he leaned more upon his 
    grace</i>, than upon Christ—and then he fell. A Christian has cause to fear 
    lest the lust and deceit of his heart betray him. Take heed of presuming. <b>
    Fear </b>begets prayer, <b>prayer </b>begets strength, and strength begets
    <b>steadfastness</b>. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Secondly. Take heed of HYPOCRISY.</p></b></font> Judas was 
    first a sly hypocrite—and then a traitor. "Their heart was not right with 
    God, neither were they steadfast in his covenant." If there is any venom or 
    malignity in the <i>blood</i>—it will break forth into a <i>plague-sore</i>. 
    The venom of <i>hypocrisy </i>is in danger of breaking out into the 
    plague-sore of <i>scandal</i>. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Thirdly. Beware of a vile heart of UNBELIEF.</p></b></font> 
    "Take heed lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in 
    departing from the living God." Whence is <i>apostasy—</i>but from <i>
    unbelief</i>? Men do not <i>believe </i>the truth, and therefore they <i>
    fall </i>from the truth. <i>Unbelieving </i>and <i>unstable, </i>go 
    together. "They <i>believed </i>not in God." "They <i>turned </i>back."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) If you would be pillars in the temple of God, and 
    persevere in sanctity:</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1) See that you enter into religion upon a right ground</p></b></font>; 
    be well grounded in the foundational truths of Scripture. You must know the 
    love of the Father, the merit of the Son, and the efficacy of the Holy 
    Spirit. Such as know not God aright will by degrees fall away. The 
    Samaritans sided with the dews when they were in favor—but disclaimed all 
    kindred with them when Antiochus persecuted the Jews. No wonder they were no 
    more fixed in true religion, if you consider what Christ says of them: "You 
    worship, you know not what." They were ignorant of the true God. Let your 
    knowledge of God be clear, and serve him purely out of choice, and then you 
    will persevere. "I have chosen the way of truth. I have stuck unto your 
    testimonies."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2) Get a real work of grace in your heart. </p></b></font>
    "It is a good thing that the heart be established with grace." Nothing will 
    hold out, but true grace; it is only this <i>anointing </i>which abides; <i>
    paint </i>will fall off. Get a heart-changing work. "But you are <i>washed</i>—but 
    you are <i>sanctified</i>." Do not be content with baptism of <i>water</i>, 
    without baptism of the <i>Spirit</i>. The reason men persevere not in true 
    religion, is for lack of a vital principle; that branch must wither, which 
    has no root to grow upon.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3) If you would persevere, be very SINCERE. </p></b></font>
    Perseverance grows only upon the root of sincerity. "Let integrity and 
    uprightness preserve me.". The breastplate of sincerity can never be shot 
    through. How many storms was Job in! The <i>devil </i>set against him; his
    <i>wife </i>tempted him to curse God; his <i>friends </i>accused him of 
    being a hypocrite. Here was enough, one would think, to have made him desist 
    from piety! But for all this, he perseveres. What preserved him? It was his 
    sincerity. "I will not deny my integrity. I will maintain my righteousness 
    and never let go of it; my <i>conscience </i>will not reproach me as long as 
    I live." Job 27:5-6.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(4) If you would persevere, be HUMBLE.</p></b></font> 
    Chrysostom calls humility the mother of all the graces. God lets a poor, 
    humble Christian stand, when others of higher abilities, and who have higher 
    thoughts of themselves, fall off by apostasy. They are most likely to 
    persevere, to whom God gives most grace. "He gives grace to the humble." 
    They are most likely to persevere, who have God dwelling in them. "God 
    dwells in the humble soul." "The Holy Spirit will only come to rest over a 
    humble soul," Bernard. The <i>lower </i>the tree roots in the earth—the 
    firmer it is. Just so, the more the soul is rooted in humility—the more 
    established it is, and is in less danger of falling away.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(5) Would you persevere? Nourish the grace of FAITH. </p></b>
</font>Faith is our support. "By faith you stand." Faith knits us to Christ, 
    as the members are knit to the head by nerves and sinews. Faith fills us 
    with love to God. "Faith works by love." He who loves God will rather die 
    than desert him; as the soldier who loves his general will die in his 
    service. Faith gives us a glimpse of heaven; it shows us the invisible 
    glory! He who has Christ in his heart, and a crown in his eye—will not faint 
    away. O nourish faith! Keep your faith—and your faith will keep you. While 
    the pilot keeps his ship—his ship keeps him.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(6) Would we persevere? Let us seek God's power to help 
    us.</p></b></font> We are kept by the power of God. The child is safest when it 
    is held in the father's arms. Just so, we are safest, when we are held in 
    the arms of free grace! It is not <i>our </i>holding God—but <i>his </i>
    holding us, which preserves us. When a boat is tied to a rock, it is secure. 
    Just so—when we are fast tied to the Rock of Ages, we are impregnable. O 
    engage God's power to help you to persevere. We engage his power by <b>
    prayer</b>. Let us pray to him to keep us. "Hold up my goings in your path, 
    that my footsteps slip not." "Hold me up—and I shall be safe!" Psalm 
    119:117. It was a good prayer of Beza, "Lord, perfect what you have begun in 
    me, that I may not suffer shipwreck when I am almost at the haven."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(7) If you would persevere, set before your eyes the 
    noble examples of those who have persevered in piety.</p></b></font> How many 
    martyrs, how many faithful souls are even now rejoicing in Heaven! What a 
    glorious army of saints and martyrs have gone before us! How constant to the 
    death, was Paul! "Why all this weeping? You are breaking my heart! For I am 
    ready not only to be jailed at Jerusalem but also to die for the sake of the 
    Lord Jesus." Acts 21:13. How persevering in the faith were Ignatius, 
    Polycarp, and Athanasius! They were stars in their orbs, pillars in the 
    temple of God. Let us look on their zeal and courage, and be animated. 
    "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the 
    life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially 
    the sin that so easily hinders our progress. And let us run with endurance 
    the race that God has set before us." Hebrews 12:1. The <i>crown </i>is set 
    at the <i>end </i>of the race! If we finish the race—we shall wear the 
    crown!
