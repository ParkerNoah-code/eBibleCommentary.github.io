<p align="center"><font size="4">1. FAITH</font></p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, 
    but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the 
    Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." Galatians 2:20 </p>
<p align="justify">The Spirit applies to us the redemption purchased by 
    Christ, by working faith in us.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is the glory of the gospel, and faith in Christ 
    the comfort of the gospel.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the kinds of faith?</p></b></font> Fourfold: 
<p align="justify">(1.) A <b>historical </b>or <b>dogmatic </b>faith, which 
    is believing the truths revealed in the Word, because of divine authority.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is a <b>temporary </b>faith, which lasts for a 
    time, and then vanishes. "Yet has he no root in himself—but endures for a 
    while." A temporary faith is like Jonah's gourd, which came up in a night 
    and withered.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A <b>miraculous </b>faith, which was granted to the 
    apostles, to work miracles for the confirmation of the gospel. This Judas 
    had; he cast out devils—yet was cast out to the devil.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) A true <b>justifying </b>faith, which is called "A 
    faith of the operation of God," and is a jewel hung only upon the elect. Col 
    2:12.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What is justifying faith? </p></b></font>I shall show, 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) What it is not.</p></b></font> It is not a bare 
    acknowledgment that Christ is a Savior. There must be this acknowledgment, 
    but that is not sufficient to justify. The devils acknowledged Christ's 
    Godhead. "Jesus the Son of God." There may be an assent to divine truth, and 
    yet no work of grace on the heart. Many assent in their judgements, that sin 
    is an evil thing—but they go on in sin, whose corruptions are stronger than 
    their convictions. Many assent that Christ is excellent; they cheapen the 
    pearl—but do not buy.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) What justifying faith is. </p></b></font>True justifying 
    faith consists in three things:
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1:) Self-renunciation. </p></b></font>Faith is going out of 
    one's self, being taken off from our own merits, and seeing we have no 
    righteousness of our own. "Not having my own righteousness." 
    Self-righteousness is a broken reed, which the soul dares not lean on. 
    Repentance and faith are both humbling graces; by <i>repentance </i>a man 
    abhors himself; by <i>faith </i>he goes out of himself. As Israel in their 
    wilderness march, behind them saw Pharaoh and his chariots pursuing, before 
    them the Red Sea ready to devour; so the sinner behind sees God's justice 
    pursuing him for sin, before, hell ready to devour him; and in this forlorn 
    condition, he sees nothing in himself to help—but he must perish unless he 
    can find help in another.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2:) Reliance.</p></b></font> The soul casts itself upon 
    Jesus Christ; faith rests on Christ's person. Faith believes the promise; 
    but that which faith rests upon in the promise—is the person of Christ: 
    therefore the spouse is said to "lean upon her Beloved." Faith is described 
    to be "believing on the name of the Son of God," namely, on his person. The
    <i>promise </i>is but the cabinet, <i>Christ </i>is the jewel in it which 
    faith embraces. The promise is but the dish, Christ is the food in it which 
    faith feeds on. Faith rests on Christ's person, "as he was crucified." It 
    glories in the cross of Christ. Gal 6:14. To consider Christ crowned with 
    all manner of excellencies, stirs up admiration and wonder; but Christ 
    looked upon as bleeding and dying, is the proper object of our faith; it is 
    called therefore "faith in his blood." Rom 3:25.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3:) Appropriation, or applying Christ to ourselves. </p></b>
</font>A medicine, though it be ever so sovereign, if not applied, will do 
    no good. Though the plaster is made of Christ's own blood, it will not heal, 
    unless applied by faith; the blood of God, without faith in God, will not 
    save. This applying of Christ is called receiving him. John 1:12. The hand 
    receiving gold, enriches. Just so, the hand of faith, receiving Christ's 
    golden merits with salvation, enriches us.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How is faith wrought?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">By the blessed Spirit; who is called the "Spirit of 
    grace," because he is the spring of all grace. Zech 12:10. Faith is the 
    chief work which the Spirit of God works in a man's heart. In making the 
    world God did but <i>speak </i>a word—but in working faith he puts forth his
    <i>arm</i>. Luke 1:51. The Spirit's working faith is called, "The exceeding 
    greatness of God's power." Eph 1:19. What a power was put forth in raising 
    Christ from the grave when such a tombstone lay upon him as the sins of all 
    the world—yet he was raised up by the Spirit. The same power is put forth by 
    the Spirit of God, in working faith. The Spirit irradiates the mind, and 
    subdues the will. The will is like a garrison, which holds out against God: 
    the Spirit with sweet violence conquers, or rather changes it; making the 
    sinner willing to have Christ upon any terms; to be ruled by him as well as 
    saved by him.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Wherein lies the preciousness of faith?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) In its being the chief gospel-grace, the head of the 
    graces.</p></b></font> As gold among the metals, so is faith among the graces. 
    Clement calls the other graces, <i>the daughters of faith</i>. In heaven, 
    love will be the chief grace; but, while we are here, love must give place 
    to faith. Love takes possession of glory—but faith gives a title to it. Love 
    is the crowning grace in heaven—but faith is the conquering grace upon 
    earth. "This is the victory which overcomes the world, even our faith."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) In its having influence upon all the graces, and 
    setting them to work.</p></b></font> Not a grace stirs—until faith sets it to 
    work. Faith sets <b>hope </b>to work. The heir must believe his title to the 
    glories of heaven, before he can hope for it; faith believes its title to 
    glory, and then hope waits for it. If faith did not feed the lamp of hope 
    with oil, it would soon die. Faith sets <b>love </b>to work. "Faith which 
    works by love." Believing the mercy and merit of Christ, causes a flame of 
    love to ascend. Faith sets <b>patience </b>to work. "Be followers of those 
    who through faith and patience inherit the promises." Faith believes the 
    glorious rewards given to suffering. This makes the soul patient in 
    suffering. Thus faith is the master-wheel, it sets all the other graces 
    running.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Faith is the grace which God honors—to justify and 
    save. </p></b></font>Thus indeed it is "precious faith," as the apostle calls 
    it. The other graces help to sanctify—but it is faith that justifies. "Being 
    justified by faith." Repentance or love do not justify—but faith does.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How does faith justify?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">(1.) Faith does not justify as it is a work, which would 
    make a <i>savior </i>of our faith; but faith justifies, as it lays hold of 
    the object, namely, Christ's merits. If a man had a precious stone in a ring 
    that could heal, we should say the ring heals; but properly it is not the 
    ring—but the precious stone in the ring that heals. Thus faith saves and 
    justifies—but it is not any inherent virtue in faith—but only as faith lays 
    hold on Christ, that it justifies.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Faith does not justify as it exercises grace. It 
    cannot be denied, that faith invigorates all the graces, puts strength and 
    liveliness into them—but it does not justify under this notion. Faith works 
    by love—but it does not justify as it works by love—but as it applies 
    Christ's merits.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Why should faith save and justify more than any other 
    grace?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because of God's purpose. </p></b></font>He has 
    appointed this grace to be justifying; and he does it, because faith is a 
    grace that takes a man off himself, and gives all the honor to Christ and 
    free grace. "Strong in faith, giving glory to God." Therefore God has put 
    this honor on faith—to make it saving and justifying. The king's stamp makes 
    the coin pass for current. Just so, God having put his sanction, the stamp 
    of his authority and institution upon faith, makes it to be justifying and 
    saving.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because faith makes us one with Christ.</p></b></font> 
    Eph 3:17. Faith is the espousing, incorporating grace, it gives us coalition 
    and union with Christ's person. Other graces make us like Christ; faith 
    makes us members of Christ.
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">Use one: Of EXHORTATION.</p></font> </b>Let us above all 
    things labor for faith. "Above all, taking the shield of faith." Faith will 
    be of more use to us than any grace; as an eye, though dim, was of more use 
    to an Israelite than all the other members of his body, a strong arm, or a 
    nimble foot. It was his eye looking on the brazen serpent, which cured him. 
    It is not knowledge, though angelic, not repentance, though we could shed 
    rivers of tears which can justify us; only faith, whereby we look on Christ. 
    "Without faith it is impossible to please God." If we do not please him by 
    believing, he will not please us in saving. Faith is the condition of the 
    covenant of grace; without faith—without covenant; and without 
    covenant—without any hope of salvation. Eph 2:12.
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">Use two: Of TRIAL.</p></font> </b>Let us try whether we have 
    faith. There is something that looks like faith, and is not, as a 
    Bristol-stone looks like a diamond. Some plants have the same leaf with 
    others—but the herbalist can distinguish them by the root and taste. Some 
    faith may look like true faith—but it may be distinguished by the fruits. 
    Let us be serious in the trial of our faith. Much depends upon our faith; 
    for if our faith is not good, nothing good comes from us—even our duties and 
    graces are adulterated.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">How shall we know if we have true saving faith? </p></b>
</font>By the noble <b>fruits</b> and <b>effects</b> of saving faith. 
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Faith is a Christ-prizing grace—it puts a high 
    valuation upon Christ. </p></b>"To you that believe, he is precious." Paul best 
    knew Christ. "Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?" He saw Christ with his 
    bodily eyes in a vision, when he was caught up into the third heaven; and 
    with the eye of his faith in the Holy Supper; therefore he best knew Christ. 
    And see how he styles all things in comparison of him. "I count all things 
    but dung, that I may win Christ." Do we set a high estimate upon Christ? 
    Could we be willing to part with the wedge of gold—for the pearl of great 
    price?
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Faith is a refining grace. </p></b>Faith is in the soul 
    as fire among metals; it refines and purifies. Morality may wash the 
    outside, faith washes the inside. "Having purified their hearts by faith." 
    Faith makes the heart a holy of holies. Faith is a virgin-grace: though it 
    does not take away the <i>life </i>of sin—yet it takes away the <i>love </i>
    of sin. Examine if your hearts are an unclean fountain, sending out the mud 
    and mire of pride and envy. If there are legions of lusts in your soul, 
    there is no faith. Faith is a heavenly plant, which will not grow in an 
    impure soil.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) Faith is an obediential grace. </p></b>"The obedience of 
    faith." Faith melts our will into God's. It runs at God's call. If God 
    commands duty (though cross to flesh and blood) faith obeys. "By faith 
    Abraham obeyed." Heb 11:1. Faith is not an idle grace; as it has an eye to 
    see Christ, so it has a hand to work for him. It not only believes God's 
    promise—but obeys his command. It is not having knowledge that will evidence 
    you to be believers; the devil has knowledge—but lacks obedience, and that 
    makes him a devil. The true obedience of faith, is a cheerful obedience. 
    God's commands do not seem grievous. Have you obedience, and obey 
    cheerfully? Do you look upon God's command as your burden—or privilege; as 
    an iron fetter about your leg—or as a gold chain about your neck.
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Faith is an assimilating grace. </p></b>It changes the 
    soul into the image of the object; it makes it like Christ. Never did any 
    look upon Christ with a believing eye—but he was made like Christ. A 
    deformed person may look on a beautiful object, and not be made beautiful; 
    but faith looking on Christ transforms a man, and turns him into his 
    similitude. Looking on a bleeding Christ, causes a soft bleeding heart. 
    Looking on a holy Christ causes sanctity of heart. Looking on a humble 
    Christ makes the soul humble. As the chameleon is changed into the color of 
    that which it looks upon, so faith, looking on Christ, changes the Christian 
    into the similitude of Christ.
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) True faith grows.</p></b> All living things grow. "From 
    faith to faith." How may we judge of the growth of faith?
<p align="justify">Growth of faith is judged by strength. We can do that 
    now, which we could not do before. When one is man-grown, he can do that 
    which he could not do when he was a child; he can carry a heavier burden; so 
    you can bear crosses with more patience.</p>
<p align="justify">Growth of faith is seen by doing duties in a more 
    spiritual manner, with more fervency; we put coals to the incense, from a 
    principle of love to God. When an apple has done growing in bigness, it 
    grows in sweetness; so you perform duties in love and are sweeter, and come 
    off with a better relish.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">But I fear I have no faith.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">We must distinguish between <i>weakness </i>of faith—and
    <i>no </i>faith. A weak faith is true. The bruised reed is but weak—yet it 
    is such as Christ will not break. Though your faith is weak, be not 
    discouraged.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) A weak faith may receive a strong Christ.</p></b> A weak
    <i>hand </i>can tie the knot in marriage, as well as a strong one. A weak <i>
    eye </i>might have seen the brazen serpent. The woman in the gospel did but
    <i>touch </i>Christ's garment, and received virtue from him. It was the 
    touch of faith.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The promise is not made to strong faith—but to true 
    faith. </p></b>The promise does not say—whoever has a <i>giant</i>-faith, which 
    can remove mountains, which can stop the mouths of lions—shall be saved. But 
    the promise is made to <i>whoever </i>believes, be his faith ever so small. 
    Though Christ sometimes chides a weak faith—yet that it may not be 
    discouraged, he makes it a promise. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for 
    theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:3.
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) A weak faith may be fruitful. </p></b>Weakest things 
    multiply most; the vine is a weak plant—but it is fruitful. Weak Christians 
    may have strong affections. How strong is the first love, which is after the 
    first planting of faith!
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) Weak faith may be growing.</p></b> Seeds spring up by 
    degrees; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. 
    Therefore, be not discouraged. God, who would have <i>us </i>receive those 
    who are weak in faith, will not <i>himself </i>refuse them. Rom 14:1. A weak 
    believer is a member of Christ; and though Christ will cut off <i>rotten </i>
    members from his body, he will not cut off <i>weak </i>members.
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">2. EFFECTUAL CALLING</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"And those he predestined, he also <b>called</b>; those 
    he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified." Romans 
    8:30 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question 31: What is the NATURE Effectual Calling?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Answer: It is a gracious work of the Spirit, whereby he 
    causes us to embrace Christ freely, as he is offered to us in the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">In this verse is the golden chain of salvation, made up 
    of four links, of which one is effectual calling. This calling is <i>nova 
    creatio—</i>"a new creation," the first resurrection. There is a two-fold 
    call: </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) An outward call. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) An inward call.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) An OUTWARD call</p></b></font>, which is God's offer of 
    grace to sinners, inviting them to come and accept of Christ and salvation. 
    "Many are called—but few chosen." This call shows men what they ought to do 
    in order to salvation, and renders them inexcusable in case of disobedience.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is an INWARD call</p></b></font>, when God with 
    the offer of grace, works grace. By this call the heart is renewed, and the 
    will is effectually drawn to embrace Christ. The outward call brings men to 
    a <i>profession </i>of Christ, the inward to a <i>possession </i>of Christ.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the MEANS of this effectual call?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Every creature has a voice to call us. The <i>heavens </i>
    call to us to behold God's glory. Psalm 19:1. <i>Conscience </i>calls to us. 
    God's <i>judgments </i>call us to repent. "Hear the rod." But every voice 
    does not convert. There are two means of our effectual call:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The <i>preaching of the word</i>, which is the 
    sounding of God's silver trumpet in men's ears. God speaks not by an oracle, 
    he calls by his ministers. Samuel thought it had been the voice of Eli which 
    called him; but it was God's voice. So, perhaps, you think it is only the 
    minister that speaks to you in the word—but it is God himself who speaks. 
    Therefore Christ is said to speak to us from heaven. Heb 12:25. How does he 
    speak but by his ministers? as a king speaks by his ambassadors. Know, that 
    in every sermon preached, God calls to you; and to refuse the message we 
    bring, is to refuse God himself.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The other means of our effectual call is the <i>Holy 
    Spirit</i>. The ministry of the word is the pipe or organ; the Spirit of God 
    blowing in it, effectually changes men's hearts. "While Peter spoke, the 
    Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word of God." Ministers knock at 
    the door of men's hearts, the Spirit comes with a key and opens the door. "A 
    certain woman named Lydia, whose heart the Lord opened."</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">FROM what does God call men?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">(1.) God calls men from <b>sin</b>. He calls them from 
    their ignorance and unbelief. I Pet 1:14. By nature the understanding is 
    enveloped with darkness. God calls men "from darkness to light," as if one 
    should be called out of a dungeon to behold the light of the sun. Eph 5:8.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God calls men from <b>danger</b>. As the angels 
    called Lot out of Sodom, when it was ready to rain fire; so God calls his 
    people from the fire and brimstone of hell, and from all those curses to 
    which they were exposed.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) God calls men <b>out of the world</b>; as Christ 
    called Matthew from the collection of taxes. "They are not of the world." 
    Such as are divinely called, are not natives in this world—but pilgrims; 
    they do not conform to the world, or follow its sinful fashions; they are 
    not of the world. Though they live here—yet they trade in the heavenly 
    country. The world is a place where Satan's throne is. Rev 2:13. It is a 
    stage on which sin every day acts its part. Now such as are called—are <i>in
    </i>the world but not <i>of </i>it.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">TO what does God call men?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">(1.) He calls them to <b>holiness</b>. "For God did not 
    call us to be impure, but to live a holy life." 1 Thess 4:7. Holiness is the 
    silver star which the godly wear. "The people of your holiness." The called 
    of God, are anointed with the consecrating oil of the Spirit. "You have an 
    anointing from the Holy One."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God calls them to <b>glory</b>—as if a man were 
    called out of a prison to sit upon a throne. "Who has called you to his 
    kingdom and glory." Whom God <i>calls</i>, he <i>crowns </i>with a weight of 
    glory. 2 Cor 4:17. The Hebrew word for glory signifies <i>pondus</i>—a 
    weight. The weight of glory adds to the worth, the weightier gold is, the 
    more it is worth. This glory is not transient—but permanent, an <i>eternal
    </i>weight. This glory will be better <i>felt—</i>than <i>expressed</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What is the CAUSE of the effectual call?</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">God's electing love. "And those he <i>predestined</i>, he 
    also <i>called</i>." Romans 8:30. Election is the fountain-cause of our 
    effectual calling. It is not because some are more <i>worthy </i>to partake 
    of the heavenly calling than others—for we were "all in our blood." What 
    worthiness is in us? What worthiness was there in <i>Mary Magdalene</i>, out 
    of whom seven devils were cast? What worthiness in the <i>Corinthians</i>, 
    before God called them by his gospel? They were "idol worshipers, 
    adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals, thieves, greedy people, 
    drunkards, abusers, and swindlers." "And that is what some of you were. But 
    you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the 
    Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." 1 Cor 6:9-11. Before 
    effectual calling, we are not only "without strength," but "enemies to God." 
    So that the foundation of effectual calling is <i>election</i>, and not <i>
    merit</i>.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">What are the CHARACTERISTICS of this call?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is a POWERFUL call.</p></b></font> "The <i>words </i>
    of God are <i>works</i>," Luther. God puts forth infinite power in calling 
    home a sinner to himself; he not only puts forth his <i>voice—</i>but his <i>
    arm</i>. The apostle speaks of the exceeding greatness of his power, which 
    he exercises towards those who believe. Eph 1:19. God rides forth conquering 
    in the chariot of his gospel; he conquers the pride of the heart, and makes 
    the will, which stood out as a fort-royal, to yield and stoop to his grace; 
    he makes the stony heart bleed. Oh, it is a mighty call! Why then do the 
    Arminians seem to talk of a <i>moral persuasion</i>, that God in the 
    conversion of a sinner only morally persuades and no more; sets his promises 
    before men to allure them to good, and his threatenings to deter them from 
    evil; and that is all he does? But surely moral persuasions alone are 
    insufficient to the effectual call. How can the bare proposal of promises 
    and threatenings convert a soul? This amounts not to a new creation, or that 
    power which raised Christ from the dead. God not only persuades—but enables. 
    Ezek 36:27. If God, in conversion, should only morally persuade, that is, 
    set good and evil before men—then he does not put forth so much power in 
    saving men as the devil does in destroying them. Satan not only propounds 
    tempting objects to men—but <i>incites </i>with his temptations: therefore 
    he is said to "<i>work </i>in the children of disobedience." The Greek word, 
    to <i>work</i>, signifies the power Satan has in carrying men to sin. And 
    shall not God's power in <i>converting</i>, be greater than Satan's power in
    <i>seducing</i>? The effectual call is mighty and powerful. God puts forth a 
    divine energy, nay, a kind of omnipotence; it is such a powerful call, that 
    the will of man has no power effectually to resist.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is a HIGH calling.</p></b></font> "I press toward the 
    mark for the prize of the high calling of God." It is a high calling, 
<p align="justify">(1.) Because we are called to high exercises of piety—to 
    be crucified to the world, to live by faith, to love God, to be living 
    organs of his praise, to hold communion with the Father and the Son.</p>
<p align="justify">(2:) It is a high calling, because we are called to high 
    privileges; to justification and adoption, to be kings and priests unto God. 
    We are called to be co-heirs with Christ. Heb 12:22. Rom 8:17. Those who are 
    effectually called, are heirs for heaven—they are princes in all lands, 
    though princes in disguise. Psalm 45:16.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It is an IMMUTABLE call. </p></b></font>"God’s gracious 
    gifts and <i>calling </i>are irrevocable;" Rom 11:29. That is, those gifts 
    that flow from election (as effectual calling and justification) are 
    irrevocable. God never repents of calling a sinner to be a saint.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: See the NECESSITY of the effectual call.</p></b></font> 
    A man cannot go to heaven without it. We must be called before we are 
    glorified. Rom 8:30. A man uncalled can lay claim to nothing in the Bible 
    but threatening! A man in the state of nature is not fit for heaven, no more 
    than a man in his filth and his rags is fit to come into a king's presence. 
    A man in his natural state is a God-hater, and is he fit for heaven? Rom 
    1:30. Will God lay his enemy in his bosom?
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Of TRIAL whether we are effectually called.</p></b></font> 
    This we may know by its <i>antecedent</i>, and its <i>results</i>.
<p align="justify">(1.) By the <b>antecedent</b>. Before this effectual 
    call, a humbling work passes upon the soul. A man is convinced of sin, he 
    sees he is a sinner and nothing but a sinner; the fallow ground of his heart 
    is broken up. Jer 4:3. As the farmer breaks up the clods, then casts in the 
    seed; so God, by the convincing work of the law, breaks a sinner's heart, 
    and makes it fit to receive the seeds of grace. Such as were never convinced 
    of sin—are never called. "He shall convince the world of sin." John 16:8. <i>
    Conviction </i>of sin is the first step in <i>conversion </i>from sin.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By the <b>results</b>, which are two. </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He who is savingly called, answers to God's call. 
    When God called Samuel, he answered, "Speak, Lord, your servant hears." When 
    God calls you to an act of piety—do you run at God's call? "I was not 
    disobedient to the heavenly vision." If God calls to duties contrary to 
    flesh and blood, we obey his voice in everything; true obedience is like the 
    needle, which points that way which the magnet draws. Such as are deaf to 
    God's call, show they are not called by grace. </p>
<p align="justify">(2) He who is effectually called stops his ears to all 
    other calls which would call him off from God. As God has his call, so there 
    are other contrary calls. <i>Satan </i>calls by a temptation, <i>lust </i>
    calls, <i>evil company </i>calls; but as the adder stops its ear against the 
    voice of the charmer, so he who is effectually called stops his ear against 
    all the charms of the flesh and the devil.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Of COMFORT to those who are the called of God.
    </p></b></font>This call evidences election. "Those He predestined, He also 
    called." Election is the <i>cause </i>of our effectually calling; and 
    effectually calling is the <i>sign </i>of our election. Election is the 
    first link of the golden chain of salvation, effectually calling is the 
    second. He who has the second link of the chain—is sure of the first link! 
    As by the <i>stream </i>we are led to the <i>fountain</i>, so by effectually 
    calling we ascend to election. Effectually calling is the pledge of glory. 
    "God has chosen you to salvation, through sanctification." We may read God's 
    predestinating love—in the work of grace in our heart.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Let such as are called be THANKFUL to God for 
    that unspeakable blessing.</p></b></font> Be thankful to all the persons in the 
    Trinity, to the <i>Father's </i>mercy, to the <i>Son's </i>merit, to the 
    Spirit's efficacy. To make you thankful, consider, when you had <i>offended
    </i>God—he called you. Consider that when God had no need of you—but had 
    millions of glorified saints and angels to praise him, he called you. 
    Consider what you were <i>before </i>God called you! "You were dead, doomed 
    forever because of your many sins!" When God called Paul, he found him 
    persecuting; when he called Zacchaeus, he found him using extortion. When 
    God calls a man by his grace, he finds him seeking after his lusts; as when 
    Saul was called to the kingdom, he was seeking the donkeys. Admire his love, 
    exalt his praise—that He should call you when you were in the hot pursuit of 
    sin! What mercy is this—that God should call you, and pass by others! "Even 
    so, Father, for so it seemed good in your sight!" That God should pass by 
    wise and noble people, people of sweeter disposition, greater abilities, 
    guilty of less vice, and that the lot of free grace should fall upon you—oh, 
    the astonishing love of God! 
<p align="justify">It was a great favor to Samuel that God called to him, 
    and revealed his mind to him, and passed by Eli, though a priest and a judge 
    in Israel. Just so, that God should call to you, a monstrous sinner, and 
    pass by others of better morals—calls aloud for praise. As God so governs 
    the clouds, that he makes them rain upon one place, and not upon 
    another—just so, at a sermon the Lord opens the heart of one, and another is 
    no more affected with it than a deaf man with the sound of music. Here is 
    the banner of free grace displayed, and here should the trophies of praise 
    be erected. Elijah and Elisha were walking together; when suddenly there 
    came a chariot of fire, and carried Elijah up to heaven—but left Elisha 
    behind; just so, when two are living together, husband and wife, father and 
    child, that God should call one by his grace—but leave the other in his 
    sins; carry up one in a triumphant chariot to heaven—but let the other 
    perish eternally—oh infinite rich grace! How should they that are called be 
    affected with God's sovereign love! How should the vessels of mercy run over 
    with thankfulness! How should they stand upon Mount Gerizim, blessing and 
    praising God! Oh begin the work of heaven here! Such as are trophies of 
    mercy, should be trumpeters of praise. Thus Paul, being effectually called 
    by God, and seeing what a debtor he was to free grace, breaks forth into 
    admiration and gratitude, "Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!" 2 
    Corinthians 9:15.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use five: To the called. Walk worthy of your high 
    calling.</p></b></font> "I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you 
    have received." Ephesians 4:1; in two things.
<p align="justify">(1.) Walk <b>compassionately</b>. Pity such as are yet 
    uncalled. Have you a child, or a wife, or a friend—whom God has not yet 
    called? Weep over their dying souls; they are "dead, doomed forever because 
    of their many sins," and "under the power of Satan." Oh pity them! Let their 
    sins more trouble you—than your own sufferings. If you pity an ox or donkey 
    going astray, will you not pity a soul going astray? Show your <i>piety, </i>
    by your <i>pity</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Walk <b>holily</b>. Yours is a holy calling. 2 Tim 
    1:9. You are called to be saints, Rom 1:7. Show your effectual calling by a 
    Bible life. Shall not flowers smell sweeter than weeds? Shall not those who 
    are ennobled with grace, have more fragrance in their lives than uncalled 
    sinners? "As the One who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all 
    your conduct." 1 Peter 1:15. Oh dishonor not your high calling by any sordid 
    life! When Antigonus was going to defile himself with women, one told him, 
    "You are a king's son!" Oh remember your dignity; "called of God!" of the 
    royal blood of heaven. Do nothing unworthy of your honorable calling. Scipio 
    refused the embraces of an harlot, because he was general of an army. Abhor 
    all motions to sin, because of your high calling. It is not fit for those 
    who are the called of God, to do as others. Though other <i>Jews </i>drank 
    wine, it was not fit for the <i>Nazarite</i>, because he had a vow of 
    separation upon him, and had promised abstinence. Though Pagans and nominal 
    Christians take liberty to sin—yet it is not fit for those who are called 
    out of the world, and have the mark of election upon them, to do so. You are 
    consecrated people, your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, and your 
    bodies must be a <i>holy of holies</i>.</p>

<p align="center">3. JUSTIFICATION</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"Being justified freely by his grace." Romans 3:24</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Question 23. What is Justification?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Answer: Justification is an act of God's free grace, 
    whereby he pardons all our sins, and accepts us as righteous in his 
    sight—only for the righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, and received by 
    faith alone.</p>
<p align="justify">Justification is the very hinge and pillar of 
    Christianity. An error about justification is dangerous, like a defect in a 
    foundation. Justification by Christ is a spring of the water of life. To 
    have the poison of corrupt doctrine cast into this spring is damnable. It 
    was a saying of Luther, "that after his death, the doctrine of justification 
    would be corrupted." In these latter times, the Arminians and Socinians have 
    cast a dead fly into this box of precious ointment.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall endeavor to follow the star of Scripture, to 
    light me through this mysterious point.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is MEANT by justification?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is a word borrowed from law-courts, wherein a person 
    arraigned is <i>pronounced righteous</i>, and is openly absolved. God, in 
    justifying a person, pronounces him to be righteous, and looks upon him as 
    if he had not sinned.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the SOURCE of justification?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The cause, the inward impellant motive or ground of 
    justification, is the free grace of God: "being justified freely by his 
    grace." Ambrose expounds this, as "not of the grace wrought within us—but 
    the free grace of God." The first wheel that sets all the rest running is 
    the love and favor of God; as a king freely pardons a delinquent. 
    Justification is a mercy spun out of the affections of free grace. God does 
    not justify us because we are worthy—but by justifying us makes us worthy.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the GROUND, or that by which a sinner is 
    justified?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The ground of our justification is Christ's satisfaction 
    made to his Father. If it be asked, how can it stand with God's justice and 
    holiness to pronounce us innocent—when we are guilty? The answer is, that 
    Christ having made satisfaction for our sins, God may, in equity and 
    justice, pronounce us righteous. It is a just thing for a creditor to 
    discharge a debtor of the debt, when a satisfaction is made by the surety.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But how was Christ's satisfaction meritorious, and so 
    sufficient to justify?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In respect of the divine nature. As he was man he 
    suffered, as God he satisfied. By Christ's death and merits, God's justice 
    is more abundantly satisfied than if we had suffered the pains of hell 
    forever.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Wherein lies the METHOD of our justification?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In the imputation of Christ's righteousness to us. "This 
    is the name whereby he shall be called, <i>Jehovah Tzidkennu</i>, the Lord 
    our righteousness." "He is made to us righteousness." This righteousness of 
    Christ, which justifies us, is a better righteousness than the angels; for 
    theirs is the righteousness of creatures, this righteousness is of God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the MEANS or instrument of our justification?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Faith. "Being justified by faith." The dignity is not in 
    faith as a grace—but relatively, as faith lays hold on Christ's merits.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the efficient CAUSE of our justification?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The whole Trinity. All the persons in the blessed Trinity 
    have a hand in the justification of a sinner. God the <i>Father </i>is said 
    to justify. "It is God who justifies." God the <i>Son </i>is said to 
    justify. "By him all who believe are justified." God the <i>Holy Spirit </i>
    is said to justify. "But you are justified by the Spirit of our God." God 
    the Father justifies, as he pronounces us righteous; God the Son justifies, 
    as he imputes his righteousness to us; and God the Holy Spirit justifies, as 
    he clears up our justification, and seals us up to the day of redemption.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the END of our justification?</p></b> The end is, 
<p align="justify">(1.) That God may inherit praise. "To the praise of the 
    glory of his grace." Hereby God raises the everlasting trophies of his own 
    honor. How will the justified sinner proclaim the love of God, and make 
    heaven ring with his praises!</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the justified person may inherit glory. "Whom 
    he justified, those he also glorified." God in justifying, not only absolves 
    a soul from guilt—but advances him to dignity. Just as Joseph was not only 
    loosed from prison—but made Lord of the kingdom. <i>Justification </i>is 
    crowned with <i>glorification!</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Are we justified from eternity?</p></b> No, for, 
<p align="justify">(1.) By nature we are under a sentence of condemnation. 
    John 3:18. We could never have been condemned, if we were justified from 
    eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The Scripture confines justification to those who 
    believe and repent. "Repent, that your sins may be blotted out." Acts 3:19. 
    Therefore their sins were uncancelled, and their persons unjustified, until 
    they did repent. Though God does not justify us for our repentance—yet not 
    without it. The Antinomians erroneously hold, that we are justified from 
    eternity. This doctrine is a key which opens the door to all licentiousness; 
    for what sins do they not commit, so long as they hold they are justified 
    whether they repent or not?</p>
<p align="justify">Before I come to the uses, I shall lay down <b>
<font color="#0000ff">four maxims or positions about justification.</font></b></p>
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">[1] That justification confers a real benefit upon the 
    person justified.</p></font> The acquitting and discharging of the debtor, 
    by virtue of the satisfaction made by the surety, is a real benefit to the 
    debtor. A robe of righteousness, and a crown of righteousness, are real 
    benefits.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[2] All believers are alike justified.</p></b></font> 
    Justification does not apply to some more than to others. Though there are 
    degrees in grace—yet not in justification; one is not justified more than 
    another. The weakest believer is as perfectly justified as the strongest. 
    Mary Magdalene is as much justified as the Virgin Mary. This may be a 
    cordial to a weak believer. Though you have but a grain of faith, you are as 
    truly justified, as he who is of the highest stature in Christ.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[3] Whoever God justifies, he sanctifies. </p></b></font>"But 
    you are sanctified—but you are justified." 1 Cor. 6:2. The Papists 
    calumniate Protestants; they report them to hold that men continuing in sin 
    are justified; whereas all our Protestant writers affirm, that righteousness 
    imputed, for justification, and righteousness inherent, for sanctification, 
    must be inseparably united. Holiness indeed is not the cause of our 
    justification—but it is the attendant; as the heat in the sun is not the 
    cause of its light—but it is the attendant. It is absurd to imagine that God 
    should justify a people, and they should still go on in sin. If God should
    <i>justify </i>a people and not <i>sanctify </i>them—he would justify a 
    people whom he could not glorify. A holy God cannot lay a sinner in his 
    bosom. The metal is first refined, before the king's stamp is put upon it. 
    Just so, the soul is first refined with holiness, before God puts the royal 
    stamp of justification upon it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">[4] Justification is a fixed permanent thing, it can 
    never be lost.</p></b></font> The Arminians hold an apostasy from justification; 
    today justified, tomorrow unjustified; today a Peter, tomorrow a Judas; 
    today a member of Christ, tomorrow a child of Satan. This is a most 
    uncomfortable doctrine. Justified people may fall from degrees of grace, 
    they may leave their first love, they may lose God's favor for a time—but 
    not lose their justification. If they are justified they are elected; and 
    they can no more fall from their justification than from their election. If 
    they are justified they have union with Christ, and can a member of Christ 
    is broken off? If one justified person may fall away from Christ, all may; 
    and so Christ would be a head without a body.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one:</p></b></font> See from hence, that there is nothing
    <i>within </i>us that could justify us—but something <i>without </i>us; not 
    any righteousness <i>inherent</i>—but righteousness <i>imputed</i>. We may 
    as well look for a star in the earth, as for justification in our own 
    righteousness. The Papists say we are justified by works; but the apostle 
    confutes it, for he says, "not of works, lest any man should boast." The 
    Papists say, "the works done by an unregenerate man indeed cannot justify 
    him—but works done by a regenerate man may justify." This is most false, as 
    may be proved both by example and reason.
<p align="justify">(1.) By example. Abraham was a regenerate man; but 
    Abraham was not justified by works—but by faith. Abraham "believed God, and 
    it was counted to him for righteousness." </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By reason. How can those works justify us—which 
    defile us? "Our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Good works are not an 
    usher to go before justification—but a handmaid to follow it.</p>
<p align="justify">But does not the apostle James say that Abraham was 
    justified by works?</p>
<p align="justify">The answer is easy. Works manifest us to be righteous 
    before men—but they do not make us righteous before God. Works are <i>
    evidences </i>of our justification, not causes. The only name engraved upon 
    the golden plate of Christ our High Priest must be, <i>the Lord Our 
    Righteousness.</i></p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: </p></b></font>Of exhortation. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) Adore the infinite wisdom and goodness of God that 
    found out a way to justify us by "rich grace and precious blood."</p></b></font> 
    We were all involved in guilt; none of us could plead <i>not-guilty</i>; and 
    being guilty, we lay under a sentence of death. Now that the judge himself 
    should find out a way to justify us, and the creditor himself contrive a way 
    to have the debt paid, and not distress the debtor—should fill us with 
    wonder and love! The angels admire the mystery of free grace in this new way 
    of justifying and saving lost man, I Pet 1:12, and should not we, who are 
    nearly concerned in it, and on whom the benefit is devolved, cry out with 
    the apostle, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of 
    God!"
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) Labor for this high privilege of justification. </p></b>
</font>There is balm in Gilead; Christ has laid down his blood as the price 
    of our justification; and he offers himself and all his merits to us, to 
    justify. He invites us to come to him; he has promised to give his Spirit, 
    to enable us to do what is required. Why then, sinners, will you not look 
    after this great privilege of justification? <i>Why starve in the midst of 
    plenty? </i>Why perish, when there is a remedy to save you? Would not he be 
    thought to be deranged, who having a pardon offered him, only upon the 
    acknowledgment of his fault, and promising amendment, should bid the prince 
    keep his pardon to himself; for his part, he was in love with his chains and 
    fetters, and would die? You who neglect justification offered you freely by 
    Christ in the gospel, are this deranged person. Is the love of Christ to be 
    slighted? Is your soul, is heaven worth nothing? Oh then look after 
    justification through Christ's blood!
<p align="justify">Consider—</p>
<p align="justify">(1:) The <b>necessity </b>of being justified. If we are 
    not justified, we cannot be glorified. "Whom he justified, them he also 
    glorified." Rom 8:30. He who is outlawed, and all his goods confiscated, 
    must be brought into favor with his prince before he can be restored to his 
    former rights and liberties. Just so, we must have our sins forgiven, and be 
    brought into God's favor by justification, before we can be restored to the 
    liberty of the sons of God, and have a right to that happiness we forfeited 
    in Adam.</p>
<p align="justify">(2:) The utility and <b>benefit</b>. By justification we 
    enjoy peace in our conscience; a richer jewel than any prince wears in his 
    crown. "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God." Peace can sweeten 
    all our afflictions; it turns our water into wine. How happy is a justified 
    person who has the power of God to guard him, and the peace of God to 
    comfort him! Peace flowing from justification is an antidote against the 
    fear of death and hell. "It is God who justifies, who is he that condemns?" 
    Rom 8:33, 34. Therefore labor for this justification by Christ. This 
    privilege is obtained by believing in Christ. "By him all who believe are 
    justified." "Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in 
    his blood." Faith unites us to Christ; and having union with his person—we 
    partake of his merits, and the glorious salvation which comes by him.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three:</p></b></font> Comfort to the justified. 
<p align="justify">(1.) It is comfort in case of failings. Alas! how 
    defective are the godly! they come short in every duty; but though believers 
    should be humbled under their defects, they should not despond. They are not 
    to be justified by their duties or graces—but by the righteousness of 
    Christ. Their duties are mixed with sin—but that righteousness which 
    justifies them is a perfect righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Comfort in case of hard censures. The world censures 
    the people of God as proud and hypocritical, and the troublers of Israel. 
    But though men censure and condemn the godly—yet God has justified them, and 
    as he has now justified them, so at the day of judgement he will openly 
    justify them, and pronounce them righteous before men and angels. God is so 
    just and holy a judge, that having once justified his people he will never 
    condemn them. Pilate justified Christ, saying, "I find no fault in him;" yet 
    after this he condemned him; but God having publicly justified his saints, 
    he will never condemn them; for "whom he <i>justified</i>, them he also <i>
    glorified</i>."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
<p align="center">4. ADOPTION</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become 
    the sons of God, even to those who believe on his name." John 1:12.</p>
<p align="justify">Having spoken of the great points of faith and 
    justification, we come next to adoption.</p>
<p align="justify">The qualification of the people is, "As many as received 
    him." Receiving is put for believing, as is clear by the last words, "to 
    those who believe in his name." The specification of the privilege is, "to 
    them gave he power to become the sons of God." The Greek word for power, <i>
    exousia</i>, signifies dignity and prerogative: he dignified them to become 
    the sons of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Our sonship differs from Christ's. He was the Son of God 
    by eternal generation, a son before time; but our sonship is, </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) By creation. "We are his offspring." This is no 
    privilege; for men may have God for their Father by creation, and yet have 
    the devil for their father. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Our sonship is by adoption. "He gave them power to 
    become the sons of God." Adoption is twofold. </p>

<p align="justify">External and federal</p></b>: as those who live in a visible 
    church, and make a <i>profession </i>of God, are sons. "The children of the 
    kingdom shall be cast out." 
<b>
<p align="justify">Real and gracious</p></b>: as they are sons who are God's 
    favorites, and are heirs of glory. Before I proceed to the questions, I 
    shall lay down three positions.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">I. Adoption takes in all nations.</p></b></font> A first 
    adoption was confined to the people of the Jews, who alone were grafted into 
    the true olive tree, and were dignified with glorious privileges. "Who are 
    Israelites, to whom pertains the adoption and the glory." But now, in the 
    time of the gospel, the charter is enlarged, and the believing Gentiles are 
    within the line of communication, and have a right to the privileges of 
    adoption as well as the Jews. "In every nation he who fears God and works 
    righteousness is accepted with him."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Adoption takes in both sexes, females as well as 
    males. </p></b></font>"I will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and 
    daughters." I have read, that in some countries, females are excluded from 
    the supreme dignity, as by the Salique law in France, no woman can inherit a 
    crown; but of spiritual privileges, females are as capable as males. Every 
    gracious soul (of whatever gender) lays claim to adoption, and has an 
    interest in God as a father. "You shall be my <i>sons </i>and <i>daughters</i>, 
    says the Lord Almighty."
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Adoption is an act of pure grace. </p></b></font>"He 
    predestined us to be adopted as His sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance 
    with His pleasure and will." Ephesians 1:5. Adoption is a mercy spun out of 
    the affections of free grace. All by nature are strangers to God, therefore 
    have no right to sonship. God is pleased to adopt one, and not another; to 
    make one a vessel of glory, another a vessel of wrath. The adopted heir may 
    cry out, "Lord, how is it, that you will show yourself to me, and not unto 
    the world?"
<p align="justify">What is this filiation or adoption?</p>
<p align="justify">It is taking a stranger into the relation of a son and 
    heir; as Moses was the adopted son of King Pharaoh's daughter, Exod 2:10, 
    and Esther was the adopted child of her cousin Mordecai. Esth 2:7. Thus God 
    adopts us into the family of heaven, and God in adopting us does two things:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He ennobles us with his name. He who is adopted 
    bears the name of him who adopts him. "I will write on him the name of my 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God consecrates us with his Spirit. All whom he 
    adopts—he anoints. All whom he makes sons, he makes saints. When a man 
    adopts another for his son and heir, he may put his name upon him—but he 
    cannot put his disposition into him; if he is of a morose rugged nature, he 
    cannot alter it. But those whom God <i>adopts, </i>he <i>sanctifies</i>; he 
    not only gives a new name but a new nature. 2 Pet 1:4. He turns the wolf 
    into a lamb; he makes the heart humble and gracious; he works such a 
    change—as if another soul dwelt in the same body.</p>
<p align="justify">From what state does God take us when he adopts us?</p>
<p align="justify">From a state of sin and misery. Pharaoh's daughter took 
    Moses out of the ark of bulrushes in the water, and adopted him for her son. 
    God did not take us out of the water—but out of our blood, and adopted us. 
    Ezek 16:6. He adopted us from slavery; it is a mercy to <i>redeem </i>a 
    slave—but it is more to <i>adopt </i>him!</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">To what does God adopt us?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) God adopts us to a state of excellence.</p></b></font> 
    It would be much for God to take a clod of dust, and make it a star. But it 
    is more for him to take <i>a piece of clay and sin</i>, and adopt it for his 
    heir!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) God adopts us to a state of liberty.</p></b></font> 
    Adoption is a state of freedom; a slave being adopted, is made a free man. 
    "You are no more a servant, but a son." How is an adopted son free? Not to 
    do what he wants; but he is free from the dominion of sin, the tyranny of 
    Satan, and the curse of the law. He is free in the manner of worship. He has 
    God's free Spirit, which makes him free and cheerful in the service of God; 
    he is "joyful in the house of prayer."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3.) God adopts us to a state of dignity. </p></b></font>He 
    makes us heirs of promise, he installs us into honor. "Since you were 
    precious in my sight, you have been honorable." The adopted are God's <b>
    treasure</b>; Exod 19:5; his <b>jewels</b>; Mal 3:17; his <b>first-born</b>; 
    Heb 12:23. They have angels for their life-guards. Heb 1:14. They are of the 
    royal blood of heaven. I John 3:9. The Scripture has set forth their 
    spiritual heraldry; they have their escutcheon or coat-armor; sometimes the
    <i>lion </i>for courage; Prov 28:1; sometimes the <i>dove </i>for meekness; 
    Cant 2:14; sometimes the <i>eagle </i>for flight; Isa 40:31. Thus you see 
    their coat of arms displayed.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4.) God adopts us to a glorious inheritance. </p></b></font>
    God adopts all his sons to an inheritance. "It is your <i>father's </i>good 
    pleasure to give you the kingdom!" Luke 12:32. It is no disparagement to be 
    the sons of God. To reproach the saints, is like when Shimei had reproached 
    David when he was going to be made king. <i>Adoption </i>ends in <i>
    coronation</i>. The kingdom God gives to his adopted sons and heirs, excels 
    all earthly monarchies.
<p align="justify">(1:) In <b>riches</b>. "The gates are of pearl, and the 
    streets of pure gold, as it were transparent glass."</p>
<p align="justify">(2:) In <b>tranquility</b>. It is peaceable, and the 
    white lily of peace is the best flower in a prince's crown. One peace is 
    better than innumerable triumphs. No divisions at home, or invasions abroad; 
    no more the noise of the drum or cannon; but the voice of harpers harping is 
    the emblem of peace. Rev 14:2.</p>
<p align="justify">(3:) In <b>stability</b>. Other kingdoms are corruptible; 
    though they have heads of gold, they have feet of clay; but the kingdom into 
    which the saints are adopted runs parallel with eternity, it is a kingdom 
    that cannot be shaken. Heb 12:28. The heirs of heaven reign forever and 
    ever. Rev 22:5.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">What is the organic or instrumental cause of adoption?</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Faith interests us in the privilege of adoption. "You are 
    all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Before faith is wrought, 
    we are spiritually illegitimate, we have no relation to God as a father. An 
    unbeliever may call God <i>judge</i>—but not <i>father</i>. Faith is the 
    affiliating grace; it confers upon us the title of sonship, and gives us 
    right to inherit.</p>
<p align="justify">Why is faith the instrument of adoption more than any 
    other grace?</p>
<p align="justify">Faith is a quickening grace, the vital artery of the 
    soul. "The just shall live by faith." Life makes us capable of adoption; 
    dead children are never adopted. It makes us Christ's brethren, and so God 
    comes to be our Father. "How great is the love the Father has lavished on 
    us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The 
    reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him." 1 John 3:1. 
    "He predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in 
    accordance with his pleasure and will." Ephesians 1:5 </p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use one: (1.) See the amazing love of God, in making us 
    his sons.</p></b></font> Plato gave God thanks that he had made him a man, and 
    not only a man but a philosopher; but it is infinitely more, that he should 
    invest us with the prerogative of his sons! It is love in God to <i>feed </i>
    us—but more to <i>adopt </i>us. "Behold, what manner of love the Father has 
    bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!" Behold the 
    wonder! The wonder of God's love in adopting us will appear the more if we 
    consider these six things:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(1:) That God should adopt us, when he had a Son of his 
    own. </p></b></font>Men adopt because they have no children, and desire to have 
    some to bear their name; but that God should adopt us when he had a Son of 
    his own, the Lord Jesus—is a wonder of love. Christ is called "God's dear 
    Son." A Son more worthy than the angels. "Being made so much better than the 
    angels." Now, since God had a Son of his own, and such a Son—how wonderful 
    God's love in adopting us! We needed a Father—but he did not need sons!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(2:) Consider what we were before God adopted us. </p></b>
</font>We were very deformed; and a man will scarcely adopt one for his 
    heir—who is crooked and ill-favored. He will rather one who has some beauty. 
    Mordecai adopted Esther, because she was fair. When we were in our blood, 
    God adopted us. "When I saw you polluted in your blood, it was the time of 
    love." God did not adopt us when we were bespangled with the jewels of 
    holiness—but when we were black as Ethiopians, diseased as lepers—it was the 
    time of his love.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(3:) That God should be at so great expense in adopting 
    us.</p></b></font> When men adopt, they have only some deed sealed, and the 
    thing is effected; but when God adopts, it puts him to a far greater 
    expense; it sets his wisdom to work to find out a way to adopt us. It was no 
    easy thing to make heirs of wrath, into heirs of the promise and of glory. 
    When God had found out a way to adopt, it was no easy way. Our adoption was 
    purchased at a dear rate; for when God was about to make us sons and heirs, 
    he could not seal the deed but by the blood of his own Son. Here is the 
    wonder of God's love in adopting us, that he should be at all this expense 
    to accomplish it.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(4:) That God should adopt his enemies.</p></b></font> If a 
    man adopts another for his heir, he will not adopt his mortal enemy; but 
    that God should adopt us, when we were not only strangers—but enemies, is 
    the wonder of his love! For God to have <i>pardoned </i>his enemies would 
    have been much; but to adopt them for his heirs, astonishes the angels in 
    heaven!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(5:) That God should take great numbers out of the 
    devil's family, and adopt them into the family of heaven.</p></b></font> Christ 
    is said to "bring <i>many </i>sons to glory." Men usually adopt but <i>one
    </i>heir—but God is resolved to increase his family, he brings <i>many </i>
    sons to glory. God's adopting of millions—is the wonder of love. Had but <i>
    one </i>been adopted, all of us might have despaired; but he brings many 
    sons to glory, which opens a door of hope to us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(6:) That God should confer so great honor upon us, in 
    adopting us.</p></b></font> David thought it no small honor that he should be a 
    king's son-in-law. But what honor to be the sons of the high God! The more 
    honor God has put upon us in adopting us, the more he has magnified his love 
    towards us. What honor—that God has made us so near in alliance to him, sons 
    of God the Father, members of God the Son, temples of God the Holy Spirit! 
    that he has made us as the angels; nay, in some sense, superior to the 
    angels! All this proclaims the wonder of God's love in adopting us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">(7:) See the dreadful condition of such as live and die 
    in unbelief.</p></b></font> They are not the sons of God. "To as many as 
    received him, he gave power to become the sons of God, even to those who 
    believe on his name." No faith—no sonship. Unbelievers have no sign of 
    sonship—they know not God. All God's children know their Father—but the 
    wicked do not know him. "They proceed from evil to evil, and know not me, 
    says the Lord." Unbelievers are "dead in trespasses and sins." <i>God has no 
    dead children</i>; and not being children, they have no right to inherit the 
    glories of heaven.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use two: Try whether you are adopted. </p></b></font>The 
    whole world is divided into two classes—the sons of God, and the heirs of 
    hell. "To them he gave power to become the sons of God." Let us put 
    ourselves on a trial. It is no sign we are adopted sons, because we are sons 
    of godly parents. The Jews boasted that they were of Abraham's seed, and 
    thought they must needs be good, because they came of such a holy line. But 
    adoption does not come by blood. Many godly parents have wicked sons; 
    Abraham had an Ishmael; Isaac had an Esau. The corn that is sown pure, 
    brings forth grain with a <i>husk</i>. Just so, from him who is holy, an 
    unholy child springs. We are only God's sons by adoption and grace—not as we 
    are born of godly parents. Well, then, let us <b>test </b>ourselves, to see 
    if we are the adopted sons and daughters of God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The first sign of adoption is obedience.</p></b></font> A 
    son <i>obeys </i>his father. "I set cups and jugs of wine before them and 
    invited them to have a drink, but they refused. "No," they said. "We don't 
    drink wine, because Jehonadab son of Recab, our ancestor, gave us this 
    command: You and your descendants must never drink wine." Jeremiah 35:5-6. 
    So, when God says "drink not in sin's enchanted cup," an adopted child says, 
    "my heavenly Father has commanded me, and I dare not drink." A gracious soul 
    not only <b>believes </b>God's promise—but <b>obeys </b>his command. True 
    child-like obedience must be regular, which implies five things:
<b>
<p align="justify">(1.) It must be done by a right RULE. </p></b>Obedience must 
    have the Word of God for its rule. This is the touchstone. "To the law and 
    to the testimony!" If our obedience is not according to the Word, it is 
    offering up strange fire; it is will worship; and God will say, "Who has 
    required this at your hand?" The apostle condemns worshiping of angels, 
    which had a show of humility. Col 2:18. The Jews might say that they were 
    reluctant to be so bold as to go to God in their own persons; they would be 
    more humble, and prostrate themselves before the <i>angels</i>, desiring 
    them to be their mediators to God. Here was a show of humility in their 
    angel worship; but it was abominable, because they had no word of God to 
    warrant it; it was not obedience—but idolatry. Child-like obedience is that 
    which is consistent with to our Father's revealed will.
<b>
<p align="justify">(2.) It must be done from a right PRINCIPLE, from the 
    noble principle of faith.</p></b> "The obedience of faith." "All acceptable 
    works proceed from faith," Augustine. A crab-tree may bear fruit fair to the 
    eye—but it is sour because it does not come from a good root. A moral person 
    may give God outward obedience, which to the eyes of others may seem 
    glorious; but his obedience is sour because it comes not from the sweet and 
    pleasant root of faith. A child of God gives him the obedience of faith, and 
    that meliorates and sweetens his services, and makes them come off with a 
    better relish. "By faith Abel offered a better sacrifice than Cain."
<b>
<p align="justify">(3.) It must be done to a right END.</p></b> The end 
    determines the value of the deed; the end of obedience is glorifying God. 
    That which has spoiled many splendid services, is, that the end has been 
    wrong. "Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, <i>to 
    be seen by them. </i>So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with 
    trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, <i>to 
    be honored by men. </i>I tell you the truth, they have received their reward 
    in full." Matthew 6:1-2. Good works should shine—but not blaze. "If I give 
    my body to be burnt, and have not love, it profits me nothing." The same I 
    must say of a sincere aim; if I obey ever so much, and have not a sincere 
    aim, it profits me nothing. True obedience looks at God in all things. "That 
    Christ may be magnified." Though a child of God shoots short—yet he takes a 
    right aim.
<b>
<p align="justify">(4.) True child-like obedience must be UNIFORM. </p></b>A 
    child of God makes conscience of one command, as well as another. All things 
    done for God, are done with equal zeal. All God's commands have the same 
    stamp of divine authority upon them; and if I obey one precept because my 
    heavenly Father commands me, by the same rule I must obey all. As the blood 
    runs through all the veins of the body—just so, true child-like obedience 
    runs through the first and second table. "I have respect unto all your 
    commandments." Psalm 119:6. To obey God in some things—and not in others, 
    shows an unsound heart; like Esau, who obeyed his father in bringing him 
    venison—but not in a greater matter, as the choice of his wife. Child-like 
    obedience moves towards every command of God, as the needle points that way 
    which the loadstone draws. If God call to duties which are cross to flesh 
    and blood, if we are children, we shall still obey our Father. "I have kept 
    my feet from every evil path so that I might obey your word." Psalm 119:101.
    
<p align="justify">But who can obey God in all things?</p>
<p align="justify">Though an adopted heir of heaven cannot obey every 
    precept perfectly—yet he does evangelically. He approves of every command. 
    "I consent to the law, that it is good." Rom 7:16. He delights in every 
    command. "O how love I your law!" Psalm 119:97. His desire is to obey every 
    command. "Oh, that my ways were steadfast in obeying your decrees!" Psalm 
    119:5. Wherein he comes short, he looks up to Christ's blood to supply his 
    defects. This is evangelical obedience; which, though we are not satisfied 
    with it, God accepts it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">(5.) True childlike obedience is constant. </p></b>"Blessed 
    is he who does righteousness at all times." Child-like obedience is not 
    fitful—but abides; and like the fire on the altar, which was kept always 
    burning. Lev 6:13.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The second sign of adoption is to love to be in our 
    Father's presence.</p></b></font> The child who loves his father is never so 
    well as when he is near him. Are we children? We love the presence of God in 
    his ordinances. In <i>prayer </i>we speak to God, in the <i>preaching </i>of 
    his word he speaks to us; and how does every child of God delight to hear 
    his Father's voice! "O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul 
    thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there 
    is no water." Psalm 63:1, 2. Such as disregard ordinances are not God's 
    children, because they care not to be in God's presence. "Cain went out from 
    the presence of the Lord." Gen 4:16. Not that he could go out of God's 
    sight—but the meaning is, "Cain went out from the church and people of God, 
    where the Lord gave visible tokens of his presence."
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The third sign of adoption is to have the guidance of 
    God's Spirit. </p></b></font>"As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are 
    the sons of God." Rom 8:14. It is not enough that the child have life—but it 
    must be led every step by the nurse. Just so, the adopted child must not 
    only be born of God—but have the anointing of the Spirit to lead him in a 
    course of holiness. "I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their 
    arms." As Israel was led by the pillar of fire, so God's children are led by 
    the Spirit. The adopted ones need God's Spirit to lead them, since they are 
    apt to go wrong. The fleshy part inclines to sin; the understanding and 
    conscience are to guide the will—but the will is imperious and rebels; 
    therefore, God's children need the Spirit to check corruption and lead them 
    in the right way. As wicked men are led by the <i>evil </i>spirit—the spirit 
    of Satan led <i>Herod </i>to incest, <i>Ahab </i>to murder, <i>Judas </i>to 
    treason; just so, the <i>good </i>Spirit leads God's children into virtuous 
    actions.
<p align="justify">But enthusiasts pretend to be led by the Spirit, when it 
    is a delusion.</p>
<p align="justify">The Spirit's guidance is agreeable to the Word; 
    enthusiasts leave the Word. "Your Word is truth." "The Spirit guides into 
    all truth." The <i>Word's teaching </i>and the <i>Spirit's leading </i>agree 
    together.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fourth sign is, that if we are adopted we have an 
    entire love to all God's children. </p></b></font>"Love the brotherhood." We 
    bear affection to God's children, though they have some infirmities. There 
    are spots in God's children; Deut 32:5; but we must love the beautiful face 
    of holiness, though it has a scar in it. If we are adopted, we love the good 
    we see in God's children—we admire their <i>graces</i>, we pass by their <i>
    imprudences</i>. If we cannot love them because they have some failings, how 
    do we think God can love us? Can we plead exemption? By these signs we know 
    our adoption.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use three: Rejoice in the BENEFITS of adoption.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">What are the benefits which accrue to God's children?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(1.) They have great privileges.</p></b></font> King's 
    children have great privileges and freedoms. They do not pay custom. Matt 
    17:25. God's children are privileged people, they are privileged from the 
    hurt of everything. "Nothing shall by any means hurt you." Luke 10:19. <i>
    Hit </i>you it may—but not <i>hurt </i>you. "There shall no <i>evil </i>
    befall you." Psalm 91:10. God does not promise that no <i>affliction </i>
    shall befall his children—but no <i>evil</i>; the hurt and poison of 
    affliction is taken away. Affliction to a wicked man has evil in it, it 
    makes him worse; it makes him curse and blaspheme. "Men were scorched with 
    great heat, and blasphemed the name of God." But no evil befalls a child of 
    God; he is bettered by affliction. Heb 12:10. The furnace makes gold purer.
<p align="justify">Again, no evil befalls the adopted, because no 
    condemnation. "It is God who justifies; who is he who condemns?" What a 
    blessed privilege is this, to be freed from the <i>sting </i>of affliction, 
    and the curse of the law! to be in such a condition that nothing can hurt 
    us! It is fabled—when the dragon has poisoned the water, the unicorn with 
    his horn extracts and draws out the poison. Just so, Jesus Christ has drawn 
    out the poison of every affliction, that it cannot injure the saints.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">(2.) The second benefit, if we are adopted, is that we 
    have an interest in all the promises.</p></b></font> The promises are children's 
    bread. "Believers are heirs of the promises." The promises are <i>sure</i>. 
    God's truth, which is the brightest pearl in his crown, is pawned in a 
    promise. The promises are <i>suitable</i>, like a medical garden, in which 
    there is no disease but there is some herb to cure it. In the dark night of 
    desertion, God has promised to be a sun; in temptation, to tread down Satan. 
    Rom 16:20. Does sin prevail? He has promised to take away its kingly power. 
    Rom 6:14. Oh the heavenly comforts which are distilled from the promises! 
    But who has a right to these? Believers alone, are heirs of the promise. 
    There is not a promise in the Bible but a believer may say, "This is mine!"
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use four: Extol and magnify God's mercy, who has adopted 
    you into his family! </p></b></font>They were slaves of Satan—but God has made 
    them his sons! They were heirs of hell—but God has made them heirs of the 
    kingdom! Adoption is a free gift. He gave them power, or dignity, to become 
    the sons of God. As a thread of silver runs through a whole piece of work, 
    so free grace runs through the whole privilege of adoption. Adoption is a 
    greater mercy than Adam had in paradise; he was a son by <i>creation</i>—but 
    here is a further sonship by <i>adoption</i>. To make us thankful consider, 
    in civil adoption there is some worth and excellence in the person to be 
    adopted; but there was no worth in us, neither beauty, nor parentage, nor 
    virtue; nothing in us to move God to bestow the prerogative of sonship upon 
    us. We have enough in us to move God to <i>correct </i>us—but nothing to 
    move him to <i>adopt </i>us, therefore exalt free grace; begin the work of 
    angels here; bless him with your praises, who has blessed you in making you 
    his sons and daughters.
