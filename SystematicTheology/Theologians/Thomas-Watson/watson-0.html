        An excerpt from Thomas Watson's "A Divine Cordial" 1663
        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          "And we know that<i> <b>all things work together for good</b> </i>to
          those who love God, to those who are the called according to His
          purpose." Romans 8:28
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We shall consider, first—WHAT things work for good to the godly; and
          here we shall show that both the <b>best</b> things and
          <font color="#FF0000"><b>the worst things</b></font> work for their
          good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Do not mistake me, I do not say that of their own nature, the
          <i>worst</i> things are good, for they are a fruit of the curse. But
          though they are naturally evil—yet the wise overruling hand of God
          disposing and sanctifying them—they are morally good. As the elements,
          though of contrary qualities—yet God has so tempered them, that they
          all work in a harmonious manner for the good of the universe. Or as in
          a watch, the wheels seem to move contrary one to another—but all carry
          on the motions of the watch. Just so, things that seem to move cross
          to the godly—yet by the wonderful providence of God, work for their
          good. Among these worst things, there are <b>four sad evils </b>which
          work for good to those who love God.

        >
        <p align="justify">
          It is one heart-quieting consideration in all the afflictions which
          befall us—that God has a special hand in them: "The Almighty has
          afflicted me" (Ruth 1:21). Instruments can no more stir until God
          gives them a commission, than the axe can cut, by itself, without a
          hand. Job eyed God in his affliction: therefore, as Augustine
          observes, he does not say, "The Lord gave—and the devil took away,"
          but, "The Lord has taken away." Whoever brings an affliction to us, it
          is God who sends it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Another heart quieting consideration is—that afflictions work for
          good. "I have sent them into captivity for their own good." (Jer.
          24:6). Judah's captivity in Babylon was for their good. "It is good
          for me that I have been afflicted" (Psalm 119:71). This text, like
          Moses' tree cast into the bitter waters of affliction, may make them
          sweet and wholesome to drink. Afflictions to the godly are
          <i>medicinal</i>. Out of the most poisonous drugs God extracts our
          salvation. Afflictions are as needful as ordinances (1 Peter 1:6). No
          vessel can be made of gold without fire; so it is impossible that we
          should be made vessels of honor, unless we are melted and refined in
          the furnace of affliction. "All the paths of the Lord are mercy and
          truth" (Psalm 35:10). As the painter intermixes bright colors with
          dark shadows; so the wise God mixes mercy with judgment. Those
          afflictive providences which seem to be harmful, are beneficial. Let
          us take some instances in Scripture.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Joseph's</p></b>brethren throw him into a pit;
        afterwards they sell him; then he is cast into prison; yet all this did
        work for his good. His <i>abasement </i>made way for his
        <i>advancement</i>, he was made the second man in the kingdom. "You
        thought evil against me—but God meant it for good" (Gen. 50:20).
        <b> <p align="justify">Jacob</p></b>wrestled with the angel, and the
        hollow of Jacob's thigh was put out of joint. This was sad; but God
        turned it to good, for there he saw God's face, and there the Lord
        blessed him. "Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for I have seen
        God face to face" (Gen. 32:30). Who would not be willing to have a bone
        out of joint, so that he might have a sight of God?
        <p align="justify">
          King <b>Manasseh </b>was bound in <i>chains</i>. This was sad to see—a
          crown of gold changed into fetters. But it wrought for his good, for,
          "So the Lord sent the Assyrian armies, and they took Manasseh
          prisoner. They put a ring through his nose, bound him in bronze
          chains, and led him away to Babylon. But while in
          <i>deep distress</i>, Manasseh sought the Lord his God and cried out
          humbly to the God of his ancestors. And when he prayed, the Lord
          listened to him and was moved by his request for help." (2 Chron.
          33:11-13). He was more indebted to his iron chain—than to his golden
          crown. The one made him proud—the other made him humble.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Job</p></b>was a spectacle of misery; he lost all
        that he ever had; he abounded only in boils and ulcers. This was sad;
        but it wrought for his good, his grace was proved and improved. God gave
        a testimony from heaven of his integrity, and did compensate his loss by
        giving him twice as much as ever he had before (Job 13:10).
        <b> <p align="justify">Paul</p></b>was smitten with blindness. This was
        uncomfortable—but it turned to his good. God did by that blindness, make
        way for the light of grace to shine into his soul; it was the beginning
        of a happy conversion (Acts 9:6).
        <p align="justify">
          As the hard frosts in winter bring on the flowers in the spring; as
          the night ushers in the morning star: so the evils of affliction
          produce much good to those who love God. But we are ready to question
          the truth of this, and say, as Mary did to the angel, "How can this
          be?" Therefore I shall show you several ways how affliction works for
          good.

        rightly understand some of the Psalms—until he was in affliction.
        <p align="justify">
          Affliction teaches what <b>sin </b>is. In the word preached, we hear
          what a dreadful thing sin is, that it is both defiling and damning—but
          we fear it no more than a <i>painted </i>lion; therefore God lets
          loose affliction—and then we feel sin bitter in the fruit of it. A
          sick bed often teaches more than a sermon. We can best see the
          <i>ugly visage of sin </i>in the looking-glass of affliction!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Affliction teaches us to know <b>ourselves</b>. In prosperity we are
          for the most part strangers to ourselves. God afflicts us—that we may
          better know ourselves. We see that corruption in our hearts, in the
          time of affliction, which we would not believe was there. Water in the
          glass looks clear—but set it on the fire, and the scum boils up. In
          prosperity, a man seems to be humble and thankful, the water looks
          clear; but set this man a little on the <i>fire of affliction</i>, and
          <i>the scum boils up</i>—much impatience and unbelief appear. "Oh,"
          says a Christian, "I never thought I had such a bad heart, as now I
          see I have! I never thought my corruptions had been so strong, and my
          graces so weak."

        >In prosperity the heart is apt to be divided (Hos. 10:2). The heart
        cleaves partly to God—and partly to the world. It is like a needle
        between two loadstones: God draws, and the world draws. Now God takes
        away the world—that the heart may cleave more to Him in sincerity.
        Correction is a setting the heart right and straight. As we sometimes
        hold a crooked rod over the fire to straighten it; so God holds us over
        the fire of affliction to make us more straight and upright. Oh, how
        good it is, when sin has bent the soul awry from God, that affliction
        should straighten it again!

        >God's rod is a pencil to draw Christ's image more lively upon us. It is
        good that there should be symmetry and proportion between the Head and
        the members. Would we be parts of Christ's mystical body, and not like
        Him? His life, as Calvin says, was a series of sufferings, "a man of
        sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (Isaiah 53:3). He wept, and bled.
        Was His head crowned with thorns, and do we think to be crowned with
        roses? It is good to be like Christ, though it be by sufferings. Jesus
        Christ drank a bitter cup, it made Him sweat drops of blood to think of
        it; and, though He drank the <i>poison </i>in the cup (the wrath of God)
        yet there is some <i> wormwood </i>in the cup left, which the saints
        must drink: only here is the difference between Christ's sufferings and
        ours; His were atoning, ours are only chastening.

        >Sin is the mother, affliction is the daughter; the daughter helps to
        destroy the mother. Sin is like the tree which breeds the worm, and
        affliction is like the worm that eats the tree. There is much corruption
        in the best heart: affliction does by degrees work it out, as the fire
        works out the dross from the gold, "The Lord did this to purge away his
        sin" (Isaiah 27:9). What if we have more of the rough file—if we have
        less rust! Afflictions carry away nothing but the dross of sin. If a
        physician should say to a patient, "Your body is distempered, and full
        of bad humours, which must be cleared out, or you will die. But I will
        prescribe physic which, though it may make you sick—yet it will carry
        away the dregs of your disease, and save your life." Would not this be
        for the good of the patient? Afflictions are the medicine which God uses
        to carry off our spiritual diseases; they cure the swelling of pride,
        the fever of lust, the cancer of covetousness. Do they not then work for
        good?

        When you dig away the <i> earth </i>from the root of a tree, it is to
        loosen the tree from the earth. Just so, God digs away our earthly
        comforts to loosen our hearts from the earth. A <i>thorn </i>grows up
        with every <i>flower</i>. God would have the world hang as a loose tooth
        which, being twitched away does not much trouble us. Is it not good to
        be weaned? The oldest saints need it. Why does the Lord break the
        conduit pipe—but that we may go to Him, in whom are "all our fresh
        springs" (Psalm 87:7).

        "In the valley of <i>Achor, </i>is a door of hope" (Hos. 2:15)
        <i>Achor </i>signifies trouble. God sweetens outward pain with inward
        peace. "Your sorrow shall be turned into joy" (John 16:20). Here is the
        water turned into wine. After a bitter pill, God gives sugar. Paul had
        his <i>prison </i>songs. God's rod has <i>honey </i>at the end of it.
        The saints in affliction have had such sweet raptures of joy, that they
        thought themselves in the borders of the heavenly Canaan.

        >"What is man, that you should magnify him, and that you should visit
        him every morning?" (Job 7:17). God does by affliction magnify us three
        ways.
        <p align="justify">
          (1st.) In that He will condescend so low as to take notice of us. It
          is an honor that God will mind dust and ashes. It is a magnifying of
          us, that God thinks us worthy to be smitten. God's not
          <i> striking </i>is a slighting: "Why should you be stricken any
          more?" (Isaiah 1:5). If you will go on in sin, take your course—sin
          yourselves into hell.

        <p align="justify">
          (2nd.) Afflictions also magnify us, as they are ensigns of glory,
          signs of sonship. "If you endure chastening, God deals with you as
          with sons" (Heb. 12:7). Every print of the <i>rod, </i>is a badge of
          honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3rd.) Afflictions tend to the magnifying of the saints, as they make
          them renowned in the world. Soldiers have never been so admired for
          their victories, as the saints have been for their sufferings. The
          zeal and constancy of the martyrs in their trials have rendered them
          famous to posterity. How eminent was Job for his patience! God leaves
          his name upon record: "You have heard of the patience of Job" (James
          5:11). Job the <i> sufferer</i>, was more renowned than Alexander the
          <i>conqueror</i>.

        "Happy is the man whom God corrects" (Job 5:17). What politician or
        moralist ever placed happiness in afflictions? Job does. "Happy is the
        man whom God corrects."
        <p align="justify">
          It may be said, How do afflictions make us happy? We reply that, being
          sanctified, they bring us nearer to God. The moon in the full is
          furthest off from the sun: so are many further off from God in the
          full moon of prosperity; afflictions bring them nearer to God. The
          <i>magnet of mercy </i>does not draw us so near to God as the
          <i>cords of affliction</i>. When Absalom set Joab's corn on fire, then
          he came running to Absalom (2 Sam. 16:30). When God sets our worldly
          comforts on fire, then we run to Him, and make our peace with Him.
          When the prodigal was pinched with need, then he returned home to his
          father (Luke 15:13). When the dove could not find any rest for the
          sole of her foot, then she flew to the ark. When God brings a deluge
          of affliction upon us, then we fly to the ark, Christ. Thus affliction
          makes us happy, in bringing us nearer to God. Faith can make use of
          the waters of affliction, to swim faster to Christ.

        wicked men. When the atheists of the world see that God has a people,
        who serve Him not for a livery—but for love, this stops their mouths.
        The devil accused Job of hypocrisy, that he was a mercenary man, all his
        religion was made up of ends of gold and silver. "Does Job serve God for
        naught? Have not you made a hedge about him?" Etc. "Well," says God,
        "put forth your hand, touch his estate" (Job 1:9). The devil had no
        sooner received a commission—but he falls a breaking down Job's hedge;
        but still Job worships God (Job 1:20), and professes his faith in Him.
        "Though he slays me—yet will I trust in him" (Job 13:15). This silenced
        the devil himself. How it strikes a damp into wicked men, when they see
        that the godly will keep close to God in a suffering condition, and
        that, when they lose all, they yet will hold fast their integrity.

        first lays the dark colors of affliction, and then He lays the golden
        color of glory. The vessel is first seasoned before wine is poured into
        it: the vessels of mercy are first seasoned with affliction, and then
        the wine of glory is poured in. Thus we see afflictions are not
        harmful—but beneficial, to the saints. We should not so much look at the
        evil of affliction, as the good; not so much at the dark side of the
        cloud, as the light.

        Here take notice of two things. His <b>violence </b>in tempting; and so
        he is the <i> red dragon</i>. He labors to storm the castle of the
        heart, he throws in thoughts of blasphemy, he tempts to deny God. These
        are the fiery darts which he shoots, by which he would inflame the
        passions. Also, notice his <b> subtlety </b>in tempting; and so he is
        the <i>old serpent</i>. There are five chief subtleties the devil uses.

            <p align="justify">
              (1.) He observes the temperament and constitution—he lays suitable
              baits of temptation.

        Like the farmer, he knows what grain is best for the soil. Satan will
        not tempt contrary to the natural disposition and temperament. This is
        his policy—he makes the wind and tide go together; that way the natural
        tide of the heart runs, that way the wind of temptation blows. Though
        the devil cannot know men's thoughts—yet he knows their temperament, and
        accordingly he lays his baits. He tempts the ambitious man with a crown,
        the lustful man with beauty.

          ><b>
            <p align="justify">

        Satan's time of tempting is usually after an ordinance—and the reason
        is, he thinks he shall find us most secure. When we have been at solemn
        duties, we are apt to think all is done, and we grow remiss, and leave
        off that zeal and strictness as before; just as a soldier, who after a
        battle leaves off his armor, not once dreaming of an enemy. Satan
        watches his time, and, when we least suspect, then he throws in a
        temptation.

        Thus he handed over a temptation to Job by his wife. "Are you still

        He is most to be feared when he transforms himself into an
        <i>angel of light</i>. He came to Christ with Scripture in his mouth:
        "It is written." The devil baits his hook with religion. He tempts many
        a man to covetousness and extortion under a pretense of providing for
        his family; he tempts some to do away with themselves, that they may
        live no longer to sin against God; and so he draws them into sin, under
        a pretense of avoiding sin. These are his <i>subtle stratagems </i>in
        tempting.

        A tree that is shaken by the wind is more settled and rooted. Just so,
        the blowing of a temptation does but settle a Christian the more in

        The more <i>furiously </i>Satan tempts, the more <i>fervently </i>the
        saint prays. The deer being shot with the dart, runs faster to the
        water. When Satan shoots his fiery darts at the soul, it then runs
        faster to the throne of grace. When Paul had the messenger of Satan to
        buffet him, he says, "For this I besought the Lord thrice, that it might
        depart from me" (2 Cor. 12:8). Temptation is a medicine for carnal
        security. That which makes us pray more, works for good.

        Joseph's mistress tempted him to folly, the stronger her temptation was,
        the stronger was his opposition. That temptation which the devil uses as
        a spur to sin, God makes a bridle to keep back a Christian from it.

        The devil tempts, that he may deceive; but God allows us to be tempted,
        to try us. Temptation is a trial of our sincerity. It argues that our
        heart is chaste and loyal to Christ, when we can look a temptation in
        the face, and turn our back upon it. Also it is a trial of our courage.
        "Ephraim is a silly dove, without heart" (Hosea 8:11). So it may be said
        of many, they are without a heart; they have no heart to resist
        temptation. No sooner does Satan come with his bait—but they yield; like
        a coward who, as soon as the thief approaches, gives him his purse. But
        he is the valorous Christian, who brandishes the sword of the Spirit
        against Satan, and will rather die than yield. The courage of the Romans
        was never more seen than when they were assaulted by the Carthaginians:
        the valor and courage of a saint is never more seen than on a
        battlefield, when he is fighting the red dragon, and by the power of
        faith puts the devil to flight. That grace is <i>tried </i>gold, which
        can stand in the fiery trial, and withstand Satan's fiery darts!

        A Christian must himself be under the buffetings of Satan, before he can
        speak a word in due season to him that is weary. Paul was well-versed in
        temptations. "We are not ignorant of his devices" (2 Cor. 2:11). Thus he
        was able to acquaint others with Satan's cursed wiles (1 Cor. 10:13). A
        man that has ridden over a place where there are bogs and quicksands, is
        the fittest to guide others through that dangerous way. He who has felt
        the claws of the roaring lion, and has lain bleeding under those wounds,
        is the fittest man to deal with one who is tempted. None can better
        discover Satan's subtle devices, than those who have been long in the
        fencing school of temptation.

        The child who is sick and bruised is most looked after. When a saint
        lies under the bruising of temptations, Christ prays, and God the Father
        pities. When Satan puts the soul into a fever, God comes with a cordial;
        which made Luther say, that temptations are Christ's embraces, because
        He then most sweetly manifests Himself to the soul.

        Christ is our Friend, and when we are tempted, He sets all His power
        working for us. "Since he himself has gone through suffering and
        temptation, he is able to help us when we are being tempted" (Heb.
        2:18). If a poor soul was to fight alone with the Goliath of hell, he
        would be sure to be vanquished—but Jesus Christ brings in His auxiliary
        forces, He gives fresh supplies of grace. "We are more than conquerors
        through him who loved us!" (Romans 8:37). Thus the <i>evil </i>of
        temptation is overruled for good.
        <b> <p align="justify">Question.</p></b>But sometimes Satan foils a
        child of God. How does this work for good?
        <b> <p align="justify">Answer.</p></b>I grant that, through the
        suspension of divine grace, and the fury of a temptation, a saint may be
        overcome; yet this foiling by a temptation shall be overruled for good.
        By this foil God makes way for the augmentation of grace. Peter was
        tempted to self-confidence, he presumed upon his own strength; and
        Christ let him fall. But this wrought for his good, it cost him many a
        tear. "He went out, and wept bitterly" (Matt. 26:75). And now he grows
        less self-reliant. He dared not say he loved Christ more than the other
        apostles. "Do you love me more than these?" (John 21:15). He dared not
        say so—his fall into sin broke the neck of his pride!
        <p align="justify">
          The foiling by a temptation causes more circumspection and
          watchfulness in a child of God. Though Satan did before decoy him into
          sin—yet for the future he will be the more cautious. He will have a
          care of coming within the lion's chain any more. He is more vigilant
          and fearful of the occasions of sin. He never goes out without his
          spiritual armor, and he girds on his armor by prayer. He knows he
          walks on slippery ground, therefore he looks wisely to his steps. He
          keeps close sentinel in his soul, and when he spies the devil coming,
          he grasps his spiritual weapons, and displays the shield of faith
          (Eph. 6:16). This is all the hurt the devil does when he foils a saint
          by temptation—he cures him of his careless neglect; he makes him watch
          and pray more. When wild beasts get over the hedge and damage the
          grain, a man will make his fence the stronger. Just so, when the devil
          gets over the hedge by a temptation, a Christian will be sure to mend
          his fence; he will become more fearful of sin, and careful of duty.
          Thus the being worsted by temptation works for good.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Objection.</p></b> But if being foiled works for
        good, this may make Christians careless whether they are overcome by
        temptations or not. <b> <p align="justify">Answer.</p></b>There is a
        great deal of difference between <i>falling </i>into a temptation, and
        <i>running </i>into a temptation. The <i>falling </i>into a temptation
        shall work for good, not the <i>running </i>
        into it. He who falls into a river is fit for help and pity—but he who
        desperately runs into it, is guilty of his own death. It is madness
        running into a lion's den. He who runs himself into a temptation is like
        king Saul—who fell upon his own sword.
        <p align="justify">
          From all that has been said, see how God disappoints the old serpent,
          making his temptations turn to the good of His people. Surely if the
          devil knew how much benefit accrues to the saints by temptation, he
          would forbear to tempt. Luther once said, "There are three things
          which make a godly man—prayer, meditation, and temptation." Paul, in
          his voyage to Rome, met with a contrary wind (Acts 27:4). So the wind
          of temptation is a contrary wind to that of the Spirit; but God makes
          use of this cross wind, to blow the saints to heaven!<br />

          The evil of <b>desertion </b>works for good. The spouse complains of
          desertion. "My beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone!" (Cant.
          5:6). There is a twofold withdrawing; either in regard of
          <b>grace</b>, when God suspends the influence of His Spirit, and
          withholds the lively actings of grace. If the Spirit is gone, grace
          freezes into a chillness and indolence. Or, a withdrawing in regard of
          <b>comfort</b>. When God withholds the sweet manifestations of His
          favor, He does not look with such a pleasant aspect—but veils His
          face, and seems to be quite gone from the soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is <b>just </b>in all His withdrawings. We desert Him before He
          deserts us. We desert God—when we leave off close communion with Him;
          when we desert His truths and dare not appear for Him; when we leave
          the guidance and conduct of His word, and follow the deceitful light
          of our own corrupt affections and passions. We desert God first;
          therefore we have none to blame but ourselves.

          Desertion is very sad, for as when the <i>light </i>is withdrawn,
          darkness follows in the air—so when God withdraws, there is darkness
          and sorrow in the soul. Desertion is an agony of conscience. God holds
          the soul over hell. "The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the
          poison whereof drinks up my spirits" (Job 6:4). It was a custom among
          the Persians in their wars, to dip their arrows in the poison of
          serpents to make them more deadly. Thus did God shoot the
          <i>poisoned arrow of desertion </i>into Job, under the wounds of which
          his spirit lay bleeding. In times of desertion the people of God are
          apt to be dejected. They dispute against themselves, and think that
          God has quite cast them off. Therefore I shall prescribe some
          <b>comfort </b>to the deserted soul.

        Christ may withdraw, and leave the soul awhile—but He will come again.
        "In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment—but with
        everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you" (Isaiah 64:8). When it is
        low water—the tide will come in again. "I will not always show my
        anger." (Isaiah 57:16). The tender <i>mother </i>sets down her
        <i>child </i>in anger—but she will take it up again into her arms, and
        kiss it. God may put away the soul in anger—but He will take it up again
        into His dear embraces, and display His banner of love over it.

        Can there be a greater misery than to have God's displeasure? What makes

        sin? "They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid
        him" (John 20:13). Just so, our sins have taken away the Lord, and we
        know not where He is laid. The favor of God is the best jewel; it can
        sweeten a prison, and unsting death. Oh, how odious then is that sin,
        which robs us of our best jewel! Sin made God desert His temple (Ezek.
        8:6). Sin causes Him to appear as an enemy, and dress Himself in armor.
        This makes the soul pursue sin with a holy malice, and seek to be
        avenged on it! The deserted soul gives sin gall and vinegar to drink,
        and, with the <i>spear of mortification</i>, lets out the heart-blood of

        When Christ was departed, the spouse pursues after Him, she "searched

        found Him, she makes a cry after Him, "Have you seen him anywhere, this
        one I love so much?" (Cant. 3:3). The deserted soul sends up whole
        volleys of sighs and groans. It knocks at heaven's gate by prayer—it can

        Just so, sin lived in, hinders the sweet current of God's love. Thus

        feeds them with the hidden manna. "Light is sown for the righteous"
        (Psalm 97:11.) The saints' comforts may be hidden like seed under

        Were there no sinners, we could not be in such a capacity for service.
        The godly are often the means of converting the wicked; their prudent
        advice and pious example is a <i>lure </i>and a <i>bait </i>to draw
        sinners to the embracing of the gospel. The disease of the
        <i>patient, </i>works for the good of the <i>physician</i>; by healing
        the patient, the physician enriches himself. Just so, by converting
        sinners from the error of their way, our crown comes to be enlarged.
        "Those who turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the
        <i>stars </i>forever and ever" (Dan. 12:31). Not as <i>lamps </i>or
        <i>candles</i>—but as the <i>stars </i>forever! Thus we see the sins of
        others are overruled for our good.

              (2). The sense of their OWN sinfulness, will be overruled for the

        >Thus our own sins shall work for good. This must be understood
        carefully, when I say the sins of the godly work for good—not that there
        is the least good in sin. Sin is like poison, which corrupts the blood,
        and infects the heart; and, without a sovereign antidote, sin always
        brings death. Such is the venomous nature of sin—it is <i>deadly </i>and
        <i>damning</i>. Sin is worse than hell. But yet God, by His mighty
        over-ruling power, makes sin in the outcome turn to the good of His
        people. Hence that golden saying of Augustine, "God would never permit
        evil—if He could not bring good out of evil." The feeling of sinfulness
        in the saints, works for good several ways.

        >That sin is <i>in </i>the godly—is sad; but that it is their
        <i>burden—</i>is good. Paul's <i>afflictions </i>(pardon the expression)
        were but <i>child's play </i>to him—in comparison of his <i>sin</i>. He
        rejoiced in tribulation (2 Cor. 7:4). But how did this bird of paradise
        weep and bemoan himself under his sins! "Who shall deliver me from the
        body of this death?" (Romans 7:24). A believer carries his
        <i>sins </i>as a prisoner his <i>shackles</i>; oh, how does he long for
        the day of release! This sense of sin is good.

        Christ the physician to him! He who feels himself stung with sin—how
        precious is the brazen serpent to him! When Paul had bemoaned his body
        of death—how thankful was he for Christ! "I thank God through Jesus
        Christ our Lord!" (Romans 7:25). Christ's blood <i>saves </i> from sin,
        and is the sacred ointment which <i>kills </i>this deadly disease of
        sin.

          <p align="justify">(a) Sin puts the soul upon self-searching.</p></b
        >
        A child of God being conscious of sin, takes the candle and lantern of
        the Word, and searches into his heart. He desires to know the worst of
        himself; as a man who is diseased in body, desires to know the worst of
        his disease. Though our joy lies in the knowledge of our
        <i>graces</i>—yet there is some benefit in the knowledge of our
        <i>corruptions</i>. Therefore Job prays, "Reveal to me my transgression
        and sin" (Job 13:23). It is good to know our sins—that we may not
        flatter ourselves, or take our condition to be better than it is. It is
        good to find out our sins—lest they find us out!
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            (b) Sin puts a child of God upon self-abasing.
          </p></b
        >Sin is left in a godly man—as a cancer in the breast, or a hunch upon
        the back—to keep him from being proud. Gravel and dirt are good to
        <i>ballast </i>a ship, and keep it from overturning; the sense of sin
        helps to ballast the soul, that it be not overturned with pride. We read
        of the "spots of God's children" (Deut. 32:5). When a godly man beholds
        his face in the looking-glass of Scripture—he sees the spots of pride,
        lust and hypocrisy. They are humbling spots—and make the
        <i>plumes of pride </i>fall off! It is a good use that may be made even
        of our sins, when they occasion low thoughts of ourselves. Better is
        that sin which humbles me—than that duty which makes me proud! Holy
        Bradford uttered these words of himself, "I am but a painted hypocrite";
        and Hooper said, "Lord, I am hell—and You are heaven."
        <b>
          <p align="justify">(c) Sin puts a child of God on self-judging.</p></b
        >
        He passes a sentence upon himself. ''I am more brutish than any man"
        (Proverbs 30:2). It is dangerous to judge <i>others</i>—but it is good
        to judge <i> ourselves</i>. But if we judged ourselves, we would not
        come under judgment" (1 Cor. 11:31). When a man has judged himself,
        Satan is put out of office. When Satan lays anything to a saint's
        charge, he is able to retort and say, "It is true, Satan, I
        <i>am </i>guilty of these sins; but I have judged myself already for
        them; and having condemned myself in the lower court of conscience, God
        will acquit me in the upper court of heaven."

            (d) Sin puts a child of God upon self-conflicting.
          </p></b
        >
        Spiritual self conflicts with carnal self. "The spirit lusts against the
        flesh" (Gal. 5:17). Our life is a wayfaring life—and a war-faring life.
        There is a duel fought every day between the two seeds. A believer will
        not let sin have peaceable possession. If he cannot keep sin <i>out</i>,
        he will keep sin <i>down</i>; though he cannot quite overcome—yet he is
        overcoming. "To him who is overcoming" (Rev. 2:7).
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            (e) Sin puts a child of God upon self-observing.
          </p></b
        >He knows sin is a bosom traitor, therefore he carefully observes
        himself. A subtle and deceitful heart, needs a watchful eye. The heart
        is like a castle which is continually in danger to be assaulted; this
        makes a child of God to be always a sentinel, and keep a guard over his
        heart. A believer has a strict eye over himself, lest he fall into any
        scandalous sin—and so open a sluice to let all his comfort run out.
        <b> <p align="justify">(f) Sin puts the soul upon self-reforming.</p></b
        >A child of God does not only <i>find </i>out sin—but <i>drives </i>out
        sin! One foot he sets upon the neck of his sins—and the other foot he
        "turns to God's testimonies" (Psalm 119. 59). Thus the sins of the godly
        work for good. God makes the saints' <i>maladies</i>—their
        <i>medicines</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          But let none abuse this doctrine. I do not say that sin works for good
          to an <i>impenitent </i>person. No, it works for his damnation! Sin
          only works for good to those who love God; and for you who are godly,
          I know you will not draw a wrong conclusion from this—either to make
          <i>light </i>of sin, or to make <i>bold </i>with sin. If you should do
          so, God will make it cost you dearly! Remember David. He ventured
          presumptuously on sin, and what did he get? He lost his peace, he felt
          the terrors of the Almighty in his soul, though he had all helps to
          cheerfulness. He was a king; he had skill in music; yet nothing could
          administer comfort to him; he complains of his "broken bones" (Psalm
          51:8). And though he did at last come out of that
          <i>dark cloud</i>—yet perhaps he never recovered his
          <i>full joy </i>to his dying day. If any of God's people should be
          tampering with sin, because God can turn it to good; though the Lord
          does not <i>damn </i>them—He may send them to hell in this life. He
          may put them into such bitter agonies and soul convulsions, as may
          fill them full of horror, and make them draw near to despair. Let this
          be a flaming sword to keep them from coming near the forbidden tree!
