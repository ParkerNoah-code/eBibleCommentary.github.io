    The Godly Should SPEAK of God</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Having done with the <i>character </i>of the godly in 
    general terms, I proceed next to their special characteristics: "Then those 
    who feared the Lord<i> talked with each other</i>". When the wicked said, 
    "It is vain to serve God", then "Then those who feared the Lord<i> talked 
    often with each other</i>". The meaning of this word, they "talked often", 
    is they discoursed piously together; their tongues were divinely tuned by 
    the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Christians, when they meet together, should be much in 
    "holy conference". This is not only an advice—but a charge: "You must commit 
    yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands I am giving you today. Repeat 
    them again and again to your children. <i>Talk </i>about them when you are 
    at home and when you are away on a journey, when you are lying down and when 
    you are getting up again." (Deut. 6:6). Indeed, where there is <i>grace 
    poured in</i>—it will effuse out! Grace changes the language—and makes it 
    spiritual. When the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles, they "spoke with 
    other tongues" (Acts 2:4). Grace makes Christian speak with other tongues. A 
    godly Christian not only has the law of God in his <i>heart </i>(Psalm 
    37:31)—but in his <i>tongue! </i>(verse 30). The body is the <i>temple </i>
    of God (1 Cor. 6:19). The tongue is the <i>organ </i>in this temple, which 
    sounds in holy discourse! "The tongue of the just is as choice silver" 
    (Prov. 10:20). He drops silver sentences, enriching others with spiritual 
    knowledge! "The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in 
    him; and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. 
    But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for 
    every careless word they have spoken. For by your words you will be 
    acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned." (Matt. 12:35-37). In 
    the godly man's heart, there is a <i>treasury of goodness</i>, and this is 
    not like a bag of hidden money—but he brings something out of the treasury 
    within—to the enriching of others. </p>
<p align="justify">Grace is of the nature of fire, which will not be pent 
    up. Like new wine, grace requires a vent (Acts 4:20). There is a principle 
    within, which constrains to holy conference: "I am full of words, and my 
    spirit compels me to speak." (Job 32:18).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The first use of this doctrine is for INFORMATION. </p></b>
</font>It shows the character and temper of true saints: they "speak often 
    one to another"; their lips drop as a <i>honeycomb</i>. The country to which 
    a man belongs—is known by his language. He who belongs to the Jerusalem 
    above—speaks the language of Canaan. None of God's children are <i>dumb</i>; 
    their mouth is a "wellspring of wisdom" (Prov. 18:4).
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The second use is REPROOF. </p></b></font>Here I may draw up 
    a bill of indictment against five sorts of people.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Such as are SILENT in matters of true religion.</p></b></font> 
    They would be counted godly—but he must have good <i>eyes</i>, who can <i>
    see </i>it! I know not whether it is <i>ignorance </i>or <i>timidity</i>—which 
    sets godly discourse aside. Many are as mute in piety—as if their tongues 
    did cleave to the roof of their mouth! Had they any love to God, or had they 
    ever tasted how sweet the Lord is—their mouth would "talk of his 
    righteousness" (Psalm 71:24). 
<p align="justify">Friends, what should concern us but <i>salvation</i>? 
    What are the things of this <i>world</i>? They are neither <i>real </i>or <i>
    lasting </i>(Proverbs 23:5). Do we not see men heap up riches, and suddenly 
    death, as God's sergeant, arrests them! What should we talk of—but the 
    things pertaining to the kingdom of God? Let this cause <i>blushing </i>
    among Christians—that their meetings are so unprofitable, because they leave 
    God out of their discourse!</p>
<p align="justify">Why is there no godly conference? Have you so much 
    spiritual knowledge, that you need not have it increased? Have you so much 
    faith, that you need not have it strengthened? Silence in piety—is a loud 
    sin! We read of one who was possessed with a <i>dumb devil </i>(Mark 9:17). 
    How many are spiritually possessed with a <i>dumb devil!</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is a rebuke to such as, when they meet together, 
    instead of speaking of heaven, have IDLE, FROTHY discourse! </p></b></font>They 
    talk—but do not say anything spiritually profitable. Their lips do not drop 
    as a honeycomb. Their speaking is no more profitable, than an infant's 
    mutterings. "They speak <i>vanity </i>everyone with his neighbor" (Psalm 
    12:2). If Christ should ask some today, as he did the two disciples going to 
    Emmaus, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" (Luke 24:17); 
    they could not answer as those did, "The things concerning Jesus the 
    Nazarene!" No, perhaps they were talking about toys, or new fashions! If <i>
    idle words </i>must be accounted for (Matt. 12:36), Lord, what an account 
    will some have to give!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. It reproves the avaricious person who, instead of 
    speaking of heaven, talks of nothing but the WORLD.</p></b></font> The <i>farmer
    </i>speaks of his plough and yoke of oxen; the <i>tradesman </i>of his wares 
    and drugs; but not a word of God. "The one who is from the earth belongs to 
    the <i>earth</i>—and speaks as one from the <i>earth.</i>" (John 3:31). Many 
    are like the fish in the gospel—which had <i>money </i>in its mouth! (Matt. 
    17:27). They talk only of <i>secular </i>things, as if they imagined to 
    fetch happiness out of that earth which God has cursed!
<p align="justify">Seneca, being asked of what country he was, answered he 
    was "a citizen of this world". We may know many to be citizens of this 
    world—their speech betrays them! O souls bent towards the earth and empty of 
    spiritual things!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. It reproves those who do indeed speak often to one 
    another—but with EVIL speech.</p></b></font> "The tongue also is a fire, a world 
    of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the 
    whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell." (James 
    3:6).
<p align="justify">i. They speak one to another in <font color="#b07050"><b>
    harsh </b></font>words. Their words should be like the "waters of 
    Shiloh—which go <i>softly</i>" (Isaiah 8:6). But too often they are fierce 
    and biting. Water, when it is <i>hot</i>, soon boils over; when the heart is 
    heated with anger—it soon boils over in furious speech!</p>
<p align="justify">Many curse in their anger. The tongue is made in the 
    fashion of a <i>sword</i>—and it <i>cuts </i>like a sword! Angry words often 
    harm the one who utters them. Rehoboam with one churlish word, lost ten 
    tribes. A fiery spirit is unsuitable to the <i>Master </i>we serve—"the 
    Prince of Peace"; and to his <i>message</i>—"the gospel of peace". Such 
    whose tongues are set on fire, let them take heed that they do not one day 
    in hell, desire a drop of water to cool their tongue! (Luke 16:24).</p>
<p align="justify">ii. They speak one to another in a bad sense, who
    <font color="#b07050"><b>MURMUR </b></font>and <font color="#b07050"><b>
    COMPLAIN </b></font>one to another. They do not complain of their sins—but 
    their vain desires. Murmuring proceeds from unbelief: "They did not <i>
    believe </i>his word: but <i>murmured</i>" (Psalm 106:24-25). When men 
    distrust God's <i>promises</i>, they murmur at his <i>providences</i>. This 
    is a sin God can hardly bear! "How long shall I bear with this evil 
    congregation, which murmurs against me?" (Num. 14:27). Israel's speeches 
    were venomous, and God punished them with venomous serpents! (1 Cor: 10:10).</p>
<p align="justify">iii. They speak one to another in a bad sense who give 
    vent to<font color="#b07050"><b> FILTHY, CORRUPT </b></font>language. The 
    heart is a <i>cask </i>full of wickedness, and the tongue is the <i>tap </i>
    which lets it flow out! When the face breaks out in sores and pimples—it 
    shows that the blood is corrupt. When men break forth in filthy speech—it 
    shows the heart is corrupt. We read that the lips of the <i>leper </i>were 
    to be covered (Lev. 13:45). It would be a blessing—if we could cover the 
    filthy lips of our spiritual lepers!</p>
<p align="justify">iv. They speak one to another in a bad sense who, instead 
    of seasoning their words with grace, mix them with <font color="#b07050"><b>
    SWEARING</b></font>. Swearers rend and tear God's name, and, like mad 
    dogs—fly in the face of God! "Because of swearing the land mourns" (Jer. 
    23:10). Some think it <i>fine </i>speech, to mix every sentence with an 
    oath; as if they would go to hell <i>genteelly</i>. "But", says one, "it is 
    my custom to swear." Is this an <i>excuse—</i>or an <i>aggravation </i>of 
    the sin? If a malefactor should he arraigned for robbery, and he should say 
    to the judge, "Spare me—for it is my custom to rob and steal", the judge 
    would say, "You shall all the more die!" <i>For every oath that a man 
    swears, God puts a drop of wrath into his vial!</i></p>

<p align="justify">v. It reproves those who, instead of speaking in a holy 
    manner one to another, speak <b>of </b>others:</p>
<p align="justify">First, they speak of others in CENSURING. Some make it a 
    part of their religion to talk about and criticize others. They do not 
    imitate their <i>graces</i>—but speak upon their <i>failings</i>. God grant 
    that professors may wash their hands of this! Were people's hearts more <i>
    humble</i>—their tongues would he more <i>charitable!</i> It is the sign of 
    a hypocrite—to criticize others and commend himself.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, they speak of others in SLANDERING. "You 
    slander your own mother's son!" (Psalm 50:20). Slandering is when we speak 
    to the harm of another—and speak that which is not true. <i>Worth </i>is 
    blasted by slander! Holiness itself is no shield from this sin. The <i>
    lamb's </i>innocency will not preserve it from the <i>wolf! </i>Job calls 
    slandering "the <i>scourge </i>of the tongue" (Job 5:21). You may <i>smite
    </i>a man—yet never <i>touch </i>him! A slanderer wounds another's 
    reputation, and no physician can heal these wounds! The <i>eye </i>and the
    <i>name—</i>are two tender things. God takes it ill at our hands—to 
    calumniate others, especially to slander those who help to keep up the 
    credit of true religion: "Were you not afraid to speak against my servant 
    Moses?" (Num. 12:8). What, my servant, who has wrought so many miracles, 
    whom I have spoken with face to face on the mount! Were you not afraid to 
    speak against <i>him! </i></p>

<p align="justify">The Greek word for <i>slanderer </i>signifies <i>devil</i> 
    (1 Tim. 3:11). Slander is the devil's proper sin—he is "the accuser of the 
    brethren" (Rev. 12:10). The devil does not commit adultery—but he bears 
    false witness. The slanderer may be indicted for <i>clipping</i>; he <i>
    clips </i>his neighbor's credit to make it weigh lighter. Our nature is 
    prone to slander; but remember, it is just as much a sin in God's reckoning 
    to break the Ninth Commandment, as the Eighth Commandment.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The third use is EXHORTATION.</p></b></font> Put this great 
    duty into <i>practice!</i> Imitate these holy ones in the text, who "spoke 
    often one to another". Jerome thinks they spoke something in defense of the 
    providence of God; they vindicated God in his dealings, and exhorted one 
    another not to be discouraged at the virulent speeches of the wicked—but 
    still to hold on a course of piety. Thus, Christians, when you meet, give 
    one another's <i>souls </i>a visit—impart your spiritual knowledge, impart 
    your experiences to each other (Psalm 66:16). Samson having found honey, did 
    not only eat of it himself—but carried it to his father and mother (Judges 
    14:9). Have you tasted the honey of the Word? Let others have a taste with 
    you!
<p align="justify">He who has been in a perfumer's shop does not only 
    himself partake of those sweet fragrances—but some of the perfume sticks to 
    his clothes, so that those who come near him partake of those perfumes. Just 
    so, having ourselves partaken of the sweet savor of Christ's ointments, we 
    should let others partake with us, and by our heavenly discourse, diffuse 
    the <i>perfume of piety </i>to them. Let your words be seasoned with salt 
    (Col. 4:6). Let grace be the salt which seasons your words and makes them 
    savory. Christians should take all occasions for godly discourse, when they 
    walk together, and sit at table together. This makes their eating and 
    drinking to be "to the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31). What makes it a 
    communion of saints--but godly conversation?</p>
<p align="justify">But some may say they are barren of <i>matter</i>—and 
    know not what to speak of. Have you walked so often through the <i>field </i>
    of Scripture—yet gathered no ears of corn? Have not you matter enough in the 
    Word to furnish you with something to say? Let me suggest a few things to 
    you. When you meet, speak one to another of the <b>promises</b>. No honey is 
    so sweet—as that which drops from a promise! The promises are the support of 
    faith, the springs of joy, and the saints royal charter. Are you citizens of 
    heaven, and yet do not speak of your charter?</p>
<p align="justify">Speak of the preciousness of <b>Christ</b>. He is all 
    beauty and love; he has laid down his blood as the price of your redemption. 
    Have you a friend who has redeemed you—and yet you never speak of him?</p>
<p align="justify">Speak one to another of <b>sin</b>, what a deadly evil it 
    is, how it has infected your virgin-nature, and turned it into a lesser 
    hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Speak of the beauty of <b>holiness</b>, which is the 
    souls embroidery, filling it with such orient splendor, as makes God and 
    angels fall in love with it. The <i>graces </i>are the sacred characters of 
    the divine nature.</p>
<p align="justify">Speak one to another of your <b>souls</b>: enquire 
    whether they are in good health.</p>
<p align="justify">Speak about <b>death </b>and <b>eternity</b>: can you 
    belong to heaven and not speak of your country?</p>
<p align="justify">Thus, you see, here is matter enough, for holy 
    conference. Why then do you not maintain godly discourse? I believe that one 
    main reason for the decay of the power of godliness, is a lack of Christian 
    conference. People when they meet talk of <i>vanities</i>—but <i>God </i>and
    <i>heaven </i>are left out of their discourse! That I may <b>persuade </b>
    you in your conversations to put in a word about your souls—let me offer 
    these few things for your consideration.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Holy conversation was the practice of the saints of 
    old.</p></b></font> Elijah and Elisha went on in godly discourse until the 
    chariot of heaven came to part them (2 Kings 2:11). David's tongue was tuned 
    to the <i>language of Canaan</i>, "My tongue shall talk of your 
    righteousness" (Psalm 71:24). The primitive Christians, into whatever 
    company they came, spoke of a <i>glorious kingdom </i>they expected, so that 
    some thought they were ambitious of worldly honor. But the kingdom they 
    looked for, was not of <i>this world </i>but a kingdom with Christ in 
    heaven. Jerome says that some of the Christian ladies spent much of their 
    time in communing together, and would not let him alone—but continually 
    asked him questions about their souls.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. We are bidden to redeem the time </p></b></font>(Eph. 
    5:16). The poets painted time with <i>wings, </i>because it <i>flies</i> so 
    fast! Time <i>lost </i>must be redeemed, and is there any better way to 
    redeem time, than to improve it in trading for heaven, and speaking of God 
    and our souls?
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Jesus Christ has left us a pattern. </p></b></font>His 
    words were perfumed with holiness, "All bore him witness, and wondered at 
    the <i>gracious </i>words which proceeded out of his mouth!" (Luke 4:22). 
    Christ had grace poured into his lips (Psalm 45:2.). In all companies, he 
    maintained godly discourse. When he sat on Jacob's well, he falls into an 
    heavenly discourse with the woman of Samaria about the water of life (John 
    4:14). And so when Levi made him a feast (Luke 5:29), Christ feasts him in 
    return—with heavenly discourse. And no sooner was Christ risen from the 
    grave but he "was speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God" 
    (Acts 1:3). <i>The more spiritual we are in our speeches—the more we 
    resemble Christ! </i>Should not the <i>members </i>he like the <i>Head? </i>
    Christ will not be our <i>Savior</i>—unless we make him our <i>pattern</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. <i>Godly </i>discourse would prevent <i>sinful </i>
    discourse. </p></b></font>Much <i>sin </i>passes in ordinary talk—as <i>gravel
    </i>and <i>mud </i>pass along with water. How many are guilty of 
    tongue-sins! Godly discourse would prevent evil—as labor prevents idleness. 
    If we accustomed our tongues to the heavenly dialect, the devil would not 
    have so much power over us.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. We may somewhat have a knowledge of men's hearts—by 
    their common discourse. </p></b></font><i>Words are the looking-glass of the 
    mind. </i>As you may judge of a face by the mirror, whether it be fair or 
    foul; so by the words—we may judge of a man's heart. A lascivious tongue 
    shows a <i>lustful </i>heart; an earthly tongue shows a <i>covetous </i>
    heart; a gracious tongue shows a <i>gracious </i>heart. The Ephraimites were 
    known by their pronunciation, saying "sibboleth" for "s<i>h</i>ibboleth" (Judg. 
    12:6). So by the manner of our speech—it may be known to whom we belong. The
    <i>tongue </i>is the index of the <i>heart</i>! If you broach a cask, that 
    which is within, will come out. By that which comes out of the mouth—you may 
    guess what is within, in the heart! "Of the abundance of the heart—the mouth 
    speaks" (Luke 6:45).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Godly discourse is beneficial. </p></b></font>"The tongue 
    of the wise brings healing." (Proverbs 12:18) A word spoken in season may 
    make such a powerful impression upon another's heart, which will do him good 
    all his life. One single <i>coal </i>is apt to die—but many coals put 
    together keep in the heat. Christians by their heavenly talk may "blow up" 
    one another's grace into a flame!
<p align="justify">When the daughters of Jerusalem had conversed a while 
    with the spouse, and had heard her describe Christ's admirable beauty, their 
    affections began to be inflamed, and they would seek him with her. "Where is 
    your beloved gone, O fairest among women—that we may seek him with you?" 
    (Song of Sol. 6:1).</p>
<p align="justify">A Christian by divine discourse may <i>enlighten </i>
    another when he is ignorant; <i>warm </i>him when he is frozen; <i>comfort
    </i>him when he is sad; and <i>confirm </i>him when he is wavering. Latimer 
    was much strengthened by discourse with Thomas Bilney in prison, and hearing 
    his confession of faith. A godly <i>life </i>adorns true religion—a godly <i>
    tongue </i>propagates it! When the apostle would have us edify one another, 
    what better way could he prescribe than this—to have such holy speeches 
    proceed out of our mouths as might "minister grace unto the hearers" (Eph. 
    4:29)?</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. We must be accountable to God for our speech. </p></b>
</font>Words are judged <i>light </i>by men—but they weigh <i>heavy </i>in 
    God's balance. By our words we shall be either <i>saved </i>or <i>damned</i>. 
    "For by your words you shall he justified, and by your words you shall be 
    condemned" (Malt. 12:37). If our words have been seasoned with grace—then 
    the acquitting sentence is likely to go on our side.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Godly discourse is a Christian's honor.</p></b></font> The 
    tongue is called our glory (Psalm 30:12), because it is the instrument of 
    glorifying God. When our tongues are out of tune in murmuring, then they are 
    not our glory; but when the organs sound in holy discourse, then our tongues 
    are our glory.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Godly discourse will be a means to bring Christ into 
    our company.</p></b></font> While the two disciples were conferring about the 
    death and sufferings of Christ, Jesus Christ himself came among them: "While 
    they communed together . . . Jesus himself drew near, and went with them" 
    (Luke 24:15). When bad discourse prevails—Satan draws near and makes one of 
    the company; but when godly discourse is promoted—Jesus Christ draws near.
<p align="justify">Let all that has been said excite us to godly discourse. 
    Certainly, there is no better way than this to increase our stock of grace. 
    Others by spending grow poor; but the more we spend ourselves in holy 
    discourse, the richer we grow in grace; as the widow's oil, by pouring out, 
    increased (2 Kings 4).</p>
<p align="justify">Question: <font color="#0000ff"><b>How may godly 
    conference be arrived at?</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. If you wish to discourse of true religion, get 
    your minds well furnished with knowledge.</p></b></font> Hereby, you will have a
    <i>treasury </i>to fetch from. "I am pent up and full of words" (Job 32:18). 
    Some are backward to speak of godly things for lack of matter. The <i>empty
    </i>vessel cannot run. If you would have your tongues run fluently in piety, 
    they must be fed with a spring of knowledge. "Let the word of Christ dwell 
    in you richly" (Col. 3:16). In one of the miracles which Christ wrought, he 
    first caused the water-pots to he <i>filled </i>with water, and then said, 
    "Now draw some out" (John 2:8). So we must first have our heads <i>filled
    </i>with knowledge, and then we shall be able to draw out to others in godly 
    discourse.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. If you would discourse readily in the things of 
    God, make piety your delight.</p></b></font> What men <i>delight </i>in—they 
    will be <i>speaking </i>of. The sensualist speaks of his sports; the 
    worldling of his rich purchase. <i>Delight </i>makes the tongue as the pen 
    of a ready writer. The spouse, being delighted and enamored with Christ's 
    beauty, could not conceal herself; she makes an elegant and passionate 
    oration in the commendation of Christ. "My beloved is white and ruddy, the 
    chief among ten thousand! Yes—he is altogether lovely!" (Song of Solomon 
    5:10, 16).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. Pray that God will both gift and grace you for 
    Christian conference. </p></b></font>"O Lord, open my lips!" (Psalm 51:15). 
    Satan has locked up men's lips. Pray that God will open them. Perhaps you 
    pray that you may believe in Christ—but do you pray that you may commend 
    him, and not be ashamed to speak of him before others? "I will speak of your 
    testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed" (Psalm 119:46). To 
    end this, let me briefly insert two cautions:
<p align="justify">Caution 1. I do not deny that it is lawful to confer of 
    worldly business sometimes; communication requires conference. But with this 
    proviso, that we should show more delight and earnestness in speaking of 
    spiritual things than earthly things, remembering that the <i>soul </i>is 
    far more valuable than the <i>world</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Caution 2. When people speak of true religion, let it not 
    be for any sinister, unworthy end, nor for <i>ostentation</i>—but for <i>
    edification</i>; and then, having your aim right, speak of the things of 
    God, with life and affection, that others may perceive you <i>feel </i>those 
    truths of which you <i>speak</i>.</p>

<p align="justify">A. The Godly Should Meditate on God's Name</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">The second special characteristic of the godly in the 
    text is, "they thought upon God's name." These saints, when they were 
    together—<i>spoke </i>of God; when they were alone—they <i>thought </i>of 
    God. They "thought upon his name".</p>
<p align="justify">Question. <font color="#0000ff"><b>What is meant by God's 
    name?</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">Answer 1. By the name of God is meant his <i>essence</i>; 
    God's name is put for <i>God himself</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. By the name of God is meant his glorious <i>
    attributes</i>, which are, as it were, the several letters of his name.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. By the name of God is meant his worship and 
    ordinances, where his name is called upon. "Go to the place at Shiloh where 
    I once put the Tabernacle to honor my name" (Jer. 7:12). That is, where I 
    first set up my public worship.</p>
<p align="justify">Now this name of God, the saints in the text did 
    contemplate, they thought upon his name. Thoughts are the first-born of the 
    soul, the conceptions of the mind, the immediate fruit and outcome of a 
    rational being. "Thoughts are the representations of things in the 
    imagination." These devout souls in the text were chiefly busying their 
    thoughts about God and heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">It is the inseparable sign of a godly man, to employ his 
    chief thoughts about God: "The thoughts of the righteous are right" 
    (Proverbs 12:5); that is, they are set upon the right object. It is natural 
    to think. Thoughts fly out of the mind—as sparks fly out of a furnace. The 
    Hebrew word for a <i>thought </i>signifies the <i>boughs of a tree</i>, 
    because thoughts shoot out from our minds as branches do from a tree. It is, 
    I say, natural to think—but it is not natural to think of God; this is 
    proper to a saint. His thoughts are sublime and seraphic—they fly to heaven.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The mind is a mint-house where thoughts are minted.</p></i> 
    David minted golden thoughts: "I am still with you" (Psalm 139:18), that is, 
    by divine contemplation. Thoughts are the <i>travelers </i>of the soul. 
    David's thoughts kept on heavens road: "I am continually with you" (Psalm 
    73:23). As the mariners needle turns to the North Pole, so a saint's 
    thoughts are still pointing towards God.
<p align="justify">Question. <font color="#0000ff"><b>Why is it, that the 
    saints thoughts mount up to God?</b></font></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. There will be this thinking on God—from those 
    intrinsic perfections which are in him.</p></b></font> <i>The loveliness of the 
    object, attracts the thoughts. </i>God is the Supreme good. There is nothing 
    but God, which is really worth thinking upon. "You are my portion, O Lord" 
    (Psalm 119:S7). Will not a man's thoughts run upon his portion? A gracious 
    soul has found <i>pleasure </i>in thinking on God (Psalm 63:5-6). He has had 
    those transfigurations on the mount, those <i>incomings </i>of the Spirit, 
    those <i>enterings </i>of God's love, those <i>foretastes </i>of glory—so 
    that he cannot keep his thoughts off from God! To hinder him from thinking 
    on God—is to bar him of all his pleasure.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2.</p></b></font> <font color="#008000"><b>There will 
    be thinking on God—from the powerful operations of the Holy Spirit.</b></font> 
    We cannot of ourselves think a godly thought (2 Cor. 3:5)—but the Spirit 
    elevates and fixes the heart on God: "The Spirit lifted me up" (Ezek. 3:14). 
    When you see the iron move <i>upward</i>—you know there has been some <i>
    magnet </i>drawing it. Just so, when the thoughts move upwards towards God, 
    the Spirit has, as a divine magnet, drawn them!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">First Use: REPROOF.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Out of the quiver of this text I may draw several <i>
    arrows of reproof:</i></p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. It reproves those who do not think upon God's name.</p></b></font> 
    It is the brand-mark of a reprobate: "God is not in all his thoughts" (Psalm 
    10:4). He endeavors to expunge and blot God out of his mind. Though he draws 
    his breath from God—yet he does not think of him. His thoughts all shoot 
    into the <i>earth </i>(Phil. 3:19). Had not sinners by their fall lost their 
    head-piece, they would reason thus with themselves: "Certainly God is best 
    worth thinking on. Is there any excellency in the world? Then what 
    excellency there is in God—who has made it! He gives the <i>star </i>its 
    beauty, the <i>flower </i>its fragrance, <i>food </i>its pleasantness! If 
    there is such deliciousness in the creature, what must there be in God! He 
    must needs be better than all. O my soul, shall I admire the <i>drop—</i>and 
    not the <i>ocean</i>? Shall I think of the <i>workmanship</i>, and not of <i>
    him </i>who made it?"
<p align="justify">This <i>forgetfulness of God</i>, is the fruit of 
    original sin—which has warped the soul, and taken it off from the right 
    object.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It reproves such as indeed think of God—but who do not 
    have RIGHT thoughts of him.</p></b></font> As the Lord said to Eliphaz, "You 
    have not spoken of me what is right" (Job 42:7); so some think of God—but 
    they do not think of him rightly.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. They have low <i>unworthy </i>thoughts of God</p></b></font>. 
    They imagine God to be like themselves (Psalm 50:21). Men think that God is 
    as short-sighted as they, and that he cannot see them through the thick 
    canopy of the clouds. (He who makes a watch knows all the wheels and pins in 
    it, and the spring which causes the motion.) God who is the inspector of the 
    heart (Acts 1:24; 15:8) sees all the intrigues and private plots in the 
    thoughts (Job 42:2; Amos 4:13). God knows the <i>true </i>motion of a <i>
    false </i>heart! "I <i>know</i>, and am a <i>witness</i>—says the Lord" 
    (Jer. 29:23).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Men have <i>injurious </i>thoughts of God.</p></b></font>

<p align="justify">First, they think that his ways are <b>unjust</b>. "Yet 
    you say—The way of the Lord is not just. Hear, O house of Israel—Is my way 
    unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust?" (Ezek. 18:25). Some call God's 
    providence to the bar of reason, and judge his proceedings to be unjust. But 
    God says, "I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the 
    plumb line" (Isaiah 28:17). His ways are <i>secret</i>—but never <i>unjust</i>. 
    God is most just in his way—when we think he is out of his way. </p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, they think that his ways are <b>unprofitable</b>. 
    "You have said—It is useless to serve God. What have we gained by keeping 
    His requirements?" (Mal. 3:14). We cannot show our earnings. These are not 
    right thoughts of God. Men think him to be a hard master; but God will be in 
    no man's debt, he gives double pay: "Neither do you kindle a fire on my 
    altar for nothing" (Mal. 1:10).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. It reproves such as, instead of thinking on God, have 
    their minds wholly taken up with VAIN thoughts. </p></b></font>Vain thoughts are 
    the <i>froth of the brain</i>. "How long shall your vain thoughts lodge 
    within you?" (Jer. 4:14). I do not deny that vain thoughts may sometimes <i>
    come </i>into the best hearts—but they have a care to turn them out before 
    night, that they do not <i>lodge</i> there. This denominates a wicked man. 
    His thoughts dwell upon vanity; and well may his thoughts be said to be 
    vain, because they do not turn to any profit! "Vanity, and things wherein 
    there is no profit" (Jer. 16:19). They are vain thoughts, which are about 
    foolish things, and run all into straw. They are vain thoughts which do not 
    better the heart, nor will give one drop of comfort at death, "In that very 
    day his thoughts perish" (Psalm 146:4). Vain thoughts are corrupt; they <i>
    taint </i>the heart and leave an evil tincture behind.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. It reproves such as have, not only vain thoughts, but 
    VILE thoughts.</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Firstly, <font color="#b07050"><b>proud </b></font>
    thoughts: while they view themselves in the mirror of self-love, they begin 
    to take up venerable thoughts of themselves, and so pride fumes up into 
    their head and makes them giddy! (Acts 5:36). </p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, <font color="#b07050"><b>impure </b></font>
    thoughts. They think how to gratify their lusts—they "make provision," or as 
    the word signifies, become "caterers" for the flesh (Romans 13:14).</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Sin begins in the thoughts.</p></b> First men <i>devise </i>
    sin—then they <i>act </i>it (Mic. 2:1-2). For instance, if one seeks <i>
    preferment</i>, he thinks to himself by what <i>ladder </i>he may climb to 
    honor. He will cringe and comply, and lay aside conscience, because he 
    thinks that this is the way to rise. If a man would grow <i>rich</i>, he 
    sets his thoughts to work how to obtain an estate. He will pull down his 
    soul—to build up an estate. Would he wreak his <i>malice </i>on another? He 
    frames a plan in his thoughts to harm him. As Jezebel (that painted harlot) 
    when she would ruin Naboth, presently feigns a sham-plot and subtly thinks 
    of a way how to dispatch him: "She commanded: Call the citizens together for 
    fasting and prayer and give Naboth a place of honor. Find two scoundrels who 
    will accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him 
    to death!" (1 Kings 21:9-10).
<p align="justify">Oh, the mischief of thoughts! A man may <i>deny God </i>
    in his thoughts: "The fool has said in his <i>heart—</i>there is no God" 
    (Psalm 14:1). He may commit <i>adultery </i>in his thoughts: "Whoever looks 
    on a woman to <i>lust </i>after her, has committed adultery with her in his 
    heart" (Matt. 5:28). A man may <i>murder </i>another in his thoughts: 
    "Whoever <i>hates </i>his brother is a murderer" (1 John 3:15 ). O how much
    <i>contemplative wickedness </i>is in the world! Tremble at sinful thoughts. 
    We startle at gross sin—but we are not troubled so much for sinful thoughts. 
    Know firstly, that sin may be committed in the thoughts, though it never 
    blossoms into outward act: "The <i>thought </i>of foolishness is sin!" 
    (Prov. 24:9). See this illustrated in two things:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Envy</p></b>—the Jews envied Christ, for the fame of his 
    miracles: "Pilate knew that for envy they had delivered him" (Matt. 27:18). 
    Here was sin committed in the <i>thoughts</i>. The Jews sinned by envying 
    Christ, though they had never crucified him. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Discontentment</p></b>--"The Lord accepted Abel and his 
    offering, but he did not accept Cain and his offering. This made Cain very
    <i>angry </i>and <i>dejected</i>." (Gen. 4:4-5). He maligned his brother, 
    and his thoughts boiled up to discontentment. Here was sin committed in the 
    thoughts. Cain sinned in being discontented, even if he had never murdered 
    his brother.
<i>
<p align="justify">Know that God will <b>punish </b>sinful thoughts.</p></i> We 
    say thoughts are free—and so they are in <i>man's </i>court; but <i>God </i>
    will punish for thoughts! It was set upon Herod's score, that he thought to 
    destroy Christ under a pretense of worshiping him (Matt. 2:8).
<b>
<p align="justify">Let us be humbled for the sins of our thoughts.</p></b><i>
</i>"If you have thought evil, lay your hand upon your mouth" (Proverbs 
    30:32); that is, humble and abase yourself before the Lord. The holiest 
    people alive, need to be humbled for their thoughts:
<p align="justify">First, for the <b>instability </b>of their thoughts. How 
    do your thoughts dance up and down in prayer. It is hard to tie two godly 
    thoughts together. </p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, for the <b>impiety </b>of their thoughts. In 
    the fairest fruit, may be a worm—and in the best heart, evil thoughts may 
    arise. Did men's hearts stand where their faces do, they would blush to look 
    one upon another! Let us be deeply humbled for our thoughts. Let us look up 
    to Christ, that he would stand between us and God justice, and that he would 
    intercede for us, that the thoughts of our hearts may be forgiven.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Second use: EXHORTATION. </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Let us think on God's Name; let us lock up ourselves with 
    God every day; let our thoughts get wings and, with the birds of paradise, 
    fly up towards heaven. Christians, look upon that day to be lost, in which 
    you have not conversed with God in your thoughts; think of God in your 
    closet, in your shop; trade above the moon. "Isaac went out to meditate in 
    the field" (Gen. 24:63). He <i>walked in heaven </i>by holy utterances. Our 
    minds should be <i>steeped </i>in holy thoughts.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not enough to have a few transient thoughts of 
    God—but there must be a <i>fixing </i>of our minds on God, until our hearts 
    are warmed in love to him, and we can say, like those in Luke 24:32, "Did 
    not our heart burn within us!"</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">But what should the matter of our holy meditations be?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Think of God's immense being. </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Adore his illustrious <i>ATTRIBUTES</i>, which are the 
    beams by which the divine nature shines forth. Think of God's <b>omniscience</b>. 
    He particularly and critically assesses all our actions, and notes them down 
    in his book. Think of God's <b>holiness</b>, which is the most sparkling 
    jewel of his crown (Exod. 15:11). Think of God's <b>mercy</b>: this makes 
    all his other attributes sweet. Holiness without mercy, and justice without 
    mercy, would be dreadful. Think of God's <b>veracity</b>: "Abundant in 
    truth" (Exod. 34:6); that is, God will be so far from coming short of his 
    word, that he does more than he has said. He shoots <i>beyond </i>the 
    promise, never <i>short </i>of it.</p>
<p align="justify">Think of the <i>WORKS </i>of God: "I will meditate also 
    on all your works" (Psalm 77:12). God's works are bound up in three great 
    volumes: <i>Creation, Providence, Redemption</i>. Here is sweet matter for 
    our thoughts to expatiate upon.</p>
<p align="justify">To enforce the exhortation, let me propose some <b>
    arguments </b>and <b>inducements </b>to be frequent in the thoughts of God.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The reason why God has given us a thinking faculty, is 
    that we may think on his Name.</p></b></font> When our thoughts run out in vain 
    things, we should think with ourselves thus: Did God give us this talent to 
    misemploy? Did he give us thoughts that we should think of everything but 
    him?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It we do not accustom ourselves to godly thoughts, we 
    cannot be godly Christians.</p></b></font> Thinking seriously on heavenly 
    things—makes them <i>stick </i>in our minds, causes <i>delight </i>in them, 
    and makes them <i>nourish </i>us. Musing on holy objects, is like <i>
    digesting </i>food, which turns it into nourishment. Without holy thoughts, 
    there is no true religion. Can a man be pious and scarcely ever think of it?
    
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3.</p></b> <b>We are deeply obliged to think on God.</b>
</font>For, First,<b> God is our Maker</b>. "It is he who has made us, and 
    not we ourselves" (Psalm 100:3). Our bodies are God's fine needlework (Psalm 
    139:15). And as God has wrought the cabinet, so he has put a jewel in it—the 
    precious soul. Has God made us—and shall not we think of him? 
<p align="justify">Secondly, <b>God has sweetened our lives with various 
    mercies</b>. A city in Sicily is so finely situated, that the sun was never 
    out of sight. Just so, God has so placed us by his providence, that the 
    sunshine of his mercy is never out of sight. We are miraculously attended 
    with his mercy! His mercy feeds us with the finest of the wheat—the bread of 
    life; mercy guards us with a guard of angels; it makes the rock pour forth 
    rivers of oil. Shall not the <i>stream </i>lead us to the <i>fountain</i>? 
    Shall not we think of the <i>God </i>of our mercies? This is high 
    ingratitude.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. To have frequent and devout thoughts of God—evidences 
    SINCERITY</p></b></font>. No truer touchstone of sanctity exists, than the 
    spirituality of the thoughts. What a man's thoughts are—that is the man! 
    "For as he thinks in his heart—so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). <i>Thoughts </i>
    are freer from hypocrisy, than <i>words</i>. One may <i>speak </i>well for 
    applause, or to stand right in the opinion of others; but when we are alone 
    and think of God's Name, and admire his excellencies, this shows the heart 
    to be right. <i>Thoughts </i>are freer from hypocrisy, than a man's<i> 
    external behavior</i>. A man may be lovely in his outward behavior—yet have 
    a covetous, revengeful mind! The acts of sin may be concealed, when the 
    heart sits brooding upon sin. But to have the thoughts spiritualized and set 
    upon God is a truer sign of sincerity—than a life free from vice. 
<p align="justify">What do your thoughts run upon? Where do they make their 
    most frequent visits? Can you say, "Lord, our hearts are still mounting up 
    to heaven, our thoughts are lodged in paradise; though we do not see your 
    face—yet we <i>think </i>on your Name!" This is a good evidence of 
    sincerity. <i>We </i>judge men by their actions; <i>God </i>judges them by 
    their thoughts!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. Thinking much on God—would cure the love of the WORLD.
    </p></b></font>Great things seem little—to him who stands high. To such as stand 
    upon the top of the Alps, the great cities of Italy seem like little 
    villages. For those who are mounted high in the contemplation of Christ and 
    glory—how do the things of the world disappear, and even shrink into 
    nothing! A soul elevated by faith above the visible planets, has the <i>
    earth </i>under his feet. A true saint intermeddles with secular affairs, 
    more out of <i>necessity </i>than <i>choice</i>. Paul's thoughts are 
    heavenly and sublime—he lived in the altitudes—and how he scorned the world! 
    "The world is crucified unto me!" (Gal. 6:14).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. Thinking on God—would be expulsive of SIN.</p></b></font> 
    From whence is impiety—but from thoughtlessness? If only men carefully 
    considered God's holiness and justice—would they dare sin at the rate they 
    do! That which kept Joseph in check, was the thought of a sin-revenging God. 
    When the delights of sin tickle us—let the thoughts of God come into men's 
    minds, that he is both <i>Spectator </i>and <i>Judge</i>—and that after the 
    golden crowns and women's hair—comes the lions teeth! (Rev. 9:8). This would 
    put them into a cold sweat—and be as the angel's drawn sword! (Num. 22:31). 
    It would scare them from sin!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">7. Thinking on God, is an admirable means to increase our 
    LOVE to God. </p></b></font>As it was with David's meditations, "As I was musing 
    the fire burned" (Psalm 39:3); so it is with our musing on the Deity. While 
    we are thinking on God—our hearts will kindle in love to him.
<p align="justify">The reason our affections are so chilled and cold in 
    religion—is that we do not warm them with thoughts of God. Hold a magnifying 
    glass to the sun, and the glass burns that which is near to it. So when our 
    thoughts are lifted up to Christ, the Sun of righteousness, our affections 
    are set on fire. No sooner had the spouse been thinking upon her Savior's 
    beauty—but she fell into love-sickness. (Song of Sol. 5:8). O saints, do but 
    let your thoughts dwell upon the love of Christ, who passed by <i>angels </i>
    and thought of <i>you</i>; who was wounded that, out of his wounds, the balm 
    of Gilead might come to heal <i>you</i>; who leaped into the sea of his 
    Father's wrath, to save <i>you </i>from drowning in the lake of fire! Think 
    of this unparalleled love, which sets the angels wondering—and see if it 
    will not affect your hearts and cause tears to flow forth!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">8. Thinking on God, will by degrees <i>transform</i> us 
    into his image.</p></b></font> As Jacob's flock looking on the rods which had 
    white streaks conceived and brought forth like them (Gen. 30:39), so by 
    contemplating God's holiness, we are in some measure changed into his 
    likeness! "Beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord—we are changed 
    into the same image" (2 Cor. 3:18). The contemplative sight of God was 
    transforming; they had some print of God's holiness upon them; as Moses when 
    he had been on the mount with God, his face shone! (Exod. 34:35). What is <i>
    godliness</i>, but <i>God-likeness</i>? And who are so like him—as those 
    that think on his name?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">9. Thinking on God is <i>sweet</i>.</p></b></font> It ushers 
    in a secret delight to the soul! "My meditation of him shall be sweet" 
    (Psalm 104:34). He whose head gets above the clouds—has his thoughts lifted 
    high, has God in his eye, is full of divine raptures, and cries out as Peter 
    in the transfiguration, "Lord, it is good for us to be here!" Holy thoughts 
    are the <i>dove </i>we send out of the <i>ark </i>of our souls—and they 
    return with an olive branch of peace. Some complain that they have no <i>joy
    </i>in their lives. It is no wonder, when they are such strangers to 
    heavenly contemplation! Would you have God give you joy and comfort—and 
    never think of him? Indeed Israel had manna dropped into their tents, and 
    they never thought of it; but God will not drop down this manna of heavenly 
    joy on that soul which seldom or never thinks of him.
<p align="justify">Would you have your spirits cheerful? Let your thoughts 
    be heavenly! The <i>higher </i>the lark flies—the <i>sweeter </i>it sings. 
    Just so, the higher a soul ascends in the thoughts of God—the sweeter joy it 
    has!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">10. Thoughts of God will turn to the best account.</p></b></font> 
    Thoughts spent on the <i>world </i>are often in <i>vain</i>. Some spend 
    thoughts about laying up a portion for a child; and perhaps either it dies, 
    or lives to be a severe trial to them. Others beat their brains how to rise 
    in politics—when royal favor has shone upon them, all of a sudden an eclipse

    he rocks us asleep every night: "So he gives his beloved sleep" (Psalm 
    127:2). And if we awaken, he gives "songs in the night" (Job 35:10). If God

    forget a friend—who is ever mindful of us? "I know the thoughts that I think

    asks princes and emperors, "How have you employed your thoughts?" They will

    remembered that God was their rock, and the most high God their Redeemer: 
    nevertheless they only flattered him with their mouth" (Psalm 78:34-36).

<font color="#b07050"><b>

    sinner: "What! Are you so wicked as never to think of God, who indulges you 
    with so many favors!" Hereupon, he may have a few good thoughts; but they 
    are irksome to him—this is not from a principle of conscience—but to quiet 
    conscience. 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, a man may think of God with horror!</p></b></font>

    Horeb out of the fire" (Deut. 4:15). Conceive of God <i>in Christ</i>. We 
    cannot see him any other way, as we cannot see the sun in the circle—but in 
    the beams. The Godhead dwells in Christ's human nature (Col. 2:9). Think of 
    God as a Spirit full of immense glory, propitious to us through a Mediator.

<p align="justify">Thirdly, our thoughts of God must be

<p align="justify">1. Begin the day with holy thoughts. </p></b></font>"When I 
    awake, I am still with you" (Psalm 139:18). God should have the first 
    buddings of our thoughts. In the law, the Lord would have the <i>first </i>
    fruits offered him. Give God your <i>virgin </i>thoughts in the morning. 
    What the vessel is first seasoned with, it keeps the relish of, a long time

    her jewelry?" (Jer. 2:32). When she has not her jewel on her <i>ear</i>—she 
    will have it in her <i>thoughts</i>. A person deeply in love, cannot keep 
    his thoughts off from the object he loves. <i>The reason we think on God no 
    more—is because we love him no more! </i>Let there be but one spark of love 
    to God—and it will fly upward in heavenly thoughts and prayers. By nature 
    our hearts cannot be made to fix on God—but by love.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. If you would think often on God, get a saving interest

    most—upon that which is our own. If a man rides by beautiful houses and 
    gardens, he casts his eyes slightly upon them. But let him have a house of 
    his own—and his thoughts dwell in it. Why do men think no more of God—but 
    because they and God are strangers? Let a man's interest in God be 
    cleared—and he will not be able to keep his thoughts off from God.

<p align="justify">"Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other,

    presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored his name. "They 
    will be mine," says the Lord Almighty, "in the day when I make up my jewels. 
    I will spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves 
    him. And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the 
    wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not." Malachi 3:16-18

<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">A. The first of the good effects of the saints piety—is

    blessed ones in the text were <i>speaking </i>and <i>thinking </i>of God—and 
    he did not turn away his ear from them, as if he had not minded them. But he 
    hearkened and heard; which expression denotes both <i>diligence </i>and <i>
    delight</i>.
<p align="justify">1. It notes the <b>diligent heed </b>God gave to these 
    saints—he "hearkened". Here was attention of <i>ear</i>, and intentness of
    <i>mind</i>. Hearkening is the gesture of one who intently listens to what 
    another says.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God's hearkening shows the <b>delight </b>he took in 
    the holy dialogues of these saints. He was pleased with them; they were to 
    him as a sweet melody.</p>
<p align="justify">God takes special notice of the good which he sees in his 
    people. The children of God may perhaps think that God does not regard them: 
    "I cry unto you—and you do not hear me" (Job 30:20). The church complains 
    that God shuts out her prayer (Lam. 3:8)—but though God is some times <i>
    silent</i>—he is not <i>deaf!</i> He takes notice of all the good services 
    of his people: "The Lord hearkened and heard."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Why is it that God takes such notice of his people's 
    services?</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">First, not from any merit in them—but the impulsive cause 
    is his <b>free grace! </b></p></i>The best duties of the righteous, could not 
    endure God's scales of justice—but God will display the trophies of his 
    mercy. <i>Free grace accepts—what stern justice would condemn!
<p align="justify">Secondly, God's taking notice of the good in his people, 
    is through <b>Christ!</b></p></i><b> </b>"He has made us accepted—<i>in the 
    beloved</i>" (Eph. 1:6). Or, as Chrysostom renders it, he has made us 
    "favorites". Through a <i>red </i>glass everything appears of a red color. 
    Just so, through Christ's blood, both our persons and duties appear ruddy 
    and beautiful in God's eyes!
<i>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, God takes notice of the services of his

    the voice of faith: "O my dove ... let me hear your voice; for sweet is your 
    voice" (Song of Sol. 2:14). The services of the <i>wicked </i>are harsh and 
    sour—but the <i>godly </i>give God the first-ripe cluster (Mic. 7:1), which 
    grows from the sweet and pleasant root of grace.

    essence he has a full knowlege of all things. He knows the intrigues of

    contingencies fall within his cognizance. 
<p align="justify">God's knowledge is <b>foundational</b>. He is the 
    original, pattern, and prototype of all knowledge. God's knowledge is <b>
    instantaneous</b>. He knows all at once! Our knowledge is successive, we 
    know one thing after another, and argue from the effect to the cause; but 
    all things are in God's view—in one entire prospect. God's knowledge is <b>
    infallible </b>and not subject to mistake. Such is the infinity of his 
    knowledge, that the apostle cries out in admiration, "O the depth of the 
    riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" (Romans 11:33). The world 
    is to God as a <i>beehive of glass</i>, where you see the working of the

    did not accept Cain and his offering" (Gen. 4:5). Suppose a man had a sweet 
    breath—yet if he had the plague, nobody would come near him! Just so, though 
    a sinner may give God many a sweet, elegant expression in prayer—yet, having 
    the plague in his heart, God will not receive any offering from him! If God

    bitter, and can hardly be eaten; yet such was Christ's love to his spouse,
