<p align="justify">Christian Reader,<br/>
    "Of making many <i>books </i>there is no end, and much study wearies the 
    body." Ecclesiastes 12:12.<i> Books </i>are the "children of the brain". In 
    this writing age, when they are brought forth ad nauseam, I intended that my 
    pen should have been silent—but the variety and weightiness of this subject, 
    as also the desire of some friends, did prevail with me to publish it. The 
    main design of this excellent Scripture, is to encourage solid piety, and 
    confute the atheists of the world, who imagine there is no gain in 
    godliness. It was the speech of King Saul to his servants, "Will the son of 
    Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards?" (1 Samuel 22:7). Will the 
    world or men's lusts give them such noble recompenses of reward—as God 
    bestows upon his followers! Surely, it is holiness which carries away the 
    garland!</p>
<p align="justify">As for this treatise, it comes abroad in a plain dress: 
    truth like a diamond—shines brightest in its native luster! Paul did not 
    come to the Corinthians with excellency of speech, or the pride of 
    oratory—his study was not to <i>court</i>—but <i>convert</i>. It is an 
    unhappiness that, in these luxuriant times, religion should for the most 
    part run either into <i>notion </i>or <i>ceremony</i>; the spirits of true 
    religion are evaporated. When <i>knowledge </i>is turned into <i>soul food</i>, 
    and digested into <i>practice</i>—then it is saving. That God would 
    accompany these few imperfect lines with the operation and benediction of 
    his Holy Spirit, and make them edifying—is the prayer of him who is</p>
<p align="justify">Yours in all Christian service, </p>
<p align="justify">Thomas Watson, London, November 22, 1681</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, 
    and the Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in His 
    presence concerning those who feared the Lord and thought upon His name. 
    "They will be mine," says the Lord Almighty, "in the day when I make up My 
    jewels! I will spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who 
    serves him. And you will again see the distinction between the righteous and 
    the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not." </p></i>Malachi 
    3:16-18
<p align="justify">The "scripture of truth" is the ground of faith. This 
    portion of Scripture which now presents itself to our view, has its sacred 
    elegancies, and is all glorious within. It was composed by Malachi, whose 
    name means "messenger". He came as an ambassador from the God of heaven. 
    This prophet was so famous that Origen and others injudiciously supposed him 
    to be an angel. He lived after the building of the second temple, and was 
    contemporary with Haggai and Zechariah.</p>
<p align="justify">This blessed prophet lifted up his voice like a trumpet, 
    and told the Jewish nation of their sins. He was the last trumpet that 
    sounded in the Old Testament. In the words of the text are these parts:</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Part I. The character of the Godly</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">1. In <i>general</i>, they were fearers of God: "those 
    who feared the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">2. In <i>particular</i>—</p>
<p align="justify">a. They <i>spoke </i>often one to another. </p>
<p align="justify">b. They <i>thought </i>upon God's Name.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Part II. The Great Gain of their Godliness</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">1. The Lord <i>regarded </i>it—"the Lord listened and 
    heard."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Lord <i>recorded </i>it—"a book of remembrance was 
    written. </p>
<p align="justify">3. The Lord <i>rewarded </i>it. This reward consisted in 
    three things:</p>
<p align="justify">a. God's <i>owning </i>them: "They will be mine."</p>
<p align="justify">b. God's <i>honoring </i>them: "In the day when I make up 
    my jewels."</p>
<p align="justify">c. God's <i>sparing </i>them: "I will spare them."</p>
<p align="justify">Before I come to the several parts distinctly, note the 
    connective word standing at the beginning of the text which may not be 
    omitted, namely, the word THEN. "<i>Then </i>those who feared the Lord 
    talked with each other . . ." <i>Then</i>, that is, after Israel's return 
    from the Babylonian captivity; then, when the major part of the people grew 
    corrupt, and came out of the furnace worse than they went in! In this bad 
    juncture of time, then those who feared the Lord spoke often one to another.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Hence observe—that <b>the profaneness of the times should 
    not slacken our zeal—but heighten it. </b>The looser <i>others </i>are—the 
    stricter <i>we </i>should be. In those degenerate times when men were 
    arrived at the peak and height of impudence, and dared to speak treason 
    against heaven—then those who feared the Lord spoke often one to another. 
    When others were plaintiffs—these were defendants; when others spoke <i>
    against </i>God—these spoke <i>for </i>God.</p>
<p align="justify">In <i>Noah's </i>days all flesh had corrupted itself (the 
    old world was drowned in <i>sin—</i>before it was drowned in <i>water</i>). 
    Now at <i>this </i>time, Noah was perfect in his generation, and Noah walked 
    with God (Gen. 6:9). He was the phoenix of his age. Athanasius stood up in 
    the defense of the truth when the world had turned Arian. The more <i>
    outrageous </i>others are in sin—the more <i>courageous </i>we should be for 
    truth! When the atheists said, "It is vain to serve God," then those who 
    feared the Lord spoke often one to another.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Why should we be holiest in evil times?</p>
</b></font><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Because of the divine injunction.</p></b></font> God 
    charges us to be <i>singular </i>(Matt. 5:47), to be <i>circumspect </i>
    (Eph. 5:15), to be <i>separate </i>from idolaters (2 Cor. 6:17), to shine as 
    lights in the dark world (Phil. 2:15). He forbids us to <i>join </i>together 
    with sinners, or <i>do </i>as they do. The way to hell is a well-trodden 
    road, and the Lord calls to us to turn out of the road: "You shall not 
    follow a multitude to do evil" (Exod. 23:2). This is sufficient reason to 
    keep ourselves pure in a time of common infection. As God's <i>Word </i>is 
    our <i>rule</i>—so his <i>will </i>is our <i>warrant</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. To be holiest in evil times, is an indication of the 
    truth of grace.</p></b></font> To profess religion when the times favor it, is 
    no great matter. Almost all will court the <i>Gospel Queen </i>when she is 
    hung with <i>jewels</i>. But to own the ways of God when they are <i>decried
    </i>and maligned, to love a <i>persecuted </i>truth—this evidences a vital 
    principle of goodness<i>. Dead fish swim down the stream—living fish swim 
    against it. </i>To swim against the common stream of evil, shows grace to be 
    alive. The prophet Elijah continuing zealous for the Lord Almighty, when 
    they had dug down God's altars—showed his heart and lips had been touched 
    with a coal from the altar.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1.</p></b></font> See hence how unworthy they are of the 
    name of Christians, who use sinful compliance, and cut the <i>garment of 
    their religion </i>according to the <i>mode </i>and <i>fashion </i>of the 
    times. They do not consult what is best—but what is safest. Complying 
    spirits can truckle to the desires of others; they can bow either to the 
    East or to the West; they prefer a <i>whole skin </i>before a pure 
    conscience. They can, with the planet Mercury, vary their motion; they can, 
    as the mariner, shift their sail with every wind and, as the mongrel 
    Israelites, speak the language of both <i>Canaan </i>and <i>Ashdod</i>. 
    These are like the <i>Samaritans </i>of whom Josephus says, when the Jews 
    flourished they pretended to he akin to them—but when the Jews were 
    persecuted, they disclaimed kindred with them. The old serpent has taught 
    men <i>crooked windings</i>, and to be for that religion which does not have 
    truth on its side—but worldly power.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2.</p></b></font> Let us keep up the vigor of our zeal, 
    in degenerate times. We should by a holy contrariness—burn <i>hotter </i>in 
    a <i>frozen </i>age. We live in the <i>dregs </i>of time; sin is grown 
    common and impudent. It is excellent to walk <i>contrary </i>to the world, 
    "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world!" (Romans 12:2). Let 
    us be as <i>lilies </i>and <i>roses </i>among the briars.<i> Sin is never 
    the better, because it is in fashion! </i>Nor will this plea hold at the 
    last day—that we did as the most did. God will say, Seeing you sinned with 
    the multitude—you shall go to hell with the multitude! Oh, let us keep pure 
    among the dregs; let us be like fish that retain their freshness in salt 
    waters; and as that lamp which shone in the smoking furnace (Gen. 15:17).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Consider—To be holy in times of general defection, is 
    that with which God is greatly pleased.</p></b></font> The Lord was much 
    delighted with the holy conferences and dialogues of these saints in the 
    text. When others were inveighing against God, that there should be a 
    remnant of holy souls speaking of glory and the life to come—their words 
    were <i>music in God's ears!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Consider—To keep up a spirit in holiness in an 
    adulterous generation is a Christian's honor.</p></b></font> This was the glory 
    of the church of Pergamum, that she held fast Christ's name—even where 
    Satan's seat was (Rev. 2:13). <i>The impiety of the times, is a foil to set 
    off grace all the more, and give it a greater luster. </i>Then a Christian 
    is most lovely, when he is (as Ambrose says) like the cypress, which keeps 
    its verdure and freshness in the <i>winter </i>season. "Mark the perfect 
    man, and behold the upright" (Psalm 37:37). An upright man is always worth 
    beholding—but then he is most to be admired when like a bright star, he 
    shines in the dark, and having lost all, he holds fast his integrity.
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">3. Consider—To be godly in a profligate age does much to 
    animate weak beginners</p></font>; it strengthens feeble </b>knees<b> </b>
    (Isaiah 35:3) and shores up those temples of the Holy Spirit which are ready 
    to fall. One man's zeal is a burning torch for others to catch fire at. How 
    did the constancy of the martyrs inflame the love of many to the truth! 
    Though only Christ's blood <i>saves</i>—yet the blood of martyrs may <i>
    strengthen</i>. Paul's prison chain made converts in Nero's court, two of 
    whom were afterwards martyrs, as history relates. Mr. Bradford's holy advice 
    and example, so confirmed Bishop Ferrar, that he would not touch the Roman 
    pollution.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Consider—How sad will it be for professors to fall off 
    from their former profession, and espouse a novel religion. </p></b></font>
    Julian bathed himself in the blood of beasts offered in sacrifice to the 
    heathen gods, and so as much as lay in him washed off his former baptism. In 
    the time of Julius Caesar this astonishing thing happened: after a plentiful 
    vintage, wild grapes appeared upon their vines, which was looked upon as an 
    ominous sign. When men seemed to bring forth the fruits of righteousness, 
    and afterwards bring forth the <i>wild grapes </i>of impiety—it is a sad 
    omen and prognostic of their ruin! "For it had been better for them not to 
    have known the way of righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn 
    from the holy commandment (2 Pet. 2:21). Let all this make us maintain the
    <i>power of holiness </i>in the <i>worst </i>times. Though others wonder we 
    do not sin after the rate that they do—yet remember, <i>it is better to go 
    to heaven with a few than to hell in the crowd. </i>"Enter through the 
    narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to 
    destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the 
    road that leads to life, and only a few find it." Matthew 7:13-14.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Question: How may we keep up the briskness and fervor of 
    grace, in times of apostasy?</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 1. Let us beware of having our hearts too much 
    linked to the world. </p></b></font>The world damps zeal—as earth chokes the 
    fire. We are bid to love our enemies; but the world is such an enemy as we 
    must not love, "Do not love the world or anything in the world." (1 John 
    2:15). The world <i>bewitches </i>with her blandishments, and <i>kills </i>
    with her silver darts! He who is a <i>Demas</i>—will be a <i>Judas!</i> A 
    lover of the world will, for a piece of money, betray a holy cause, and make 
    shipwreck of a good conscience.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. Let us be <i>volunteers </i>in piety;</p></b></font> 
    that is, choose God's service; "I have chosen the way of truth" (Psalm 
    119:30). It is one thing to be good, with a holy end in view. Hypocrites are 
    good only out of worldly design. They embrace the gospel for secular 
    advantage, and these will in time, fall away. It is fabled that the <i>
    Chelidonian stone </i>keeps its virtue no longer than it is enclosed in 
    gold; take it out of the gold, and it loses its virtue. False hearts are 
    good no longer than they are enclosed in golden prosperity; take them out of 
    the gold and they lose all their <i>seeming </i>goodness. But if we would 
    retain our sanctity in backsliding times we must serve God purely out of 
    choice. He who is godly out of choice, loves holiness for its beauty, and 
    adheres to the gospel, when all the <i>jewels of preferment </i>are pulled 
    off.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. Let us be inlaid with <i>sincerity</i>. </p></b>
</font>If a piece of timber begins to bend, it is because it is not sound. 
    Why do any bend and comply against their conscience—but because their hearts 
    are not sound. "Their hearts were insincere toward Him, and they were 
    unfaithful to His covenant." (Psalm 78:37). <i>Sincerity </i>causes <i>
    stability</i>. When the apostle exhorts to <i>stand fast </i>in the evil 
    day, among the rest of the Christian armor, he bids them put on the belt of 
    truth, "Stand firm then, with the <i>belt of truth </i>buckled around your 
    waist." (Eph. 6:14). The <i>belt of truth </i>is nothing else but <i>
    sincerity</i>.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 4. Let us get love to Christ.</p></b></font> Love is a
    <i>holy fuel</i>. It fires the affections, steels the courage, and carries a 
    Christian above the love of life, and the fear of death. Many waters cannot 
    quench love (Song of Solomon 8:7). Love made Christ suffer for us. If anyone 
    asks what Christ died of, it may be answered, "He died of love!" If we love 
    Christ—we will own him in the worst times, and be like that virgin of whom 
    Basil speaks who, not accepting deliverance upon sinful terms, cried out, 
    "Let life and money go! Welcome Christ!"
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 5. If we would keep up the sprightly vigor of 
    grace in evil times, let us harden our hearts against the taunts and 
    reproaches of the wicked. </p></b></font>David was the song of the drunkards 
    (Psalm 69:12). A Christian is never the worse for reproach. The <i>stars </i>
    are not the less glorious, though they have ugly names given them, the <i>
    Bear</i>, the <i>Dragon</i>, etc. Reproaches are but <i>splinters of the 
    cross</i>. How will he endure the <i>stake</i>—who cannot bear a <i>scoff?
    </i>Reproaches for Christ, are ensigns of honor, and badges of adoption (1 
    Peter 4:14). Let Christians bind these reproaches, as a <i>crown </i>about 
    their head. <i>Better have men reproach you for being godly—than have God 
    damn you for being wicked! </i>Be not laughed out of your religion. If a <i>
    lame </i>man laughs at you for walking upright—will you therefore limp?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 6. If we would keep up the vigor of devotion 
    during evil times, let us beg God for <i>confirming </i>grace.</p></b></font> <i>
    Habitual </i>grace may flag; Peter had habitual grace—yet was foiled; he 
    lost a single battle, though not the victory. We need exciting, assisting, 
    sustaining grace; not only grace <i>in </i>us—but grace <i>with </i>us (1 
    Cor. 15:10). Sustaining grace (which is a fresh gale of the Spirit) will 
    carry us undauntedly through the world's blustering storms. Thus shall we be 
    able to keep up our heroic zeal in corrupt times, and be as Mount Zion—which 
    cannot be moved.
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Part I. The character of the Godly</p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">Having done with the <i>frontispiece </i>of the text, I 
    begin, in the first place, with <i>the character in general of the godly</i>: 
    they are fearers of God, <i>"Those who <b>feared </b>the Lord"</i>. What 
    fear is meant here? Considered <font color="#0000ff"><b>negatively</b></font>:</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is not meant of a <font color="#008000"><b>natural
    </b></font>fear, which is a tremor or palpitation of heart, occasioned by 
    the approach of some imminent danger. "They are afraid of dangers on the 
    road" (Eccles. 12:5).</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is not meant of a <font color="#008000"><b>sinful
    </b></font>fear, which is twofold:</p>
<p align="justify">A <font color="#b07050"><b>superstitious </b></font>fear. 
    A black cat crossing the path, is by some more dreaded than a harlot lying 
    in the bed.</p>
<p align="justify">A <font color="#b07050"><b>carnal </b></font>fear. This 
    is the fever of the soul which sets it a shaking. He who is <i>timorous</i>, 
    will be <i>treacherous</i>; he will <i>decoy his friend</i>, and <i>deny his 
    God</i>. Three times in one chapter Christ cautions us against the fear of 
    men, (Matthew 10:26-31). Aristotle says that the reason why the chameleon 
    turns into so many colors, is through excessive fear. Fear makes men change 
    their religion as the chameleon does her colors!</p>
<p align="justify">A carnal fear is EXCRUCIATING, "fear has torment in it." 
    (1 John 4:18).The Greek word for torment is sometimes put for <i>hell </i>
    (Matt. 25:46). Fear has <i>hell </i>in it.</p>
<p align="justify">A carnal fear is PERNICIOUS. It indisposes for duty. The 
    disciples, under the power of fear, were fitter to flee than to pray, 
    (Matthew 26:56), and it puts men upon sinful means to save themselves: "The 
    fear of man brings a snare!" (Proverbs 29:25). What made Peter deny Christ, 
    and Origen sprinkle incense before the idol—but fear?</p>
<p align="justify">Considered <font color="#0000ff"><b>positively</b></font>, 
    the fear meant in the text is a <b>divine </b>fear, which is the reverencing 
    and adoring of God's holiness, and the setting of ourselves always under his 
    sacred inspection. The infinite distance between God and us causes this 
    fear.</p>
<p align="justify">When God's glory began to shine out upon the Mount, Moses 
    said, "I exceedingly fear and quake!" (Heb. 12:21). Such as approach God's 
    presence with light feathery hearts, and worship him in a crude, careless 
    manner—have none of this fear.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Those who feared the Lord"</p></i>. In the words are two 
    parts.
<p align="justify">1. The Act—fear.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Object—the Lord.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">"Those who <b>feared </b>the Lord"</p></i>. The fear of God 
    is the sum of all true true religion. "Now all has been heard; here is the 
    conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is 
    the whole duty of man. (Ecclesiastes 12:13 ). Fear is the <i>leading </i>
    grace, the first <i>seed </i>which God sows in the heart. When a Christian 
    can say little of <i>faith</i>, and perhaps nothing of <i>assurance</i>, yet 
    he dares not deny that he <i>fears </i>God (Neh. 1:11). God is so <i>great</i>—that 
    the Christian is afraid of <i>displeasing </i>him; and so <i>good</i>—that 
    he is afraid of <i>losing </i>him.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine: It is an indispensable duty incumbent on 
    Christians, to be fearers of God.</p></b></font> "Fear God!" (Eccles. 5:7). 
    "That you may fear the glorious and awesome name of the Lord your God!" 
    (Deut. 28:58). This fear of God, is the very foundation of a saint. One can 
    no more act as a <i>Christian </i>without the fear of God—than he can act as 
    a <i>man </i>without reason. This holy fear is the fixed temper and 
    complexion of the soul; this fear is not <i>servile—</i>but <i>filial</i>. 
    There is a difference between <i>fearing God</i>, and <i>being afraid of God</i>. 
    The godly fear God as a child does his <i>father</i>; the wicked are afraid 
    of God as the prisoner is of the <i>judge!</i> This divine fear will appear 
    admirable if you consider how it is <i>mixed </i>and <i>interwoven </i>with 
    several of the <i>graces</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The fear of God is mixed with LOVE</p></b></font> (Psalm 
    145:19, 20)
<p align="justify">The chaste spouse fears to displease her husband, because 
    she loves him. There is a necessity that fear and love should be in 
    conjunction. <i>Love </i>is as the sails to make swift the soul's motion; 
    and <i>fear is </i>as the ballast to keep it steady in true religion. Love 
    will be apt to grow wanton, unless it is counter-balanced with fear.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The fear of God is mixed with FAITH.</p></b></font> "By 
    faith Noah, moved with holy fear, prepared an ark" (Hebrews 11:7). When the 
    soul looks either to God's holiness, or its own sinfulness—it fears. But it 
    is a fear mixed with faith in Christ's merits; the soul <i>trembles</i>—yet
    <i>trusts</i>. Like a ship which lies at anchor, though it <i>shakes </i>
    with the wind, yet it is fixed at anchor. God in great wisdom couples these 
    two graces of <i>faith </i>and <i>fear</i>. <i>Fear </i>preserves 
    seriousness, <i>faith </i>preserves cheerfulness. Fear is as lead to the 
    net—to keep a Christian from floating in presumption; and faith is as cork 
    to the net—to keep him from sinking in despair.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The fear of God is mixed with PRUDENCE.</p></b></font> He 
    who fears God has the <i>serpent's eye </i>in the <i>dove's head</i>. He 
    foresees and avoids those rocks upon which others run. "A prudent man sees 
    danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it." 
    (Proverbs 22:3). Though divine fear does not make a person <i>cowardly</i>—it 
    makes him <i>cautious</i>.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fear of God is mixed with HOPE.</p></b></font> "The 
    eyes of the Lord are on those who <i>fear </i>him, on those whose <i>hope
    </i>is in his unfailing love" (Psalm 33:18). One would think that fear would 
    destroy hope—but it nourishes it. Fear is to hope, as the oil to the lamp—it 
    keeps it burning. The more we <i>fear </i>God's justice—the more we may <i>
    hope </i>in his mercy. Indeed, such as have no fear of God do sometimes 
    hope—but it is not "good hope through grace" (2 Thess. 5:26). Sinners 
    pretend to have the "helmet of hope" (1 Thess. 5:8)—but lack the 
    "breastplate of righteousness" (Eph. 6:14).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The fear of God is mixed with INDUSTRY.</p></b></font> 
    "Noah, moved with holy fear, prepared an ark" (Hebrews 11:7). There is a 
    carnal fear, which represents God as a severe Judge. This takes the soul off 
    from duty, "I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground" 
    (Matthew 25:25). 
<p align="justify">But there is also a fear of <i>diligence</i>. A Christian 
    fears—and <i>prays</i>; fears—and <i>repents</i>. Fear quickens industry. 
    The spouse, fearing lest the bridegroom should come before she is dressed, 
    hastens and puts on her jewels, that she may be ready to meet him. Fear 
    causes a <i>watchful eye</i>—and a <i>working hand</i>. Fear banishes <i>
    sloth </i>out of its diocese. "The greatest labor in true religion," says 
    holy fear, "is far less than the least pain the damned feel in hell." There 
    is no greater spur in the heavenly race—than the fear of God.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">The REASONS enforcing this holy fear of God</p></b></font>, 
    include the following:
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. God's eye is always upon us.</p></b></font> He who is 
    under the eye of his earthly prince, will he careful of doing anything which 
    would offend him. "Does He not see my ways and number all my steps?" (Job 
    31:4). God sees in the dark: "Even the darkness is not dark to You. The 
    night shines like the day; darkness and light are alike to You" (Psalm 
    139:12). The <i>night </i>is no curtain, the <i>clouds </i>are no canopy—to 
    hinder or intercept God's sight. God sees the heart. An earthly judge can 
    judge of the <i>fact</i>—but God judges of the <i>heart.</i> "I, the Lord, 
    examine the mind, I test the heart!" (Jeremiah 17:10). He is like Ezekiel's 
    wheels, "full of eyes." God is <i>all eye! </i>Should not this make us walk 
    with fear and circumspection? We cannot sin—but our judge looks on!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. God interprets our not fearing of Him—as a slighting 
    of Him.</p></b></font> As not to <i>praise </i>God is to wrong him—so not to <i>
    fear </i>God is to slight him. Of all things, a person can least endure to 
    he slighted: "Why has the wicked <i>despised </i>God?" (Psalm 10:13). For a 
    worm to slight its Maker causes the fury to rise up in God's face! "My fury 
    will flare up!" (Ezekiel 38:18).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. God has power to destroy us. </p></b></font>"Fear him who 
    is able to destroy both soul and body in hell!" (Matthew 10:28). God can <i>
    look </i>us into our grave—and with a breath blow us into hell—and shall we 
    not fear him! Is it easy to wrestle with flames? "Who knows the power of his 
    anger!" (Psalm 90:11). What engines or buckets can quench the infernal fire 
    of hell? We are apt to fear men who may try to hurt us—but what is their 
    power compared to God's power? They threaten a <i>prison</i>, God threatens
    <i>hell</i>. They threaten our <i>life</i>, God threatens our <i>soul</i>—and 
    shall we not tremble before him! Oh, how dreadful, when the great fountains 
    of God's wrath shall be broken up, and all his bitter vials poured out! "Can 
    your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the day that <i>I </i>
    shall deal with you!" (Ezekiel 22:14)
<p align="justify">Objection:<font color="#b07050"><b> But are not we bidden 
    to serve God without fear? </b></font>(Luke 1:74)</p>
<p align="justify">Answer. We must not fear God with such a fear, as the 
    wicked do. They fear him as a Turkish slave does his master; they fear him 
    in such a way as to <i>hate </i>him—and wish there were no God! We must not 
    serve God with this hellish fear—but we must serve him with a sincere filial 
    fear, sweetened with love.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Refutation. </p></b></font>This refutes the <i>Papists
    </i>who hold that a Christian cannot have assurance, because he is to serve 
    God with fear. Assurance and fear are <i>different</i>—but not <i>contrary</i>. 
    A child may have <i>assurance </i>of his father's love—yet a <i>fear </i>of 
    offending him. Who was more fearful of sin than Paul? (1 Cor. 9:27) Yet who 
    had more assurance? "Christ, who loved <i>me</i>, and gave himself for <i>me</i>" 
    (Gal. 2:20). Faith <i>procures </i>assurance (Eph. 1:13) fear <i>preserves
    </i>assurance.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Instruction. </p></b></font>It is a Christian duty to 
    fear God. What strangers, then, are they to true religion—who are <i>void
    </i>of this holy fear! The <i>godly </i>fear—and sin not. The <i>wicked </i>
    sin—and fear not. They are like the Leviathan, who is "made without fear" 
    (Job 41:33). Lack of the fear of God is the innate cause of all wickedness: 
    "Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed 
    blood" (Romans 3:14-15). Why was this? "There is no fear of God before their 
    eyes!" (verse 18). 
<p align="justify">Abraham surmised that the men of Gerar would stick at no 
    sin. Why so? "I thought, <i>Surely the fear of God is not in this place</i>" 
    (Gen. 20:11). The judge in the Gospel is called an <i>unjust </i>judge (Luke 
    18:6); and no wonder, for he "had no fear of God" (verse 2). There must be 
    an excess of sin, where there the fear of God is lacking to restrain it. The 
    water must overflow, where there are no banks to keep it out. We live in a 
    godless age; would men dare to sin at the rate they do—if the fear of God 
    were ruling in their hearts? Would they dare to swear, be immoral, use false 
    weights, bear false witness, hate purity, deride God, forge plots, persecute 
    Christ's body—if they had the fear of God before their eyes? These men 
    proclaim to the world that they are atheists; they do not believe in the 
    immortality of the soul. They are worse than brutish—a beast fears the 
    fire—but these fear not hell-fire! They are worse than devils, for the 
    devils "believe and tremble" (James 2:19).</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 3. Lamentation.</p></b></font> Let us bewail the lack of 
    the fear of God in our world. <font color="#008000"><b>Why is it that so few 
    fear God?
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Men do not fear God—because they have not the 
    knowledge of God. </p></b></font>"They hated knowledge, and did not choose the 
    fear of the Lord" (Proverbs 1:29). Every sin is founded in ignorance of God. 
    If only men knew God in his immense glory, they would be swallowed up with 
    divine amazement. When the prophet Isaiah had a glimpse of God's glory, he 
    was struck with holy consternation: "Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man 
    of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have 
    seen the King, the Lord Almighty!" (Isaiah 6:6). <i>Ignorance </i>of God, 
    banishes the <i>fear </i>of God.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Men do not fear God—because they presume on his mercy.</p></b></font> 
    God is merciful, and they do not doubt of the virtue of this sovereign balm. 
    But who is God's mercy for? "His mercy extends to those who fear him" (Luke 
    1:50). Such as do not fear God's <i>justice</i>—shall not taste his <i>mercy</i>.
<p align="justify">Let this be "for a lamentation", that the fear of God is 
    so vanished from our world. Why is it almost nowhere to be found? Some fear
    <i>shame</i>, others fear <i>danger—but </i>where is he who fears <i>God</i>?</p>
<p align="justify">And not only among the generality of people—but even 
    among professing Christians, how few fear God in truth! <i>Profession </i>is 
    often made a <i>cloak </i>to cover sin. <i>Absalom </i>palliated his treason 
    with a religious vow (2 Samuel 15:7). The <i>Pharisees </i>made <i>long 
    prayer </i>a cloak for oppression (Matt. 23:14). This is sordid—to carry on 
    wicked designs—under a mask of piety. The <i>snow </i>covers many a <i>
    dunghill</i>. A snowy white profession covers many a foul heart! The sins of 
    professors are more odious. Thistles are bad in a <i>field</i>—but worse in 
    a <i>garden</i>. The sins of the <i>wicked </i>anger God—but the sins of 
    professing Christians <i>grieve </i>him.</p>
<b><font color="#0000ff">
<p align="justify">Use 4. Reproof.</p>
</font><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">1. This reproves jovial sinners, who are so far from 
    fearing God, that they spend their time in mirth and wantonness!</p></font></b> 
    "People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to 
    the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all!" 
    (Luke 17:27). There is a place in Africa called Timbuktu, where the 
    inhabitants spend all the day in playing and dancing. What sensual, jovial 
    lives do the gallants of our age live! They spend their life in a frolic, as 
    if God had made them to be like the leviathan who plays in the sea. "They 
    sing with tambourine and harp. They make merry to the sound of the flute." 
    (Job 21:12). <i>They ride to hell upon the back of pleasure, and go merrily 
    to damnation!
</i>
<p align="justify">Does not God call us to trembling? Our sins presage evil. 
    May not we fear that "the glory is departing"? May not we fear the death of 
    true religion before the birth of reformation? May not we fear that some 
    momentous calamity should bring up the fear of former judgments? As the 
    prophet Ezekiel says, "Should we then make mirth?" (Ezekiel 21:10). But 
    jovial spirits have banished the fear of God. </p>
<p align="justify">"How terrible it will be for you who sprawl on ivory beds 
    surrounded with luxury, eating the meat of tender lambs and choice calves. 
    You sing idle songs to the sound of the harp!" (Amos 6:4,5). Sinners whose 
    hearts are <i>hardened with soft pleasures</i>, let them have their 
    lusts—but farewell Christ and his gospel. "They feast without fear" (Jude 
    12.). But they forget death will bring in the reckoning, and they must pay 
    the reckoning in hell-fire! The Turkish sultan, when he intends the death of 
    any of his minions, invites them to sumptuous feast, and then causes them to 
    he taken away from the table and strangled. Just so, Satan gluts men with 
    sinful pastimes and delights, and then strangles them! Foolish 
    pleasure-lovers are like the fish that swim pleasantly through the silver 
    streams of Jordan, until at last they fall into the <i>Dead Sea</i>. "Those 
    who want to be rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many foolish and 
    harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction!" (1 Tim. 
    6:9).</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. This reproves secure sinners who have no fear of God.
    </p></b></font>Like Laish of old, they are "a secure people" (Judges 18:27). 
    Those who are least safe—are most confident! Carnal security throws men into 
    a deep sleep. Birds which roost in steeples, being used to the continual 
    ringing of bells, the noise does not at all disturb them. So sinners who 
    have been long used to the sound of Aaron's bells, though now and then they 
    have a peal rung out against their sins yet, being used to it, they are not 
    startled at all. <b>A carnally secure sinner is known thus:
<font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">a. He lives as had as the worst, yet hopes to be saved as 
    well as the best.</p></font></b> "I am safe, even though I am walking in my own 
    stubborn way." (Deut. 29:19). This is as if a man should drink poison—yet 
    believe that he shall have his health. A secure sinner now lies in Delilah's 
    lap—yet hopes to some day lie in Abraham's bosom!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">b. A secure sinner thinks all is well, because all is in 
    peace. </p></b></font>He hears others speak of a "spirit of bondage", and the 
    terrors they have felt for sin—yet he thanks God that he never knew what 
    trouble of spirit meant; he thinks his conscience is <i>good</i>, because it 
    is <i>quiet</i>. When the devil keeps the palace—all is in peace" (Luke 
    11:12). <i>Ungrounded </i>peace presages an earthquake in the conscience.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">c. A secure sinner is careless about his soul.</p></b></font> 
    The soul is the princely part, which is crowned with reason. A secure sinner 
    provides for his <i>body</i>—but neglects his <i>soul</i>. He is like one 
    who waters his flowers—but never minds his jewels. Behold here a secure 
    person, who is in a spiritual lethargy; he has no sense of the life to come; 
    he is destitute of the fear of God.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. This reproves scoffers, who are the vilest of sinners.
    </p></b></font>"There shall come in the last days, scoffers" (2 Pet. 3:3). These 
    Ishmaels jeer at holy living—and ridicule all true religion. They throw 
    squibs of reproach at the saints. In the massacre at Paris, the Papists 
    scoffed at the Protestants when they murdered them, "Where is your God now? 
    What has become of all your prayers now?" These are devils in the likeness 
    of men! They are far from the fear of God! The scorner's chair stands at the 
    mouth of hell!
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 5. Exhortation. </p></b></font>It exhorts us to get the 
    fear of God planted in our hearts. "Happy is he who fears always" (Proverbs 
    28:14). The fear of God would influence all our <i>actions</i>. It would 
    make us <i>godly </i>in both tables of God's laws. It would make us holy 
    towards <i>God</i>—and righteous towards <i>men. </i>We would be true in our 
    promises—and just in our dealings (Matt. 7:12).
<b>
<p align="justify">That I may press you to this <i>holy fear</i>—let me show 
    you the DIGNITY and EXCELLENCY of fearing God:</p>
<font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">1. The fear of God is the true BADGE and uniform of a 
    saint.</p></font></b> The saints of old were God-fearing men (Gen. 22:12; Acts 
    10:22); Obadiah feared the Lord greatly (I Kings 8:13). All the moral 
    virtues in their highest elevation, do not make a saint. But here is the 
    Christian's true character—he is one who fears God. Augustine said of 
    himself, that he did knock at heaven-gate with a <i>trembling </i>hand. 
    Christ calls his elect, "his sheep" (John 10:27). Sheep are of a <i>
    trembling </i>nature. The saints are <i>tremulous</i>—they dare not take 
    liberties as others do.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The fear of God is the beginning of true WISDOM.</p></b></font> 
    (Proverbs 1:7). Wisdom is "more precious than rubies" (Prov. 3:15). No jewel 
    we wear so adorns us as <i>wisdom</i>. Now, the fear of Lord is our wisdom: 
    "The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom" (Job 28:28).
<b>
<p align="justify">Wherein is the fear of God the true wisdom?</p>
<font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">A. The fear of God is wisdom, in that it makes its 
    careful about our spiritual accounts.</p></font></b> Wisdom lies in nothing more 
    than in keeping accounts exactly. The fear of God teaches a person to 
    examine the state of his soul critically. "O my soul, how is it with you?" 
    Do you gain or lose? Is our faith in its infancy, being but newly laid to 
    the breast of the promise? Or is it grown to some stature? How is it? Does
    <i>grace </i>or <i>sin </i>prevail? Thus the fear of God makes us wisely 
    balance our accounts, and see how matters stand between God and our souls. 
    "I meditate in my heart, and my spirit made diligent search" (Psalm 77:6).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">B. The fear of God is wisdom as it makes its understand 
    divine secrets.</p></b></font> "The secret of the Lord is with those who fear 
    him" (Psalm 21:14). He must he wise, who is acquainted with the <i>secrets 
    of heaven</i>. A fearer of God is acquainted with the secret of <i>election
    </i>(1 Thess. 1:4), of <i>God's love </i>(Rev. 1:5), of the <i>holy 
    annointing </i>(1 John 2:20). He knows God's mind: "We have the mind of 
    Christ (1 Cor. 2;16). 
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">C. The fear of God is wisdom, in that it makes us <i>
    consider</i>.</p></b></font> "I <i>considered </i>my ways" (Psalm 119:59). A 
    great part of wisdom lies in <i>consideration</i>. He who fears God 
    considers how vain the <i>world </i>is—and therefore dares not love it. He 
    who fears God considers how short <i>time </i>is—and therefore dares not 
    lose it. He who fears God considers how precious <i>salvation </i>is—and 
    therefore dares not neglect it.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">D. The fear of God is wisdom, in that it makes its walk 
    wisely.</p></b></font> "Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the 
    time" (Col. 4:5).
<p align="justify">a. The fear of God makes us walk <i>amiably</i>: "Abraham 
    stood up and bowed himself to the children of Heth" (Gen. 2.3:7). <i>Piety
    </i>does not exclude <i>courtesy</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">b. The fear of God makes us walk <i>inoffensively</i>: it 
    prevents not only scandals but indecencies. The veneration of God, causes 
    circumcision of heart, and circumspection of life.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">E. The fear of God is wisdom, as it preserves us from 
    hell. </p></b></font>It is wisdom to keep out of danger; fear makes us flee from 
    the wrath to come.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The fear of God is the best certificate to show for 
    heaven.</p></b></font> Do you have <i>knowledge</i>? So has Satan. Do you have
    <i>profession</i>? So has Satan, he "transforms himself into an angel of 
    light" (2 Cor. 11:14). But do you have filial fear? In this you will excel 
    him. The fear of God is, though not our <i>plea </i>for heaven—yet our <i>
    evidence </i>for heaven.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. There is that in God, which may command fear:</p>
</b></font><font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. "He is clothed in awesome majesty!"</p></b></font> (Job 
    37:22).
<p align="justify">a. There is majesty in God's <i>Name</i>, Jehovah. It 
    comes from a Hebrew root which speaks of God's absolute, eternal, and 
    independent being.</p>
<p align="justify">b. There is majesty in God's <i>looks</i>. Job had but a 
    glimpse of God, and he was even swallowed up with divine amazement: "My ears 
    had heard of you—but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself 
    and repent in dust and ashes!" (Job 42:5-6).</p>
<p align="justify">c. There is majesty in God's <i>words</i>. He speaks with 
    majesty, as when he gave the law in thundering, insomuch that the people 
    said, "Let not God speak with us lest we die!" (Exodus 20:19).</p>
<p align="justify">d. There is majesty in God's <i>attributes</i>: his 
    holiness, power, justice, which are the irradiations of the divine essence.</p>
<p align="justify">e. There is majesty in God's <i>works</i>: "They will 
    speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty, and I will meditate on your 
    wonderful works. They will tell of the power of your awesome works, and I 
    will proclaim your great deeds" (Psalm 145:5). Every creature sets forth 
    God's majesty; we may see the majesty of God blazing in the sun, twinkling 
    in the stars. God's majesty is discernable in those two wonders of nature, 
    behemoth and leviathan (Job 40:18; 41:19). </p>
<p align="justify">In short, the majesty of God is seen in humbling the 
    children of pride. He turned King Nebuchadnezzar out to pasture, and made 
    him fellow-commoner with the beasts. Does not all this call for fear?</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. "He is clothed in awesome majesty!" </p></b></font>"He is 
    feared by the kings of the earth" (Psalm 76:12). There is a time coming when 
    God will be dreadful to his enemies; when conscience is awake, when death 
    strikes, when the last trumpet sounds. And shall we not fear this God? "Do 
    you not fear Me? Do you not tremble before Me?" (Jer. 5:22). <i>Fearing </i>
    God's justice—is the way not to <i>feel </i>it.
<p align="justify">And let it not seem strange to you, if I tell you, that 
    in respect of God's infinite majesty, there will be some of this blessed 
    fear in heaven. Not a fear which has torment in it, for perfect love will 
    cast out fear—but a <i>holy, sweet, reverential fear</i>. Though God has so 
    much beauty in him as shall cause love, and joy, in heaven—yet this <i>
    beauty </i>is mixed with so much <i>majesty</i>, as shall cause a <i>
    veneration </i>in glorified saints.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The fear of God tends to life</p></b></font> (Proverbs 
    19:23).
<p align="justify">1. This is true in a <b>temporal </b>sense, "The fear of 
    the Lord prolongs life, but the years of the wicked are cut short" (Proverbs 
    10:27); in the original it is, "adds days". Long life is promised as a 
    blessing, "With long life will I satisfy him" (Psalm 91:16). The best way to 
    come to "a good old age", is the fear of God. Sin curtails the life: many a 
    man's excess wastes his vital organs, enervates his strength, and cuts him 
    short of those years which by the course of nature might be arrived at, 
    "Don’t be excessively wicked, and don’t be foolish. Why should you die 
    before your time?" (Eccles. 7:17). You who desire to live long—live in the 
    fear of God! "The Lord commanded us to follow all these statutes and to fear 
    the Lord our God for our prosperity always and for our preservation." (Deut. 
    6:24).</p>
<p align="justify">2. This is true in a <b>spiritual </b>sense. "The fear of 
    the Lord tends to life"—namely, to "life eternal". Life is sweet, and <i>
    eternal </i>makes it sweeter. "Eternal life is true life" (Augustine). The 
    life of bliss has no term of years wherein it expires: "<i>Forever </i>
    ...with the Lord!" The lamp of glory <i>shines</i>—but is never <i>spent</i>; 
    so that divine fear tends to life; a life with God and angels forever.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6. The fear of God gives full satisfaction.</p></b></font> 
    "He who has it, shall abide satisfied" (Prov. 19:23). Such as are destitute 
    of God's fear, never meet with satisfaction. "In the midst of his plenty, 
    distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him" 
    (Job 20:22). This is a riddle, to be full—yet not have enough. The meaning 
    is there is still something lacking: he who fears not God, though his barns 
    are full—yet his mind is not at rest. The sweet waters of pleasure do rather
    <i>inflame </i>the thirst—than <i>satisfy </i>it. "I have run through all 
    the delights and grandeurs of the world, and could never find full 
    contentment", said the emperor Severus. But he who has the fear of the Lord 
    "shall abide satisfied".
<p align="justify">1. He shall <b>be </b>satisfied. His <i>soul </i>shall be 
    filled with grace, his <i>conscience </i>with peace. A holy man said, when 
    God had replenished him with inward joy, "It is enough Lord, your servant is 
    a full vessel, and can hold no more!"</p>

<p align="justify">7. The fear of God makes a little to be sweet.</p></b></font> 
    "Better is little with the fear of the Lord" (Prov. 15:16). Why is a little 
    better? Because that little a believer has, he holds in his Head, Christ. 
    That little is sweetened with the love of God. He has with that little a 
    contented mind; and contentment turns Daniel's <i>vegetables </i>into choice
    <i>meat </i>(Dan. 1:12). Again, that <i>little </i>is a pledge of <i>more</i>; 
    that little oil in the cruse—is but a pledge of that golden joy and bliss 
    which the soul shall have in heaven. Thus a little with the fear of God, is 
    better than all unsanctified riches. Lazarus' <i>crumbs </i>were better than 
    the rich man's banquet!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">8. The fear of God is a Christian's safety. </p></b></font>He 
    is invulnerable; nothing can hurt him. Plunder him of his money, he carries 
    a treasure about him of which he cannot be robbed (Isaiah 33:6). Cast him 
    into prison—his conscience is free; kill his body—it shall rise again. He 
    who has on this breastplate of God's fear may be shot <i>at</i>—but can 
    never be shot <i>through</i>.

<p align="justify">9. The fear of God makes all things go well with us.</p></b></font> 
    "How happy are those who fear the Lord—all who follow his ways! You will 
    enjoy the fruit of your labor. How happy you will be! How rich your life!" 
    (Psalm 128:1-2). Is it not well with that man who has all things working 
    together for his good—and has nothing lacking which may do him good (Psalm 
    84:11)? If God sees health and riches good for him—he shall have them. Every 
    providence shall center in his happiness. Oh, what an inducement is here to 
    solid piety! Come whatever will, "it shall be well with those who fear God" 
    (Eccles. 8:12). When they <i>die, </i>they shall go to God; and while they
    <i>live</i>, everything in the world shall do them good.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">10. The fear of God is a great cleanser.</p></b></font> "The 
    fear of the Lord is <i>clean</i>" (Psalm 19:9). It is so:
<p align="justify">1. In its own nature—it is a pure, crystal, orient grace.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the effect of it—it cleanses the heart and life. As 
    a spring works out the mud—so the fear of the Lord purges out the love of

    cleanses this temple, that it may not be defiled.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">11. The fear of God makes us accepted with God. </p></b>
</font>"In every nation he who fears him ... is accepted with him" (Acts 
    10:35). What was Paul so ambitious of? "We labor that we may be accepted by 
    him" (2 Cor. 5:9). Divine fear ingratiates us into divine favor. Such as are 
    fearless of God, neither their persons nor offerings find acceptance: "I 
    despise your feast days, and I will not dwell in your solemn assemblies. 
    Though you offer me burnt offerings . . . I will not accept them" (Amos 
    5:21-22). Who will take a gift from one who has the plague!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">12. The fear of God paves the way for spiritual joy.</p></b></font> 
    Some may think the fear of God breeds sadness; no, it is the inlet to joy! 
    The fear of God is the morning star, which ushers in the sunlight of 
    comfort: "Walking in the <i>fear </i>of the Lord, and in the <i>comfort </i>
    of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 9:31). The fear of God has solid joy in it, though 
    not frivolity. God mixes joy with holy fear, that fear may not seem slavish.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">13. The fear of God drives out all base fear.</p></b></font> 
    Carnal fear is an enemy to true religion. The fear of God frightens fear 
    away; it causes courage: "Able men, such as fear God" (Exod. 18:21); some 
    translations render it, "men of courage". When a <i>dictator </i>governed in 
    Rome, all other offices ceased. Where the <i>fear of God </i>rules in the 
    heart—it expels fleshly fear. When the empress Eudoxia threatened to banish 
    Chrysostom, the preacher said, "Tell her, <i>I fear nothing but sin!" </i>
    The fear of God swallows up all other fear, as Moses' rod swallowed up the 
    magicians' rods.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">14. To be void of God's fear, is folly. </p></b></font>"I 
    said to the fools—do not deal foolishly" (Psalm 75:4).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. Are not they fools who gratify their enemy? </p></b>
</font>Those who lack the fear of God, do so. Satan baits his hook with 
    pleasure and profit, and they swallow bait and hook and all! This pleases 
    Satan<i>; men's sins feast the devil. </i>Who but a fool would please his 
    enemy?
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. Is it not folly to prefer slavery before liberty? </p></b>
</font>If a slave in the galley should have his freedom offered him—but says 
    that he would rather tug at the oar and be a slave, than have his 
    liberty—would he not be judged to be a fool? Such is the case of him who 
    does not fear God. The gospel offers to free him from the miserable 
    captivity of sin—but he chooses rather to be a slave to his lusts. He is 
    like a servant under the law: "I love my master—I will not go out free" (Exod. 
    21:5). The foolish sinner had rather have his ear bored to the devil's 
    service, than be translated "into the glorious liberty of the sons of God" 
    (Rom. 8:21).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">3. Is not he a fool who, having but one jewel, will 
    venture the loss of it?</p></b></font> The soul is the jewel, and the sinner is 
    fearless of it, he will throw it away upon the world; as if one should throw 
    pearls and diamonds into the river. He who pampers his body and neglects his 
    soul, is like him who feasts his slave and starves his wife!
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. Is not he a fool who refuses a rich offer? </p></b></font>
    If one should offer to adopt another and make him an heir of his vast 
    estate, and he should refuse it, would not his discretion be called in 
    question? God offers Christ to a sinner, and promises to entail all the 
    riches of heaven upon him—but, lacking the fear of God, he refuses this 
    great offer: "Israel would have none of me" (Psalm 81:11). Is not this a 
    prodigy of madness? Yay not the devil peg every sinner for a fool at the 
    last day!
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">15. The fear of God is a sovereign antidote against 
    apostasy.</p></b></font> The devil was the first apostate. How rife is this sin! 
    More shipwrecks are on <i>land—</i>than at <i>sea</i>; men make shipwreck of 
    a good conscience. Apostates are said to put Christ to "open shame" (Heb. 
    6:6). The fear of God is a preservative against apostasy: "I will put my 
    fear in their hearts—that they shall not depart from me" (Jer. 32:40). I 
    will so love them—that I will not depart from them; and they shall so fear 
    me—that they shall not depart from me.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">16. There are excellent promises made to those who fear 
    God. </p></b></font>"Unto you who fear my name, shall the Sun of righteousness 
    arise with healing in his wings" (Mat. 4:2). Here is a promise of Christ; he 
    is a Sun for light and life-giving influence; and a Sun of righteousness, as 
    he diffuses the golden beams of justification. And he has healing in his 
    wings; the sun heals the air, dries up the cold moistures, exhales the 
    vapors which would be pestilential. Just so, Christ has "healing in his 
    wings"; he heals the hardness and impurity of the soul. And the horizon in 
    which this sun arises, is in hearts fearing God: "To you who fear my name, 
    shall the Sun of righteousness arise."
<p align="justify">And there is another great promise: "He will bless those 
    who fear the Lord, both small and great" (Psalm 115:13). God blesses such in 
    their name, estate, souls. And this blessing can never be reversed! As Isaac 
    said, "l have blessed him—and he <i>shall </i>be blessed" (Gen. 27:37). Such 
    as fear God are privileged people: none can take away from them—either their 
    birthright or their blessing.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">17. Fear is the admirable instrument in promoting 
    salvation.</p></b></font> "Work out your salvation with fear" (Phil. 2:12). The 
    fear of God, is that flaming sword which turns every way—to keep sin from 
    entering (Prov. 16:6). The fear of God stands sentinel in the soul, and is 
    ever upon its watchtower. Fear causes circumspection: he who walks in fear, 
    treads warily. Fear gives birth to prayer, and prayer engages the help of 
    heaven.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">18. The Lord is much pleased with those who fear him. </p></b>
</font>"The Lord takes <i>pleasure </i>in those who fear him" (Psalm 147:1). 
    In the Septuagint it is, "The Lord bears <i>good will </i>towards those who 
    fear him." Some render it, "The Lord <i>delights </i>in those who fear him." 
    Never did a suitor take such pleasure in a person he loved—as God does in 
    those who fear him; they are his "Hephzibah", which means,<i> my delight is 
    in her</i> (Isaiah 61:4). He says of them as of Zion: "This is my rest 
    forever—here I will dwell" (Psalm 132:14). A sinner is "a vessel in which is 
    no pleasure" (Hos. 8:8). But fearers of God are his favorites.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">19. Such as fear God are the only people that shall be 
    saved.</p></b></font> "Salvation is near those who fear him" (Psalm 85:9). 
    Salvation is said to be "far from the wicked" (Psalm 119:155). They and 
    salvation are so far apart—that they are likely never to meet. But God's 
    salvation is near to those who fear him. What do we aspire after, but 
    salvation? It is the end of all our prayers, tears, sufferings. Salvation is 
    the crown of our desires, the flower of our joy. And who shall be enriched 
    with salvation—only the fearers of God! "His salvation is near those who

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 6. Trial. </p></b></font>Let us put ourselves upon a 
    strict scrutiny and trial, whether we have the fear of God planted in our

<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Question: How may we know whether we have the fear of God 
    planted in our hearts?</p>
</b></font><b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Answer 1. The fear of God—will make a man fear SIN.</p></font>
</b>"How can I do this great wickedness—and sin against God?" (Gen. 39:9). 
    Indeed, sin is the only evil thing; it is the evil of evils. Sin is the 
    poison which the old serpent spat into our virgin nature! In sin there is 
    both pollution and enmity. Sin is compared to a "thick cloud" (Isaiah 
    44:22), which not only hides the light of God's face—but brings down showers 
    of His wrath. Sin is worse than all evils. There is more evil in a <i>drop
    </i>of sin—than in a <i>sea </i>of affliction!
<p align="justify">1. Sin is the cause of all affliction. Sin conjures up 
    all the winds and storms in the world. The <i>cause </i>is worse than the <i>
    effect</i>. Out of this viperous womb come, "evil thoughts, sexual 
    immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, eagerness 
    for lustful pleasure, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness."</p>
<p align="justify">2. In affliction conscience may he quiet; the hail may 
    beat upon the tiles, when there is music in the room. But sin terrifies the 
    conscience. <i>Nero</i>, in the midst of feasts and Roman sports was full of 
    horror of mind; the numbers of men he had killed troubled him. <i>Cataline
    </i>was frightened at every noise. <i>Cain </i>in killing Abel, stabbed half 
    the world at one blow, yet he could not kill the worm in his own conscience!</p>
<p align="justify">Sin is the quintessence of evil—it puts a sting into 
    death (1 Cor. 15:56). Sin is worse than hell:</p>
<p align="justify">a. Hell is a burden only to the sinner—but sin is a 
    burden to God (Amos 2:13).</p>
<p align="justify">b. There is justice in hell—but sin is the most unjust 
    thing. It would rob God of his glory, Christ of his purchase, the soul of 
    its happiness. "It is more hitter to sin against Christ, than to suffer the 
    torments of hell", says Chrysostom. Is not sin then, to be feared? <i>He who 
    fears God is afraid of touching this forbidden fruit!</i></p>

<p align="justify">More particularly:</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. He who fears God—is afraid to do anything which he 
    suspects may be sinful</p></b></font> (Romans 14:23). He will not swallow oaths 
    like pills, lest they should afterwards work in his conscience. He dares not 
    mix anything in God's worship, which God has not appointed; he fears it is 
    like offering strange fire. Where conscience is scrupulous, it is safer to 
    forbear; for, "what is not of faith is sin".
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">2. He who fears God—fears the appearance of sin.</p></b></font> 
    "Abstain from all appearance of evil" (1 Thes. 5:22). Some things have a bad 
    look, and carry a <i>show of evil </i>in them. To go to the idol temple, 
    though one does not join with them in worship, is an appearance of evil. He 
    whose heart is ballasted with God's fear—flies from that which looks like 
    sin. It was a good speech of Bernard to, "By avoiding the <i>act </i>of sin 
    we preserve our <i>peace</i>; by avoiding the <i>appearance </i>of it we 
    preserve our <i>fame</i>." The fear of God makes us shun the occasion of 
    sin: the <i>Nazarite </i>under the law was not only to forbear <i>wine</i>—but 
    he must not eat <i>grapes</i>, which might occasion intemperance. Joseph 
    fled from his mistress' temptation; he would not be seen in her company.
<p align="justify">The <i>appearance of evil</i>, though it does not defile 
    one's own conscience, may offend another's conscience. And hear what the 
    apostle says: When you "wound their weak conscience, you sin against 
    Christ!" (1 Cor. 8:12). Such as do not avoid the appearances and inlets to 
    sin-make the truth of their grace to be suspected. How far are they from the 
    fear of God who, forgetting their prayer, "Lead us not into temptation", run 
    themselves into the devil's mouth! They go to plays and theaters, which are 
    the lures and inducements of filthiness! Others associate familiarly with 
    the wicked, and are too often in their company: which is like going among 
    those who have the plague! "I wrote to you not to company with fornicators," 
    (1 Cor. 5:9). Business is one thing, keeping company is another. Polycarp 
    would have no society with Marcion, the heretic. Twisting into a cord of 
    friendship with sinners is an appearance of evil; it hardens them in sin, 
    and wounds the credit of true religion.</p>
<p align="justify">Question:<b> But did not Christ often converse with 
    sinners?</b></p>

<p align="justify">Answer 1. Christ did sometimes go among the wicked; not 
    that he approved of their sins—but as a <i>physician </i>goes among the 
    diseased to heal them, so Christ intended to work a cure upon them (Mark 
    2:17). It was their conversion which he aimed at.</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. Though Jesus Christ did sometimes converse with 
    sinners—yet he could receive no infection by them; his divine nature was a 
    sufficient antidote against the contagion of sin. As the sun cannot be 
    defiled with the thick vapors which are exhaled from the earth, and fly into 
    the sky—so the black vapors of sin could not defile the Sun of 
    righteousness. Christ was of such spotless purity, that he had no 
    receptibility of evil. But the case is otherwise with us; we have a stock of 
    corruption within. Therefore it is dangerous to mix with the wicked, lest we 
    be defiled.</p>
<p align="justify">Such as revere the divine majesty of God, dare not go 
    near the <i>borders </i>of sin. Those who went <i>near </i>the fiery 
    furnace, though they did not go into it, were burned (Dan. 3:22).</p>
<b><font color="#b07050">
<p align="justify">3. He who fears God—dares not sin secretly.</p></font> </b>A 
    hypocrite may forbear <i>gross </i>sin because of the shame—but not 
    clandestine, secret sin. He is like one who shuts up his shop windows—but 
    follows his trade within doors. But a man fearing God dares not sin, though 
    he could walk invisibly, and no eye see him. "You shall not curse the deaf, 
    or put a stumbling block before the blind; but shall fear your God" (Lev. 
    19:14). If one should curse a deaf man, he cannot hear him. If one should 
    lay a stumbling block in a blind man's way, he cannot see him. Yes—but the 
    fear of God will make one avoid those sins—which can neither he heard or 
    seen by men. <i>God's seeing in secret, </i>is a sufficient counter-poison 
    against sin.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">4. He who fears God—dares not commit sin, though it might 
    bring him a profitable advantage.</p></b> </font>Gain is the <i>golden bait </i>
    with which Satan fishes for souls. This was the last temptation the devil 
    used to Christ: "All this will I give you" (Matt. 4:9). How many bow down to 
    the <i>golden image! </i>Joshua who could stop the course of the <i>sun</i>—could 
    not stop <i>Achan </i>in his pursuit after the wedge of gold! But he who 
    fears God dares not sin to get preferment. David dared not touch the Lord's 
    anointed, though he knew he was to reign next (1 Sam. 26:33). A godly man is 
    assured that a full purse is but a poor recompense for a wounded conscience.
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">5. He who fears God—dares not gratify his own revengeful 
    humor.</p></b> </font>Homer says that revenge is sweet as dropping honey; but 
    grace makes a man rather <i>bury </i>an injury, than <i>revenge </i>it. He 
    knows who has said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay" (Rom. 12:19). He who 
    has the fear of God before his eyes, is so far from revenge, that he 
    requites good for evil. Miriam <i>murmured </i>against Moses, and Moses <i>
    prayed </i>for her, that God would heal her of her leprosy (Num. 12:13). The 
    prophet Elisha, instead of <i>smiting </i>his enemies, "set bread and water 
    before them" (2 Kings 6:22).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">6. He who fears God—dares not do that which is of evil 
    report, though possibly the thing in itself may be no sin.</p></b></font> "If 
    any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly 
    for judgment?" (1 Cor. 6:1). Yes, some might say, what sin is it to have a 
    just cause brought before unbelievers, that it may be decided? Oh but, might 
    the apostle reply, though the thing in itself is lawful—yet because it 
    sounds evil, and exposes your religion to the scorn and insult of 
    unbelievers, you who fear God, should not dare to do it. It were better to 
    decide it by a prudent arbitration. Everything is <i>permissible </i>for 
    me—but not everything is <i>beneficial</i>" (1 Cor. 6:12).
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">7. He who fears God—is not only afraid of evil <i>actions</i>, 
    but fears to offend God in his <i>thoughts</i>.</p></b> </font>"Be careful not 
    to harbor this wicked thought." (Deut. 15:9). To think of sin with delight, 
    is to act it over in the imagination. This is culpable.<i> A man may <b>
    think </b>himself into hell! </i>What were the apostate angels damned 
    for—was it for any more than proud thoughts?
<p align="justify">This is the first note of TRIAL: He who reverences 
    God—flees from sin. It is a saying of Anselm, "If sin were on one side and 
    hell on the other, I would rather leap into hell than willingly sin against 
    God!"</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 2. He who fears God—walks by Scripture rule, 
    rather than by the example of others.</p></b></font> Example is, for the most 
    part, corrupt. Examples of great men are influential. Pharaoh had taught 
    Joseph to swear—but Joseph had not taught Pharaoh to pray. The examples of 
    others cannot justify a thing which is intrinsically evil. A God-fearer 
    directs the <i>rudder of his life </i>according to the compass of the Word. 
    He looks to the sacred canon as the mariner to the compass, or Israel to the 
    pillar of fire, to direct him. "To the law and to the testimony!" (Isaiah 
    8:20).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. He who fears God—keeps his commandments. </p></b>
</font>"Fear God and keep his commandments" (Eccles. 12:13) Luther said he 
    had rather obey God, than work miracles. A gracious soul crosses his own 
    will to fulfill God's. If the Lord bids him to crucify his favorite sin, or 
    forgive his enemies—then he instantly obeys. A heathen exercising much 
    cruelty to a Christian, asked him in scorn what great miracle his master 
    Christ ever did? The Christian replied, "This miracle, that though you treat 
    me thus cruelly—I can forgive you." A holy heart knows, that there is 
    nothing lost by obedience. David swore to the Lord that he would not rest 
    until he found a place for God (Psalm 132:4-5). And God swore back to David, 
    that one of his offspring he would set one upon his throne (Psalm 132:11).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 4. He who fears God—is alike godly in all 
    companies.</p></b> </font>He diffuses the sweet savor of godliness wherever he 
    goes. Hypocrites can change themselves into all shapes, and be as their 
    company is; serious in one company and vain in another. He who reverences a 
    Deity, is alike godly in all places. A <i>steady pulse </i>shows health: a
    <i>steady walk </i>shows grace. If a godly man is providentially placed 
    among the wicked, he will not coalesce with them—but in his deportment 
    displays a majesty of holiness.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 5. He who fears God—is godly in the position where 
    God has set him. </p></b></font>Take an instance in Joseph: "I fear God" (Gen. 
    42:18). And see a pattern of relative sanctity: he showed towards his <i>
    master </i>fidelity, towards his <i>mistress </i>purity, towards his <i>
    father </i>duty, towards his <i>brethren </i>generosity. A godly man makes 
    his family, a training ground of piety (Psalm 102:1).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 6. He who fears God, dares not neglect family or 
    closet prayer.</p></b></font> "I give myself unto prayer" (Psalm 109:4).<i> 
    Prayer whispers in God's ears! </i>Prayer is private conference with God. 
    Why was Nymphas' house called a <i>church </i>(Col. 4:15). Because it was 
    consecrated by prayer. A gracious soul puts forth fervent sighs in prayer 
    (Rom. 8:26). And surely that prayer soonest pierces heaven—which pierces 
    one's own heart.
<p align="justify">If prayer be made the touchstone—then the number of those 
    who fear God is but small. Are there not many prayerless families in this 
    city and nation? "You cast off fear, you restrain prayer" (Job 15:4). When 
    men restrain prayer, they cast off the fear of God. It is the brand set upon 
    reprobates, that "they do not call on the Lord" (Psalm 14:4).</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p align="justify">Answer 7. He who fears God will not oppress his neighbor.</p></font>
</b>"You shall not oppress one another; but you shall fear your God" (Lev. 
    25:17). How can he be holy—who is not just? A saint—yet an extortioner, is a 
    contradiction. The fear of God would cure oppression. "Will you even sell 
    your brethren? Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God?" (Neh. 5:8-9). 
    As if Nehemiah had said, If you had the fear of God, you would not be so 
    wicked, you would not rise upon the ruins of others and—to wrong them, damn 
    yourselves.

<p align="justify">Answer 8. He who fears God—is given to works of mercy.
    </p></b></font>The fear of God is always joined with love to our brethren. Grace 
    may have a <i>trembling </i>hand—but it does not have a <i>withered </i>
    hand; it stretches itself out to relieve the needy, "Pure and undefiled 
    religion before our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows 
    in their distress " (James 1:27). To <i>visit </i>them is not only to go to 
    see them in affliction. Our Savior expounds what visiting is in Matthew 
    25:36, "You visited me"; how was that? "I was an hungry, and you gave me 
    food" (verse 35). Good works are not the <i>cause </i>of our justification, 
    but they are the <i>evidence </i>of our justification. How far are they from 
    the fear of God, who are hard-hearted to Christ's poor! You may as well 
    extract oil out of a flint—as the golden oil of charity out of their flinty 
    hearts! The rich man denied Lazarus a crumb of bread—and he was denied a 
    drop of water (Luke 16:21).
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">Answer 9. He who fears God—would rather displease man, 
    than God.</p></b></font> "The midwives feared God, and did not as the king of 
    Egypt commanded them—but saved the men children alive" (Exod. 1:17). What, 
    not obey the king's command! How could this stand with their allegiance? 
    Very well, because it was an <i>unlawful </i>command. The king had ordered 
    them to put to death the Hebrew males—which they dared not do, for fear of 
    incurring God's displeasure. King Nebuchadnezzar erected a golden image to 
    be worshiped—but the three Hebrew children (or rather champions) said, "Be 
    it known unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods—nor worship the 
    golden image which you have set up!" (Dan. 3:18). They would rather <i>burn—</i>than
    <i>bow!</i> He who fears God, knows it is best to please God. <i>He is the 
    best Friend—but the worst Enemy!

<p align="justify">Answer 10. The fear of God will make a man fear these six

</b></font>

<p align="justify">1. Satan's snares </p>

<p align="justify">3. Death </p>
<p align="justify">4. Judgment</p>
<p align="justify">5. Hell</p>
<p align="justify">6. Heaven</p>

<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">1. The fear of God will make a man afraid of SATAN'S 
    SNARES.</p></b></font> He has the <i>eye of faith </i>to see these snares, and 
    the <i>wing of fear </i>to fly from them! Fear gives wings to the feet. "We 
    are not ignorant of his <i>devices</i>" (2 Cor. 2:11). The word means 
    "subtle stratagems". Satan is called the "old Serpent" (Rev. 12:9). Though 
    he has lost his <i>holiness</i>, he has not lost his <i>deceitfulness</i>. 
    His snares are so cunningly laid, that without the guidance of God's fear, 
    we cannot escape them.
<b>
<p align="justify">a. One subtle artifice of Satan—is to bait his hook with 
    religion. </p></b>He can change his flag, and hang out Christ's colors; here he 
    transforms himself into an <i>angel of light </i>(2 Cor. 11:14). The devil 
    tempts men to evil, "that good may come" of it (Rom. 3:8). He whistles them 
    into the snare of preferment, that hereby they may be in a capacity of doing 
    God more service. The <i>white devil </i>is worst! Who would suspect Satan 
    when he comes as a <i>minister, </i>and quoting Scripture?
<b>
<p align="justify">b. Another snare of Satan—is to tempt to sin under a plea 
    of <i>necessity</i>.</p></b> Lot offered to expose his daughters to the lusts of 
    the Sodomites, that he might preserve his angel-guests who were come into 
    his house (Gen. 19:8). Did not Satan instigate him to this? <i>Necessity </i>
    will not excuse <i>impiety</i>.
<b>
<p align="justify">c. Another snare of Satan—is to color over sin with the 
    pretense of <i>virtue</i>. </p></b>Alcibiades hung a finely embroidered curtain 
    over a foul picture full of dragons and satyrs. Satan puts good names on 
    sin, as physicians call that film in the eye which hinders the sight a 
    "pearl" in the eye. Satan colored over Jehu's ambition with the name of zeal 
    (2 Kings 10:16). He makes men believe that <i>revenge </i>is valor, or that
    <i>covetousness </i>is<i> </i>frugality; as if one should write "medicine" 
    upon a bottle of poison!
<b>
<p align="justify">d. Another snare of Satan—is to carry on his mischievous 
    designs under a pretense of <i>friendship</i>.</p></b> He puts off his <i>lion's
    </i>skin, and comes in <i>sheep's </i>clothing. Thus Satan came to Christ: 
    "Command that these stones be made bread" (Matt 4:3). As if he had said, "I 
    see you are hungry; I therefore out of pity, counsel you to get something to 
    eat—turn these stones to bread, that your hunger may be satisfied." But 
    Christ spied the serpent in the temptation, and repulsed him. Thus Satan 
    came to Eve in the guise of a friend. He said of the tree in the midst of 
    the garden, "You shall not surely die . . . you shall be as gods" (Gen. 
    3:4-5). As if to say, "I persuade you only to that which will put you into a 
    better condition than now you are; eat of the tree of knowledge and it will 
    make you omniscient!" What a <i>kind </i>devil was here! But Eve found a <i>
    worm </i>in the apple!
<b>
<p align="justify">e. A fifth snare—if Satan cannot take a Christian off 
    from duty, he will put him on too far in duty.</p></b> Humiliation is a duty—but 
    Satan suggests that the soul is not humbled enough: and indeed he never 
    thinks it humbled enough, until it despairs. Satan comes thus to a man: 
    "Your sins have been great—so your sorrow should be proportionate. But is it 
    so? Can you say you have been as great a <i>mourner—</i>as you have been a
    <i>sinner</i>? What is a drop of your sorrow—compared to a sea of your sin? 
    This is laid only as a snare. The subtle enemy would have a Christian weep 
    himself blind, and in a desperate plight, throw away the <i>anchor of hope</i>. 
    And if Satan has such <i>fallacies</i>, and as a <i>decoy </i>draws so many 
    millions into his snares, is there not cause of jealous fear lest we should 
    be trapped? The fear of God—will make us fear hell's stratagems. Satan's <i>
    snares </i>are worse than his <i>darts!
</i><font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. The fear of God will make a man afraid of his own 
    HEART.</p></b></font> Luther used to say, that he feared his own heart more than 
    the pope or cardinals! "The heart is deceitful above all things" (Jer. 
    17:9).
<p align="justify">It is "deceitful". The word signifies, it is a "Jacob" or 
    "supplanter". As Jacob supplanted his brother, and took away the blessing, 
    so our hearts would supplant and beguile us. </p>
<p align="justify">"Above all things": there is deceit in weights, deceit in 
    friends; but the heart has an <i>art of deceiving </i>beyond all. In the 
    best hearts there is some fallaciousness. David was upright in all things, 
    "except in the affair concerning Uriah the Hittite" (1 Kings 15:5). A godly 
    man, knowing there is a measure of this deceit in his heart, fears himself! 
    The flesh is a bosom-traitor. No man can fathom what evil is in his heart. 
    "Is your servant a dog!" (2 Kings 8:13). Hazael could not believe his heart 
    could give birth to such monsters. If one had come to Noah and said, "You 
    will be drunk shortly"; he would have said, "Is your servant a dog?" No man 
    knows the depth of evil which in his heart, or what scandal he may fall 
    into—if God should leave him. Christ warns his own apostles to "take heed of 
    surfeiting and drunkenness" (Luke 21:34). A godly man therefore fears his 
    heart with a fear of caution and jealousy. </p>
<p align="justify">The heart is not only <i>stubborn</i>—but <i>subtle</i>. 
    Let us a little trace this impostor, and see if there is not cause to fear 
    it. The heart shows its deceitfulness regarding <i>sinful </i>things—and <i>
    sacred </i>things.</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">The heart shows its deceitfulness regarding SINFUL things</p></b></font>, 
    this deceit is in the <b>hiding </b>of sin, as Rahab hid the spies in the 
    flax (Josh. 2:6). So the heart hides sin. And how does it hide sin? Just as 
    Adam hid himself under fig leaves—so the heart hides sin under the fig 
    leaves of <i>rationalization </i>and <i>excuses</i>. "It was done against my 
    will; or done in a passion; or it was done along with others." Aaron blamed 
    his sin in the making of the golden calf, upon the people: "The people are 
    set on mischief" (Exod. 32:22). And Adam tacitly blamed his sin upon God 
    himself: "The woman <i>You </i>gave to be with me—she gave me some fruit 
    from the tree, and I ate" (Gen. 3:12), as if to say, "If <i>You </i>had not 
    given me this tempting woman—I would not have eaten!"
<p align="justify">The heart's deceit is seen in <b>flattering </b>us. It 
    will make us believe we are not so bad as we are. The physician deceives the 
    patient when he tells him that his disease is not so dangerous, when he is 
    falling into the hands of death! The heart will tell a man that he is free 
    from theft, when yet he robs others of their good name. The heart will tell 
    a man that he is free from drunkenness when, though he will not be drunk 
    with wine, he will be drunk with passion. Thus the heart is <i>a flattering 
    mirror</i> to make one look <i>better </i>than he is! Is there not cause to 
    suspect this impostor!</p>
<font color="#b07050"><b>
<p align="justify">Secondly, the heart shows its deceitfulness regarding 
    SACRED things.</p></b></font> It will be ready to put us off with counterfeit <b>
    grace</b>. Many have been deceived in taking false money; and many, it is to 
    be feared, have been deceived in taking false grace.
<p align="justify">The heart is ready to deceive with a false <b>repentance</b>. 
    A sinner is troubled a little for sin, or rather the <i>consequences </i>of 
    it, and perhaps sheds a few tears, and now his heart soothes him—and tells 
    him that he is a true penitent. But every <i>legal </i>terror is not true 
    repentance: "They were pricked in their hearts" (Acts 2:37); yet after this, 
    "Peter said unto them <i>repent</i>" (verse 38). If every <i>slight trouble 
    for sin </i>were true repentance—then Judas and Cain may be enrolled in the 
    number of penitents. <i>Evangelical repentance </i>works a change of heart 
    (1 Cor. 6:11). It produces sanctity. But the false penitent, though he has 
    trouble of spirit—yet has no transformation or change of heart and life. He 
    has a weeping eye—but an adulterous heart. Ahab fasts and puts on 
    sackcloth—but after this, he puts the prophet Micah in prison (1 Kings 
    22:27).</p>
<p align="justify">The heart is apt to deceive with a false <b>faith</b>; it 
    would put the dead child in the place of the living child. Those in the 
    second chapter of John are said to <i>believe</i>; but Christ did not 
    believe their faith (John 2:24). True faith, as it casts itself into 
    Christ's arms to <i>embrace </i>him, so it casts itself at Christ's feet to
    <i>serve </i>him. But spurious faith, though it is forward to receive 
    Christ's <i>benefits</i>—yet it plucks the <i>crown </i>from his head—and 
    will not submit to his authority! (Isaiah 9:6). It would have him a<i> 
    Priest </i>to save him—but not as a <i>King </i>upon his <i>throne</i> to 
    rule him (Zech. 6:13). </p>
<p align="justify">Thus the heart is full of fallacies; he who fears God, 
    fears his heart lest it should rob him of the blessing. </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. The fear of God—will make a man fear DEATH. </p></b>
</font>We should fear death, first, because it is such a <b>serious </b>
    thing, it is the inlet to eternity and puts us into an unalterable state!
    
<p align="justify">Secondly, because of its <b>proximity</b>. It is nearer 
    to us than we are aware; it may be within a few hours march of us! God may 
    this night say, "Give an account of your stewardship!" And what if death 
    should come before we are ready? </p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, because after death there is nothing to be done 
    for our souls. There is no repenting in the grave: "In the grave, where you 
    are going, there is neither working nor planning" (Eccles. 9:10). So death 
    is to be feared with a holy and pious fear.</p>
<p align="justify">Question: <i>How far may a child of God fear death?</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer 1. So far as the fear of death is a curb bit, to 
    keep him from <b>sin</b>. A believer may lawfully make use of all means to 
    deter him from sin. There is no stronger antidote against sin—than the fear 
    of death. "Am I <i>sinning </i>today—and tomorrow may be <i>dying</i>—and 
    going to<i> judgment!"</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer 2. A child of God may so far fear death, as it 
    makes him die to the <b>world</b>. The fear of death should sound a retreat 
    and call us off from worldly vanities. What is the world? We must leave it 
    shortly, and all we will then have, is our burying place (Gen. 49:30).</p>
<p align="justify">Answer 3. A child of God may so far fear death, as this 
    fear fits him more for <b>death</b>. Jacob feared his brother Esau's coming 
    against him, and he prepared to meet him, addressing himself to prayer (Gen. 
    32:7, 24). So when we fear death's coming, and we prepare to meet it—we set 
    oh soul in order. This is a <i>godly </i>fear of death.</p>
<p align="justify">But this fear of death in the godly must he mixed with 
    hope. The nature of death to a believer, is quite changed. Death is in 
    itself a curse—but God has turned this curse into a blessing. To a child of 
    God, death is not a <i>destruction, </i>but a <i>deliverance</i>. When the 
    mantle of his flesh drops off, he ascends in a fiery chariot to heaven!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. The fear of God—will make a man fear JUDGMENT.</p></b></font> 
    Anselm spent most of his thoughts upon the Day of Judgment; and Jerome 
    thought he always heard that voice sounding in his ears, "Arise you dead—and 
    come to judgment!" That there shall be such a day is evident:
<p align="justify">a. From God's <b>veracity</b>: he who is the Oracle of 
    truth has asserted it: "For he comes—for he comes to judge the earth" (Psalm 
    96:13). There is <i>duplication </i>here, firstly, to show the <i>certainty</i>: 
    "he comes, he comes". It is an indubitable maxim. Secondly, to show the <i>
    speediness</i>, "he comes, he comes", the time draws near—it is almost 
    daybreak, and the judge is ready to take the bench! (James 5:9).<i> God's 
    decree cannot be reversed!</i></p>

<p align="justify">b. There shall he such a day for the vindication of God's
    <b>justice</b>. Things seem to be done in the world, very unequally: the 
    godly suffer, the wicked prosper. Atheists are ready to think God has thrown 
    aside the government of the world—and does not mind how things are 
    transacted here below. Therefore there must he a judicial process, that God 
    may undeceive the world and set all things right.</p>
<p align="justify">c. That there shall be such a day is evident by the 
    principles engrafted in a natural conscience. When Paul reasoned of judgment 
    to come, "Felix trembled" (Acts 24:25). The <i>prisoner </i>at the bar—made 
    the <i>judge </i>tremble! That a wicked man dying is so surprised with 
    terrors—from where does this arise, but from a secret apprehension of 
    ensuing judgment!</p>
<p align="justify">It will be a <i>great </i>judgment. Never was the like 
    seen! We must <i>all </i>appear before the judgement seat! (2 Cor. 5:10). 
    There is no fleeing, no absconding, no bribing, no appearing by a proxy—but 
    all must make their <i>personal </i>appearance. Those who were above trial 
    here, and the law could not reach them, <i>must </i>appear before the 
    tribunal of heaven!</p>
<p align="justify">Who shall be the Judge? Jesus Christ (John 5:22.; Acts 
    17:31). "He has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world—by 
    that man whom he has ordained." Christ the Judge, is called <i>man </i>
    because he shall judge the world in a visible shape. He must be <i>both </i>
    God and man: he must be God, that he may see men's hearts—and he must be 
    man, that he himself may be seen.</p>
<p align="justify">What a solemn day will this be, when Christ shall sit 
    upon the bench of judicature! He will judge "righteously" (Psalm 9:8). 
    Though he himself was wronged, he will do no wrong. And he will judge <i>
    thoroughly</i>: "Whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his 
    floor" (Matt. 3:12). He will see what is wheat—and what is chaff; who have 
    his image upon them—and who the mark of the beast. Surely, the fear of God 
    will cause a holy trembling at the thoughts of this day!</p>
<p align="justify">Question: In what sense should those who fear God—fear 
    the Day of Judgment?</p>
<p align="justify">Answer: Not with a fear of dread or despondency, for the 
    Day of Judgment will be a <i>Jubilee</i>—a <i>blessed comfortable </i>day to 
    them! The thrush <i>sings </i>at the approach of rain—and so may believers 
    at the approach of Judgment. Christ who is their <i>Judge </i>is also their
    <i>Redeemer </i>and <i>Advocate</i>. But,</p>
<p align="justify">a. The godly should so fear judgment as every day to 
    renew their <i>sorrow for sin</i>. They have sins which creep upon them 
    daily—and they must with Peter weep bitterly. They must <i>steep their souls
    </i>in the salty tears of repentance. It would be sad to be found at the 
    last day, in any sin unrepented of.</p>
<p align="justify">b. The godly should so fear the Day of Judgment as to 
    make them afraid of <i>sins of omission</i>. Not dressing a wound brings 
    death. Not discharging duty may bring damnation. You may read the solemn 
    process at the last day: "I was <i>hungry </i>and you gave Me nothing to 
    eat; I was <i>thirsty </i>and you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a <i>
    stranger </i>and you didn’t take Me in; I was <i>naked </i>and you didn’t 
    clothe Me, <i>sick </i>and in <i>prison </i>and you didn't take care of Me" 
    (Matt. 25:42). The charge here brought in, is for sins of <i>omission</i>. 
    Christ does not say, "You took away my food from me"—but "You gave me 
    nothing to eat"; He does not say, "You put me in prison"—but "You did not 
    visit me." The sins of <i>omission </i>condemned them. Not praying in the 
    family, not attending the means of grace, not giving alms, will be the fatal 
    indictment.</p>
<p align="justify">c. The godly should so far fear the Day of Judgment as to 
    make them afraid of <i>pretending </i>in religion. For at that day, false 
    hearts will be unmasked. Why did Paul walk with such integrity? "You are 
    witnesses and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblamably we behaved 
    ourselves among you" (1 Thess. 2:10). What was the cause of this? Surely a 
    fear of the approaching Judgment Day: "For we must all appear before the 
    judgement seat of Christ!" (2 Cor. 5:10). The word in the original means we 
    must be made <i>manifest</i>, our hearts must be laid open before men and 
    angels. Such is the <i>witchcraft of hypocrisy, </i>that it is hard in this 
    life, to know who is a false professor, and who is sincere. But shortly 
    there will be a full revealing. It is good for God's people so to fear 
    judgment, as to make them strive against deceit and hypocrisy; for then the 
    hypocrite will be found out.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5. The fear of God—makes a man fear HELL.</p></b></font> Hell 
    is called the "place of torment" (Luke 16:28). Not only notoriously wicked 
    sinners—but such as fear God, ought to fear hell: "I say unto you<i> my 
    friends</i>, Fear him who has power to cast into hell!" (Luke 12:4).
<p align="justify">Question: <i>How far should God's people fear hell?</i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer: <i>Not so far, as to let go their hope. </i>A 
    mariner fears a storm—but not so as to throw away his anchor. Such as fear 
    God—should fear hell in four ways.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">a. Those who fear God ought to fear hell—as that which 
    they have deserved. </p></b>Their sins have merited hell. Woe to the holiest man 
    alive—if God should weigh him in the balance of his justice!
<b>
<p align="justify">b. Those who fear God ought to fear hell—insofar as this 
    is a means to make them shake off spiritual sloth. </p></b>This <i>sleeping 
    disease </i>is apt to seize upon God's own people; "the wise virgins <i>
    slumbered</i>" (Matt. 25:5). Now, so far as the fear of hell is an alarm or 
    a warning-bell to awaken the godly out of security, and make them run faster 
    to heaven, so far it is a godly and blessed fear.
<b>
<p align="justify">c. The fear of hell is good in the godly—insofar as it 
    makes them afraid of being in the number of those who shall go to hell.</p></b> 
    There are certain people who are in danger of hell:
<p align="justify">First, those who have their heaven in this life: "You who 
    are given to pleasure" (Is. 47:8). Epicures swim in sensual delights; they 
    would rather displease God—than deny the flesh. These shall take up their 
    quarters in hell. "The Lord, the Lord Almighty, called you on that day to 
    weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth. But see, there 
    is joy and revelry, eating of meat and drinking of wine! "Let us eat and 
    drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!" The Lord Almighty has revealed this 
    in my hearing: "Until your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says 
    the Lord, the Lord Almighty!" (Isaiah 22:12-14) That is, this sin shall not 
    be done away by any sacrifice.</p>
<p align="justify">Second, they are in danger to be cast into hell who live 
    in the sin of adultery (Prov. 22:12). <i>Those who burn in lust—shall burn 
    in hell! </i>"Lord knows how to keep the unrighteous under punishment until 
    the day of judgment, <i>especially </i>those who follow the polluting 
    desires of the flesh." (2 Pet. 2:9-10). See the corruption of man's nature! 
    Instead of drinking water out of his own cistern, he loves <i>stolen </i>
    waters (Prov. 9:17). The same Latin word signifies a <i>stable </i>and a <i>
    whore-house—</i>both are for <i>beasts!</i></p>

<p align="justify">Third, they are likely to go to hell who, by giving <i>
    bad example</i>, cause others to sin. Bad example, like the plague, is 
    contagious. Great men are <i>mirrors—</i>by which the common people dress 
    themselves. Such as give bad example, have not only their own sins, but the 
    sins of others to answer for. That doubtless was the reason why the rich man 
    entreated Abraham that one might go from the dead to preach to his brethren 
    (Luke 16:27), and not that he had love to their souls, but because, while he 
    was alive, he had occasioned his brethren's sins by his wicked example, and 
    knew that their coming to hell would increase his torment!</p>
<p align="justify">Fourth, they are likely to go to hell who live and die in 
    the contempt of God's Word. Ministers have preached until their lungs are 
    exhausted—but men stop their ears and harden their hearts! "They made their 
    hearts as an adamant stone" (Zech. 7:12). Hardness of heart lies in the 
    insensibility of the <i>conscience </i>(Eph. 4:19), and the inflexibility of 
    the <i>will </i>(Jer. 44:16-17). Obdurate sinners shake out the <i>arrow of 
    conviction </i>and scorn all godly reproof. When the prophet cried to the 
    altar of stone, it broke apart (1 Kings 13:2). But sinners hearts do not 
    break! These are likely to have the wrath of God flame about their ears! 
    "This will take place at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with 
    His powerful angels, taking vengeance with flaming fire on those who don't
    <i>know </i>God and on those who don't <i>obey </i>the gospel of our Lord 
    Jesus. These will pay the penalty of everlasting destruction, away from the 
    Lord’s presence and from His glorious strength!" (2 Thess. 1 :7-8).</p>
<p align="justify">Fifth, they shall go to hell who fall away (Mat. 13:6). 
    Because they had <i>no root</i>—they withered. Flowers in a waterpot will 
    keep green and fresh a while—but having no root, they wither. Demas made a 
    fair show a while—but ended as the silkworm which, after all her fine 
    spinning, at last becomes a common fly. "If we deliberately keep on sinning 
    after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is 
    left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that 
    will consume the enemies of God!" (Heb. 10:26-27).</p>
<p align="justify">Thus we see who are likely to be thrown into hell. Now it 
    is good for the godly so to fear hell—as to fear to be in the number of 
    those who shall go to hell.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">d. The fear of hell is good in the godly—insofar as it is 
    a fear mixed with rejoicing.</p></b> "Rejoice with trembling" (Psalm 2:11). A 
    believer's fear of hell must he like the fear of the two Marys going from 
    the sepulcher: "They departed from the sepulcher with <i>fear </i>and great
    <i>joy</i>" (Matt. 28:8). With <i>fear</i>, because they had seen an angel; 
    and with <i>joy</i>, because Christ was risen! So must the godly look on 
    hell, with fear and joy. With <i>fear</i>, because of the fire; and with <i>
    joy</i>, because Christ has freed them from hell. A man who stands upon a 
    high rock, fears when he looks down into the sea—yet rejoices that he is not 
    there drowning in the waves. So a child of God, when he looks down into hell 
    by contemplation, may fear because of the dreadfulness of the torment; yet 
    this fear should be mingled with joy, to think he shall never come there! 
    Jesus has delivered him "from the wrath to come" (1 Thess. 1:10).

<p align="justify">6. The fear of God will make a man fear HEAVEN.</p></b></font> 
    You may say, "that is strange—we should rather <i>hope </i>for heaven." No, 
    a regenerate person is to fear heaven—lest he fall short of it. "Therefore, 
    while the promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear so that none of 
    you should miss it!" (Heb. 4:1). It is a metaphor taken from athletes who, 
    growing weary and lagging behind, come short of the prize. Who had more hope 
    of heaven than Paul? Yet he was not without his fears: "I discipline my body 
    and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I 
    myself will not be disqualified" (1 Cor. 9:27). And well may he who shall go 
    to heaven, fear less he miss it, if you consider:
<p align="justify">a. It is possible for many who make a <i>splendid 
    profession</i>, to lose heaven. What do you think of the <i>foolish </i>
    virgins? They are called virgins because they were not tainted with any 
    gross sin; yet these virgin-professors were shut out of heaven! (Matt. 
    25:10). Balaam, a <i>prophet</i>; and Judas, an <i>apostle</i>—were both 
    shut out of heaven! We have seen some ships which had glorious <i>names </i>
    given them, the <i>Good-speed</i>, the <i>Hope</i>, the <i>Safeguard</i>—which 
    were lost at sea.</p>
<p align="justify">b. It is possible to come <i>near </i>to heaven—yet fall
    <i>short </i>of it: "You are <i>not far </i>from the kingdom of God" (Mark 
    12:34); yet he was <i>not near enough! </i>Men may commend the ministry of 
    the Word, have their affections moved at an ordinance, and in <i>outward 
    show </i>out-do the children of God (Num. 23:1-2); yet, not having the <i>
    oil of sincerity </i>in their vessels, they will fall short of eternal 
    happiness. And how dismal is that—to lose <i>God</i>, to lose their <i>souls</i>, 
    to lose their<i> hopes! </i>The millions of tears shed in hell—are not 
    sufficient to bewail the loss of heaven! Well may such as have heaven in 
    them, fear their coming short of it. </p>
<p align="justify">So much, then, for this sixth use, <i>trial</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Question. <i><b>How shall we arrive at this blessed fear?</b></i></p>

<p align="justify">Answer. </p>
<p align="justify">1. Let us set God ever in our eye—study his immensity! He 
    is God Almighty (Gen. 17:1). He gives laws to the angels, binds the 
    consciences of men, cuts off princes "He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is 
    feared by the kings of the earth." (Psalm 76:12). The thoughts of God's <i>
    incomprehensible greatness</i>, should strike a <i>holy awe </i>in our 
    hearts! Elijah wrapped his face in a mantle when God's glory passed by. <i>
    The reason men do not fear God—is because they entertain slight thoughts of 
    him! </i>"You thought that I was altogether like you!" (Psalm 50:21).</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let us <i>pray </i>for this fear of God, which is the 
    root of all holiness, and the mother of all wisdom. "Give me an undivided 
    heart—that I may fear your name" (Psalm 86:11). The Lord has promised to put 
    his fear in our heart (Jer. 32:40). Let us pray over this promise. While 
    some pray for riches, and others for children—let us pray for a heart to 
    fear God!</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude this, you who have this fear planted in your 
    souls—bless God for it! "You who fear the Lord—bless the Lord" (Psalm 
    135:20). God has done more for you than if he had made you kings and 
    queens—and caused you to ride upon the high places of the earth! He has 
    enriched you with that jewel which he bestows only upon the elect.</p>
<p align="justify">Oh, stand upon Mount Gerizim, <i>blessing</i>. The fear 
    of God is an immortal seed springing up into glory! "You who fear the 
    Lord—praise him!" (Psalm 22:23). Begin the work of heaven now. Be spiritual 
    choristers! Sound forth holy doxologies and triumphs! Say, as David, "My 
    mouth is full of praise and honor to You all day long!" (Psalm 71:8).</p>
<p align="justify">God has but little praise in the world. Who should thus 
    pay that which is due to him—if not those who fear him?</p>
