        <h2>Of the NAMES of God</h2>
        <p>
          Being about to treat of God, and of the things of God, it may be
          proper to begin with his names: the names of persons and things are
          usually the first that are known of them; and if these are not known,
          it cannot be thought that much, if anything, is known of them; and
          where the name of God is not known, he himself cannot be known; and
          the rather the consideration of his name, or names, is worthy of
          regard, because they serve to lead into some knowledge of his nature
          and perfections; and therefore a proper introduction to such a
          subject. Indeed, properly speaking, since God is incomprehensible, he
          is not nominable; and being but one, he has no need of a name to
          distinguish him; and therefore Plato says, he has no name; and hence
          he commonly calls him, &quot;Ens&quot;, &quot;The Being&quot;. So when
          Moses asked the Lord, what he should say to the children of Israel,
          should they ask the name of him that sent him to them, he bid him say,
          &quot;I am that I am&quot;; that is, The eternal Being, the Being of
          beings; which his name Jehovah is expressive of: nevertheless, there
          are names of God in the Scriptures taken from one or other of his
          attributes, which are worthy of consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The names of God, as Zanchy observes, some of them respect him as the
          subject, as Jehovah, Lord, God: others are predicates, what are spoken
          of him, or attributed to him, as holy, just, good, etc. Some respect
          the relation the divine Persons in the Godhead stand in to each other,
          as Father, Son, and Spirit: others the relation of God to the
          creatures; and which are properly said of him, and not them, as
          Creator, Preserver, Governor, etc. some are common to the Three divine
          persons, as Jehovah, God, Father, Spirit; and some peculiar to each,
          as the epithets of unbegotten, begotten, proceeding from the Father
          and the Son: some are figurative and metaphorical, taken from
          creatures, to whom God is compared; and others are proper names, by
          which he either calls himself, or is called by the prophets and
          apostles, in the books of the Old and New Testament; which are what
          will be particularly considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. &quot;Elohim&quot; is the first name of God we meet with in
          Scripture, and is translated God, (Genesis 1:1) and is most frequently
          used throughout the whole Old Testament; sometimes, indeed, improperly
          of creatures, angels, and men, and of false deities, (Psalm 8:5, 82:1,
          6; Jeremiah 10:11) but properly only of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some derive this word from a root, which signifies to curse and swear;
          but as to the reasons why this name is given to the divine Being on
          that account, it is not agreed; some of late, have given this as a
          reason, because the three divine Persons, as they in a shocking manner
          express it, bound themselves with an oath, under a curse, to redeem
          mankind; which, to say no worse of, is indecent and unworthy of the
          dignity and majesty of God, &quot;who is blessed for evermore&quot;;
          for to bind himself with an oath, and that under a conditional curse;
          which is no other than to imprecate a curse upon himself, if his oath
          and covenant are not fulfilled; is so harsh, if not something worse,
          as is not to be endured: and though Christ agreed to redeem men, and
          to be made a curse for them, that they might receive the blessing; yet
          he was not accursed through any failure of his oath and covenant; but
          on another account, being the Surety of his people; nor is he ever
          called Eloah on that account, and still less the other two persons:
          besides there are other and better reasons to be given for this name
          of the divine Being, supposing it to be taken from the word signifying
          as above; as, because he adjures and causes others to swear, and binds
          them with an oath to himself; in which sense the word is used of men,
          (1 Samuel 14:24; 1 King 8:31) and is the business of judges; by which
          oath men are bound to God, and not he to them; and so, according to
          the Jewish writers, the word is expressive of God as a judge; in which
          they are followed by some learned men: or, because he pronounces a man
          accursed who breaks his law, and neglects and despises the sacrifice
          and righteousness of Christ; so Cocceius: or, because he is the object
          men must swear by, whenever they swear at all (see Deuteronomy 6:13;
          Isaiah 65:16). Though this word Elohim cannot be derived from the word
          so signifying, because it has the immoveable and immutable as appears
          from the point &quot;mappick&quot;, in its singular Eloah, and from
          the construction of it, which that word has not; and besides, that is
          never used of God when he is said to swear, but always another.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word Elohim may be better derived from a word in the Arabic
          language, which signifies to &quot;worship&quot;, as is thought by
          many learned men and so is a fit name for God, who is the sole object
          of religious worship and adoration; not idols of gold, silver, etc.
          nor living men, nor persons deified after death, nor angels; but the
          Lord God only, (Matthew 4:10. It is a word of the plural number; and
          though it has a singular, which is sometimes used, yet it is most
          frequently in this form; and being joined with a singular verb, as in
          (Genesis 1:1 it is thought to denote a plurality of persons in the
          unity of the divine essence; and certain it is, that three persons,
          Father, Son, and Spirit, appeared, and were concerned in the creation
          of all things (Genesis 1:1-3; Ps 33:6).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another name of God is &quot;El&quot;; and which may be observed in
          the word Beth-el, which signifies, &quot;The house of God&quot;
          (Genesis 12:7, 8). Both the singular and plural, El Elim, the God of
          gods, are used in Daniel 11:36 and the word is left untranslated in
          Matthew 27:46 &quot;Eli, Eli; my God, my God&quot;. It is commonly
          rendered, by Junius and Tremellius, the strong or mighty God; an
          epithet that well agrees with the divine Being, (Job 9:4, 19; Psalm
          89:8, 13) and is one of the names of the Messiah (Isaiah 9:6).
          Hillerus takes this to be a part of the word Eloah, the singular of
          Elohim; which, according to him, signifies the first in essence; being
          the first and the last, the beginning and the end, (Isaiah 44:6;
          Revelation 1:8) it is expressive of the power of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The next name of God we meet with is &quot;Elion&quot;, the most
          high, (Genesis 14:18-20, 22). So Christ is called &quot;The son of the
          Highest&quot;, and the Spirit, &quot;the power of the Highest&quot;,
          (Luke 1:32, 35) and which name God has either from his habitation, the
          highest heavens; which is his palace, where he keeps his court, and
          which is his throne; in which high and holy place he, the high and
          lofty One, dwells, (Isaiah 57:15, 56:1) or from his superiority,
          power, and dominion over all creatures, over the highest personages on
          earth, and the highest angels in Heaven, (Psalm 83:18, 97:9; see also
          Ecclesiastes 5:8) or from the sublimity of his nature and essence,
          which is out of the reach of finite minds, and is incomprehensible,
          (Job 11:7, 8). This name was known among the Phoenicians, and is given
          to one of their deities, called Elioun, the most high; it is
          expressive of the supremacy of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Another name of God is &quot;Shaddai&quot;: under this name God
          appeared to Abraham, (Genesis 17:1) and to which reference is had,
          (Exodus 6:3) we translate it Almighty in both places, and in all
          others, particularly in the book of Job, where it is often mentioned;
          and it well agrees with him whose power is infinite and
          uncontrollable, and appears in the works of his hands, creation and
          providence. Some choose to render it &quot;sufficient&quot;, or
          &quot;all-sufficient&quot; God; having a sufficiency in and of
          himself, and for himself, to make himself completely and infinitely
          happy; nor does he need, nor can he receive anything from his
          creatures to add to his happiness; and he has a sufficiency for them;
          he can, and does, supply all the wants of his people, temporal and
          spiritual; &quot;his grace is sufficient for them.&quot; Others render
          it &quot;Nourisher&quot;; deriving it from a word which signifies
          &quot;a breast&quot;; that being what creatures nourish their young
          with; and is made mention of when this name of God is spoken of
          (Genesis 49:25). God not only fills men&#x27;s hearts with food and
          gladness, but &quot;he opens his hand, and satisfies the desire of all
          creatures, and gives them their meat in due season&quot; (Acts 14:17;
          Psalm 145:15, 16). Hillerus derives it from a word which signifies to
          pour out, or shed; and it well agrees with God, who pours forth, or
          sheds his blessings, in great plenty, on his creatures; and which flow
          from him as from a fountain; to which he is often compared: though
          others give a very different etymology of it; deriving it from a word
          which signifies to &quot;destroy&quot;; to which there seems to be a
          beautiful allusion in (Isaiah 13:6.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Destruction from Shaddai, the destroyer&quot;, who destroyed the
          old world, Sodom and Gomorrah, the firstborn of the Egyptians, and
          Pharaoh and his host: though God is so called, previous to most of
          these instances; indeed he is &quot;the law-giver, that is able to
          save and to destroy&quot;; even to destroy body and soul in Hell, with
          an everlasting destruction. And some render the word the
          &quot;Darter&quot;, or &quot;Thunderer&quot;; whose darts are his
          thunderbolts (Job 6:4; Psalm 18:13, 14). The heathens called their
          chief God, Jupiter, &quot;Tonans, The Thunderer&quot;: and, perhaps,
          from another etymology of this word before given, from &quot;a
          breast&quot;. Some of their deities are represented as full of
          breasts; so Ceres, Isis, and Diana. This name seems to be expressive
          of the all-sufficiency of God, and of the supply of his creatures from
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Another of the names of God is, the &quot;Lord&quot;, or &quot;God
          of hosts&quot;; it is first mentioned in 1 Samuel 1:3, 11 but
          frequently afterwards; and is left untranslated in James 5:4 where the
          Lord is called, &quot;the Lord of Sabaoth&quot;, not
          &quot;Sabbath&quot;, as it is sometimes wrongly understood; and as if
          it was the same with &quot;Lord of Sabbath&quot;, (Matthew 12:8) for
          though the words are somewhat alike in sound, they are very different
          in sense; for &quot;Sabbath&quot; signifies &quot;rest&quot;, and
          &quot;Sabaoth&quot; means &quot;hosts&quot; or &quot;armies&quot;: the
          Lord is the God of armies on earth, a man of war, expert in it; that
          teaches men&#x27;s hands to war, and their fingers to fight, and is
          the generalissimo of them, as he was particularly of the armies of
          Israel, as they are called, (Exodus 7:4) which he brought out of
          Egypt, and went at the head of them, and fought their battles for
          them; (see Exodus 14:14, 15:3) and who gives success and victory on
          what side soever he takes: and he is the Lord of the hosts of the
          starry heavens; the sun, moon, and stars, called the host of Heaven,
          (Genesis 2:1; 2 King 21:3, 23:5) and by this military term, because
          under the Lord they sometimes fight as the stars did against Sisera,
          (Jude 5:20) and also of the airy heavens; and the locusts that fly
          there are his army, (Joel 2:7, 11) and the meteors, thunder and
          lightning, snow and hail, which are laid up by him against the day of
          battle and war, are the artillery he sometimes brings forth against
          the enemies of his people; as he did against the Egyptians and
          Canaanites, (Job 38:22, 23; Exodus 9:24, 25; Joshua 10:11) the angels
          also are the militia of Heaven, and are called &quot;the heavenly
          host&quot;, (Luke 2:13; see 1 King 22:19) the place where the angels
          of God met Jacob, was called from thence Mahanaim, (Genesis 32:1, 2)
          two hosts or armies, one going before him, and the other behind him;
          or the one on one side him and the other on the other, to guard him;
          hence they are said to &quot;encamp&quot; about them that fear the
          Lord (Psalm 34:7). These are the creatures of God by whom he is adored
          and served; they are at his command, and sometimes employed in a
          military way, to destroy his and his peoples&#x27; enemies (see 2 King
          19:35). This name is expressive of God&#x27;s dominion over all his
          creatures, and the several armies of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Another name of God is &quot;Adonai&quot;, or &quot;Adon&quot;,
          (Genesis 15:2) and is commonly rendered Lord. Hence the Spanish word
          &quot;don&quot; for &quot;lord&quot;. God is so called, because he is
          the Lord of the whole earth (Zechariah 4:14). Some derive it from a
          word which signifies the basis, prop, or support of anything. So a
          king in the Greek language is called basileuv, because he is the basis
          and support of his people: and so God is the support of all his
          creatures; &quot;he upholds all things by the word of his power&quot;;
          he bears up the pillars of the earth; all men move and have their
          being in him; and &quot;he upholds his saints with the right hand of
          his righteousness&quot;; and even his Son as man and mediator, (Isaiah
          41:10, 42:1). Some think it has the signification of a judge;
          &quot;God is the judge of all the earth&quot;; and is a righteous one,
          protects and defends good men, and takes vengeance on the wicked; and
          will judge the world in righteousness at the last day. Though,
          perhaps, Hillerus is most correct in rendering it &quot;the
          Cause&quot;, from which, and for which, all things are; as all things
          are made by the Lord, and for his will, pleasure, and glory (see
          Romans 11:36; Hebrews 2:10; Revelation 4:11). Adon is used in the
          plural number of God, (Malachi 1:6) and so Adonai is used of the Son,
          as well as of the Father, (Psalm 110:1) and of the Holy Spirit, Isaiah
          6:8 compared with Acts 28:25. Hence Adonis, with the heathens, the
          same with the sun, their chief deity, according to Macrobius, by whom
          Bacchus is called Ebon, or rather Edon; who, he says, is also the same
          with the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The famous name of God is &quot;Jehovah&quot;; this is a name he
          takes to himself and claims it, (Exodus 6:3; Isaiah 42:8) and is
          peculiar to him; his name alone is Jehovah, and incommunicable to
          another, (Psalm 83:18) because this name is predicated of God, as a
          necessary and self existent being, as a learned Jew observes, which no
          other is; for though it is sometimes spoken of another, yet not singly
          and properly, but with relation to him. So the church is called
          &quot;Jehovah-shammah&quot;, because of his presence with her,
          (Ezekiel 48:35). The Jews, from a superstitious abuse of it, assert it
          to be ineffable, and not to be pronounced, and even not to be read and
          written, and therefore they substitute other names instead of it, as
          Adonai, and Elohim. This might arise, originally, from their very
          great awe and reverence of this name, according to Deuteronomy 28:58
          but every name of God is reverend, and not to be taken in vain, nor
          used in common, nor with any degree of levity, (Psalm 111:9). It is
          written with four letters only; hence the Jews call it
          &quot;tetragrammaton&quot;, and is very probably the tetraktuv of the
          Pythagoreans, by which they swore; and it is remarkable, that the word
          for God is so written in almost all languages; denoting, it may be,
          that he is the God of the whole world; and ought to be served and
          worshiped, and his name to be great and had in reverence in the four
          quarters of it; it takes in all tenses, past, present, and to come:
          the words of the evangelist John are a proper periphrasis of it;
          &quot;which is, and which was, and which is to come&quot;, (Revelation
          1:4) or, &quot;shall be&quot;, as in Revelation 16:5 it comes from the
          root hyh or hwh which signify, &quot;to be&quot;, and is expressive of
          the essence of God; of his necessary and self-existence, for God
          naturally and necessarily exists; which cannot be said of any other:
          creatures owe their being to the arbitrary will of God; and so might
          be, and might not be, as he pleased; but God exists in and of himself,
          he is a self-existent and independent Being, as he must needs be,
          since he is before all creatures, and therefore cannot have his being
          from them; and he is the cause of theirs, and therefore must be
          independent of them; and yet, when we say he is self-existent, it must
          not be understood as if he made himself; for though he exists, he is
          not made. He is the Being of beings; all creatures have their beings
          from him and in him, &quot;the heavens, earth, and sea, and all that
          is in them&quot;; he is the former and maker of all things; he is
          eminently &quot;the Being&quot;, and all in comparison of him are mere
          nonentities; &quot;all nations&quot;, and the inhabitants of them,
          &quot;are as nothing before him; yes, less than nothing, and
          vanity&quot; (Isaiah 40:17).
        </p>
        <p>
          8. &quot;Jah&quot; is another name of God, which is mentioned in Psalm
          68:4, 150:6, Isaiah 26:4, though it may be only an abbreviation or
          contraction of the word Jehovah, and may signify the same; according
          to Cocceius, it comes from hay (Jeremiah 10:7) and signifies
          &quot;decency&quot;, or what is meet and becoming.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. &quot;Ejeh&quot; is a name God gave as a name of his to Moses, when
          he sent him to the children of Israel; and is translated &quot;I AM
          that I AM&quot;, (Exodus 3:13, 14) and may be rendered, &quot;I shall
          be what I shall be&quot;, and what I have been; so the Jews interpret
          it; &quot;I am he who was, I am he who is now, and I am he who is to
          come, or shall be.&quot; It seems to be of the same signification with
          Jehovah, and to be derived from the same word, and is expressive of
          the same things; of the being and existence of God, of his eternity
          and immutability, and of his faithfulness in performing his promises:
          our Lord has a manifest respect unto it, when he says, &quot;Before
          Abraham was I AM&quot;, (John 8:58). Hillerus renders it &quot;I
          remain&quot;, that is, always the same.

          10. The names of God in the New Testament are these two kuriov and
          yeov, the one is usually rendered Lord and the other God. The first is
          derived either from kurw, &quot;to be&quot;, and signifies the same as
          Jehovah, to which it commonly answers, and denotes the essence or
          being of God; or from kurov, &quot;power and authority&quot;; and
          agrees with God, who has a sovereign power and authority over all
          creatures, having a property in them, by virtue of his creation of
          them; it is generally used of Christ, &quot;who is Lord of all&quot;,
          (Acts 10:36; 1 Corinthians 8:6; Ephesians 4:6). The etymology of yeov,
          &quot;God&quot;, is very different; as either from a word which
          signifies &quot;to run&quot;, or from one that signifies &quot;to
          heat&quot;, or from one that signifies &quot;to see&quot;; which seem
          to be calculated by the heathens for the sun, the object of their
          worship, applicable to it, for its constant course, being the fountain
          of light and heat, and seeing all things, as they affirm: though each
          of them may be applied to the true God, who runs to the assistance of
          his people in distress, (2 Chronicles 16:9; Psalm 46:1) is light
          itself, &quot;the Father of lights&quot;, and &quot;a consuming
          fire&quot; (1 John 1:5; James 1:17; Hebrews 12:29) and sees all men,
          their ways and works, and even their hearts, and the thoughts of them
          (Job 34:21, 22; 1 Samuel 16:7). Some derive it from a word which
          signifies to dispose; and which agrees with God, who disposes of, and
          orders all things &quot;in the armies of the heavens, and among the
          inhabitants of the earth, according to the council of his will&quot;,
          and to answer the purposes of his own glory, and the good of his
          creatures. Though, perhaps, it may be best of all to derive it from a
          word which signifies &quot;fear&quot;, and so describes God as the
          object of fear and reverence; who is not only to be stood in awe of by
          all the inhabitants of the earth, (Psalm 33:8) but more especially is
          to be feared with a godly fear by his saints, (Psalm 87:7; Hebrews
          12:28) and fear sometimes takes in the whole worship of God, both
          internal and external; and so the true God, in distinction from
          others, is called, &quot;the fear&quot;, that is, the God of Isaac,
          (Genesis 31:53), and &quot;fear&quot;, is sometimes used in the Targum
          for the true God, as it sometimes is of idols. From all these names of
          God we learn that God is the eternal, immutable, and almighty Being,
          the Being of beings, self-existent, and self-sufficient, and the
          object of religious worship and adoration.
