        <h2>OF THE BEING OF GOD</h2>
        <p>
          Having undertaken to write a System of Theology, or a Body of
          Doctrinal Divinity; and Theology being nothing else than a speaking of
          God, or a discoursing concerning him; his nature, names, perfections,
          and persons; his purposes, providences, ways, works, and word: I shall
          begin with the Being of God, and the proof and evidence of it; which
          is the foundation of all religion; for if there is no God, religion is
          a vain thing; and it matters not neither what we believe, nor what we
          do; since there is no superior Being to whom we are accountable for
          either faith or practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, because the being of God is a first principle, which is not to
          be disputed; and because that there is one is a self-evident
          proposition, not to be disproved; have thought it should not be
          admitted as a matter of debate: but since such is the malice of Satan,
          as to suggest the contrary to the minds of men; and such the badness
          of some wicked men as to listen to it, and imbibe it; and such the
          weakness of some good men as to be harassed and distressed with doubts
          about it at times; it cannot be improper to endeavor to fortify our
          minds with reasons and arguments against such suggestions and
          insinuations. And my
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First argument to prove the Being of a God, shall be taken from the
          general consent of men of all nations, in all ages of the world; among
          whom the belief of it has universally obtained; which it is not
          reasonable to suppose would have obtained, if it was not true. This
          has been observed by many heathen writers themselves. Aristotle says,
          &quot;all men have a persuasion of Deity, or that there is a
          God.&quot; Cicero observes, &quot;There is no nation so wild and
          savage, whose minds are not imbued with the opinion of the gods; many
          entertain wrong notions of them; but all suppose and own the divine
          power and nature.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And in another place he says, &quot;There is no animal besides man
          that has any knowledge of God; and of men there is no nation so
          intractable and fierce, although it may be ignorant what a God it
          should have, yet is not ignorant that one should be had.&quot; And
          again, &quot;It is the sense of all mankind, that it is
          &quot;innate&quot; in all, and is, as it were, engraved on the mind,
          that there is a God; but what a one he is, in that they vary; but that
          he is, none denies.&quot; And to the same sense are the words of
          Seneca, &quot;There never was a nation so dissolute and abandoned, so
          lawless and immoral, as to believe there is no God.&quot; So Aelianus
          relates, &quot;None of the barbarous nations ever fell into atheism,
          or doubted of the gods whether they were or not, or whether they took
          care of human affairs or not; not the Indians, nor the Gauls, nor the
          Egyptians.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And Plutarch has these remarkable words, &quot;If you go over the
          earth, says he, you may find cities without walls, letters, kings,
          houses, wealth, and money, devoid of theaters and schools; but a city
          without temples and gods, and where is no use of prayers, oaths, and
          oracles, nor sacrifices to obtain good or avert evil, no man ever
          saw.&quot; These things were observed and said, when the true
          knowledge of God was in a great measure lost, and idolatry prevailed;
          and yet even then, this was the general sense of mankind. In the first
          ages of the world, men universally believed in the true God, and
          worshiped him, as Adam and his sons, and their posterity, until the
          flood; nor does there appear any trace of idolatry before it, nor for
          some time after. The sins which caused that, and with which the world
          was filled, seem to be lewdness and impurity, rapine and violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some think the tower of Babel was built for an idolatrous use; and it
          may be that about that time idolatry was set up; as it is thought to
          have prevailed in the days of Serug: and it is very probable that when
          the greater part of the posterity of Noah&#x27;s sons were dispersed
          throughout the earth, and settled in the distant parts of it; that as
          they were remote from those among whom the true worship of God was
          preserved; they, by degrees, lost sight of the true God, and forsook
          his worship; and this being the case, they began to worship the sun in
          his stead, and which led on to the worship of the moon, and the host
          of Heaven; which seem to be the first objects of idolatry. This was as
          early as the times Job, who plainly refers to it, (Job 31:26, 27).
          And, indeed, when men had cast off the true object of worship, what
          more natural to substitute in his room than the sun, moon, and stars,
          which were above them, visible by them, and so glorious in themselves,
          and so beneficial to the earth and men on it? Hence the people of
          Israel were exhorted to take care that their eyes were not ensnared at
          the sight of them, to fall down and worship them; and which in later
          times they did (Deuteronomy 4:19; 2 King 21:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears also that men took very early to the deifying of their
          heroes after death, their kings, and great personages, either for
          their wisdom and knowledge, or for their courage and valor, and
          martial exploits, and other things; such were the Bel, or Belus, of
          the Babylonians; the Baalpeor of the Moabites. ;and the Molech of the
          Phoenicians, and other Baalim lords, or kings, mentioned in the
          Scriptures: and such were Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Hercules;
          and the rest of the rabble of the heathen deities; and indeed their
          Lares, and Penates, or household gods, were no other than the images
          of their deceased parents, or more remote ancestors, whose memory they
          revered; and in process of time their deities became very numerous;
          they had gods many and lords many: even with the Jews, when fallen
          into idolatry, their gods were according to the number of their cities
          (Jeremiah 2:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for the Gentiles, they worshiped almost everything; not only
          the sun, moon, and stars; but the earth, fire, and water; and various
          sorts of animals, as oxen, goats, and swine, cats and dogs, the fishes
          of the rivers, the river horse, and the crocodile, those amphibious
          creatures; the birds of the air, as the hawk, stork, and ibis; and
          even insects, the fly; yes, creeping things, as serpents, the beetle,
          etc.; as also vegetables, onions, and garlic; which occasioned the
          satirical poet to say, &quot;O holy nations, whose gods are born in
          their gardens!&quot; Nay, some have worshiped the devil himself, as
          both in the East and West Indies; and that for this reason, that he
          might not harm them. Now though all this betrays the dreadful
          depravity of human nature; the wretched ignorance of mankind; and the
          sad stupidity men were sunk into; yet at the same time such shocking
          idolatry, in all the branches of it, is a full proof of the truth and
          force of my argument, that all men, in all ages and countries, have
          been possessed of the notion of a God; since, rather than to have no
          God, they have chosen false ones; so deeply rooted is a sense of Deity
          in the minds of all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sensible that to this it is objected, that there have been, at
          different times, and in different countries, some particular persons
          who have been reckoned atheists, deniers of the Being of a God. But
          some of these men were only deriders of the gods of their country;
          they mocked at them as unworthy of the name, as weak and insufficient
          to help them; as they reasonably might; just as Elijah mocked at Baal
          and his worshipers. Now the common people, because they so behaved
          towards their gods, looked upon them as atheists, as such who did not
          believe there was any God. Others were so accounted, because they
          excluded the gods from any concern with human affairs; they thought
          they were other ways employed, and that such things were below their
          notice, and not becoming their grandeur and dignity to regard; and had
          much the same sentiments as some of the Jews had (Ezekiel 9:9; Zep.
          1:12).
        </p>
        <p>
          But these men were not deniers of the existence of God, only of his
          providence as to the affairs of the world: and others have been rather
          practical than speculative atheists, as the fool in Psalm 14:1, who
          not only live as if there was no God; but wish in their hearts there
          was none, rather than believe there is none; that so they might take
          their fill of sin, without being accountable to a superior Being. The
          number of real speculative atheists have been very few, if any; some
          have boldly asserted their disbelief of a God; but it is a question
          whether their hearts and mouths have agreed; at least they have not
          been able to maintain their unbelief long without some doubts and
          fears. And at most this only shows how much the reason of man may be
          debased, and how low it may sink when left to itself: these few
          instances are only particular exceptions to a general rule; which is
          not destroyed thereby, being contrary to the common sense of mankind;
          even as it is no sufficient objection to the definition of man, as a
          rational creature, that there is now and then an idiot born of his
          race, so not to the general belief of Deity, that there is now and
          then an atheist in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is further objected, that there have been whole nations in Africa
          and America, who have no notion of Deity. But this is what has not
          been sufficiently proved; it depends upon the testimonies of
          travelers, and what one affirms, another denies; so that nothing can
          with certainty be concluded from them. &quot;I should rather question,
          says Herbert, Lord Cherbury, whether the light of the sun has shone on
          the remotest regions, than that the knowledge of the Supreme Being is
          hidden from them; since the sun is only conspicuous in its own sphere;
          but the Supreme Being is seen in everything.&quot; Diodorus Siculus
          says, a few of the Ethiopians were of opinion there was no God; though
          before he had represented them as the first and most religious of all
          nations, as attested by all antiquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hottentots about the Cape of Good Hope have been instanced in, as
          without any knowledge of Deity: and certainly they are a most beastly
          and brutish people that can be named, and the most degenerate of the
          human species, and have survived the common instincts of humanity;
          yet, according to Mr. Kolben&#x27;s account of them, published some
          years ago, they appear to have some sense of a Supreme Being, and of
          inferior deities. They express a superstitious joy at new and full
          moons; and it is said they pray to a Being that dwells above; and
          offer sacrifice of the best things they have, with eyes lifted up to
          Heaven. And later discoveries of other nations, show the contrary to
          what has been asserted of them; which assertions have arose either
          from want of intimate knowledge of them, and familiar acquaintance
          with them, or from their dissolute, wicked, and irreligious lives;
          when, by conversing with them, it appears that they have a notion of
          the sun, or sky, or something or another being a sort of deity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it has been observed of the Greenlanders, that &quot;they had
          neither a religion nor idolatrous worship; nor so much as any
          ceremonies to be perceived tending to it: hence the first missionaries
          entertained a supposition, that there was not the least trace to be
          found among them of any conception of a divine Being, especially as
          they had no word to express him by. But when they came to understand
          their language better, they found quite the reverse to be true, from
          the notions they had, though very vague and various, concerning the
          soul, and concerning spirits; and also from their anxious solicitude
          about the state after death. And not only so, but they could plainly
          gather from a free dialogue they had with some perfectly wild
          Greenlanders, that their ancestors must have believed a supreme Being,
          and did render him some service; which their posterity neglected by
          little and little, the further they were removed from more wise and
          civilized nations; until at last they lost every just conception of
          the Deity; yet, after all, it is manifest, that a faint idea of a
          divine Being lies concealed in the minds even of this people, because
          they directly assent, without any objection, to the doctrine of a God,
          and his attributes.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And as to what is concluded from the irreligious lives of the
          inhabitants of some nations, we need not be sent to Africa and America
          for such atheists as these; we have enough of them in our own nation;
          and I was just ready to say, we are a nation of atheists in this
          sense: and, indeed, all men in an unregenerate state, be they Jews or
          Gentiles, or live where they may, they are &quot;atheists&quot;; as
          the apostle calls them, (Eph 2:12) they are &quot;without God in the
          world, being alienated from the life of God&quot;, (Eph 4:18)
          otherwise there is such a general sense of Deity in mankind; and such
          a natural inclination to religion, of some sort or another, though
          ever so bad, that some have thought that man should rather be defined
          as a religious than a rational animal. I take no notice of the holy
          angels, who worship God continually; nor of the devils, who believe
          there is one God and tremble; my argument being only concerned with
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The second argument shall be taken from the law and light of
          nature; or from the general instinct in men, or impress of Deity on
          the mind of every man; that is, as soon as he begins to have the
          exercise of his rational powers, he thinks and speaks of God, and
          assents to the Being of a God. This follows upon the former, and is to
          be proved by it; for as Cicero says, &quot;The consent of all nations
          in anything, is to be reckoned the law of nature.&quot; And since all
          nations agree in the belief of a Deity, that must be a part of the law
          of nature, inscribed on the heart of every man. Seneca makes use of
          this to prove there is a God; he says: &quot;because an opinion or
          sense of Deity, is &quot;implanted&quot; in the minds of all
          men.&quot; And so likewise Cicero, as observed before; and who calls
          them the notions of Deity implanted and innate. And whoever believes
          the Mosaic account of the creation of man, cannot doubt of this being
          his case, when first created; since he is said to be made in the
          image, and after the likeness of God; for the image of God surely
          could not be impressed upon him, without having the knowledge of him
          implanted in him; and though man by sinning has greatly come short of
          this image and glory of God, yet this light of nature is not wholly
          obscured, nor the law of nature entirely obliterated in him; there are
          some remains of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some indeed among us, who deny there are any innate ideas in
          the minds of men, and particularly concerning God: but to such writers
          and reasoners I pay but little regard; when the inspired apostle
          assures us, that even the Gentiles, destitute of the law of Moses,
          have &quot;the work of the law written in their hearts&quot;, (Romans
          2:15) which, as it regards duty to God, as well as man, necessarily
          supposes the knowledge of him; as well as of the difference between
          good and evil, as founded upon his nature and will: and though this
          light of nature is not sufficient to lead men, in their present state,
          to a true spiritual and saving knowledge of God; yet it furnishes them
          with such a sense of him, as puts them upon seeking him; &quot;if
          haply they may feel and grope after him, and find him&quot;, (Acts
          17:27).
        </p>
        <p>
          These notices of a divine Being do not flow from the previous
          instructions of parents and others; but from a natural instinct; at
          most, they are only drawn forth by instruction and teaching; Velleius,
          the Epicurean, says, &quot;that there is a Deity nature itself has
          impressed the notion of on the minds of all men; for what nation, or
          sort of men, &quot;he adds, &quot;that has not a certain anticipation
          of it without being taught it, &quot;or before taught it, as Julian
          expresses it: nor do these notices take their rise from state policy;
          or are the effects of that originally: if this was the case, if it was
          the contrivance of politicians to keep men in awe, and under
          subjection, it must be the contrivance of one man, or more united
          together. If of one, say, who is the man? in what age he lived, and
          where? and what is his name, or his son&#x27;s name? If of more, say,
          when and where they existed? and who they were that met together? and
          where they formed this scheme? And let it be accounted for; if it can,
          that such a number of sage and wise men, who have been in the world;
          that no man should be able to get into the secret, and detect the
          fallacy and discover it, and free men from the imposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, these notices appeared before any scheme of politics was
          formed; or kings or civil magistrates were in being. Plato has refuted
          this notion; and represents it as a very pestilent one, both in
          private and in public. Nor are these notices by tradition from one to
          another; since traditions are peculiar to certain people: the Jews had
          theirs, and so had the Gentiles; and particular nations among them had
          separate ones from each other; but these are common to all mankind:
          nor do they spring from a slavish fear and dread of punishment; for
          though it has been said, that fear makes gods, or produces a notion of
          Deity; the contrary is true, that Deity produces fear, as will be seen
          in a following argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this head may be observed the innate desires of men after
          happiness, which are so boundless as not to be satisfied. Let a man
          have ever so great a compass of knowledge and understanding; or
          possess ever so large a portion of wealth and riches; or be indulged
          with the gratification of his senses to the highest degree; or enjoy
          all the pleasure the whole creation can afford him; yet after all,
          according to the wise man, the conclusion of the whole is, &quot;all
          is vanity and vexation of spirit&quot; (Ecclesiastes 2:17). Now these
          desires are not in vain implanted, there must be an object answerable
          unto them; a perfect Being, which is no other than God; who is the
          first cause and last end of all things, of whom the Psalmist says,
          &quot;Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is none on earth my
          soul desires besides you&quot; (Psalm 73:25).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third argument, proving the Being of God, shall be taken from
          the works of creation; concerning which the apostle says, &quot;the
          invisible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly
          seen; being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
          power and Godhead&quot; (Romans 1:20). Plutarch, in answer to a
          question, Whence have men the knowledge of God? replies, &quot;They
          first receive the knowledge of him from the beauty of things that
          appear; for nothing beautiful is made in vain, nor by chance, but
          wrought with some are: that the world is beautiful, is manifest from
          the figure, the color, and magnitude of it; and from the variety of
          stars about the world.&quot; And these so clearly display the Being
          and power of God, as to leave the heathen without excuse, as the
          apostle observes; and as this, and other instances, show.

          Most admirable was the reasoning of a wild Greenlander, which he
          declared to a missionary to be the reasoning of his mind before his
          conversion; he said to him, &quot;It is true we were ignorant
          heathens, and knew nothing of God, or a Savior; and, indeed, who
          should tell us of him until you come? but you must not imagine that no
          Greenlander thinks about these things. I myself have often thought: a
          boat with all its tackle and implements, does not grow into existence
          of itself; but must be made by the labor and ingenuity of man; and one
          that does not understand it would directly spoil it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the meanest bird has far more skill displayed in its structure,
          than the best boat; and no man can make a bird: but there is still a
          far greater are shown in the formation of a man, than of any other
          creature. Who was it that made him? I thought myself that he proceeded
          from his parents, and they from their parents; but some must have been
          the first parents; whence did they come? common report informs me,
          they grew out of the earth: but if so, why does it not still happen
          that men grow out of the earth? and from whence did this same earth
          itself, the sea, the sun, the moon, and stars, arise into existence?
          Certainly there must be some Being who made all these things; a Being
          that always was, and can never cease to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must be inexpressibly more mighty, knowing, and wise, than the
          wisest man. He must be very good too, because that everything that he
          has made is good, useful, and necessary for us. Ah, did I but know
          him, how would I love him and honor him! But who has seen him? who has
          ever conversed with him? None of us poor men. Yet there may be men too
          that know something of him. O that I could but speak with such!
          therefore,&quot; he said, &quot;as soon as ever I heard you speak of
          this great Being, I believed it directly, with all my heart; because I
          had so long desired to hear it.&quot; A glaring proof this, that a
          supreme Being, the first cause of all things, is to be concluded from
          the works of creation. The notion of the eternity of the world has
          been imbibed by some heathens, but sufficiently confuted by others.
          And even Aristotle, to whom it is ascribed, asserts, that &quot;it was
          an ancient doctrine, and what all men received from their ancestors;
          that all things are of God, and consist by him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And those who believe the divine revelation, cannot admit of any other
          doctrine; but must explode the notion of the eternity of the world,
          and of its being of itself; since that assures us, that &quot;in the
          beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot;: also that all
          things were made, &quot;not of things which do appear&quot;, but out
          of nothing, (Genesis 1:1; Hebrews 11:3) for, be it, that the heavens
          and the earth were made out of a chaos, or out of pre-existent matter;
          it may be reasonably asked, out of what was that pre-existent matter
          made? the answer must be, out of nothing; since it was by creation,
          which is the production of something out of nothing: and which can
          never be performed by the creature; for out of nothing, nothing can be
          made by that. If therefore all things are originally produced out of
          nothing, it must be by one that is almighty, whom we rightly call God.
        </p>
        <p>
          No creature can produce itself; this involves such contradictions as
          can never be admitted; for then a creature must be before it was; as
          that which makes must be before that which is made: it must act and
          operate before it exists; and be and not be at one and the same time;
          which are such glaring contradictions, as sufficiently confute the
          creature&#x27;s making itself; and therefore its being must be owing
          to another cause; even to God, the Creator; for between a creature and
          God, there is no medium: and if it could be thought or said, that the
          most excellent creatures, men, made themselves; besides the above
          contradictions, which would be implied, it might be asked, why did not
          they make themselves wiser and better; since it is certain, they have
          knowledge of beings superior to them? and how is it that they know so
          little of themselves, either of their bodies or their souls, if both
          were made by them? and why are they not able to preserve themselves
          from a dissolution to which they are all subject? It may be further
          observed; that effects, which depend upon causes in subordination to
          one another, cannot be traced up &quot;ad infinitum&quot;; but must be
          reduced to some first cause, where the inquiry must rest; and that
          first cause is God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now here is an ample field to survey; which furnishes out a variety of
          objects, and all proofs of Deity. There is nothing in the whole
          creation the mind can contemplate, the eye look upon, or the hand lay
          hold on, but what proclaims the Being of God. When we look up to the
          heavens above us; the surrounding atmosphere; the air in which we
          breathe, which compresses our earth, and keeps it together; the
          stellar space, and spreading sky, bespangled with stars of light, and
          adorned with the two great luminaries, the sun and moon, especially
          the former, that inexhaustible fountain of light and heat; and under
          whose benign influences, so many things are brought forth on earth;
          whose circuit is from one end of the Heaven to the other; and there is
          nothing hid from the heat thereof: when we consider its form,
          magnitude, and virtue; its proper distance from us, being not so near
          us as to scorch us; nor so remote as to be of no use to us; the motion
          given it at first, in which it has proceeded without stopping, but
          once as is supposed, in the days of Joshua; a motion it has had now
          almost six thousand years; the course it has steered, and steers, so
          that all parts of the earth, at one season or another, receive benefit
          by it; and the way it has been guided in, without varying or erring
          from it all this while. Whoever reflects on these things, must
          acknowledge it to be the work of an all wise and almighty agent, we
          call God; and that it must be upheld, guided, and directed by his hand
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we take a view of the earth, of the whole terraqueous globe,
          hanging on nothing, like a ball in the air, poised with its own
          weight; the different parts of it, and all disposed for the use of
          man; stored with immense riches in the heart of it, and stocked with
          inhabitants upon it; the various sorts of animals, of different forms
          and shapes, made, some for strength, some for swiftness, some for
          bearing burdens, and others for drawing carriages, some for food and
          others for clothing: the vast variety of the feathered birds that cut
          the air; and the innumerable kinds of fishes that swim the ocean. The
          consideration of all this will oblige us to say, &quot;Lord, you are
          God, which have made the Heaven, earth, and sea; and all that in them
          is&quot; (Acts 4:25).
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, there is not a shell in the ocean, nor a sand on the shore,
          nor a spire of grass in the field, nor any flower of different hue and
          smell in the garden, but what declare the Being of God: but especially
          our own composition is deserving of our notice; the fabric of the
          body, and the faculties of our souls. The body, its form and shape;
          while other animals look downwards to the earth, &quot;os homini
          sublime dedit Deus&quot;, as the poet says, man has a lofty
          countenance given him, to behold the heavens, to lift up his face to
          the stars; and for what is this erect posture given him, but to adore
          his Creator? And it is remarkable that there is a natural instinct in
          men to lift up their hands and eyes to Heaven, when either they have
          received any unexpected mercy, by way of thankfulness for it; or are
          in any great distress, as supplicating deliverance from it; which
          supposes a divine Being, to whom they owe the one, and from whom they
          expect the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the parts and members of the body are so framed and disposed,
          as to be subservient to one another; so that &quot;the eye cannot say
          to the hand, I have no need of you; nor the head to the feet, I have
          no need of you&quot;. The same may be observed of the other members.
          The inward parts, which are weak and tender, and on which life much
          depends, were they exposed, would be liable to much danger and hurt;
          but these are &quot;clothed with skin and flesh, and fenced with bones
          and sinews&quot;; and every bone, and every nerve, and every muscle,
          are put in their proper places. All the organs of the senses, of
          sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling, are most wonderfully
          fitted for the purposes for which they are made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Galen, an ancient noted physician, being atheistically inclined, was
          convinced of his impiety by barely considering the admirable structure
          of the eye; its various humours, tunics, and provision for its defense
          and safety. The various operations performed in our bodies, many of
          which are done without our knowledge or will, are enough to raise the
          highest admiration in us: as the circulation of the blood through all
          parts of the body, in a very small space of time; the respiration of
          the lungs; the digestion of the food; the chylification of it; the
          mixing of the chyle with the blood; the nourishment thereby
          communicated; and which is sensibly perceived in the several parts of
          the body, and even in the more remote; which having been weakened and
          enfeebled by hunger, thirst, and labor, are in an instant revived and
          strengthened; and the accretion and growth of parts by all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          To which may be added other things worthy of notice; the faculty of
          speech, peculiar to man, and the organs of it; the features of their
          faces; and the shape of their bodies, which all differ from one
          another; the constant supply of animal spirits; the continuance of the
          vital heat, which outlasts fire itself; the slender threads and small
          fibers spread throughout the body, which hold and perform their office
          seventy or eighty years running: all which, when considered, will
          oblige us to say, with the inspired Psalmist, &quot;I am fearfully and
          wonderfully made; marvelous are your works; and that my soul knows
          right well&quot;: and will lead us to ascribe this curious piece of
          workmanship to no other than to the divine Being, the God of all flesh
          living.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the soul of man, the more noble part of him, more fully discovers
          the original author of him; being possessed of such powers and
          faculties that none but God could give: it is endowed with an
          understanding, capable of receiving and framing ideas of all things
          knowable, in matters natural, civil, and religious; and with reason,
          to put these together, and compare them with each other, and discourse
          concerning them; infer one thing from another, and draw conclusions
          from them: and with judgment, by which it passes sentence on things it
          takes cognizance of, and reasons upon; and determines for itself what
          is right or wrong; and so either approves or disapproves: it has a
          &quot;mind&quot; susceptive of what is proposed unto it; it can, by
          instruction or study, learn any language; cultivate any are or
          science; and, with the help of some geographical principles, can
          travel over the globe, can be here and there at pleasure, in the four
          parts of the world; and in a short time, visit every city of note
          therein, and describe the situation of every country, with their
          religion, manners, customs, etc. it can reflect on things past, and
          has a foresight of, and can forecast and provide for things to come:
          it has a &quot;will&quot;, to accept or reject, to embrace or refuse,
          what is proposed unto it; with the greatest freedom of choice, and
          with the most absolute power and sovereignty: it has affections, of
          love and hatred, joy and grief, hope and fear, etc. according to the
          different objects it is conversant with.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also the conscience, which is to a man as a thousand
          witnesses, for him or against him; which, if it performs its office as
          it should do, will accuse him when he does ill, and commend, or excuse
          him, when he does well; and from hence arise either peace of mind, or
          dread of punishment, in some shape or another, either here or
          hereafter: to which may be added the memory, which is a storehouse of
          collections of things thought to be most valuable and useful; where
          they are laid up, not in a confused, but orderly manner; so as to be
          called for and taken out upon occasion: here men of every character
          and profession lay up their several stores, to have recourse unto, and
          fetch out, as their case and circumstances may require.
        </p>
        <p>
          And besides this, there is the &quot;fancy or imagination&quot;, which
          can paint and describe to itself, in a lively manner, objects
          presented to it, and it has entertained a conception of; yes, it can
          fancy and imagine things that never were, nor never will be: and, to
          observe no more, there is the power of invention; which in some is
          more, in others less fertile; which, on a sudden, supplies with what
          is useful in case of an emergency. But above all, the &quot;soul&quot;
          of man is that wherein chiefly lay the image and likeness of God, when
          man was in his pure and innocent state; and though it is now sadly
          depraved by sin, yet it is capable of being renewed by the spirit of
          God, and of having the grace of God implanted in it, and is endowed
          with immortality, and cannot die: now to whom can such a noble and
          excellent creature as this owe its original? but to the divine Being,
          who may, with great propriety, be called, the Father of spirits, the
          Lord, the Jehovah, who &quot;forms the spirit of man within him&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The fourth argument will be taken from the sustaining and
          government of the world; the provision made for the supply of
          creatures, and especially of man, and for his safety. As the world, as
          we have seen, is made by a divine Being, so by him it consists. Was
          there not such an almighty Being, &quot;who upholds all things by the
          word of his power&quot;, they would sink and fall. Did he not bear up
          the pillars of the earth, they would tremble and shake, and not be
          able to bear its weight: the most stately, firm, and well built
          palace, unless repaired and maintained, will fall to decay and ruin;
          and so the grand and magnificent building of this world would soon be
          dissolved, did not the divine agent that made it, keep it up: as he
          who built all things is God, so he who supports the fabric of the
          universe must be so too; no less than an almighty hand can preserve
          and continue it; and which has done it, without any visible appearance
          of age or decay, for almost six thousand years; and though there is
          such a vast number of creatures in the world, besides men, the beasts
          of the field, and &quot;the cattle on a thousand hills&quot;, the
          birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea; there is food provided
          for them all, and they have &quot;every one their portion of meat in
          due season&quot;: and as for man, he is richly provided for, with a
          plenty and variety of all good things; not only for necessity, but for
          delight; every man has a trade, business, and employment of life; or
          is put into such a situation and circumstances, that, with care,
          diligence, and industry, he may have enough for himself and family,
          and to spare: the earth produces a variety of things for food and
          drink for him; and of others for medicine, for the continuance of
          health, and restoration of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And can all this be without the care, providence, and interposition of
          a wise and almighty Being? Can these ever be thought to be the effects
          of blind chance and fortune? Is it not plain and clear, that God
          hereby &quot;has not left himself without a witness of his existence
          and providence, in that he does good to all his creatures, and gives
          rain from Heaven, and fruitful seasons; filling men&#x27;s hearts with
          food and gladness&quot;; and continuing the certain and constant
          revolutions of &quot;summer and winter, seedtime and harvest&quot;; as
          well as night and day, cold and heat; all which have their peculiar
          usefulness and advantages to human life; and cannot be attributed to
          anything else than the superintendency of the divine Being.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as there is a provision made for the wants of men, so for their
          safety: were it not that God had put the fear of man upon the wild
          beasts of the field, and the dread of him in them, there would be no
          safety for him, especially in some parts of the world; and had he not
          put a natural instinct into them to avoid the habitations of men, and
          to resort to woods and deserts, and dwell in uninhabited places; to
          prowl about for their prey in the night, and in the morning return to
          their caves and dens, and lurking places; when men go forth to their
          work, they would be in the utmost danger of their lives: yes, were it
          not for the overruling providence of God, which governs the world, and
          restrains the lusts of men, &quot;one man would be a wolf to
          another&quot;; neither life nor property would be secure; but must
          fall a prey to the rapine and violence of powerful oppressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human laws, and civil magistracy, do something to restrain men, but
          not everything; notwithstanding these, we see what outrages are
          committed: and how greater still would be their number, was it not for
          the interposition of divine providence: and even it is owing to a
          divine Being that there are human forms of government, and political
          schemes framed, and laws made for the better regulation of mankind,
          and these continued; for it is by him &quot;kings reign, and princes
          decree justice&quot;: and particularly, was it not for a divine
          agency, such is the rage and malice of Satan, and his principalities
          and powers, whose numbers fill the surrounding air; and who go about
          our earth like roaring lions, seeking whom they may devour; were they
          not chained by almighty power, and limited by the providence of God,
          the whole race of men would be destroyed by them, at least the godly
          among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The fifth argument may be taken from the uncommon heroic actions,
          prodigies, wonders, and miraculous things done in the world; which
          cannot be thought to be done without a superior and divine influence.
          Heroic actions, such as that of Abraham, who, with three hundred
          household servants, pursued after, and engaged with four kings who had
          beaten five before, and recovered the goods they had taken away: of
          Shamgar, who fought with and killed six hundred Philistines with an ox
          goad: and of Samson, who slew a thousand of them with the jawbone of
          an donkey: of Jonathan, and his armor bearer, who attacked and took a
          garrison of the same people, and threw a whole army of theirs into a
          panic and confusion; who had been for some time a terror to the whole
          land of Israel: and of David, a stripling, fighting with and
          conquering Goliath, a monstrous giant.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are scripture instances; and if scripture is only regarded as a
          common history; these merit our notice and credit, as any of the
          relations in profane history; in which are recorded the magnanimous
          actions of heroes, kings, and generals of armies; their wonderful
          successes, and amazing conquests; as of the Babylonians, Persians,
          Grecians, and Romans; which made such strange revolutions and changes
          in kingdoms and states; all which can never be supposed to be done
          without superior power, and the overruling, influencing providence of
          the divine Being; who inspired men to do things beyond their natural
          skill and courage; prodigies, strange and wonderful events; for which
          no natural cause can be assigned; such as the strange sights seen in
          the air, and voices heard in the temple, before the destruction of
          Jerusalem; with other things, related by Josephus, and confirmed by
          Tacitus, an heathen historian; to which might be added many others,
          which histories abound with: but besides these, things really
          miraculous have been wrought, such as are not only out of, and beyond
          the course of nature, but contrary to it, and to the settled laws of
          it; such as the miracles of Moses and the prophets, and of Christ and
          his apostles; which are recorded in the scriptures; and others in
          human writings; which are so well attested as oblige us to give credit
          to them: now, though these were not done to prove a divine Being;
          which needs them not; yet they necessarily suppose one, by whose power
          alone they are performed.

          6. The sixth argument may be formed from the prophesies of contingent
          future events, and the exact fulfillment of them. This is what is
          challenged and required from heathen deities, to prove their right to
          such a character; as being what none but God can do: &quot;Let them
          bring forth and show us what shall happen: or declare us things for to
          come: show the things that are to come hereafter; that we may know
          that you are gods: which is what none but the true God can do, and has
          done; and which being done, proves there is a God, and one that is
          truly so; instances of which there are many in the sacred writings;
          prophesies which relate both to particular persons and to whole
          kingdoms and states; which have had their exact accomplishment: but
          not to insist on these, since those who are atheistically inclined,
          disbelieve the divine revelation; let it be observed, that the
          heathens have had their auguries, sooth-sayings, divinations, and
          oracles; by which pretensions have been made to foretell future
          events. That there is such a thing as divination, is said to be
          confirmed by the consent of all nations; and is explained of a
          presension and knowledge of future things: now this being granted, it
          may be reasoned upon, that if there is a foretelling of future things,
          which certainly come to pass, there must be a God; since none but an
          omniscient Being can, with certainty, foretell what shall come to
          pass, which does not depend on necessary causes; and cannot be
          foreseen by the quickest sight, and sharpest wit, and sagacity of a
          creature.

          7. The seventh argument may be urged from the fears of men, and the
          tortures of a guilty conscience, and the dread of a future state. Some
          are terribly frightened at thunder and lightning, as Caligula, the
          Roman Emperor, used to be; who, at such times, would hide himself in,
          or under his bed; and yet this man set himself up for a God. Now these
          fears and frights are not merely on account of the awful sound of the
          thunder, and the dreadful flashes of lightning; but because of the
          divine and tremendous Being who is supposed to send them: the Heathens
          were sensible that thunder is the voice of God, as the scriptures
          represent it, and therefore called their Jove, &quot;Jupiter
          tonans&quot;; &quot;the thundering Jupiter&quot;. Many have been so
          terrified in their consciences on account of sin, that they could get
          no rest, nor enjoy peace any where, or by any means: as Cain, under
          the terrors of an evil conscience, imagined that &quot;everyone that
          found him would slay him&quot;: and those wicked traitors, Catiline
          and Jugurtha: and those wicked emperors, those monsters in impiety,
          Tiberius and Nero, and especially the latter, who was so tortured in
          his conscience, as if he was continually haunted by his mother&#x27;s
          Spirit, and by furies with burning torches: and Hobbes, our English
          atheist, as he was reckoned, was accustomed to be very uneasy when
          alone in the dark: and Epicurus, the philosopher, though he taught men
          to despise death, and out brave it; yet, when he perceived that he
          himself was about to die, was most terribly frightened; and this has
          been the case of many others: bold and &quot;strong spirits&quot;, as
          atheistical persons love to be called, have been sometimes found to be
          very timorous and fearful.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, indeed, this is natural to all men, and which is proof of a
          superior Being. Thus a wild Greenlander argued, before he had
          knowledge of the true God: &quot;Man has an intelligent soul, is
          subject to no creature in the world; and yet man is afraid of the
          future state: who is it that he is afraid of there? That must be a
          great Spirit that has dominion over us, O did we but know him! O had
          we but him for our friend!&quot; Now what do all these fears and
          tortures of conscience arise from, but from the guilt of sin, and a
          sense of a divine Being; who is above men, and will call them to an
          account for their sins, and take vengeance on them? And, indeed, the
          eternal punishment that will be inflicted on them, will greatly lie in
          the tortures of their conscience, which is the worm that will never
          die; and, in a sense of divine wrath, which is that fire that will
          never be quenched.

          8. The eighth and last argument shall be taken from the judgments in
          the world; not only famine, sword, pestilence, earthquakes, etc, but
          such that have been inflicted on wicked men, atheistical persons,
          perjured ones, blasphemers, and the like. Not to take notice of the
          universal flood, which swept away a world of ungodly men; and of the
          burning of Sodom and Gomorrah, with other cities of the plain, by fire
          and brimstone from Heaven; which yet are abundantly confirmed by the
          testimonies of heathen writers; nor of the awful instances in the New
          Testament, of Herod being smitten by an angel, and eaten of worms, and
          died, while the people was shouting him as a God, and he assented to
          their flattery; and of Ananias and Sapphira, being struck dead for
          lying unto God: besides these, there are innumerable instances of
          judgments, of the same or a like kind, in all ages and countries,
          recorded in the histories of them; and in our nation, and in our age,
          and within our knowledge; and who now can hear or read such awful
          judgments, and disbelieve the Being of God?
