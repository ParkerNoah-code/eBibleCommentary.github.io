        <h2>Of the INFINITY of God, His OMNIPRESENCE and ETERNITY.</h2>
        <p>
          The next attribute of God to be considered is, his
          &quot;Infinity&quot;; when we say that God is &quot;infinite&quot;,
          the meaning is, that he is unbounded and unlimited, unmeasurable or
          immense, unsearchable and not to be comprehended. This attribute
          chiefly respects and includes the &quot;omnipresence&quot; and
          &quot;eternity&quot; of God; these are the two branches of it; he is
          not bounded by space, and therefore is everywhere; and he is not
          bounded by time, so he is eternal: and that he is in this sense
          infinite appears from his spirituality and simplicity, before
          established; he is not a body, consisting of parts; was he, he would
          be finite; for body, or matter, is a creature of time, and not
          eternal; and is limited to a certain place, and so not everywhere; but
          God is a Spirit: though this barely is not sufficient to prove him
          infinite; because there are finite spirits, as angels, and the souls
          of men; these are created spirits, and have a beginning, though they
          will have no end; which is owing not to themselves, but to the power
          of God, that supports them in their being; who could, if he would,
          annihilate them; and they are definitively in some place, and so, on
          all accounts, finite: but God is an uncreated Spirit; was before all
          time, so not bounded by it; and was before space or place were, and
          existed without it; and so not to be limited to it, and by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the &quot;first Being&quot;, and from whom all others have their
          being; &quot;Before him there was no God formed, neither shall there
          be after him; yes, he is the first and the last&quot; (Isaiah 43:10
          44:6) and therefore there is none before him nor above him, to limit
          and restrain him: he is an &quot;independent&quot; Being; all
          creatures depend on him, but he depends on none; all things are
          &quot;of&quot; him, &quot;through&quot; him, and &quot;to&quot; him,
          as the first cause and last end of them: all creatures live, and move,
          and have their being in him; but not he in them: men, angels, good and
          bad, are checked and limited by him; but not he by them. He is
          &quot;immutable&quot;; this attribute has been already established;
          but if he changes place, or is moved from place to place, or is
          sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another, he would be mutable:
          and if he rose from non-existence into existence, or there is any end
          of his days, he would not be unchangeable; but he is the
          &quot;same&quot;, and his &quot;years shall have no end&quot;:
          immutability infers both omnipresence and eternity, the two branches
          of Infinity. We commonly say that sin is infinite, and the truest
          reason that can be given for it is, because God is the object of it;
          for as an act, it is finite, being the act of a finite creature; but
          with respect to the object against whom it is committed, it is
          infinite, and requires an infinite satisfaction; which none but an
          infinite person can give, and which Christ is in his divine nature,
          and so gave to his sufferings and death, in his human nature united to
          him, an infinite value and virtue, whereby justice had from them an
          infinite satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is infinite in all his attributes; and which are indeed, himself,
          his nature; as has been observed, and are separately considered by us,
          as a relief to our mind, and helps to our better understanding it;
          and, perhaps, by observing some of these distinctly, we may have a
          clearer idea of the infinity of God. His &quot;understanding&quot; is
          infinite, as is expressly said (Psalm 147:5), it reaches to, and
          comprehends all things that are, though ever so numerous; to the
          innumerable company of angels in the highest heavens; to the
          innumerable stars in the lower ones; to the innumerable inhabitants of
          the earth, men, and beasts, and bird; and to the innumerable creatures
          that swim in the sea; yes, not only to all that are in being, but to
          all things possible to be made, which God could have made if he would;
          these he sees and knows in his eternal mind, so that there is &quot;no
          searching of his understanding&quot; (Isaiah 40:28), there is no end
          of it, and therefore infinite. The same may be said of his knowledge
          and wisdom, there is a bayov, a &quot;depth&quot;, the apostle
          ascribes, to both; and which is not to be sounded by mortals (Romans
          11:33), he is &quot;a God of knowledge&quot; or
          &quot;knowledges&quot;, of all things that are knowable (1 Samuel
          2:3), he is the only and the all-wise God; and in comparison of him
          the wisdom of the wisest of creatures, the angels, is but folly (Job
          4:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of God is infinite; with him nothing is impossible; his
          power has never been exerted to the uttermost; he who has made one
          world, could have made millions; there is no end of his power, and his
          making of that, proves his &quot;eternal power&quot;, that is, his
          infinite power; for nothing but infinite power could ever have made a
          world out of nothing (Romans 1:20; Hebrews 11:3). His
          &quot;goodness&quot; is infinite, he is abundant in it, the earth is
          full of it, all creatures partake of it, and it endures continually;
          though there has been such a vast profusion of it from the beginning
          of the world, in all ages, it still abounds: there is no end of it, it
          is infinite, it is boundless; nor can there be any addition to it; it
          is infinitely perfect, &quot;my goodness extends not to you&quot;
          (Psalm 16:2). God is infinite in his &quot;purity, holiness, and
          justice&quot;: there is none holy as he is; or pure and righteous,
          with him; in comparison of him, the most holy creatures are impure,
          and cover themselves before him (Job 4:17,18; Isaiah 6:2, 3), in
          short, he is infinitely perfect, and infinitely blessed and happy. We
          rightly give him titles and epithets of &quot;immense&quot; and
          &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, which belong to his infinity. He is
          &quot;immense&quot;, that is, unmeasurable; he measures all things,
          but is measured by none; who can take his dimensions? they are
          &quot;as high as Heaven, what can you do? deeper than Hell, what can
          you know?&quot; If the heavens above cannot be measured, and the
          foundations of the earth beneath cannot be searched out, how should he
          be measured or searched out to perfection that made all these? (Job
          11:7-9; Jeremiah 31:37).
        </p>
        <p>
          As there is an height, a depth, a length and breadth in the love of
          God, immeasurable (Ephesians 3:18), so there is in every attribute of
          God, and consequently in his nature; his immensity is his magnitude,
          and of his &quot;greatness&quot; it is said, that it is
          &quot;unsearchable&quot; (Psalm 145:3), and therefore, upon the whole,
          must be &quot;incomprehensible&quot;; not only cannot be comprehended
          and circumscribed by space, or in place, &quot;for the Heaven of
          heavens cannot contain&quot; him; but he is not to be comprehended by
          finite minds, that cannot conceive of him as he is; his omniscience is
          &quot;too wonderful&quot; for them, and &quot;the thunder of his power
          who can understand?&quot; Somewhat of him may be apprehended, but his
          nature and essence can never be comprehended, no not in a state of
          perfection; sooner may all the waters of the ocean be put into a
          nutshell, than that the infinite Being of God should be comprehended
          by angels or men, who are finite creatures; infinity is an attribute
          peculiar to God, and, as has been observed, its two chief branches are
          &quot;omnipresence&quot; and &quot;eternity&quot;; which will be next
          considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The &quot;Omnipresence&quot; of God, or his ubiquity, which, as it
          is included in his infinity, is a branch of it, and strictly connected
          with it, it must, be strongly concluded from it; for if God is
          infinite, that is, unbounded with respect to space and place, then he
          must be everywhere; and this is to be proved from his power, which is
          everywhere: as appears, not only in the creation of all things, as the
          Heaven, and the Heaven of heavens, the earth, and the ends of them,
          and all that is in them; but in his providence, supporting and
          sustaining them; for not only the creatures have their being in him,
          and from him, and therefore he must be near them; but &quot;he upholds
          all things by his power&quot;, they consist in him, he provides for
          them, and preserves them all; and which is the argument the apostle
          uses to prove that he is not far from them (Acts 17:27, 28). The
          omnipresence of God may be argued from the distributions of his
          goodness to all; to angels and glorified saints, who partake of his
          special favors; to all men on earth, to whom he does not leave himself
          without a witness of his kindness to them, giving them food and
          clothing, and all things richly to enjoy; he is present among them,
          and opens his hand and plentifully and liberally communicates to them:
          as well as from his universal government of the world by his wisdom;
          for his kingdom rules over all, the kingdom of nature and providence
          is his, and &quot;he is the Governor among the nations&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as he is everywhere by his power and providence, so he is by his
          knowledge; all things are naked and open to him, being all before him,
          and he present with them; though he is in the highest Heaven, he can
          see and judge through the dark clouds, and behold all the inhabitants
          of the world, and their actions: and since these attributes of power,
          wisdom, and knowledge, are no other than his nature, or than himself,
          he must be everywhere by his essence; and which is most clear from the
          omnipresence of the divine nature in Christ, who, as a divine person,
          was in Heaven, when he, as man, was here on earth (John 1:18 3:13),
          and, indeed, unless he was omnipresent, he could not be in whatever
          place two or three are gathered together in his name, or be in the
          midst of the candlesticks, the churches, or with his ministers, to the
          end of the world (Matthew 18:20, 28:20), for though this is to be
          understood of his gracious presence, yet unless he was omnipresent,
          this could not be given to all the saints, and all the churches, in
          all ages, at different places, at the same time; as when they are
          worshiping in different parts of the world; as in Europe, so in
          America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if God, personally considered, or in anyone of the divine Persons,
          is omnipresent, then God, essentially considered, must be so. The
          presence of God may be observed in a different manner; there is his
          glorious presence in Heaven, where he, in a most eminent manner,
          displays the glory of his majesty to angels, and the spirits of just
          men made perfect; and there is his powerful and providential presence
          with all his creatures, giving them being, and supporting them in it;
          and there is his gracious presence with good men, regenerating,
          sanctifying, comforting, and refreshing them; dwelling in them,
          carrying on his work of grace in them, to fit them for himself in
          glory; and all suppose his omnipresence: the heathens acknowledge this
          attribute; Anaxagoras calls him an infinite mind; and Pythagoras
          defines him, a mind that is diffused throughout all the parts of the
          world, and goes through all nature; and Sallustius observes, that he
          is not contained or comprehended in place. So the Jews say the
          Shecinah, or divine Majesty, is everywhere; and they call God Mwqm,
          &quot;place&quot;, by an antiphrasis, as Buxtorf observes, because he
          is not local, who is not contained in any place, but gives place to
          all; and so the Jews themselves say[7], that he is the place of the
          world, but not the world his place, for he is without the world, and
          fills all worlds; and they further say, he is so called because in
          every place where the righteous are, he is with them; or as Aben Ezra,
          expresses it, because every place is full of his glory; agreeable to
          which Philo, the Jew, says, autov eautw topov he is place, full and
          sufficient to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This attribute is most clearly expressed in several passages of
          Scripture, as particularly in Psalm 139:7-10 where the Psalmist asks,
          &quot;Where shall l go from your Spirit?&quot; which, if it is to be
          understood of the third Person, the Spirit of the Father, and of the
          Son; if there is no going from him, then not from them, since the same
          nature is in the one as in the other; if there is no going from God,
          personally considered, or as in any of the divine Persons, then not
          from him, as essentially considered: or by his Spirit may be meant
          himself, for &quot;God is a Spirit&quot; (John 4:24). He adds,
          &quot;Or where shall I flee from your presence?&quot; not his gracious
          presence, for a good man would never seek to flee from that, nothing
          being more desirable to him; nor is there anything he more earnestly
          deprecates than to be cast away from it (Psalm 4:6, 7, 51:11), but his
          essential presence, which is everywhere; it is in the Hebrew text
          &quot;from your face&quot;; and face signifies the essence and nature
          of God, which is invisible and incomprehensible (Exodus 33:20), then
          the Psalmist goes on to enumerate all places that could be thought of
          to flee to, and yet God was there; &quot;If I ascend to Heaven, you
          are there&quot;: could he by any means climb up to Heaven, there God
          is in all the glory of his Majesty; there is his palace, his
          habitation, and his throne. &quot;If I make my bed in Hell, behold you
          are there&quot;: whether the place where the wicked are turned, and
          the apostate angels cast; there God is sustaining them in their being,
          pouring in his wrath into their consciences, and continuing the
          punishment inflicted on them: or whether the grave is meant, which is
          sometimes the sense of the word used, and is a bed to saints (Job
          17:13), there God is watching over their dust, preserving it from
          being lost, in order to raise it up at the last day.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;If I take the wings of the morning&quot;, and fly as fast as the
          morning light, which soon reaches the furthest parts of the earth; or
          as the rays of the sun, which dart from east to west, at its rising,
          instantly; &quot;and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea&quot;; in
          the most remote islands of it, or in the uttermost parts of the
          western shore; &quot;even there shall your hand lead me, and your
          right hand shall hold me&quot;: there should he experience the
          providential goodness and special favor of God to him; who leads,
          guides, and upholds his people at the ends of the earth, where some of
          them sometimes are, and where they have his presence (Isaiah 45:22,
          24:16), see a like enumeration of places in Amos 9:2, 3. Another
          passage of scripture, proving the Omnipresence of God, is in Isaiah
          66:1. &quot;Thus says the Lord, the Heaven is my throne, and the earth
          is my footstool&quot;. So immense is he who he sits upon the one, and
          treads on the other: &quot;Where is the house that you build unto
          me?&quot; or where can a house be built for him? what place can be
          found for him he is not possessed of, and does not dwell in already?
          Stephen, the proto-martyr, produces this to prove, &quot;that the most
          High dwells not in temples made with hands; that is, cannot be
          included in them, and limited to them, since he is everywhere, in
          Heaven and in earth (Acts 7:47-50). But nowhere is the Omnipresence of
          God more expressly declared than in Jeremiah 23:23, 24, &quot;Am I a
          God at hand, says the Lord, and not afar off?&quot; yes, he is both;
          he not only observes persons and things in Heaven, which may be
          thought at hand, and near him; but persons and things on earth, and
          those at the greatest distance; he is as near to, and as present with
          the one as the other; and he sees and knows all that is done by them,
          as if he was at their elbow; and therefore adds, &quot;Can any hide
          himself in secret places, that I shall not see him, says the
          Lord?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          As some might foolishly imagine, supposing him to be limited and
          confined to Heaven above, and was not present to see what was done
          below; especially in the dark and distant places of the earth:
          &quot;Do not I fill Heaven and earth, says the Lord?&quot; not only
          with inhabitants, and with all things, the effects of his power and
          goodness; but with his nature and essence, which exceeds all bounds of
          place and space. Hence the Jews call God by the name of
          &quot;Makom&quot;, place; because he fills all places, and is
          contained in none; is not local and is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this to be disproved by other passages of Scripture, which may
          seem, at first sight, to discountenance or contradict it; not such as
          speak of men&#x27;s departing and fleeing from his presence, as Cain
          and Jonah are said to do (Genesis 4:16; John 1:3), for Cain only went
          either from the place where he and the Lord had been conversing; or
          from the public place of worship, at the east of the garden of Eden,
          where were the symbol of the divine presence, an altar, where he and
          his brother had sacrificed. Jonah&#x27;s fleeing, was withdrawing
          himself from the service of God, and declining to go on his errand;
          foolishly imagining, that, by going beyond sea, he should avoid being
          urged to his duty; but he soon found his mistake, and that God was
          everywhere, and could meet with him by sea and by land. Likewise, not
          such that represent God as descending from Heaven; as at the building
          of Babel, at the cry of the sin of Sodom, and on mount Sinai (Genesis
          11:5, 7, 18:21; Exodus 19:18, 20), for these only denote some more
          than ordinary manifestations of his presence, or exertion of his
          power; as at Babel, by confounding the language; at Sodom, by
          destroying that, and the other cities; at Sinai, by giving the law out
          of the midst of fire, attended with thunder and lightning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor such as speak of the Lord not being with wicked men; particularly
          what Moses said to the disobedient Israelites, &quot;The Lord is not
          among you; and he will not be with you&quot; (Numbers 14:42, 43) which
          he might very truly say, since the ark of the covenant, the symbol of
          the divine presence, remained in the camps and went not with them
          (Numbers 14:44), nor had they any reason to believe that God would be
          so with them, as to prosper and succeed them, when they acted contrary
          to his express command: nor is God ever in such sense with wicked men,
          as with good men; namely, by his gracious presence: but this hinders
          not, but that he is with them by his omnipresence and power,
          supporting them in their being. Nor such passages which relate the
          departure of God from men; as from Samson and Saul (Judges 16:20; 1
          Samuel 28:15), since this only respects the withdrawment of uncommon
          bodily strength from the one; and wisdom and prudence, courage and
          greatness of soul from the other; leaving him to the fears,
          distractions, and confusions of his mind; without any hope of success
          in war: nor such portions of Scripture which express the desertions
          and distance of God from his people, and their desires that he would
          return to them, and not cast them away from his presence (Psalm 10:1,
          80:14, 51:11), since these only respect his gracious presence, the
          deprivation of that, and the return of it; the manifestations of his
          love and favor, and the withdrawment and renewal of them. And whereas
          it is urged against the omnipresence of God, that he is said to be in
          Heaven, and that to be his habitation, and that men pray unto him as
          their Father in Heaven (Psalm 115:3; Isaiah 63:15; Matthew 5:9). In
          what peculiar sense God may be said to be in Heaven, has been observed
          already; nor is he ever said to be in Heaven &quot;only&quot;, but in
          many places to be on earth also, and elsewhere (see Deuteronomy 4:39;
          Isaiah 66:1); though he is not contained in any place, as not on the
          earth, so neither can the Heaven of heavens contain him (1 King 8:27),
          he was before there was any space or place; his nature, and so this
          attribute of omnipresence, were the same then as now: and should it be
          asked, Where did he dwell then? I answer, In himself, in his own
          immensity and eternity (see Isaiah 57:15).
        </p>
        <p>
          The objection from the pollution of the divine Being, through sordid
          and filthy places, in which he must be if omnipresent, scarce deserves
          any regard; since bodies only touch them and are capable of being
          defiled by them; not spirits, even created ones, as angels, and the
          souls of men; as the angel in the filthy den of lions where Daniel
          was, was not; nor the souls of men that are in filthy bodies; much
          less God a pure, infinite, and uncreated Spirit, who can no more be
          affected by such means, than the sun is, by its rays striking on a
          dunghill.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The &quot;Eternity&quot; of God belongs to his infinity; for as he
          is not bounded by space, so neither by time, and therefore eternal. He
          is often called &quot;the everlasting God&quot;, and the &quot;King
          eternal&quot; (Genesis 21:33; Deuteronomy 33:27; Isaiah 40:28;
          Jeremiah 10:10; Romans 16:26; 1 Timothy 1:17), yes, eternity itself (1
          Samuel 15:29), and is said to inhabit it (Isaiah 57:15). These words,
          &quot;eternal, everlasting&quot;, and &quot;forever&quot;, are
          sometimes used in an improper sense, as of things which are of a long
          duration, but limited, and have both a beginning and an end; as the
          everlasting possession of the land of Canaan, granted in the
          everlasting covenant of circumcision, and yet both are now at an end
          (Genesis 17:7, 8) the rites and ceremonies of the law of Moses are
          said to be ordinances and statutes forever; and yet they were designed
          to continue but for a time, and have been long since abolished
          (Numbers 10:8, 15:15, 18:8,11,19, 23), the temple built by Solomon is
          said to be a settled place for God to abide in forever; yes, he
          himself says, that he would put his name in it forever; and it should
          be his rest forever; and yet it has been demolished long ago (1 King
          8:13, 9:3; Psalm 132:14), the thrones of David and Solomon are said to
          be established forever, and yet, if taken in a literal sense, they are
          no more: indeed, if understood spiritually, as David&#x27;s Son and
          Antitype, his throne will be forever and ever (2 Samuel 7:12,16), the
          earth is said to abide, and not be removed for ever (Psalm 104:5;
          Ecclesiastes 1:4), yet both that and the heavens shall perish, though
          not as to substance, yet as to quality, form, figure, and present use.
          Sometimes this phrase &quot;forever&quot;, only respects the year of
          jubilee (Exodus 21:6), and, at most, but during life (1 Samuel 1:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some creatures and things are said to be everlasting, and even
          eternal, which have a beginning, though they have no end; and this is
          what the schools call &quot;aeviternity&quot;, as distinct from
          eternity: thus angels, and the souls of men, being creatures of God,
          have a beginning; though, being immaterial and immortal, shall never
          die. The happiness of the saints is called eternal glory,
          &quot;eternal weight of glory; eternal life; an eternal inheritance;
          an house eternal in the heavens&quot; (1 Peter 5:10; Titus 1:2; 2
          Corinthians 4:17, 5:1; Hebrews 9:15). And the misery of the wicked is
          signified by suffering the vengeance of eternal fire, by everlasting
          fire, and everlasting punishment, (Jude 1:7; Matthew 25:41, 46), yet
          these have a beginning, though they will have no end; and so are
          improperly called eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eternity, properly so called, is that which is without beginning and
          end, and is without succession, or does not proceed in a succession of
          moments one after another; and is opposed to time, which has a
          beginning, goes on in a succession, and has an end: it is the measure
          of a creature&#x27;s duration, and began when creatures began to be,
          and not before, and is proper to them, and not eternity, which only
          belongs to God. Thales being asked what God was, answered thus, what
          has neither beginning nor end, which is eternity. A Jewish writer
          defines it, &quot;in which there is no former nor latter; nor order,
          nor succession of times; it being without motion&quot;. And which
          Boetius expresses in a few words, &quot;Eternity is the interminable
          or unbounded and perfect possession of life whole
          together.&#x27;&#x27; And is thus described, &quot;Before the
          mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the
          world, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God&quot; (Psalm
          90:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          Eternity, in this sense, is peculiar to God; as he only has
          immortality, so he only has eternity; which must be understood not of
          the Father, or first person only, but of the Son and Spirit also; who
          are, with the Father, the one God; and possess the same undivided
          nature; of which Eternity is an attribute. So the Son, though as to
          his human nature, was born in the fullness of time; yet, as to his
          divine nature, &quot;his goings forth were from of old, from
          everlasting&quot;: and as Mediator, in his office capacity, he was
          &quot;set up from everlasting, or ever the earth was&quot; (Mic. 5:2;
          Proverbs 8:23, 24). The Spirit of God was concerned in the creation of
          the heavens and the earth, and so must be before them; and which is
          the only idea we have of eternity, that it is before time and
          creatures were (Genesis 1:1, 2; Job 26:13; Psalm 33:6), and, according
          to some, the Spirit is called, &quot;the eternal Spirit&quot; (Hebrews
          9:14). Eternity is true of God, essentially considered, and in the
          sense explained, is to be proved, and that he is without beginning,
          without end, and without succession.
        </p>
        <p>
          2a. First, That he is without beginning, or from everlasting: this is
          put by way of interrogation (Habakkuk 1:12), not as a matter of doubt,
          but of certainty, and is strongly affirmed (Psalm 93:2), and may be
          proved,
        </p>
        <p>
          2a1. From his nature and being; as from his &quot;necessary
          self-existence&quot;: the existence of God is not arbitrary, but
          necessary: if arbitrary, it must be from his own will, or from the
          will of another; not from his own will, which would suppose him in
          being already; and then he must be before he existed, and must be, and
          not be, at the same instant; which are such contradictions as cannot
          be endured: not from the will of another, for then that other would be
          both prior and superior to him, and so be God, and not he: it remains,
          therefore, that he necessarily existed; and if so, then he must be
          eternal; since there was none before him; nor can any reason be given
          why he should necessarily exist at such an instant, and not before.
          His eternity may be argued from a state of &quot;non-existence&quot;
          he must have been in, if not eternal; and if so, then there was an
          instant in which he was not; and if there was an instant in which he
          was not, then there was an instant in which there was no God; and if
          so, there may be one again in which he may cease to be; for that which
          once was not, may again not be; and this will bring us into the depth
          of atheism; unless it could be supposed, which is quite irrational,
          that there was a God before him, and that there will be one after him;
          but this is strongly denied by himself; &quot;Before me there was no
          God formed; neither shall there be after me&quot; (Isaiah 43:10). The
          eternity of God may be inferred from his immutability, which has been
          already established: these two go together, and prove each other
          (Psalm 102:27), they are both to be observed in the great name of God,
          Jehovah, which signifies, he is, and was, and is to come, and takes in
          all time; but he is bounded by none, and is eternally the same; for if
          he is not eternal, he must have passed from non-existence into being;
          and what can be a greater change, than to come out of nothing into
          being?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, God is the most &quot;perfect Being&quot;; which he would
          not be, if not eternal; for not to be, or to have a beginning, is an
          imperfection; and it is an humbling consideration to man, a creature
          of time, that he is but &quot;of yesterday&quot; (Job 8:9). And if God
          was not eternal, let his beginning be when it may, in comparison of an
          eternity past, it would be but as yesterday; which can never be
          admitted of. Add to this, that God is the &quot;first Cause&quot; of
          all things, and therefore must be eternal: all wise and thoughtful men
          acknowledge a first Cause; and in their reasoning rise from one cause
          to another, until they arrive to a first Cause, and there stop, and
          which they truly call God; for otherwise there would be no
          subordination of causes: if there was not a first Cause, there would
          not be a second, nor a third, etc. but all would be first, and all
          eternal; and if God is the first Cause, then he is without a cause,
          and therefore must be eternal; hence he is so often called &quot;the
          first and the last&quot;; a phrase expressive of his eternity (Isaiah
          41:4, 44:6, 48:12). He is the &quot;Creator&quot; of all things, the
          heavens, earth, and sea, and all that in them are; and therefore must
          be before all things, as every artificer is before his work made by
          him; and if before all creatures, then before time, which begins with
          them, and therefore from eternity, since we can conceive of nothing
          before time but eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          2a2. The Eternity of God may be proved from his
          &quot;attributes&quot;, several of which are said to be eternal, or
          from everlasting: the &quot;power&quot; of God is expressly called his
          &quot;eternal power&quot;; and is proved to be so by the works of
          creation, to which it must be prior (Romans 1:20). The knowledge God
          has of all things is from eternity; though the things known are in
          time, his knowledge of them is before time; &quot;Known unto God are
          all his works from the beginning of the world&quot;, ap&#x27; aiwnov,
          from eternity (Acts 15:18). The &quot;mercy&quot; of God is eternal,
          it is said to be &quot;from everlasting to everlasting&quot; (Psalm
          103:17). And so the &quot;love&quot; of God, which is no other than
          himself, for &quot;God is love&quot; (1 John 4:16), his love to his
          Son, &quot;the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
          person&quot;, was from everlasting; before the earth, the hills, and
          mountains were formed, then was he by him, &quot;as one brought up
          with him&quot;, his darling and delight (Proverbs 8:30), our Lord
          himself says, his Father loved him before the foundation of the world
          (John 17:24), and as early did he love his elect in him; for he loved
          them as he loved him (John 17:23), even with an everlasting love, a
          love which is both from everlasting and to everlasting (Jeremiah
          31:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          2a3. That God is Eternal, may be argued from his purposes, counsels,
          and decrees; which are said to be &quot;of old&quot;, that is, from
          everlasting (Isaiah 25:1), this is true of them in general; for no new
          purposes and resolutions rise up, or are framed by him in his mind;
          for then there would be something in him which was not before; which
          would imply mutability. Besides, they are expressly said to be
          &quot;eternal&quot; (Ephesians 3:11), and if they are eternal, then
          God, in whom they are, and by whom they are formed, must be eternal
          also. In particular, the purpose of God, according to election, or his
          choice of men to everlasting life, is eternal; not only was before men
          had done any good or evil (Romans 9:11), but they were chosen by him
          &quot;from the beginning&quot; (2 Thessalonians 2:13), not from the
          beginning of the gospel coming to them, nor of their faith and
          conversion by it; but from the beginning of time, and before time,
          even &quot;before the foundation of the world&quot;, as is in so many
          words expressed (Ephesians 1:4), wherefore God, that chose them to
          salvation, must be eternal. Christ is eminently called the elect of
          God, being as Man and Mediator, chosen out from among the people
          (Isaiah 42:1; Ps 89:19), and the appointment of him, to be the
          Redeemer and Savior of men, or the preordination of him to be the Lamb
          slain for the redemption of his people, was before the foundation of
          the world (1 Peter 1:20), and therefore God, that foreordained him
          thereunto, must be as early.
        </p>
        <p>
          2a4. The Eternity of God may be concluded from the covenant of grace,
          styled an &quot;everlasting covenant&quot; (2 Samuel 23:5), not only
          because it will endure immoveable and unalterable forever, but because
          it was from everlasting; for though it is sometimes called a new
          covenant, yet not because newly made, or only newly manifested; but
          because it is always new, and never waxes old. Christ, the Mediator of
          it, and with whom it was made, was set up from everlasting as such;
          and his goings forth in it, representing his people, and acting for
          them, were from of old, from everlasting (Proverbs 8:22, 23; Micah
          5:2), and he had a glory with God in it before the world began (John
          17:5), there were blessings of goodness laid up in it, and with which
          Christ, the Mediator of it, was anticipated; yes, the people of God
          were blessed with these spiritual blessings in Christ, as &quot;they
          were chosen in him before the foundation of the world; and had grace
          given them in him before the world began&quot; (Ephesians 1:3, 4; 2
          Timothy 1:9). Promises also were made as early to Christ, and to them
          in him, into whose hands they were put, and in whom they are, yes and
          amen; particularly, eternal life was promised by God, that cannot lie,
          before the world was (Titus 1:2). Now if there was a covenant made by
          God from everlasting, and Christ was set up by him so early, as the
          Mediator of it; and there were blessings of grace, and promises of
          grace, made by him before time was, then he must be from everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          2a5. It may be proved from the works of God in time: all creatures are
          the works of his hands; all beings have their being from him; and time
          beginning with them, he who made them must be before all time, and
          therefore eternal: this is the argument used to prove the eternity of
          Christ, the Word, that he was in the beginning, that is, from eternity
          with God; &quot;because all things were made by him, and that he is
          the firstborn of every creature, and before all things, because all
          things are created by him, and by him do all things consist&quot;
          (John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:15-17), and the same proves the eternity of
          God; for all things are from him, and so have a beginning; but he from
          whom they are, is from none, has no cause of his being, and therefore
          must be eternal. So creation is made a proof of his eternal power and
          Godhead (Romans 1:20), creation proves his eternity, and his eternity
          proves his deity. Hence Thales said, &quot;The most ancient of Beings
          is God.&quot; 2b. Secondly, That God is to everlasting, and without
          end, may be proved from his &quot;spirituality&quot; and
          &quot;simplicity&quot;, already established; what is mixed and
          compounded, and consists of parts, may be resolved into them again,
          and so be dissolved, as bodies may; but spirits, such as angels and
          the souls of men, being immaterial, are immortal, and continue
          forever; and God being a Spirit, an infinite and uncreated one,
          simple, and uncompounded of parts, must much more be so; and therefore
          is called, &quot;The incorruptible God&quot; (Romans 1:23).
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be argued from his &quot;independency&quot;, he is
          self-existent; the first Cause, and without any cause; he is the only
          Potentate, &quot;God over all, blessed forever&quot;, and dependant on
          none; there is none above him, nor superior to him, that can put an
          end, to his being; nor can it be thought, he being in such a state of
          infinite happiness, would ever put an end to it himself. His eternity
          is to be proved from his &quot;immutability&quot;; for those, as
          before observed, infer one another. God is immutable, and therefore
          without end; for what can be a greater change than for a being not to
          be? Hence God is opposed to creatures, to mortal men, whose flesh is
          as grass, the most changeable and perishing of anything, and even to
          the Heaven and the earth, they being such; but he is unchangeably the
          same; and so there is no end of his years (1 Peter 1:24, 25; Psalm
          102:26, 27). This may be inferred from his &quot;dominion&quot; and
          government; he is, and sits King forever; he is an everlasting King,
          his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from
          generation to generation, and will never end (Jeremiah 10:10; Psalm
          10:16, 29:10; Daniel 4:3), and therefore he himself must be to
          everlasting. Moreover, he is not only called the living God (Jeremiah
          10:10), but is often said to &quot;live forever and ever&quot;
          (Revelation 4:9,10, 10:6). Hence his purposes and decrees are never
          frustrated, because he ever lives to bring them into execution: men
          take up resolutions, and form schemes, which, by reason of death, are
          never executed; their purposes are broken, and their thoughts perish;
          but &quot;the counsel of the Lord stands forever; and the thoughts of
          his heart to all generations&quot; (Psalm 33:11), and therefore he
          himself must endure forever: his promises are all fulfilled; not only
          because he is able and faithful to perform, but because he continues
          forever to make them good; and therefore is said to &quot;keep truth
          forever&quot; (Psalm 146:6). His covenant is firm and sure; more
          immoveable than rocks and mountains; it stands fast, with Christ,
          forever, and God commands it forever; because he ever lives to keep
          it. His love is to everlasting, as well as from it; he rests in it;
          nothing can separate from it; and &quot;with everlasting kindness he
          gathers his people, and has mercy on them&quot;; and therefore must be
          for ever: his grace, mercy, and goodness, continually endure, and
          therefore he himself must; and &quot;he will be the portion of his
          people forever&quot;; their everlasting ALL in ALL; and they shall
          reign and dwell with him for evermore. All which proves him to be
          without end.

          2c. Thirdly, The Eternity of God, or his being from everlasting to
          everlasting, is without succession, or any distinctions of time
          succeeding one another, as moments, minutes, hours, days, months, and
          years: the reasons are, because he existed before such were in being;
          &quot;Before the day was, I am he&quot; (Isaiah 43:13), before there
          was a day, before the first day of the creation, before there were any
          days, consisting of so many hours, and these of so many minutes; and
          if his eternity past, may it be so called, was without successive
          duration, or without succeeding moments, and other distinctions of
          time, why not his duration through time, and to all eternity, in the
          same manner? Should it be said, that days and years are ascribed to
          God; it is true, they are; but it is in accommodation and
          condescension to our weak minds, which are not capable of conceiving
          of duration but as successive: and besides, those days and years
          ascribed to God are expressly said not to be as ours (Job 10:5). He
          is, indeed, called, &quot;The Ancient of Days&quot; (Daniel 7:13), not
          ancient &quot;in&quot; days, or &quot;through&quot; them, as aged
          persons are said to be in years, and well stricken in them; not so
          God: the meaning is, that he is more ancient than days; he was before
          all days, and his duration is not to be measured by them. And it may
          be observed, that the differences and distinctions of time are
          together ascribed to God, and not as succeeding one another; he is
          &quot;the same yesterday, today, and forever&quot;; these are all at
          once, and together with him; he is he &quot;which is, and was, and is
          to come&quot; (Hebrews 13:8; Revelation 1:4), these meet together in
          his name, Jehovah; and so in his nature; he co-exists, with all the
          points of time, in time; but is unmoved and unaffected with any, as a
          rock in the rolling waves of the sea, or a tower in a torrent of
          gliding water; or as the rod or pin of a sundial, which has all the
          hours of the day surrounding it, and the sun, by it casts a shade upon
          them, points at and distinguishes them, but the stile stands firm and
          unmoved, and not affected thereby: hence it is that &quot;one day is
          with the Lord as a thousand years; and a thousand years as one
          day&quot; (2 Peter 3:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          But if his duration was successive, or proceeded by succeeding
          moments, days, and years; one day would be but one day with him, and
          not a thousand; and a thousand days would answer to a thousand days,
          and not be as one only. Besides, if his duration was measured by a
          succession of moments, etc. then he would not be &quot;immense,
          immutable&quot;, and &quot;perfect&quot;, as he is: not
          &quot;immense&quot;, or unmeasurable, if to be measured by minutes,
          hours, days, months, and years; whereas, as he is not to be measured
          by space, so not by time: nor &quot;immutable&quot;; since he would be
          one minute what he was not before, even older, which cannot be said of
          God; for as a Jewish writer well observes, it cannot be said of him,
          that he is older now than he was in the days of David, or when the
          world was created; for he is always, both before the world was made,
          and after it will cease to be; times make no change in him. Nor
          &quot;perfect&quot;; for if his duration was successive, there would
          be every moment something past and gone, lost and irrecoverable; and
          something to come not yet arrived to and obtained; and in other
          respects he must be imperfect: the &quot;knowledge&quot; of God proves
          him without successive duration. God knows all things, past, present,
          and to come, that is, which are so to us; not that they are so to him;
          these he knows at once, and all together, not one thing after another,
          as they successively come into being; all things are open and manifest
          to him at once and together, not only what are past and present, but
          he calls things that are not yet, as though they were; he sees and
          knows all in one view, in his all-comprehending mind: and as his
          knowledge is not successive, so not his duration. Moreover, in
          successive duration, there is an order of former and latter; there
          must be a beginning from whence every flux of time, every distinction
          proceeds; every moment and minute has a beginning, from whence it is
          reckoned, so every hour, day, month, and year: but as it is said of
          Christ, with respect to his divine nature, so it is true of God,
          essentially considered, that he has &quot;neither beginning of days,
          nor end of life&quot; (Hebrews 7:3). In short, God is Eternity itself,
          and inhabits eternity; so he did before time, and without succession;
          so he does throughout time; and so he will to all eternity. The very
          heathens themselves had a notion of their supreme God, as eternal: and
          this is the definition Thales gave of God; for being asked, What is
          God? answered, What has neither beginning nor end; and therefore calls
          him, the most Ancient. Sallustius denied that the nature of God was
          made, because it always was.
