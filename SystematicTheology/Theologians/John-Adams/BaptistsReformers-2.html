          "Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians,

            examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was

        <p>
          Infidelity and error have always delighted to taunt the disciples of
          Christ and the friends of truth with ignorant credulity, and the
          reception of unfounded and absurd dogmas, without due forethought and
          investigation. They have arrogated to themselves all the freedom of
          thought and independence of mind there is in the world, and profess to
          have calmly investigated the truths which they reject. The
          <i>taunt </i>on the one hand, and the <i>assumption </i>on the other,
          are both false; for it is a significant fact, that a pure Christianity
          has advanced just in proportion as the right of free and independent
          investigation has been enjoyed and exercised. Moreover, it is the
          glory of Christianity, that it courts the test of candid examination,
          and commends such a course whenever adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a striking illustration of this in the text and its
          connection. The apostle Paul, having been driven from Thessalonica by
          an infuriated mob, excited to deeds of violence by bigoted and
          interested partisans, fled to Berea. Here he pursued a course similar
          to that which he had adopted in Thessalonica. He entered the Jewish
          synagogue and taught in the name of Jesus. The community in this place
          was composed of men of more independent minds, and nobler spirit than
          the Thessalonians; and, consequently, they gave the apostle a far
          different reception from that which he experienced in their city.
          <i
            >They were not afraid to discuss, examine, and fairly investigate
            the new doctrine which he introduced to them</i
          >, and after bringing it to the proper test, to let it stand or fall
          on its own merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conduct was truly noble; and as such, it is endorsed by the Holy
          Spirit in the inspired words of the text: "Now the Bereans were of
          more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the
          message with great eagerness and
          <i
            >examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was
            true</i
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the apostle appeared among them as a reformer, they did not
          consider him an intruder, or treat him as an revolutionist; but they
          acted like rational, intelligent beings; they acted like men; they
          acted as all should act under like circumstances. Our theme on the
          present occasion will be, "The Reception That Should Be Given to the
          Religious Reformer."
        </p>
        <p>
          In illustrating this theme, I shall invite your attention to the
          conduct of the Bereans, and their treatment of Paul and Silas, as the
          divinely approved example. This example will appear to better
          advantage, if we follow the phraseology of the text, and notice,
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#0000ff"><b>1. the Comparison Instituted.</b></font> "Now
          the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians." The
          Thessalonian Jews had exhibited a spirit of gross intolerance. They
          were destitute of that spirit which truly ennobles man. They had power
          and influence, and they used these to crush the weak. They were filled
          with envy and jealousy, and they gave vent to their feelings in acts
          of violence and oppression. Refusing to be convinced themselves, they
          determined to prevent all others from being convinced. They appealed
          to passion, and prejudice, rather than to judgment and reason. They
          made old opinions, and popular usages, the standard and test by which
          they tried the apostles' teaching, instead of the Word of God. They
          falsely accused them of disturbing the peace of society; and, by a
          willful misconstruction of their words, they even charged them with
          treasonable designs against the government: "These," said they, "all
          do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another
          king, one called Jesus." They drove them entirely away from their
          city, and then persecuted those who had hospitably entertained them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor was this all. They followed them to Berea, and stirred up the
          people there, so that Paul was compelled to leave that place. Now, in
          contrast with this course, notice,

          >
          "They received the message with great eagerness." They were wedded to
          the same rites as were the Jews in Thessalonica. Their prejudices were
          in favor of Judaism and arrayed against Christianity. Hence, the
          teaching of the apostle was as much opposed to their views, as to
          those of the Thessalonians; but notwithstanding all this, "they
          received the message with great eagerness." This implies that they
          received it,
        </p>
        <font color="#008080"><b> </b></font>

          <font color="#008080"

              >1. This implies that they received te word RESPECTFULLY.
            </b></font
          >It is too frequently the case, that when the truth is presented to
          those who have long cherished religions error—they treat it with
          ridicule, especially where it comes in contact with their preconceived
          opinions. Thus the Athenians treated Paul, when he broached the
          doctrine of the resurrection, "When they heard about the resurrection
          of the dead, some of them sneered; but others said: We want to hear
          you again on this subject." (Acts 17:32)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is, often, in our day. The curling lip, and the sneer of
          contempt, and the expression of ridicule, are seen and heard as soon
          as a favorite dogma is touched, no matter how kindly. Not so with the
          Bereans. However novel the doctrines of the apostle appeared, however
          opposite to what they had been taught, or however different from their
          previously formed opinions—they listened to what he presented with
          respect.
        </p>
        <font color="#008080"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#008080"
            ><b>2. They received the word with OPENNESS.</b></font
          >
          They were disposed to be frank and fair. They were open to
          conviction—honest and sincere in their conclusions. They kept their
          minds free from an undue bias, and let every argument have its full
          weight. They were disposed to think and judge according to truth and
          justice. They were willing to admit every reasonable and logical
          conclusion. They banished prejudice, and examined the subject
          impartially.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the proper way to arrive at the truth. God gave us our
          <i>reason </i>to be exercised in religious matters, as well as in
          worldly affairs. These Bereans neither exhibited <i>bigotry </i>on the
          one hand, nor <i>credulity </i>on the other. They were willing to
          hear, and then they judged for themselves, and formed their own
          conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is all that can be demanded. This course was honorable to
          themselves, and would make even those respect them who differed from
          them. And this is true of any man, or body of men. Let them be open,
          fair and frank, and they will win the respect of those who arrive at,
          a different conclusion from them.
        </p>

          <font color="#008080"><b>3.</b></font>
          <font color="#008080"><b>They received the word PATIENTLY.</b></font>
          They did not get angry with the apostle, or exhibit signs of
          irritation, or cherish feelings of malice toward him—because he sought
          to convert them from Judaism. Though it was the religion of their
          fathers—though they had been brought up in it—though their prejudices
          were strongly wedded to its rites and ceremonies—still, they calmly
          listened to the reasons urged by the apostle why they should abandon
          it, and connect themselves with that sect which was "everywhere spoken
          against." They were not offended at Paul's zeal; their minds were
          unruffled, and day after day they came to patiently hear him through.
        </p>
        <p>
          How different is this from the conduct of most persons. Just touch
          their peculiar doctrines, or hint that the rites which they observe
          are unscriptural, and without waiting to hear the reasons for such an
          opinion, they at once become agitated, and impatiently desire to leave
          the place and inwardly determine that they will not again enter it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not so with the noble Bereans. They wished to find the truth, though
          it might lie in a different direction from that in which they had been
          accustomed to seek it. They desired to follow the truth, though it
          might lead to the abandonment of time-honored customs and the breaking
          up of old and pleasant associations. Therefore, "they received the
          message with great eagerness." Such a course might offend interested
          partisans, but God commends it as noble. We notice,

            >examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was
            true</i
          >." This is the divine standard of appeal. God gave it as our guide,
          and we are commanded to search it. Scripture is to be the test of all
          religious teaching; and the conduct of the Bereans in making it the
          test of Paul's preaching is honored by its divine Author; for let it
          not be forgotten that it is Jehovah who speaks in the text.

        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i>They did not appeal to Tradition.</i> They might have done this.
          Rumor said that Christ was an impostor; Paul affirmed that He was the
          Messiah. How were they to decide? Simply by appealing to the
          Scriptures. They did not appeal to their priests and rabbis. They had
          told them to oppose Christianity, and seek to exterminate it. But they
          knew their priests were fallible men, and that if they obeyed them,
          they might possibly be "found fighting against God."
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i
            >They did not appeal to their own preference, and interest, and
            convenience.</i
          >
          These would have prompted them to reject the investigation of the
          doctrine, and decide at once in accordance with tradition and popular
          customs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abandoning all these false and uncertain standards, they appealed to
          the Scriptures, to settle the differences between their views and
          those of their reformers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They "searched" the Scriptures; as one who seeks for something that is
          lost. Many persons read the Bible only to find support for what they
          already believe, and search the Scriptures to prove that what is new
          to them is not so. But these Bereans exhibited the same openness in
          testing the word, that they did in its reception. If the Scriptures
          sustained the apostle, they adopted his views; if not, they rejected
          them. Thus they honored God, and
          <i
            >exempted themselves from the charge of willful ignorance,
            intolerance, and superstition</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reception that should always be given to those who aim to
          reform a community, whether that reformation is universal, or whether
          it have reference only to a single doctrine or ordinance. Such a
          reception is all we ask for these Lectures. Such a reception is all
          Baptists ask anywhere.
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i
            >Those who hold the truth have nothing to fear from such a course. </i
          >Respectful, candid, and patient attention, will enable them the more
          readily to detect sophistry and specious reasoning, and the study of
          the Bible will always expose what is unscriptural and erroneous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this course has the sanction of Jehovah, however much it may
          offend men. <i>The Bible should be the test of all preaching.</i> That
          man who desires to make himself the umpire and final standard of
          appeal to his congregation, involves himself in a fearful
          responsibility, and virtually claims for himself infallibility. Yet
          some ministers appear offended if their authority is questioned, or if
          their preaching is tested by the Word of God. <br />
          <br />
          Paul did not do so. Though inspired, he commended the course of those,
          who, instead of taking his word for it, examined the Scriptures for
          themselves, to see whether those things which he taught them were so.
          To adopt a contrary course, and blindly follow a minister or priest,
          is downright Romanism! And, if pursued universally, this would . .
          .<br />
          &nbsp; arrest the progress of the Gospel,<br />
          &nbsp; and clog the wheels of truth,<br />
          &nbsp; and stamp error with immutability.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if the Hindu, the Burman, and the Chinese follow their priests,
          and universally determine never to examine Christianity? What if the
          Mohammedan, Romanist and Greek, follow their teachers? What if the
          Universalist, Infidel, and Atheist, follow their champions! These have
          as much warrant to do this, as the Presbyterian, Methodist, or
          Baptist. No, my brethren, your minister is not to be the umpire or
          standard. There is but one who could say, "Follow Me!" and that was
          Christ. We point you to Him. We direct you to His Word as the standard
          of your beliefs, and to His example as the pattern of your lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, in these Lectures, we say anything that conflicts with these,
          reject it; but if you God, on examination, that these things which we
          preach are so, remember, the whole responsibility of rejecting, not
          us, but the Word of God, and the meek and lowly Savior, rests at your
          own door.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the conduct of the Bereans were universally imitated, what happy
          events would follow! How soon would infidelity, and error, and
          superstition vanish before the influence of sound reason and Scripture
          truth. What courtesy, and forbearance, and love, would be manifested
          among brethren who differ. How much more diligently would the Bible be
          studied, and how soon would the multitude of sects and parties
          disappear, and the Savior's prayer that they all might be one would be
          answered!
        </p>
        <p>
          The contrary course can benefit no one. If a man is in an error, no
          matter how trivial—it can do him no good to continue in that error.
          Especially, it can do him no good to dwarf his mind, and stunt his
          intellectual powers—in order that he may continue in it unmolested.
          Yet this is the effect of refusing a candid investigation of the
          truth. Further, if a man has the truth, he will not fear
          investigation, but rather court it, "He who does the truth comes to
          the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought
          in God."
        </p>
        <p>
          If a pretended reformer appears, there is no surer way of exposing the
          imposition, than the adoption of the example of the Bereans. But if a
          contrary course is pursued, it frequently leads to the exercise of a
          morbid sympathy toward those who hold injurious error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Baptists appear before the world as those who aim at a complete
          reform. They, appeal . . .<br />
          not to the sympathies, but to the <i>consciences </i>of men;<br />
          not to prejudice, but to <i>reason</i>;<br />
          not to tradition but to the <i>Scriptures</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          They simply ask for the reception which the Bereans gave to those who
          sought to convert them from Judaism to Christianity.
