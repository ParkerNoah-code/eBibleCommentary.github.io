          "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also!"
          Acts 17:6
        </p>
        <p>
          It has always been the policy of the advocates of error, when unable
          to sustain themselves by sophistry, specious reasoning and false
          logic—to stigmatize the advocates of the truth as disturbers of the
          peace, and dangerous to the harmony and interests of the community.
          Such was the course pursued by those who uttered the language of the
          text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul and Silas, having been released from the Macedonian prison, where
          they had been confined for preaching the Gospel, took their departure
          from Philippi, and passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, "they
          came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews." Here
          Paul, according to his usual custom, met the Jewish rabbis and
          teachers, and reasoned with them out of the Old Testament Scriptures,
          concerning Jesus of Nazareth—proving to them that he was the Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          His reasoning on this subject was so forcible, that many of the Jews
          were convinced, and professed their faith in the Savior. This stirred
          up the hatred and envy of the baffled rabbis; and, finding themselves
          unable to cope with the superior logic and masterly reasoning of Paul,
          they enlisted the prejudices of the rabbis, and gathered a mob, and
          created a riot, and endeavored to lay violent hands on the
          disciples—and thus accomplish by force and superior numbers, what they
          could not effect by fair argument. Their accusation against the
          disciples is contained in the words of the text: "These men who have
          turned the world upside down have come here also!"

            ><b>1. The AIM of the Religious Reformer. </b></font
          >A Reformer is one who seeks to remove abuses which have crept into an
          organization or community, or one who boldly enters a field where
          error has held undisputed sway, and fearlessly wields amid giant
          powers of opposition, the weapons of truth. He aims to entirely
          revolutionize the minds of the community in which he labors, on that
          particular subject where he believes reform to he needed. A compromise
          between truth and error is not what he seeks, and will not satisfy
          him. "The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," is his
          motto.
        </p>
        <p>
          Old systems of error, however sacred on account of their antiquity, he
          boldly attacks. Though massive darkness has long brooded over the
          people, he aims to dissipate the gloom, and shed upon them brilliant
          rays of light. His work is a mighty one; the end for which he labors
          is noble and sublime. He holds a position in advance of the community
          in which he resides, and the age in which he lives—hence he possesses
          traits of character that are peculiar, which fit him to toil and
          suffer for the accomplishment of his designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spirit of <i>noble daring </i>is his.
          <i
            >He fears not to grapple with error, though sanctioned by age, and
            supported by popular favor</i
          >. He scruples not, if need be, to stand alone, as the champion of
          truth. With undaunted intrepidity he braves the "world's dread laugh"
          or meets its frown. With a spirit of indomitable perseverance, he
          steadily adheres to his purpose and determinedly pursues his single
          object. Every <i> obstacle </i>thrown across his path affords a new
          incentive to increased activity. Every <i>difficulty </i>he meets,
          only gives new strength and inspires fresh courage. He is not to be
          turned aside. Having put his hand to the plough, he looks not back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-sacrificing effort and benevolent labor are his. His time,
          talents, property, are all laid upon the altar of truth. He toils, not
          to achieve a name, to amass wealth, or to advance a sect. He labors
          for the good of others—while often he receives only their hatred,
          reproach and persecution. If there is one picture on earth that
          reminds us, more than any other, of the meek and lowly Savior, it is
          the spirit and conduct of the reformer, patiently suffering at the
          hands of those whose moral elevation he labors to effect. And here is
          the test by which the true and false reformer may be tried and
          discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infidelity boasts of seeking a reform. But when did Infidelity ever
          inspire its advocates with a spirit of self-denial for the good of
          others? Where are its sacrifices made to benefit and elevate the human
          race? Did infidelity ever suffer to benefit man? Does it today go
          forth, as an angel of mercy—to labor, to suffer, and to bless? No, no!
          But the true reformer has a high purpose, a benevolent aim; he
          occupies holy ground, and he can suffer, unjustly suffer, to benefit
          his fellow-men. Let us notice,
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#0000ff"><b>2. The REPROACH of the Reformer.</b></font>
          All Reforms are attended with agitation and conflict, but none more so
          than reforms in religion. At first, the reformer may attract but
          little attention. His attacks on error may appear so feeble, and his
          efforts to advance the truth may seem so faint, that the opponents of
          truth may esteem only the smile of ridicule and scorn necessary to
          throw his work into insignificance, or a slight exertion of authority
          sufficient to extinguish it. But let him continue with boldness,
          energy and eloquence, to plead for truth and begin to make an
          impression upon the public mind, and gather adherents around him; then
          will his adversaries become agitated and alarmed! Like the fierce
          storm, lashing into foam the waters of the mighty deep—they stir up
          the popular mind, until the entire community moves in angry surges,
          and persecution and violence ensue. The more bold the onset, the more
          forcible the elucidation of truth, the more numerous the adherents to
          the reform—the more fiercely will the advocates of error oppose the
          effort, and the more desperately will they seek to crush by force, or
          circumvent by cunning, what they cannot master by argument, or defeat
          by sound logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such an event, the reformer labors under every disadvantage. He is
          reproached as a <b>disturber of the public peace</b>. He is regarded
          as the cause of all the confusion and uproar, and must bear all the
          odium connected with it. Look at the text and its connection. The
          disciples had peacefully taught in the synagogue in Thessalonica, yet
          all the uproar was charged upon them: "These men who have turned the
          world upside down have come here also!" Thus it has ever been. The
          opposers of reform have lashed into fury the elements of political
          strife, and then have charged the peace-loving disciples of truth with
          all the disastrous results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reformer is also reproached as a <b>revolutionist</b>. He is
          opposing old customs and popular usages. He seems to be ruthlessly
          trampling on all that has been held beautiful and venerable. He seems
          to be setting up individual and novel opinions against the united and
          established wisdom of ages. He seems to be destroying everything and
          advancing nothing. He seems to be a reckless intruder, trespassing on
          ground rightfully occupied by others. He seems to touch sacred things
          with an impious hand. He seems to be sowing dissensions, destroying
          hallowed institutions, and introducing unauthorized innovations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he perceives that these old forms and venerated institutions are
          the offspring of error, and that truth and right demand their
          extermination; in the name of God, therefore, he goes forth, to
          overturn, to revolutionize, and to reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is further reproached as
          <b>illiberal, uncharitable, bigoted, and narrow-minded</b>. Because he
          refuses to call error truth, and darkness light, and wrong right, the
          slaves of error, the victims of darkness, and the followers of wrong
          conclude that he is uncharitable and narrow-minded. They forget that
          it is the highest charity to expose error and oppose wrong, and that
          only the largest minds and most benevolent hearts will seek to
          disseminate light and dispel darkness, even though "the darkness does
          not comprehend it."
        </p>
        <p>
          There never yet was a reform attempted, that did not suffer the
          reproach of the dominant party. Look at that old reformer Lot: "This
          one fellow came in to sojourn, and will needs be a judge." Look at
          Moses, the prophets, John the Baptist, Martin Luther, Roger Williams.
          All these were reproached as revolutionists, and virtually charged
          with "turning the world upside down."
        </p>
        <p>
          But the greatest revolutionist that ever appeared in our world was
          Jesus Christ. He was the Great Reformer. He aimed directly to abolish
          the old dispensation and make all things new. He paid no respect to .
          . .<br />
          the antiquity of the scribe,<br />
          the morality of the Pharisee,<br />
          or the sanctity of the priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He threw himself upon the merits of the truths he delivered, and
          declared himself a radical revolutionist and reformer. Did not He meet
          reproach? Let the purple robe, the reed scepter, the thorny crown, the
          mocking homage, and the blood-stained cross reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostles were reproached. The Gospel which they preached was a
          great innovation upon old and venerable institutions. No reform could
          ever be compared with that which they sought to effect.
          <i>They aimed to overturn all the religions in the world</i>. Hence
          they were accounted "vagabonds, fools, and madmen." They were treated
          with ridicule, scorn, and contempt. They, a few ignorant fishermen,
          seeking to abolish those religions which had stood for centuries, and
          which had gathered around them all the charms of history, philosophy,
          and poetry; religions whose massive temples towered in majestic
          splendor to the very clouds—religions which numbered among their
          devotees, crowds of kings and heroes, scholars and sages, and which
          were cherished by the most powerful and refined nations of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not strange that at first they were only deemed worthy of
          ridicule; nor is it surprising, that as success crowned their
          persevering labors, they became the subjects of violent hate and
          bitter persecution. They were shaking the foundations of ancient
          superstitions, they were disturbers of the public peace, they were
          detestable revolutionists, they were hateful reformers, in short, they
          were "turning the world upside down!"
        </p>
        <p>
          This kind of reproach Baptists especially have been called to endure.
          They are great revolutionists. Of all persecuted sects, the Baptists
          stand forth as most prominent, simply and only because
          <i
            >they aim at a more complete and thorough reform than any others
            ever attempted</i
          >. They teach that Christ's kingdom is not of this world. They teach
          that the church is not a national, political, or provincial
          establishment—but a congregation of holy men, separated from the world
          by the receiving of the Holy Spirit. They seek to "turn the world
          upside down"—not in the odious sense, but in the proper and desirable
          sense. The world is wrong; it is morally wrong side up; it needs to be
          revolutionized, and primitive Christianity alone can do it! This is
          the instrument by which Baptists aim to accomplish their design.
          <i
            >By the propagation of primitive Christianity, they confidently
            expect to achieve a complete and entire Reformation </i
          >in the Pagan, Romish, and Protestant world, and bring the race of man
          back to God. We pass on to notice,
        </p>
        <font color="#0000ff"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#0000ff"><b>3. The TRIUMPH of the reformer. </b></font
          >The true religious reformer must ultimately triumph. However opposed,
          reproached, and persecuted, he triumphs. Even when he appears to be
          defeated, he triumphs. While he struggles on in adversity, and while
          sad reverses meet him in his work, still he triumphs.
          <i>The power of the truth </i>is manifest in the support it yields him
          amid these disheartening circumstances. The consciousness that he has
          discharged his duty with fidelity, fills his mind with peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          He feels that the smile of God is upon him; hence the frowns of the
          opposers of truth, and their anathemas, are lighter than vanity to
          him. He esteems "the reproaches of Christ greater riches than all the
          treasures" of earth! The shame of the cross he counts greater honor
          than all the applause of the world, and the martyr's death is to him
          sweeter than all earthly pleasures. He exhibits a dignity of character
          that far outshines all others, and totally eclipses, on the historic
          page, all his slanderous persecutors. He is as far superior to the
          time-serving demagogue, as are the burning beams of the meridian sun
          compared to the last sickly rays of the feeble candle, flickering in
          its socket, and just ready to expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knows no fear of consequences.<i>
            Duty, it is his to perform—results, are God's to control. </i
          >He stands firmly, as the rock in the ocean, unmoved amid the howlings
          of the tempest and the fury of the waves. For him there is a glorious
          future, however dark the hour of trial may be; and though for a time
          he endures reproach, he will have a name when his persecutors have
          perished and are forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every true religious reformer that ever lived in our world triumphed.
          Daniel, and the three Hebrew worthies, possessed the spirit, endured
          the reproach, and achieved the triumph of Reformers; they saw their
          enemies clothed with shame, and the cause of God, which they had
          espoused, gloriously advanced. And though their pathway to success lay
          through the lions' den and the burning furnace, these only made their
          triumph more sublime, and shed a new halo around their names.
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i>Martin Luther</i> triumphed—and though Rome anathematized and
          bitterly execrated him, the name of the poor monk of Erfurth is
          honored wherever evangelical Christianity prevails; while the
          distinguishing doctrine for which he contended has become one of the
          strong bulwarks of the Protestant world, and the terror of Antichrist.
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i>Roger Williams</i> triumphed—though banished from the Massachusetts
          colony, and driven into the desert wilds among the Indians. The
          religious liberty for which he suffered, and which American citizens
          today enjoy, forms the most distinguishing and pre-eminent glory of
          our country.
        </p>
        <p>
          How superior is the fame of such men, to that of the mere military
          hero! Napoleon won his fifty battles; William Carey translated the
          Bible into almost as many different languages; and while today the
          name of Napoleon begets sentiments of disgust, or wakes emotions of
          unhallowed ambition—the name of William Carey touches a chord in every
          Christian bosom, arousing to new life and to more unreserved
          consecration to Christ, the energies of the ablest and best of Zion's
          sons and daughters.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a great deal of this work of reform before the church at the
          present day. Especially is this true of the Baptist churches of this
          country. They are prepared to labor for a more thorough reformation
          than any others can undertake. There are forms of error, productive of
          incalculable mischief, which none others can consistently attack;
          while
          <i>
            all others retain and seek to perpetuate the unscriptural dogma of
            infant baptism</i
          >, which with every other traditionary rite must be abolished, before
          the world's revolution will be complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it be remembered that each has a personal interest and
          responsibility in this matter. Let the inquiry be, "Lord, what will
          you have me to do?" Every Christian is to aim to reform, first
          himself; then the world.
        </p>
        <i> </i>
        <p>
          <i>The Word of God must be our weapon. </i>With this, old forms of
          error must be attacked, and the conflict only end when the field is
          left in possession of truth. "Therefore, since we are surrounded by
          such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that
          hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with
          perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,
          the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him
          endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand
          of the throne of God." Hebrews 12:1-2
