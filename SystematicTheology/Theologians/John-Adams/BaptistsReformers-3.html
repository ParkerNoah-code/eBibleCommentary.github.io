          "For the <i>weapons </i>of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in
          God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every
          high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing
          every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ!" 2
          Corinthians 10:4-5
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the introduction of sin into the world, there has been an
          unremitting conflict between truth and error. The earth has become a
          vast battle-ground—the theater of a mighty moral warfare. Truth and
          error are necessarily opposed to each other, and whenever they come in
          contact, a fierce contest ensues, which ends only when error is
          destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conflict is not, however, one of a material kind; nor should
          physical force be used in carrying it on. It is a moral warfare; and
          ultimate success can be sensed only by the use of corresponding
          weapons. The advocates of error may press into their service carnal
          weapons, as indeed they are always forced to do, in their vain efforts
          to sustain themselves and oppose the truth; but thus they only
          acknowledge their own weakness, and betray the defects of their cause,
          and insure in the end their own defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disciple of the truth needs no such weapons. He knows that they
          can yield him no advantage, and secure no permanent benefit; and he
          sees that they would only encumber and embarrass him in the conflict,
          and retard the cause he seeks to advance. He feels that in order to be
          successful, he must use only those means which God has appointed, and
          which He can bless. He therefore appropriately adopts the language of
          the text: "For the <i>weapons </i>of our warfare are not carnal but
          mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and
          every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,
          bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ!"
        </p>
        <p>
          In conducting any enterprise, or effecting any work, instruments are
          necessary implements adapted to the end designed. The work of the
          reformer is, in a great measure, a work of destruction. He goes forth
          to demolish all that is opposed to truth—all that prevents its free
          and rapid advance. He is the pioneer, who is accounted "famous
          according as he lifts up the axe upon the thick trees."
        </p>
        <p>Error is rather negative than positive.</p>
        <p>
          Truth was intended to enlighten man; error, like a cloud, intervenes
          to shut out its brilliant rays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth was intended to make man happy; error infuses poison, and
          introduces the ingredients of misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth was intended to make man free; error rears her fortress and
          strongholds, and makes him a captive in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the work of the reformer is to dissipate this cloud—to extract
          this poison—to pull down these strongholds. The work of Christ, the
          Great Reformer, was eminently a work of destruction. He was manifested
          that He might "destroy the works of the devil." Let us notice,

              demolish.

        <p>
          <font color="#b07050"><b>1. Ignorance.</b> </font>All religious error
          is the offspring of ignorance and mistake. God is true, and His Word
          is true. No religious error can find any support there. Yet we know
          that error does exist to a vast extent. How mighty, then, is this
          fortress! and how strong! Look at the ignorance of
          <i>heathen </i>nations. See the ignorance of those who are under the
          dominion of the <i>Papacy</i>. Behold the lamentable ignorance of a
          vast majority of Protestants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the reformer meets this stronghold wherever he undertakes to
          labor. He beholds willful ignorance of plainly revealed truths. He
          beholds one body of men willfully ignorant of the views and practices
          of another body which they condemn. He finds himself misrepresented,
          misunderstood, and opposed—because men are entrenched in this
          stronghold of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle Paul once found himself a victim of misrepresentation
          which had gained currency simply through the inexcusable and willful
          ignorance of those who believed them. "Are not you that Egyptian," he
          was asked, "which, before these days made an uproar, and led out into
          the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The religious reformer is frequently assailed with questions as
          absurd, betraying the willful ignorance of those who oppose him in his
          work. This ignorance he labors to remove.
        </p>
        <font color="#b07050"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#b07050"><b>2. Prejudice.</b></font> Prejudices are
          generally in favor of that to which men are accustomed, and opposed to
          that which appears new to them. If men have been accustomed to error,
          they love it on account of its antiquity; and the inquiry too
          frequently is not:<i> What is truth?</i> But,
        </p>
        <i>
          <p>Is it in accordance with our traditions?</p>
        </i>
        <p>Is it what our fathers practiced?</p>
        <p>Is it what they taught us?</p>
        <p>
          Men speak of time-honored customs; they forget that, while
          <i>errors may be time-honored, truth is eternal</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prejudice is a mighty stronghold. Its walls are of adamantine strength
          and of almost impenetrable thickness. Entrenched in this fortress, men
          are unapproachable. The soundest logic, the strongest arguments, the
          most convincing proofs, the fairest reasonings—all fail, all are
          powerless, while prejudice holds the mind within her grasp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very work of the religious reformer brings him in direct contact
          with those <i>customs </i>which appeal most powerfully to men's
          prejudices. He aims to remove old errors; but, in order to do this, he
          must first demolish the stronghold in which they are entrenched. He
          aims to convince men that it is better to be the willing subjects of
          reason, than the blind slaves of prejudice!
        </p>
        <font color="#b07050"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#b07050"><b>3. Self-interest.</b></font> Many go with the
          crowd, merely because it is to their present interest. After they are
          enlightened by truth, and after their old prejudices are
          overcome—still, selfishness prevails; and instead of doing that which
          they know to be right, and laboring to advance the truth, they prefer
          to act contrary to their own convictions. They perceive that the truth
          is unpopular—that its advocacy will necessitate self-denial and
          sacrifice—that their temporal interests will suffer, and their names
          be cast out as evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the religions reformer aims to make men benevolent; he labors to
          make them willing to deny themselves and cheerfully suffer for the
          good of others and the sake of the truth. Selfishness must be
          demolished, this mighty stronghold must be pulled down, before the
          reformer can succeed in his work. Thus,
          <i
            >the victims of error must be driven from every refuge, and their
            hiding-places must be destroyed, before they will be made free by

          >
          These are stated in the text negatively. "The weapons of our warfare
          are not carnal." The religious reformer does not invoke:
        </p>
        <font color="#b07050"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#b07050"><b>1. The Civil Power. </b></font>He does not
          seek to force men by legal enactments to embrace his views, or profess
          attachment to his cause. He does not seek to unite the Church with the
          State, or enforce his teachings at the edge of the sword and the point
          of the bayonet. He does not use persecution or oppression of any kind.
          He does not use authority of office, either civil or ecclesiastical.
          He does not use the authority growing out of the domestic relations to
          force the consciences of those who are subject to him, or compel them
          to adopt his views of truth. He utterly renounces <i>compulsion </i>of
          every kind. The gibbet, the rack, and the stake, are all discarded by
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here was one radical defect of the <i>Reformation </i>of the sixteenth
          century. The <i>civil arm </i>was invoked,
          <i>the State was united with the Church</i>, a political element was
          infused, and carnal weapons were used as freely by the Reformed
          Churches in enforcing their dogmas, as by the Papacy in maintaining
          its heresies. The thorough religious reformer uses no such weapons.
          Neither does he employ,
        </p>
        <font color="#b07050"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#b07050"><b>2. Calumny and Misrepresentation.</b></font>
          In order successfully to combat the opinions and practices of an
          opponent, individuals sometimes distort and falsify his views. They
          present an absurd doctrine, which is inconsistent both with reason and
          revelation, falsely charge it on those whom they oppose—and then
          eloquently declaim against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or they mistake the arguments used by their opponents to sustain their
          views, and endeavor to make the impression that they are but weak
          fanatics, or men laboring under mental imbecility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, they openly slander and vilify them, and injure their reputation.
          And thus they labor to bring into disrepute both the views and
          practices they oppose, and the persons who advocate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          All who persecute, love to have some pretext; they therefore first
          slander their victim—and then put him to death! Thus it was with
          Jesus; false witnesses rose against him; and though their testimony
          carried its refutation on its very face, it was made the pretext for
          his crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the thorough religious reformer, having no desire to persecute,
          needs no pretext for it; he therefore discards calumny and
          misrepresentation. Neither does he resort to,
        </p>
        <font color="#b07050"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#b07050"
            ><b>3. Flattery and Deceitful Artifices. </b></font
          >He appeals not to sinful passions, such as pride, ambition,
          self-indulgence and a desire for worldly honor. This is often done in
          order to advance a sect or party. "Our denomination," it is urged, "is
          the most popular—it numbers more than any other—it has more wealth."
          "Our church is the most respectable—it embraces the most learned and
          talented men; therefore we are right." "It will be to your interest to
          join our church, because it is THE church of whole region." Now all
          such motives as these must be classed among the carnal weapons. They
          appeal to selfishness. The true reformer makes no such appeals, urges
          no such motives, wields no such weapons: "For the weapons of his
          warfare are not carnal."
        </p>
        <p>
          Such weapons are impotent, and worse than useless, in seeking to
          advance the truth. If a man becomes an honest and faithful follower of
          the truth, it must be for the truth's sake—and not to avoid
          persecution, or reproach, or unpopularity. Such weapons can never pull
          down the strongholds of error, but rather render them more
          impregnable. <i> Persecution </i>will never enlighten the mind of the
          ignorant. <i> Misrepresentation </i>will never remove prejudice.
          <i>Flattery </i>will never demolish selfishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And further, such weapons only recoil on the heads of those who use
          them. It is an immutable decree of Jehovah, that "those who take the
          sword shall perish with the sword." We have a striking illustration of
          this in the burning of Cranmer and Rogers. We have been taught to
          sympathize with them in their martyr-deaths at the stake; and that
          sympathy we would not check, for they were cruelly persecuted. But we
          would at the same time recognize in their sufferings a, fulfillment of
          Christ's words, "For in the same way you judge others, you will be
          judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
          Matthew 7:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hands of both of them had been stained with the blood of Joan
          Boucher, a noble-minded and pious lady, who, in the reign of the
          youthful Edward, was committed to the flames for
          <i>the sin of being a Baptist</i>. "Cranmer is said by Fox in his
          <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, to have been most urgent with the young king
          to sign to the cruel document. The youthful king hesitated. Cranmer
          argued from the law of Moses, by which blasphemers were to be stoned
          to death. With tears but unconvinced, the royal signature was
          appended. Rogers also thought that she ought to be put to death, and
          when urged with the cruelty of the deed, replied, 'that burning alive
          was no cruel death, but easy enough!'"
        </p>
        <p>
          God has shown, in an unmistakable manner, his disapprobation of carnal
          weapons. While the reformer deprecates the use of these means, there
          are weapons employed by him which are "mighty, through God, to the
          pulling down of strongholds." Among these we notice:
        </p>
        <font color="#008000"><b> </b></font>
        <p>
          <font color="#008000"
            ><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The Word of God.</b></font
          >
          This is the double-edged sword of the Spirit. This is the grand weapon
          which is to cut its way through all error. It always has been
          successful, and always will be. Those only have been successful
          reformers, who have used this as their great weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the <i>Great Reformer</i>; when he went forth to encounter, in
          the wilderness, the arch adversary of truth, how did he vanquish him?
          Though all the hosts of Heaven were ready to do his bidding, and drag
          Satan back to his prison, He disdained to exert physical force. He
          used this great weapon; and every assault of the Tempter was repelled
          by the calm reply, "It is written—it is written—IT IS WRITTEN!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the <i>apostles </i>went forth, the Word of God was the
          instrument with which they overcame the opposition of Judaism.
        </p>
        <p>
          What gave rise to the reformation in the sixteenth century? Why, a
          poor monk found a Bible, and in his cell made it his study. Happy
          would it have been for the world, if the reformers of that age had
          been guided exclusively by its holy precepts. Discarding tradition,
          and every human invention—the thorough religious reformer makes the
          Bible both his text-book and test-book.

          He takes pains to ascertain accurately the views of those whose errors
          he would correct, giving them credit for the truth they hold, and
          acknowledging their excellencies wherever they exist. His work is not
          to destroy their lives, their liberties, or their reputations, but
          their errors. He therefore speaks the truth in love, and seeks not
          theirs but them. His great wish is to benefit them; and, like the
          blessed Redeemer, who could mingle His tears of compassion with his
          denunciations against sin—the reformer boldly and sternly denounces
          error, yet cherishes ardent affection for those who are "out of the
          way." He also employs,

          >
          He appeals not to passion or prejudice, but to the understanding. He
          is able to give a reason for everything he attempts. He shows the
          fitness of things, and their propriety; he invites the exercise of the
          judgment of those whom he addresses. Instead of regarding men as
          brutes, who are to be driven by force, he recognizes them as rational,
          intelligent beings, who are to be convinced, and persuaded, and moved
          by mental and moral power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ and the apostles were great reasoners; especially is this true
          of the apostle Paul. Who can read the epistles to the early churches,
          without being struck with the force of his reasoning? The advocates of
          error cannot stand before the reformer who is well skilled in the use
          of this weapon.

          The religious reformer, therefore, while he wields the "sword of the
          Spirit" and exhibits in his own life the power of the truth he holds,
          depends only on God for success in his work.

          These are the weapons of the reformer. With these he goes forth to
          attack the strongholds of sin, and raze to the ground the giant fabric
          of error. To be successful even in advancing the truth, we must use
          only the divinely appointed means; for wherever the opposite course
          has been pursued, the most disastrous results have followed. Truth is
          only trammeled and retarded by the use of any but the heaven-approved
          weapons.

          These weapons, only, have been used by Baptists. They have never
          figured on the historic page as persecutors. Though the subjects of
          bitter oppression and cruel persecutions themselves, it has been their
          glory always to exclaim, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
          but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds!"
