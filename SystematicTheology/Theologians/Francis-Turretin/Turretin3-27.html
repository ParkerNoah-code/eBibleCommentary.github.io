          TWENTY-SEVENTH QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Can the divine persons be distinguished from the essence, and from
            each other, and how?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>The persons may be distinguished from the essence.</p>
        <p>
          I. A Trinity of divine persons having been established, we must now
          treat of their distinction both from the essence itself and from each
          other. The persons are manifestly distinct from the essence because
          the essence is one only, while the persons are three. The former is
          absolute, the latter are relative; the former is communicable (not
          indeed as to multiplication, but as to identity), the latter are
          incommunicable; the former is a something broader and the latter are
          narrower. For although the essence is adequate to the three persons
          taken together, yet it is broader than each one of them because each
          person has indeed the whole divinity, but not adequately and totally
          (if it is right so to speak), i.e., not to the exclusion of the others
          because it is still communicable to more. The former is the common
          principle of external operations, which are undivided and common to
          the three persons; the latter are the principle of internal
          operations, which belong to the single persons mutually related to
          each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. About the nature of this distinction theologians are not agreed.
          Some maintain that it is real; others formal; others virtual and
          eminent (of reasoned ratiocination, which although it may not be on
          the part of the thing, still may have its foundation in the thing);
          others personal; others, finally, modal. We think these various
          notions ought not to be troubled and cut to the quick since, being
          drawn from human and finite things, they can but very imperfectly
          adumbrate this mystery. It is better to be satisfied with this general
          notion that there is a distinction, although what and how great it is
          cannot be comprehended and expressed by us.
        </p>
        <p><b>Not essentially, but modally.</b></p>
        <p>
          III. Now although all these species of distinction come far short of
          the sublimity of this great mystery, still no one seems to us to
          approach nearer to it than the modal distinction (distinctione modali)
          by which the mode is said to be distinguished from some thing. For the
          personal properties by which the persons are distinguished from the
          essence are certain modes by which it may be characterized; not indeed
          formally and properly (as modes are said to be in created things,
          which as finite can be differently affected and admit modes really
          distinct and posterior to the thing modified, which cannot fall on the
          infinite and most perfect essence of God); but eminently and
          analogically, all imperfection being removed. Thus the person may be
          said to differ from the essence not really (realiter), i.e.,
          essentially (essentialiter) as thing and thing, but modally
          (modaliter)—as a mode from the thing (modus a re).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Hence it follows that there is no composition in God because
          composition arises only from diverse things. Here we do not have a
          thing and a thing, but a thing and the modes of the thing by which it
          is not compounded but distinguished. Again, composition belongs to
          those things which are related to each other as power and act (which
          cannot be granted here). Nor can the term composition be applied to
          God without implying imperfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Whatever is in God essential and absolute is God himself (such are
          the divine attributes, power, wisdom, justice, etc.). But whatever is
          in God personal, relative and modal may not immediately in every way
          be identified with the divine essence. It is indeed God in the
          concrete, but not in the abstract. It is God the Father or God the Son
          or God the Holy Spirit, but cannot be called formally the divinity
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. While infinity is an essential property belonging to the divinity,
          it is not necessary that it should be properly ascribed to the
          personalities. It suffices that they be called modes of the infinite
          essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The wisdom and power of God taken precisely and essentially are
          attributes which are identified with the divinity. Yet they are spoken
          of the Son and the Holy Spirit personally, and relatively as they are
          affected by the personalities of the Son and the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The distinction of the persons from each other seems to be
          greater than from the essence. For the essence can be predicated of
          the person, nor is there granted an opposition between the person and
          the essence in the exercised act or in the concrete. Thus it may be
          said, this person is not God, for the Father is God, the Son is God,
          etc., although in the signified act and in the abstract, a person is
          not the essence. But the persons cannot be mutually predicated of each
          other, for the Father cannot be called the Son or the Son the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >In explaining the distinction between the persons Sabellianism must
            be avoided.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. In explaining this distinction two extremes must be avoided—the
          sources of the most grevious heresies. On the one hand, there is
          Sabellianism, introduced about the year 260 by Sabellius, the
          Pentapolitan of the city of Ptolemais in Egypt. He was followed
          afterwards by Praxeas, an Asiatic, and Hermogenes, an African. In a
          latter age, Michael Servetus restored this error, maintaining a
          distinction only of reason between the persons, so as to make only one
          person (who on account of various effects may be called now the
          Father, now the Son, and then the Holy Spirit). On the other hand,
          there is the Tritheism of Philoponus and Valentine Gentilis (who from
          the three persons make three eternal, unequal spirits, essentially
          distinct from each other).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The orthodox hold a middle ground. Against Sabellius, they deny
          that the distinction of reason alone has place here because the Father
          is another than the Son and the Son than the Father (on the part of
          the thing beyond the operation of our conception). Against the
          Tritheists, they reject the real (realem) or essential distinction
          because although there are more persons than one mutually distinct,
          yet there is only one essence. But they hold to a modal (modalem)
          distinction because as the persons are constituted by personal
          properties as incommunicable modes of subsisting, so they may properly
          be said to be distinguished by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Although theologians may seem in some measure to differ from each
          other here (some urging a real, others only a modal distinction), yet
          they are easily reconciled. Those who say that they differ really are
          nevertheless unwilling to express it as a real major distinction
          (distinctionem realem majorem) which exists between things and things
          (as if there was in the Trinity a difference of things or one and
          another essence, which would be opposed to the unity and simplicity of
          the divine essence). But they say it is only a real minor distinction
          (distinctionem realem minorem, as the Scholastics have it) which
          exists between a thing and the mode of the thing or between the modes
          themselves, which coincides with the modal distinction held by others.
          Although in God there is not one and another thing (i.e., different
          essences), still there is one and another subject (a difference of
          persons).
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. To authorize this distinction in the deity, it is not necessary
          that there should be any adequate or equal example among creatures. It
          is sufficient if there is anything similar or analogous as a
          foundation; yea, it would even be sufficient to attend to the persons
          themselves which would be distinct only in name (as Sabellius held) if
          there were no real modal distinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Things incommunicable to each other (allelois) can be said to
          differ really (i.e., not only by reason); but it does not immediately
          follow that they differ essentially and specifically. The persons
          differ from each other in the first manner, not in the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. These modes of subsisting (tropoi hyparxeos) by which the persons
          are distinguished from each other may well be called real (reales)
          because they are not a work of reason, but imply something positive on
          the part of the thing (by which the persons are constituted and
          distinguished from each other). Yet they cannot well be called either
          substantial (substantiales) or accidental (accidentales) since this
          division applies only to a finite being and indeed to things, not to
          modes. If at any time, they are said to be substantial, this is done
          improperly with respect to the subject modified (subjecti modificati)
          (if we may so speak) and not with respect to the form or quiddity of
          the modes themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. But although these modes are wont to be explained mostly
          negatively by incommunicability, it does not follow that nothing
          positive is meant, but indicates only a bare negation of the
          conjunction of the divine essence with any other thing in order to
          constitute one self-existent thing (suppositum). That negative term
          implies positively the ultimate complement by which the thing is so
          complete in itself, as that it cannot be further united with or
          communicated to any other. Hence that communicability is founded upon
          something positive, which is formally constitutive of the person, and
          not upon something negative. Otherwise the conception of the Trinity
          would be purely negative, and the three persons of the Trinity in
          their personal being would be constituted and be mutually
          distinguished from each other by negation alone, and the personal
          internal works would have only a negative principle. Since these
          cannot stand, we are necessitated to say that the mode of subsisting
          in the divinity superadds something positive to the unity of the
          divine essence. Now although we cannot easily conceive what that
          something positive is, it ought not, therefore, to be said to consist
          in a mere negation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >The distinction of persons is found: (1) in the persons themselves
            as to order.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. This distinction of the persons may be principally observed in
          two things: (1) within (intus), in the persons themselves; (2) without
          (foris) in their operations. First, as to the persons, with respect to
          order, because the Father is proposed in Scripture as the first
          person, who is from no one; the Son as the second, who is from the
          Father; and the Holy Spirit as the third who is from the Father and
          the Son. With respect to that order a certain preeminence (hyperoché)
          is attributed by theologians to the Father, not indeed as to essence
          and deity (because the persons being consubstantial [homoousioi] the
          highest equality exists among them), but as to mode (both in
          subsisting and in working): in subsisting, because both as to order
          and as to origin, he precedes the Son and the Holy Spirit (as having
          no principle either of order or of origin, but existing from
          himself—not positively, but negatively). In this sense, he is called
          by the fathers “the fountain of deity” (pégaia theototos), not
          absolutely as to existence, but respectively as to the communication
          of it. In working (operando), because the order of operating follows
          the mode of subsisting. Hence the Father operates from himself, but
          the Son from the Father.
        </p>
        <p><b>And personal properties.</b></p>
        <p>
          XVII. Second, as to personal properties—which are not common to the
          single persons, but singular to each person (and so incommunicable
          because they agree with the persons as persons and constitute the very
          incommunicability of the persons). Thus to the Father is ascribed
          agennesia; to the Son gennésis; to the Holy Spirit ekporeusis. The
          Father is said to be self-begotten (autogennétos)—not affirmatively
          (otherwise he would be the principle of himself and prior and
          posterior to himself), but negatively (because he is unbegotten,
          agennétos). As Athanasius explains this in the Athanasian Creed (ap’
          oudevos esti poiétos, oude men ktistos oude gennétos), “He is made of
          none, neither created nor begotten,” in contradistinction to the Son
          (who although not created or made, still is begotten from the Father)
          (Symbolum Quicunque, PG 28.1587). So the Son is said to be from the
          Father by generation; not with respect to essence and absolutely as
          God, but with respect to person and _ reduplicatively (reduplicative)
          as Son. The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son by spiration;
          for generation and spiration are communicative of the essence to the
          term of personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Because these personal and characteristic properties are
          usually expressed by the relative names of Father, Son and Holy
          Spirit, it happens that they may well be said also to be distinguished
          from each other by relations (not indeed predicamental, which are
          accidental, but transcendental). For as to each person there is a
          peculiar subsistence and a peculiar property, so also to them singly
          there is a peculiar relation. Now although these relations can be
          called real (reales) on the part of the foundation (which is
          constituted in the internal operations because there is a real
          difference between the persons, and the Father is really distinct from
          the Son); still they cannot be called real beings (realia, as the
          Scholastics term them) because they are not absolute entities, but
          only modifications and characters of the essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Yet the persons are so distinguished by these relations as to be
          not so much principles constitutive of the persons, as declarative of
          them a posteriori; to wit, inasmuch as they are regarded in their
          external and respective being. So paternity (which is the relation of
          the Father to the Son) notifies to us the first person, filiation the
          second, spiration the third. And although there may be granted in the
          Father two relations—paternity and spiration—yet the Father is not
          distinguished into two persons. Besides what is common to the Father
          and the Son cannot be a distinguishing property (diakritiké) of the
          Father, only the opposed relations here make the distinction (which
          does not occur in paternity and spiration).
        </p>
        <p><b>2. In the external works.</b></p>
        <p>
          XX. Second, the distinction is collected from the works of the
          persons. For although the external works are undivided and equally
          common to the single persons (both on the part of the principle and on
          the part of the accomplishment), yet they are distinguished by order
          and by terms. For the order of operating follows the order of
          subsisting. As therefore the Father is from himself, so he works from
          himself; as the Son is from the Father, so he works from the Father
          (here belong the words of Christ, “the Son can do nothing of himself,
          but what he seeth the Father do,” Jn. 5:19). As the Holy Spirit is
          from both, so he works from both. They also differ in terms as often
          as any divine operation is terminated on any person. So the voice
          heard from heaven is terminated on the Father, incarnation on the Son
          and the appearance in the form of a dove on the Holy Spirit.
