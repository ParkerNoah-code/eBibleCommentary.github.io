          SIXTH QUESTION: ADOPTION
          <br />
          <em>What is the adoption which is given to us in justification? </em>
        </p>
        <p>The other part of justification, adoption.</p>
        <p>
          I. The other part of justification is adoption or the bestowal of a
          right to life, flowing from Christ’s righteousness, which acquired for
          us not only deliverance from death, but also a right to life by the
          adoption with which he endows us. For on this account, he is said to
          have been made under the law (hypo nomon) by an economical subjection
          that he might redeem us from the bondage of the law and confer upon us
          the adoption or the right of sons (Gal. 4:4, 5). On this, the right to
          life depends because “if children, then heirs” (Rom. 8:17). John says
          “to them who received him,” i.e., “who believed on his name, he gave
          power to become the sons of God” (1:12). Here exousia does not signify
          authority or power because it has reference here to inferiors; nor
          faculty or potency by which a person can make himself a son. Rather it
          signifies axidma (i.e., the dignity and right of sons).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In how many ways adoption may be taken.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. However adoption here is not taken by us (as it is elsewhere) for
          an external calling and reception into the covenant (such as was
          formerly the case with the Jews, whose is said to be the adoption,
          Rom. 9:4). Nor for the sense and use of adoption which is made by
          emancipation, such as belongs to believers of the New Testament, who
          because they are made adults and are no longer minors are said to have
          received the Spirit of adoption and are no longer called servants, nor
          are held in the manner of servants, but are sons and heirs who rejoice
          in this right (Gal. 4:5). Nor for the full manifestation of adoption,
          which will occur in the resurrection. In this sense, believers are
          said to wait for the adoption (i.e., the resurrection of their bodies,
          Rom. 8:23). Rather it is taken for a juridical act of God by which
          from his mere mercy, he adopts into his family through faith in Christ
          those whom he elected to salvation from eternity and bestows upon them
          the name and right of sons as to inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What is adoption?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. However as the word “adoption” is derived from a custom received
          among men, so the action itself has a multiple analogy with civil
          adoption (although it differs also in various things and is better).
          Adoption is defined by lawyers as a “lawful act imitating nature
          introduced for the consolation of those who have no children.” Thus
          there is required here: first an adopter, who can have the authority
          of a father who (destitute of children) supplies the defect of nature
          by law and receives a stranger into his own family and promises to him
          paternal favor; (2) the person adopted, who passes from his father’s
          family into another and (his state being changed) changes his name and
          life and has a right to the paternal goods and especially to the
          inheritance; and in turn binds himself to all the duties of filial
          obedience. Thus in this matter, adoption is not an act of nature, but
          of a gracious will which our heavenly Father wished to exercise
          towards us. In this sense, he is said “to have begotten us of his own
          will” (Jam. 1:18) and the very name adoption (hyiothesias) denotes
          this voluntary and most free disposition of God. By it God transfers
          us strangers and foreigners (who were the servants or slaves of Satan)
          from the family of the old Adam and the power of darkness and admits
          us into his own family and the kingdom of light and gives us the
          dignity of sons. He not only bestows upon us the glorious name of
          dearly beloved sons (1 Jn. 3:1; Rev. 2:17; 3:12) with the distinctions
          and honors pertaining to them, but also gives us a right to all his
          goods of grace as well as of glory. All this comes under the name of
          inheritance as acquired not by any merit, but given by the mere grace
          of the Father to us in virtue of our adoption by him. And we in turn
          (answering by faith to this great love) bind ourselves to filial
          worship and obedience to him (2 Cor. 6:18; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16; Mal. 1:6,
          8).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How it differs from human adoption.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Of whatever kind may be the analogy, still a great and remarkable
          difference always intervenes. For what the law does among men, this is
          a work of mere good will (eudokias). That was sought out for the
          solace of childlessness to supply a defect of nature; but this was
          made for our consolation only, not for God’s, who was perfectly well
          pleased with his only begotten Son. That was ordained for the
          succession to the goods of a deceased father, but this only for a
          participation in the goods of a Father living forever. That can give
          the name, the titles and distinctions of sons, but not the mind and
          qualities. But in this, God by adopting changes the heart, and to whom
          he gratuitously gives the right of sons, he also impresses upon them
          the mind and character of sons by the Spirit of adoption. That does
          not make them good, but supposes them to be so; for neither would a
          man adopt anyone as a son unless he perceived in him something lovely.
          But this is a work of mere grace which does not suppose anything good
          in us who were enemies, rebels and most corrupt. Thus God adopts us,
          not because we are good, but to make us good.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Here belongs the testamentary disposition which the Father is said
          to have instituted for giving us the inheritance. It is nothing else
          than the final and immutable will sealed in the Scriptures and
          confirmed by the blood and death of Christ, by which he pronounces
          elect believers his heirs. Christ clearly intimates this: “I appoint”
          (diatithemai, or give by a will) “unto you a kingdom, as my Father
          hath appointed (dietheto) unto me” (Lk. 22:29). “And for this cause he
          is the mediator of the new testament,” says Paul, “that by means of
          death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
          first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of
          eternal inheritance” (Heb. 9:15). The goods left by this testament do
          not pertain only to “the inheritance of this world” (Rom. 4:13),
          according to which all things are ours (1 Cor. 3:21), but it is
          especially the inheritance of heaven or of the kingdom of heaven (Mt.
          25; Jam. 2:5). Thus it is the inheritance of God himself, who (as he
          is the highest good) is often called our portion and inheritance (Gen.
          15:1; Ps. 16:5; Jer. 10:16), as believers are the portion and
          inheritance of God (Ps. 33:12).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Now although this privilege as to the thing is common to all the
          believers of the Old Testament, no less than to those of the New, who
          were both sons of God and had a right to the heavenly inheritance (to
          which after death they were admitted), still it is certain that the
          condition of believers of the New Testament as to the mode is far
          better in this respect: they are no longer in an infantile age, held
          like slaves under teachers and the rudiments of the world, when they
          were not able to have either the sense or the use of their right,
          animated by the spirit of bondage. But now being adults and
          emancipated by Christ, they are admitted to the sanctuary of the
          Father and have a full sense and fruit of their right, the Spirit of
          adoption being received, in virtue of which they can confidently cry
          out, Abba, Father. Paul refers to this when he says, “Christ was made
          under the law, to redeem them that were under the law” (to wit, under
          the curse of the moral law and under the yoke of the ceremonial law)
          “that we might receive the adoption of sons” (Gal. 4:4, 5). Not that
          only by which we are separated from the children of wrath and of the
          Devil, but also that by which we far excel infants, who do not differ
          from slaves. This is more copiously proved in Topic XII, of the
          covenant of grace, Question 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. From these positions, it is gathered that to no purpose do some
          anxiously ask here how justification and adoption differ from each
          other, and whether adoption is by nature prior to justification (as
          some hold, who think it is the first and immediate fruit of faith by
          which we are united and joined to Christ; or whether posterior to and
          consequent upon it, as others). For since it is evident from what has
          been said that justification is a benefit by which God (being
          reconciled to us in Christ) absolves us from the guilt of sins and
          gives us a right to life, it follows that adoption is included in
          justification itself as a part which, with the remission of sins,
          constitutes the whole of this benefit. Nor can it be distinguished
          from adoption except inasmuch as it is taken strictly for remission of
          sins, since in its formal conception it includes also acceptation to
          life, which flows from the imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Nor is adoption here to be confounded with our union with
          Christ. For although it necessarily flows from it as its cause and
          foundation (since from union with Christ depends the communion of all
          his benefits, of justification and of sanctification and of glory),
          still it cannot (if we wish to speak accurately) be identified with
          it. Rather it stands related to it as an effect to its cause. Hence it
          is that, being united to Christ as our head and the first-begotten of
          God, his most perfect righteousness becomes ours by the imputation of
          God and the reception of faith, upon which depend both absolution from
          sins and the adoption or acceptation to life and the inheritance which
          is the right of sons. For as many as obtain that dignity are not only
          received into God’s family to be members of his house (Gal. 6:10), to
          be always under the fatherly protection of God, depending upon him for
          nutrition, education and perpetual conservation, but have a right to
          the inheritance (Rom. 8:17), i.e., the possession of all the goods of
          the Father and the enjoyment of God himself (which is our
          inheritance).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Christian liberty flows from adoption.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. From this adoption springs Christian liberty, which is not an
          immunity from all laws (divine and human) and a license to live
          according to our pleasure and to indulge the lusts of the flesh (as
          the Libertines profess, changing liberty into licentiousness); not an
          exemption from the civil obligation of subjection and from the
          tributes and jurisdiction of magistrates (as the various Anabaptists
          maintain and which the Romish clergy claim for themselves against the
          express teachings of Scripture); but it is a spiritual and mystical
          manumission obtained for us by the blood of Christ, by which from the
          spiritual bondage of the law, of sin, of the world and Satan (by whose
          chains we were before bound), we are brought into the liberty of the
          sons of God (as it is treated in Jn. 8:32, 36; Rom. 6:15, 22; 8:2, 3;
          Gal. 3:13; 4:6, 26; 5:1; Heb. 2:15 and elsewhere); through which being
          called into fellowship with God (as our Father) and with Christ (as
          our brother), we obtain dominion over the creatures and are heirs of
          the kingdom of Heaven.
