          TENTH QUESTION
          <br />

          <em>The unity, perfection and certainty of justification</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Unity, perfection and certainty are the three principal adjuncts of
          justification concerning which disputes exist. Of these we must speak
          briefly because we have elsewhere discussed them partially.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The unity or equality of justification among believers.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Unity can be regarded in two ways: either relative to believers
          among themselves; or absolutely with respect to him who is justified.
          In the former sense, it is said to be “one in species” or “equal in
          all believers” of all times and places because God justifies all
          believers in the same manner (viz., by his grace and the merit of
          Christ through faith). “Seeing it is one God,” says the apostle,
          “which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision
          through faith” (Rom. 3:30), i.e., who justifies the Jews as well as
          the Gentiles by faith. For since all are liable to sin and
          condemnation (v. 19), and destitute of the glory of God (v. 23), there
          is no other method of justification than by faith. The apostle proves
          this fully in the same place and confirms it by the examples of David
          and of Abraham (Rom. 4); as also of all the saints of the Old
          Testament mentioned in Heb. 11, who by faith are said to have pleased
          God (v. 6), to have obtained witness that they were righteous (v. 4)
          and to have become heirs of the righteousness which is by faith (v.
          7). Nor either in the Old or New Testament can there be found any
          dissimilar example of a person justified in another way. Hence Peter
          says, “To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
          whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins” (Acts
          10:43). Through the grace of Christ, we shall be saved, even as they
          (Acts 15:11). Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever (Heb.
          13:8); he is the Way, and the Truth and the Life; no one can come to
          the Father except by him (Jn. 14:6).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. For the objections brought forward here by the Socinians against
          the identity of the justification of the believers of the Old and New
          Testaments, see Topic XII, Question 5 concerning the unity of the
          covenant of grace (where they are discussed).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now although the same benefit as to substance was common to the
          believers of the Old Testament no less than to those of the New (as
          they had true remission of sins in and on account of Christ), still
          there was a multiple difference as to degree and sense. It is far more
          clearly revealed and more fully and efficaciously felt by us now; as
          was proved in the same place and in Question 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The numerical unity of the same in particular believers.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Second, the same justification is one numerically in individuals.
          It is not promoted successively after the manner of sanctification by
          repeated acts, but is finished in one judicial act and brings to the
          believer the remission of all sins. Hence the Romanists (from their
          fictitious hypothesis concerning physical justification by an infusion
          of righteousness) falsely make it twofold: the first, that by which a
          man from being unjust is made just by an infusion of righteousness;
          the second, that by which from being just he is made more just by the
          increase of righteousness. The foundation having been once overturned
          (as was done above), whatever is built upon it falls. Nor does the
          passage in Rev. 22:11 favor this error because (as we have already
          said), it does not treat of the infusion of righteousness, but either
          of the sense and declaration of righteousness once gained (which is
          retained by the exercise of righteousness) or of its special
          application to everyday sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The distinction between active and passive justification points
          out indeed the truth of the terms “from which” and “to which” (viz.,
          of God who justifies and of man who is justified), but does not change
          the degree or species. For by the same sentence by which God justifies
          us (while he intimates it to the conscience), we are also passively
          justified when it is received by us through faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The blessing of justification and the right to it differ from the
          feeling and the knowledge of it. There is no cutting off or renewal of
          the former because it is a gift without repentance (ametameléton). The
          latter, however, may be interrupted and restored according to the
          various increases and decreases of sanctification. And although that
          sense may be interrupted in grievous sins and be recovered by various
          and repeated acts, still the blessing of justification remains always
          in him the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Although our justification will be fully declared on the last
          day (our good works also being brought forward as the sign and proof
          of its truth, Mt. 25:3440), still falsely would anyone maintain from
          this a twofold gospel justification—one from faith in this life (which
          is the first); the other (and second) from works on the day of
          judgment (as some hold, agreeing too much with Romanists on this
          point). The sentence to be pronounced by the supreme Judge will not be
          so much a new justification, as the solemn and public declaration of a
          sentence once passed and its execution by the assignment of the life
          promised with respect to an innocent person from the preceding
          justification. Thus it is nothing else than an adjudicatory sentence
          of the possession of the kingdom of heaven from the right given before
          through justification. And if works are then brought forward, they are
          not adduced as the foundation of a new justification to be obtained
          then, but as signs, marks and effects of our true faith and of our
          justification solely by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. It is one thing to apply justification often and to extend it to
          sins of daily occurrence (in which sense we are commanded to seek
          remission of sins every day); another to repeat and renew
          justification often. The former we grant, but not the latter. Nor is
          there need that a new justification should take place as often as the
          believer falls into a new sin. It is sufficient that the justification
          once made (which if not formally, virtually and generically contains
          the remission of all sins) be applied and extended specifically and
          determinatively to this or that sin by an intimation of the Holy
          Spirit and the apprehension of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Although remission of sins ought to be applied often to daily sins,
          yet falsely would anyone thence gather that sins once discharged
          revive and return again by subsequent sins (as some of the Romanists
          hold), since it is an unchangeable (ametameléton) gift of God. Nor
          does the parable of that ungrateful servant (who, after a greater
          amount had been yielded to him by his master, wished to deal cruelly
          with his fellow servant who owed him far less and who on that account
          was delivered to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due
          unto him [which is recorded in Mt. 18:23-—35]) prove this. It pertains
          to nothing else than to show that the remission of sins proposed
          conditionally does not belong to him in whom the condition is lacking.
          The design of the parable (which is to be regarded here simply) is no
          other than to teach that the mercy of God is not exercised towards the
          unmerciful; nor are sins pardoned by God, except to those who forgive
          the offenses of others. To show this the more efficaciously, the
          master is opposed here to his servant, an immense sum to a minute and
          the highest clemency to extreme inhumanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Perfection.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. (2) Perfection belongs to justification, according to which it is
          so full and absolute intensively (both with respect to evils taken
          away and blessings acquired) that it is free as to itself from
          increase and decrease. Nor does it admit of more and less, although as
          to the apprehension and sense of it our faith advances so gradually as
          to have even its progressions and defects. If the faith by which we
          are justified is active and remitted, it does not follow that
          justification itself is equally intermittent because it does not
          justify by itself and properly, but only instrumentally and
          relatively; as the beholding of the brazen serpent did not cease
          equally to heal, although some looked at it more intently and strongly
          than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Certainty.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. (3) Its certainty is twofold: one of the object in itself by the
          immutability and perseverance by which God never recalls the pardon
          once given (on account of the immutability of his grace, justice and
          promise confirmed by an oath, Heb. 6:17, 18). For the gifts of God
          bestowed upon the elect and the calling according to his purpose (kata
          prothesin) are without repentance (ametameléta, Rom. 11:29). Hence God
          _ never condemns and disinherits those whom he has once justified and
          made heirs. The other is the certainty of the subject, which refers to
          the sense of justification. Although it is possible from the nature of
          faith (yea, even necessary to bring peace and consolation to our
          souls), still it is not always in the same degree—but more perfect or
          imperfect according to the proportion of faith, so that there never
          was a believer (not even excepting Abraham [Gen. 17:17], or David [Ps.
          42:5, 11]) who did not have to struggle with doubts concerning grace.
          How each of these certainties belong to justification has already been
          shown fully, when we discussed the perseverance and certainty of
          faith; cf. Topic XV, Questions 16 and 17.
