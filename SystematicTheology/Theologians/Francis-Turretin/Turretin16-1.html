          FIRST QUESTION
          <br />
          <em
            >Is the word “justification” always used in a forensic sense in this
            argument; or is it also used in a moral and physical sense? The
            former we affirm; the latter we deny against the Romanists</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. As in the chain of salvation justification follows calling (Rom.
          8:30) and is everywhere set forth as the primary effect of faith, the
          topic concerning calling and faith begets the topic concerning
          justification. This must be handled with the greater care and accuracy
          as this saving doctrine is of the greatest importance in religion. It
          is called by Luther “the article of a standing and a falling church”
          (Articulus stantis, et cadentis Ecclesiae). By other Christians, it is
          termed the characteristic and basis of Christianity —not without
          reason—the principal rampart of the Christian religion. This being
          adulterated or subverted, it is impossible to retain purity of
          doctrine in other places. Hence Satan in every way has endeavored to
          corrupt this doctrine in all ages, as has been done especially in the
          papacy. For this reason, it is deservedly placed among the primary
          causes of our secession from the Roman church and of the Reformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. However, although some of the more candid Romanists (conquered by
          the force of the truth) have felt and expressed themselves more
          soundly than others concerning this article (nor are there wanting
          also some among other divines who, influenced by a desire to lessen
          controversies, think there is not so great matter for dispute about it
          and that there are here not a few logomachies), still it is certain
          that up to this time there are between us and the Romanists in this
          argument controversies not only verbal, but real and many which are of
          great importance (as will be made manifest in what follows).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. From a false and preposterous explanation of the word, the truth
          of the thing itself has been wonderfully obscured. In the first place,
          its genuine sense (and in this question most especially) must be
          unfolded. This being settled, we will be able the more easily to reach
          the nature of the thing itself.
        </p>

          <b>Homonyms of the verb justificare.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The word htsdyq, to which the Greek dikaioun answers and the Latin
          justificare, is used in two ways in the Scriptures—properly and
          improperly. Properly the verb is forensic, put for “to absolve” anyone
          in a trial or “to hold” and to declare “just”; as opposed to the verb
          “to condemn” and “to accuse” (Ex. 23:7; Dt. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Lk.
          18:14; Rom. 3—5). Thus apart from a trial, it is used to acknowledge
          and to praise one as just and that too either deservedly (as when it
          is terminated on God, in which way men are said to justify God when
          they celebrate him as just [Ps. 51:4]; “wisdom” is said to be
          “justified of her children” [Mt. 11:19*; Lk. 7:35], ie., acknowledged
          and celebrated as such); or presumptuously ([doxastds] as the
          Pharisees are said to justify themselves, Lk. 16:15). Improperly it is
          used either ministerially, for to bring to righteousness (Dan. 12:3
          where mtsdyqy seems to be exegetical of [exégétikon tou] mskylym
          because while the preachers of the gospel instruct and teach
          believers, by this very thing they justify them ministerially [to wit,
          by teaching them the true way in which they can be justified] in the
          same sense in which they are said to save them, 1 Tim. 4:16). Or by
          way of synecdoche (the antecedent being put for the consequent) for
          “to free”; “he that is dead is justified from sin” (Rom. 6:7), i.e.,
          freed. Or comparatively, where on account of a comparison between the
          sins of Israel and Samaria, Israel is said “to justify Samaria” (Ezk.
          16:51, 52) and the sins of Judah increasing, Judah is said “to have
          justified Israel” (Jer. 3:11) because Israel was more just than Judah
          (i.e., her sins were fewer than the sins of Judah).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Hence arises the question with the Romanists concerning the
          acceptation of this word—whether it is to be taken precisely in a
          forensic sense in this affair; or whether it ought also to be taken in
          a physical and moral sense for the infusion of righteousness and
          justification, if it is allowable (so to speak) either by the
          acquisition or the increase of it. For they do not deny that the word
          jusfiticatio and the verb justificare are often taken in a forensic
          sense, even in this matter, as Bellarmine (“De Justificatione,” 1.1
          Opera [1858], 4:461-62), Tirinus (Theologiae — elenchticae
          controversarium fidei, Cont. 15, number 1 [1648], pp. 217-21) and
          Toletus (Commentarii et annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos,
          Annot. 13 [1602], pp. 117—22) and not a few others. Yet they do not
          wish this to be the constant meaning, but that it often signifies a
          true production, acquisition or increase of righteousness; this is
          especially the case when employed about the justification of man
          before God. Hence they distinguish justification into “first and
          second.” The first is that by which the man who is unjust is made
          just; the second is that by which a just man is made more just. Hence
          Bellarmine says: “Justification undoubtedly is a certain movement from
          sin to righteousness, and takes its name from the terminus to which it
          leads, as all other similar motions, illumination, calefaction; that
          is true justification, where some righteousness is aquired beyond the
          remission of sin.” Thomas Aquinas says, “Justification taken passively
          implies a motion to making righteous, just as calefaction a motion to
          heat” (ST, III, Q. 113, Art. 1, p. 1144). Now although we do not deny
          that this word has more than one signification and is taken in
          different ways in the Scriptures (now properly, then improperly, as we
          have already said), still we maintain that it is never taken for an
          infusion of righteousness, but as often as the Scriptures speak
          professedly about our justification, it always must be explained as a
          forensic term.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Proof that the word “justification” is forensic. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The reasons are: (1) the passages which treat of justification
          admit no other than a forensic sense (cf. Job 9:3; Ps. 143:2; Rom.
          3:28; 4:1—-3; Acts 13:39 and elsewhere). A judicial process is set
          forth and mention is made of an accusing “law,” of “accused persons”
          who are guilty (hypodikoi, Rom. 3:19), of a “hand-writing” contrary to
          us (Col. 2:14), of divine “justice” demanding punishment (Rom. 3:24,
          26), of an “advocate” pleading the cause (1 Jn. 2:1), of
          “satisfaction” and imputed righteousness (Rom. 4 and 5), of a “throne
          of grace” before which we are absolved (Heb. 4:16), of a “judge”
          pronouncing sentence (Rom. 3:20) and absolving sinners (Rom. 4:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (2) Justification is opposed to condemnation: “Who shall lay
          anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who
          is he that condemneth?” (Rom. 8:33, 34*). As therefore accusation and
          condemnation occur only in a trial, so also justification. Nor can it
          be conceived how God can be said to condemn or to justify, unless
          either by adjudging to punishment or absolving us from it judicially.
          Toletus is compelled to confess this on Rom. 8:33: “The word
          justification in this place is taken with that signification, which is
          opposed to its antithesis, namely, condemnation; so that it is the
          same in this place to justify as to pronounce just, as a judge by his
          sentence absolves and pronounces innocent” (Commentarii et
          annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos [1602], p. 441 on Rom. 8:33).
          Cornelius a Lapide, who otherwise earnestly strives to obscure the
          truth, still overcome by the force of the truth, acknowledges that God
          justifies (i.e., absolves from the threatened action of sin and the
          Devil and pronounces just).
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. (3) The equivalent phrases by which our justification is
          described are judicial: such as “not to come into judgment” (Jn.
          5:24), “not to be condemned” (Jn. 3:18), “to remit sins,” “to impute
          righteousness” (Rom. 4), “to be reconciled” (Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 5:19)
          and the like. (4) This word ought to be employed in the sense in which
          it was used by Paul in his disputation against the Jews. Yet it is
          certain that he did not speak there of an infusion of righteousness
          (viz., whether from faith or from the works of the law, the habit of
          righteousness should be infused into man), but how the sinner could
          stand before the judgment seat of God and obtain a right to life
          (whether by the works of the law, as the Jews imagined, or by faith in
          Christ). And since the thought concerning justification arose without
          doubt from a fear of divine judgment and of the wrath to come, it
          cannot be used in any other than a forensic sense (as it was used in
          the origin of those questions which were agitated in a former age upon
          the occasion of indulgences, satisfactions and remission of sins). (5)
          Finally, unless this word is taken in a forensic sense, it would be
          confounded with sanctification. But that these are distinct, both the
          nature of the thing and the voice of Scripture frequently prove.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sources of explanation.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Although the word “justification” in certain passages of Scripture
          should recede from its proper signification and be taken in another
          than a forensic sense, it would not follow that it is taken judicially
          by us falsely because the proper sense is to be looked to in those
          passages in which the foundation of this doctrine is formed. (2)
          Although perchance it should not be taken precisely in a forensic
          sense for “to pronounce just” and “to absolve in a trial,” still we
          maintain that it cannot be taken in a physical sense for the infusion
          of righteousness, as the Romanists hold (as is easily proved from the
          passages brought forward by Bellarmine himself).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. In Is. 53:11, where it is said Christ “by his knowledge shall
          justify many,” it is manifest that reference is made to the
          meritorious and instrumental cause of our absolution with God (namely,
          Christ and the knowledge or belief of him). For the knowledge of
          Christ here ought not to be taken subjectively concerning the
          knowledge by which he knows what was agreed upon between himself and
          the Father (which has nothing to do with our justification); but
          objectively concerning that knowledge by which he is known by his
          people unto salvation (which is nothing else than faith, to which
          justification is everywhere ascribed). The following words show that
          no other sense is to be sought when it is added “for he shall bear
          their iniquities.” This denotes the satisfaction of Christ, which
          faith ought to embrace in order that we may be justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Nor does the passage in Dan. 12:3 press us. As we have already
          said, justification is ascribed to the ministers of the gospel, as
          elsewhere the salvation of believers is ascribed to them (1 Tim. 4:16;
          1 Cor. 9:22). Not assuredly by an infusion of habitual righteousness
          (which does not come within their power), but by the instruction of
          believers by which, as they open the way of life, so they teach the
          mode by which sinners can obtain justification in Christ by faith.
          Hence the Vulgate does not translate it justificantes, but erudientes
          ad justitiam.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. “He that is righteous, let him be righteous still” (Rev. 22:11)
          does not favor our opponents so as to denote an infusion or increase
          of righteousness. Thus it would be tautological (tautologia) with the
          following words, “He that is holy, let him be holy still,” because
          justification would not differ from sanctification. But it is best to
          refer it to the application and sense of justification; for although
          on the part of God justification does not take place successively,
          still on our part it is apprehended by us by varied and repeated
          actions, while by new acts of faith we apply to ourselves from time to
          time the merit of Christ as a remedy for the daily sins into which we
          fall. Nay, although it should be granted that the exercise of
          righteousness is here meant (as in a manuscript we have dikaiosyneén
          poiésato) that it may be opposed to the preceding words—‘“He that is
          unjust, let him be more unjust’—the opinion of the Romanists will not
          on that account be established.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. “The justification of the wicked” of which Paul speaks (Rom.
          4:5), ought not to be referred to an infusion or increase of habitual
          righteousness, but belongs to the remission of sins (as it is
          explained by the apostle from David). Nay, it would not be a
          justification of the wicked, if it were used in any other sense than
          for a judicial absolution at the throne of grace. I confess that God
          in declaring just ought also for that very reason to make just so that
          his judgment may be according to truth. But man can be made just in
          two ways: either in himself or in another; either from the law or from
          the gospel. God therefore makes him just whom he justifies; not in
          himself, as if from a sight of his inherent righteousness he declared
          him just, but from the view of the righteousness imputed—in Christ. It
          is indeed an abomination to Jehovah to justify the wicked without a
          due satisfaction, but God in this sense justifies no wicked one
          (Christ having been given to us as a surety who received upon himself
          the punishment we deserved).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Although certain words of the same order with justification
          denote an effecting in the subject, there is not the same reason for
          this, which otherwise barbarously has been received into Latinity to
          express the force of htsdyq and dikaioun (neither of which admit a
          physical sense). Thus we magnify and justify God, not by making him
          great from small or just from unjust, but only declaratively
          celebrating him as such.
