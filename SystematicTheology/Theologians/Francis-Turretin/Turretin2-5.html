        <h2>Apparent Contradictions in Scripture</h2>
        <p>FIFTH QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Are there in Scripture true contradictions, or any irreconcilable
            passages, which cannot be resolved or harmonized in any way?
            Negative.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. When the divine quality of Scripture, which was argued in the
          preceding question, has been accepted, its infallibility follows of
          necessity. But in every age the enemies of true religion and of
          Scripture have thought that they had found contradictory passages in
          Scripture, and have vigorously presented them in order to overthrow
          its authority; for example, Porphyry, Lucian, and Julian the Apostate
          among the pagans of antiquity, and today various atheists, who in
          hostile fashion declare that there are contradictions and
          irreconcilable differences which cannot be harmonized in any way.
          Therefore this particular question must be discussed with them, so
          that the integrity of Scripture may be upheld against their impiety by
          a completed fabric and covering.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our controversy is not with open atheists and pagans, who do not
          recognize Holy Scripture, but with others who, although they seem to
          accept it, yet indirectly deny it in this manner: for example, the
          enthusiasts, who allege the imperfection of the written word in order
          to attract people to their esoteric word or special revelations; the
          Roman Catholics, who, although they defend the divine quality of
          Scripture against the atheist, yet do not fear to oppose, with
          powerful weapons, and to the full extent of their ability, their own
          cause and that of all Christendom, and to enter the struggle as its
          enemies, by teaching the corruption of the sources in order to win
          agreement for the authority of their Vulgate version; and finally,
          various libertines, who, although living in the bosom of the church,
          never stop calling attention to some "irreconcilable differences" and
          "contradictions," so as to erode the authority of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To deal with them, the scholars (doctores) follow various paths.
          Some think the question may be easily handled by granting that the
          sacred writers could have made mistakes, by failure of memory, or in
          unimportant details. This argument is used by Socinus when he treats
          the authority of Scripture, by Castellio in his Dialogue, and by
          others. But this does not counter the argument of the atheists; it
          joins them in a blasphemous manner. Others hold that the Hebrew and
          Greek sources have been corrupted in places, through the malice of
          Jews and heretics, but that the correction is easy by means of the
          Vulgate and the infallible authority of the church. This is the
          teaching of most Roman Catholics. We will argue against it in a later
          section, when we discuss the purity of the sources. Others concede
          that small errors have appeared in Scripture, and remain, which cannot
          be corrected by reliance on any manuscript or by collation, but which
          are not to be ascribed to the sacred writers, but explained partly by
          the ravages of time and partly by the faults of copyists and editors,
          and which do not destroy the authority of Scripture because they occur
          only with regard to unnecessmy or unimportant statements. Scaliger,
          Cappel, Amama, Voss, and others are of this opinion. Finally, others
          uphold the integrity of Scripture and do not deny that various seeming
          contradictions--not, however, true or real ones--occur; [they believe]
          that these passages are difficult to understand but not altogether
          contradictory and impossible. This is the more common opinion of the
          orthodox, which we follow as the more safe and the more true.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. It is not a question of errors in spelling and punctuation, or of
          variant readings, which everyone admits are not infrequent, nor
          whether the copies that we have agree so completely with the original
          autographs that they do not differ in the least. But the question is
          whether our manuscripts so differ from the originals that the true
          meaning has been corrupted, and the original texts can no longer be
          regarded as the rule of faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. It is not a question of the faultiness of some individual codices,
          or of the errors which the carelessness of copyists and printers may
          have introduced into the copies of this or that edition. No one denies
          that there are various corruptions of this sort. The question is
          whether there are corruptions and "universal errors" so distributed
          through all the copies, whether handwritten or printed, that they
          cannot be corrected either by the comparison of variant readings or
          from Scripture itself and the collating of parallel passages, and
          whether these are true and real contradictions, which we deny, or
          merely apparent ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The reasons are: (1) Scripture is "God-breathed" (II Tim. 3:16).
          The Word of God cannot lie (Ps. 19:8 - 9; Heb.6:18), it cannot perish
          and pass away (Matt. 5:18), it abides forever (I Peter 1:25), and it
          is truth itself (John 17:17). How could this be predicated of it if
          there were deadly contradictions, and if God had allowed the sacred
          writers either to err and to forget, or to introduce into it
          irreparable deceit?
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (2) Unless unimpaired integrity is attributed to Scripture, it
          cannot be regarded as the sole rule of faith and practice, and a wide
          door is opened to atheists, libertines, enthusiasts, and others of
          that sort of profane people to undermine its authority and overthrow
          the foundation of salvation. Since error cannot be part of the faith,
          how can a Scripture which is weakened by contradictions and
          corruptions be regarded as authentic and divine? Nor should it be said
          that these corruptions are only in matters of little significance,
          which do not affect the fundamentals of the faith. For as soon as the
          authenticity of Scripture has been found wanting, even if it be a
          single corruption [of the text] that cannot be corrected, how can our
          faith any longer be sustained? If corruption is conceded in matters of
          little importance, why not also in others of more significance? Who
          will be able to give me faith that there has been no forgetfulness or
          deceit in the fundamental passages? What answer can be given the
          subtle 'atheist or heretic who persistently claims that this or that
          text, unfavorable to him, rests on falsehood? The reply should not be
          that divine providence has willed the [Scripture] be preserved from
          serious corruptions, but not from minor ones. For not only is this an
          arbitrary assumption, but it also cannot be made without grave insult
          [to Scripture], implying that it lacks something necessary for its
          full self-authentication, nor can it easily be believed that God, who
          spoke and inspired every single word to God-inspired men, would not
          have provided for the preservation of all. If human beings preserve
          their words with the greatest care so that they will not be changed or
          corrupted, especially when--as is the case, for instance, with wills
          and contracts--they are of some importance, how much more should God
          be thought to have taken care for his Word, which he willed to have
          the status of testament and public notice of his covenant with us, so
          that nothing could corrupt it, especially when he could have easily
          foreseen and prevented such corruptions, to uphold the faith of his
          church?
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. There are four main arguments for the integrity of Scripture,
          and the purity of the sources. (1) Above all, the providence of God,
          who, since he wished to provide for our faith, could be expected to
          keep the Scripture pure and uncontaminated, both by inspiring the
          sacred authors who wrote it, and by protecting it from the efforts of
          enemies who left nothing untried to destroy it, that our faith might
          always have a firm point on which to rest. (2) The religion of the
          Jews, who were always careful guardians of the accuracy of the sacred
          codices, even to the point of superstition. (3) The diligence of the
          Masoretes, who, by their marks, placed, as it were, a fence around the
          Law. (4) The number and completeness of copies, with the result that
          even if one codex could have been corrupted, all could not be.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Whatever contradictions seem to be in Scripture are apparent but
          not real. [They appear] only with respect to the understanding of us
          who are not able to perceive and grasp everywhere their harmony. They
          are not in the material itself. If the laws of true contradiction are
          observed, so that seeming contradictions are brought together in
          accordance with simple identity of qualities (secundum idem),
          circumstance (ad idem), or time, the various so-called contradictions
          of Scripture can readily be reconciled, for either (1) they are simply
          not discussions of the same things, as when James ascribes
          justification to works, although Paul disparages them. One speaks of
          an explanatory justification of effect, a posteriori; the other of a
          justification of cause, a priori. So also in Luke 6:36 mercy is
          required, "be merciful," while it is forbidden in Deuteronomy 19:13,
          "you shall show no mercy." One commandment is for private citizens;
          one for magistrates. Or (2) the same thing is not described according
          to the same qualities, as Matthew in 26:11 denies the presence of
          Christ in the world, "You will not always have me/, while in 28:20 he
          promises it, "I am with you always, to the end of time." One statement
          is made with respect to the human nature [of Christ] and his bodily
          presence; the other with respect to the divine nature and his
          spiritual presence. Or (3) the statements are not made with regard to
          the same circumstances, as when one is absolute and the other
          relative. "Honor your father," but, Luke 14:26, "if anyone does not
          hate his father." One statement is to be understood as absolute; the
          other as relative, in that our [earthly] father must be loved less and
          placed after Christ. Or the statements do not refer to the same time,
          whence the maxim, "Distinguish the scriptural times and
          relationships." Thus circumcision is both exalted, as the great
          privilege of the Jews (Rom. 3:1- 2), and deprecated as a thing of
          naught (Gal. 5:3). One statement refers to the time of the Old
          Testament, when it was the ordinary sacrament and seal of the
          righteousness of faith; the other to the time of the gospel after the
          abrogation of the ceremonial law. Likewise the apostles were sent on a
          special mission to the Jews alone before Christ's passion, and were
          forbidden to go to the Gentiles, "Do not go into the way of the
          Gentiles" (Matt. 10:5), but after the resurrection [they were sent] on
          a general mission to all people (Mark 16:15).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Although we attribute absolute integrity to Scripture, we do not
          hold that the copyists and printers have been inspired, but only that
          the providence of God has so watched over the copyists that, although
          many errors could have entered, they did not, or at least they did not
          enter the codices in such a manner that they cannot easily be
          corrected by comparison with other copies (ex collatione aliorum) or
          with [other parts of] Scripture itself. So the basis of the purity and
          integrity of the sources does not rest on the inerrancy of human
          beings but on the providence of God, who, although the men who copied
          the sacred works could have introduced many errors, always carefully
          looked after them and corrected them, or else they can easily be
          corrected either by comparison with the Scripture itself or with
          better codices. Therefore it was not necessary to make all the scribes
          infallible, but only so to guide them that the true reading can always
          be found, and this book far surpasses all others whatsoever in purity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Although we cannot quickly find an obvious harmonization, free
          from all obscurities, between Scripture texts which involve names,
          numbers, or dates, these problems, are not to be quickly classed as
          insoluble, or if they are called insoluble, they are such because of
          human ignorance, and not because of the problem itself, so that it is
          better to acknowledge our ignorance than to accept any contradiction.
          These records are not written so exactly that all the circumstances
          were included. Many facts were certainly condensed into an epitome;
          others, which seemed unnecessary, were omitted; and it is even
          possible that these passages have various relationships which were
          well known to the writers, although now hidden from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence Peter Martyr says very well concerning II Kings 8:17, "Granted
          that there are obscure passages in the chronologies, it is not to be
          conceded that, for the purpose of reconciling them, we say that the
          sacred codex is false. For God, who in his mercy willed that the holy
          (divinus) books be preserved for us, gave them whole and not
          corrupted. Therefore when we are not able to explain the number of
          years, the ignorance under which we work must be admitted, and it must
          be remembered that the sacred book is written with such brevity that
          it is not easy to find out from what point the reckoning of time was
          begun; the Scripture, which, if it failed in one or another place,
          would also be suspect in others, remains uncorrupted." And again,
          about I Kings 15:1 [he says], "It is not uncommon, in this record, for
          the number of years which is attributed to the kings to appear to have
          little consistency. Doubts of this kind can be dispelled on manifold
          grounds. It may be that one and the same year is attributed to two
          persons, when it was not lived through its entirety by either.
          Sometimes sons ruled jointly with their parents for some years, and
          these years were assigned now to the reign of the parents, and now to
          that of the children. An interregnum sometimes took place and the
          empty period was attributed, now to the earlier king, and now to the
          later. There are even some years, in which the sovereigns ruled
          illegally and without religious sanction (tyrannice et impie), which
          are therefore disregarded, and not added to the other years of the
          reign." XII. Luke 3:36, concerning the younger Cain who is placed
          between Arpachshad and Shelah, contrary to the truth of the Mosaic
          record (Gen. 11:13), offers indeed a difficult problem, which learned
          scholars interpret in different ways, but it should not be regarded as
          an insoluble one, since various forms of solution are possible. For
          our part, not mentioning other opinions, we consider most appropriate
          that which regards this Cain as a suppositious and spurious [person],
          who crept in, through the carelessness of copyists, from the
          Septuagint version, in which he had existed before the time of Christ,
          as the chronology of Demetrius quoted in Eusebius's De praeperatione
          evangelii witnesses; or through some pious intent [of copyists], who
          did not want to oppose Luke to the Septuagint, whose authority was
          then considerable. The following data support this: (1) the authority
          of Moses and of the Books of Chronicles, which make no mention of him
          in their genealogies, in which there are three places where clearly he
          should have been included (Gen.10:24 and 11:13; I Chron.1:18). (2) The
          Chaldean paraphrase, which altogether omits this Cain both in Genesis
          and in Chronicles. (3) Josephus does not mention him, nor does Berosus
          to whom he refers, nor [Julius] Africanus whom Eusebius quotes. (4)
          [If his existence is upheld] the sacred chronology would be confused,
          and the Mosaic record would be brought into doubt, if Cain is inserted
          between Arpachshad and Shelah, and Noah becomes the eleventh after
          Abraham, not the tenth as Moses states. (5)[This Cain] is not found in
          all the codices. Our Beza witnesses to his absence from his oldest
          manuscript, and Ussher states (Dissertatio de Cainane, p.196) that he
          has seen a copy of Luke in Greek and Latin on a very old parchment, in
          large letters without breathings and accents, which was long ago taken
          from Greece to France and placed in the monastery of Saint Irenaeus
          near Lyons, and in 1562 removed, and then taken to England and given
          to Cambridge University, in which Cain in not listed. Scaliger
          affirms, in his prologue to the chronicle of Eusebius, that this Cain
          is lacking in the oldest copies of Luke. Whatever may be the facts,
          although this passage in Luke may be said to contain an error, Luke's
          authenticity cannot be brought into doubt on account of it, for (1)
          the corruption is not universal; (2) little falsehood is contained in
          it, and the correction for that is easily supplied from Moses, so that
          there was no need for the learned Isaac Voss to be concerned over the
          purity of the Hebrew codices, that he might defend the authenticity of
          the Septuagint.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. If there is a great difference in the genealogies of Christ
          which are recorded by Matthew and Luke, both as to the persons and the
          number of persons, this ought not to seem remarkable, because they do
          not record the same matters, but different ones. Matthew gives the
          genealogy of Joseph, whose family derives from David through Solomon.
          Luke traces the family of Mary to this same David through another son,
          Nathan. Matthew, after the Hebrew custom, included the wife's family
          in the husband's; Luke, however, wished to supply what had been
          omitted, by reporting Mary's family tree, so that the genealogy of
          Christ would stand out, so to speak, full and complete, from both
          parents, so that there would be no place for the doubts of the weak or
          the scoffing of the enemies of the gospel, and that the former would
          be upheld, and the latter won over, to the conviction that according
          to the predictions of the prophets Christ was the true and natural son
          of David, whether reference was made to her husband Joseph, into whose
          family Mary passed by marriage, or to Mary herself. It is most certain
          that heiresses (virgines, epiklhrous) such as the blessed virgin was,
          who received a dowry from the family inheritance, could not marry
          outside their own tribe and family. Luke's genealogy also, therefore,
          refers to Joseph, not to Mary, for it was not customary to prepare a
          genealogy through the women, for they were listed either with their
          parents and brothers if they were unmarried, or with their husbands if
          they were espoused; hence the maxim of the Jews, "the mother's family
          is not the family."
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV Although the father of Joseph is called Jacob by Matthew, and Heli
          by Luke (Matt. 1:16; Luke 3:23), there is no contradiction, because
          this is to be understood as of two different matters (kat' alla kai
          allo). First, it is not absurd for one son to have two fathers in
          different senses, when one is the natural father who begat the son
          from himself, and the other the legal father who adopted him to
          himself from another family by full process of law. In this way
          Manasseh and Ephraim were natural sons of Joseph but legal sons of
          Jacob by adoptions; and Obed the grandfather of David had one natural
          father, Boaz, but also a legal one, Mahlon, the former husband of his
          mother Ruth, to whom Boaz the second husband raised seed according to
          the law. Thus Jacob was the natural father of Joseph, but Heli may be
          called the father of Joseph. This may be either in a legal sense, as
          [Julius] Africanus supposed, because on the death of Heli without
          children, Jacob had married his wife according to the law (Deut.25:5)
          and fathered Joseph, Mary's husband, from her. Or it may be that Heli
          was the natural father of Mary and thus in a civil sense the father of
          Joseph by reason of the marriage contracted by his daughter, through
          which he became a father [-in-law], in which sense Naomi speaks of her
          daughters-in-law as her daughters (Ruth 1:11-12), which manner of
          speaking is in use among all people. Or it may be said that not
          Joseph, but Christ, is son of Heli, the phrase "as was supposed" being
          indeed parenthetical, not meaning, however, as commonly read, "being,
          as was supposed, the son of Joseph," but rather, "Jesus, who was
          supposed to be the son of Joseph, being the son of Heli," that is, his
          grandson, through the Virgin Mary, nor is it improper to pass in this
          manner from grandfather to grandson, especially if the fathers have
          died, and all the more in this case, because Christ was without father
          according to his human nature....

          XXII. In II Samuel 24:24 David is said to buy a threshing floor and
          oxen from Araunah for 50 shekels of silver. In I Chronicles 21:25
          reference is made to 600 shekels of gold. A reconciliation is easy
          from the nature of the transaction: he gave 50 shekels for the part in
          which he first built an altar, but after he learned, through a
          heavenly fire that came down, that this was the place God had chosen
          for the temple, then, not satisfied with the small area, he bought the
          whole field, and the hill, for 600 shekels. . . . XXXIV. When Christ
          forbids swearing "at all" (Matt. 5:34), he does not intend to condemn
          the oath absolutely and simply, for elsewhere it is allowed and
          approved, and it is required by God (Exod.22:8, 10 - 11; Lev. 5:4;
          Num. 5:19 - 20; Prov. 18:18; Heb. 6:16), but rather certain forms of
          oath which were used by the Jews, and which are mentioned in the same
          place, namely, those by heaven, earth, Jerusalem, the head and other
          created things of that nature, all of which are condemned by Christ as
          rash and forbidden. In this way universal terms often are restricted
          to some particular (ad certam speciam), [for example] John 10:8: "All
          who came before me are thieves"; all, that is, who were not called or
          sent, or who said that they themselves or some other was the shepherd
          of the sheep. And I Corinthians 10:23, "All things are lawful to me,'"
          and 9:22, "I have become all things to all"; that is, in matters that
          are lawful and indifferent. Evil and sinful acts are not lawful to
          anyone. . . .

          XXXVI. From the above it is clear that the various difficult passages
          which are used to deny the authority of Scripture, which we have
          illustrated, are not irreconcilable contradictions, although they are
          indeed difficulties. There are also many others which the Roman
          Catholics use to argue the corruption of the sources by Jews and
          heretics, but they will be better dealt with later, when we discuss
          the authoritative version.
