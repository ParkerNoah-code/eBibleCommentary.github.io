        <h2>The Canonicity of the Apocrypha</h2>
        <p>NINTH QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Are Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, the first two books of
            Maccabees, Baruch, and the additions to Esther and Daniel properly
            included in the list of canonical books? Negative, against the Roman
            Catholics.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The apocryphal books are so called not because the authors of the
          books are unknown--there are canonical works whose authors are not
          known and apocryphal ones whose authors are--nor because they are read
          only privately, and not in public [worship]; some of them are indeed
          read in public. They are so called either because they were kept out
          of the chest in which the sacred writings were preserved, as
          Epiphanius and Augustine supposed, or because their authority was
          unclear and suspect and therefore their use was restricted, that is,
          the church did not read them for the purpose of establishing
          ecclesiastical dogmas, as Jerome says in his preface to the Proverbs
          of Solomon; or, which is the more truthful explanation, because they
          are of doubtful and obscure origin, and the obscurity was not cleared
          up by those through whose testimony the authority of Scripture came to
          us, as Augustine says (City of God 5.24 [15.23]).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The question does not involve the books of the Old and New
          Testaments which we regard as canonical; these the Roman Catholics
          also accept. Nor does it involve all apocryphal writings; there are
          some which the Roman Catholics reject no less than we, such as III and
          IV Esdras, III and IV Maccabees, or the prayer of Manassas. But we are
          concerned with Tobit, Judith, Baruch, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, I and II
          Maccabees, and the additions to Esther and Daniel, which the Roman
          Catholics include among the canonical writings. We exclude them, not
          that they are without many true and pious elements, but that they lack
          the marks of the canonical books.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. There are a number of reasons. (1) The Jewish church, to which
          was entrusted the oracles of God (Rom. 3:2), did not accept them,
          using the same canon as we, as Josephus witnesses (Against Apion 1.
          [8]) and as Becanus and Stapleton admit. This could not have been done
          without serious sin (crimen) if these books had been entrusted to them
          on the same terms as the others, but no such charge is ever made
          against them by Christ or by the apostles. At this point no
          distinction ought to be made between the Jewish and the Christian
          canon, because Christians cannot and should not accept any books as
          canonical, except those accepted by the Jews, their book-carriers
          (capsarii), as Augustine calls them-- "who carry the books for us
          students" (commentary on Psalm 60). (2) [The apocryphal books] are
          never cited as canonical by Christ and the apostles as the others are,
          and indeed when Christ divides all the Old Testament books into three
          classes-law, psalms, and prophets (Luke 24:44)--he obviously gave his
          approval to the Jewish canon, and excluded those books which are not
          contained in this classification. (3) Because the Christian church
          accepted the same canon as we, and no other books, for four hundred
          years; this is shown by the canons of the Council of Laodicea (59), by
          Melito, bishop of Sardis, who lived in A.D. 116 (Eusebius, Church
          History 4.25), Epiphanius in his treatment of the Epicureans, Jerome
          in his prologue, Athanasius in his synopsis. (4) Because the authors
          [of the Apocrypha] were not prophets and inspired men, since these
          books were written after Malachi, the last of the prophets, nor were
          they written in Hebrew, like the Old Testament, but in Greek. So
          Josephus says, in the place cited above, that the writings of his
          people after the time of Artaxerxes are not of equal trustworthiness
          and authority with the earlier ones, as not being in the true
          succession of the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. (5) Both the style and the content of these books cry out that
          they are human, not divine, so that anyone who did not realize that
          they were produced by human effort would be a person of little
          insight, although some [of the books] are superior to others. For
          besides the fact that the style does not equal the majesty and
          simplicity of the divine style, but is redolent of the evil and
          weakness of human learning, with folly, flattery, conceit,
          affectation, pseudoerudition and false eloquence, all of which occur
          frequently (non raro), there is in [these books] so much that is not
          only inconsequential and frivolous, but also false, superstitious, and
          contradictory, that it is very plain that [these books] were of human,
          not divine, composition. We give a few examples of the many errors. In
          Tobit lying is attributed to the angel, who in 5:15 [12] calls himself
          Azariah the son of Ananias, and in 12:15 Raphael the angel of the
          Lord. The same [angel] in chapter 6 gives magical guidance for the
          expulsion of a demon by the smoke of a burning fish's liver, contrary
          to the word of Christ (Matt. 17:21). He accepts for himself the
          offering of prayer which is rightful only for Christ (12:12). The book
          of Judith praises (9:2) an act of Simeon that was cursed by Jacob
          (Gen. 49 [:5 - 7]); it praises the lying and deception of Judith,
          which is not consistent with piety (chap. 11); and worse than that, it
          praises her for seeking the blessing of God for her lying and
          deception (9:13). There is no mention of the city of Bethulia in
          Scripture, nor is there any mention of this deliverance [by Judith] in
          either Josephus or Philo, who wrote about Jewish history. The author
          of Wisdom falsely states that he was king in Israel (9:7 - 8), and is
          understood as Solomon, although he mentions athletic contests which
          were not yet being held among the Greeks of Solomon's time (4:2);
          moreover, he presents the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration (8:19
          - 20) and gives a false account of the origin of idols (15:15 -16).
          The son of Sirach attributes to Samuel an act that was the work of an
          evil demon called forth by wicked methods (Ecclesiasticus 46:20; I
          Sam. 28:11), gives a false account of the corporeal return of Elijah
          (de Elia corporaliter reverso) (48:11), and, in the prologue,
          apologizes for his delusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. In the additions to Esther and Daniel there are so many
          contradictory and foolish statements that Sixtus Senensis simply
          rejects them. Baruch says that he read his book to Jeconiah and all
          the people in Babylon in the fifth year after the fall of Jerusalem
          (Baruch 1:2 - 3), when, however, Jeconiah was still in prison, and
          Baruch was in Egypt, taken away with [Jeremiah] after the
          assassination of Gedaliah (Jer. 43:10 [7]). The altar of the Lord is
          mentioned at a time when the temple no longer existed (Baruch 1:10).
          The books of the Maccabees often contradict each other--compare I
          Maccabees 1:16 with 9:5 and 28, and I Maccabees 10. The suicide of
          Razis is praised (II Maccabees 14:42). Will-worship is praised when
          Judas [Maccabeus] offers sacrifices for the dead which are not
          provided for by the law (II Maccabees 12:42). The author apologizes
          for his weakness and infirmity, and comments on the difficulty of
          stitching together his patchwork (cento) out of the five books of
          Jason of Cyrene (II Maccabees 2:24; 15:[38-]39). If anyone should want
          more on these books, let him consult Rainold, Chamierus, Molinaeus,
          Spanheim, and others who have carried on this discussion extensively
          and soundly.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The canon of faith is one thing; the canon of ecclesiastical
          reading is another. We are not discussing the latter, for it is well
          known that these apocryphal books have from time to time been read in
          public worship, but only for the instruction of the people, as Jerome
          says in his preface to the book of Solomon. Likewise the "legends,"
          which are so called from legendum, and which told of the sufferings of
          the martyrs, used to be read in public worship, although not regarded
          as canonical. Here we are discussing the canon of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The word canon is used in two senses by the patristic writers,
          broadly and narrowly. In the former sense it includes not only the
          canon of faith but also that of ecclesiastical reading. In this sense
          the fortyseventh canon of the third Council of Carthage must be
          understood, when it calls the books [of the Apocrypha] canonical, not
          narrowly and with strict accuracy as the canon of faith, but broadly
          as the canon of reading, as the synod, which also desired that the
          "passions of the martyrs" be read, explicitly declared (if indeed this
          canon is not interpolated, since it mentions Pope Boniface, who at
          that time was not yet pope, so that Syrius Monachus calls this a canon
          of the seventh council of Carthage, not the third). Augustine is to be
          understood in the same way when he calls [the Apocrypha] canonical. He
          sets up two classes of canons, one that is accepted by all churches
          and concerning which there is no question; the second which is
          accepted by some, and which was commonly read by both parties, and he
          held this second as not to be esteemed as much as the first, and its
          authority to be much less (Against the Manicheans 2.5). The Apocrypha
          indeed are for him corrupt, false, and dishonest writings; he calls
          them "fables of scriptures which are called apocrypha" (City of God
          5.24 [15.23]). But "canon" is used narrowly for that which had divine
          and infallible authority for proving the dogmas of the faith, and thus
          Jerome uses the word when he excludes [the Apocrypha] from the canon.
          So Augustine uses the word canon more broadly than Jerome, who uses
          the word apocrypha more broadly than Augustine, not only for books
          which are clearly false and mythological, but also for those which,
          although read in church, are not employed for proving the dogmas of
          the faith, so that it is easy to harmonize the words of these Fathers,
          who seem to disagree in this matter. So Cajetan, at the end of his
          commentary on Esther, explains the words of the Fathers: "for Jerome
          the words of councils and fathers are reduced to such a classification
          that they are not canonical, that is, containing rules for the
          establishment of articles of faith, although they can be called
          canonical, that is, containing rules for the edification of believers,
          since they are received into the biblical canon for this purpose,"
          with which teaching Dionysius the Carthusian agrees in his preface to
          Tobit.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. There is no point to the Roman Catholic distinction between the
          canon of the Jews and that of the Christians, for, although our canon
          in its totality means all the books of the Old and New Testaments,
          which are equally part of it, as is not the case with the Jews, who
          reject the New, nevertheless, if the word is used of a part, that is,
          the Old Testament, in which sense we are now discussing, it is certain
          that our canon does not differ from that of the Jews, because they
          have never received any books into the canon except those which we do.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. If among the Fathers there is reference to some deuterocanonical
          works, it is not to be understood that they are in truth and
          univocally canonical with respect to faith, but they are included in
          the canon of reading, on account of many pious and useful contents
          that can serve for edification.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The quotation of a passage does not prove a book to be canonical,
          (1) for if it did, Aratus, Menander, and Epimenides, who are quoted by
          Paul (Acts 17:28; I Cor. 15:33;Titus 1:12) would be canonical, and (2)
          the words which our adversaries claim are quoted from the Apocrypha
          can be found in other canonical books, from which, rather than from
          the Apocrypha, the apostles could have quoted.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. If [the apocryphal books] are joined to the canonical ones, it
          does not follow that they are of equal authority, but only that they
          are useful for the cultivation of morals, and for an understanding of
          the history of [biblical] times, not for the establishment of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Although some apocryphal books, such as Wisdom and
          Ecclesiasticus, are better and purer than others, and contain a number
          of ethical teachings of good content, which have their value, yet
          because they have many other teachings both false and foolish, they
          are wisely excluded from the canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Although some doubted the authenticity of a number of New
          Testament books, such as the Epistle of James, II Peter, II and III
          John, and Revelation, which afterward were held canonical by the
          church, it does not follow that this could happen with respect to the
          apocryphal books, because in this matter the status of Old and New
          Testament books is different. (1) For the books of the Old Testament
          were not given to the Christian church by stages, in temporal
          succession or through parts of the church, but all books belonging to
          it were received from the Jews at one and the same time written in one
          codex, after they had received unquestioned authority, which was
          confirmed by Christ himself and by the apostles. But the books of the
          New Testament were written separately in different times and places,
          and gradually collected into one corpus. Therefore, some of the later
          books, which came later to some churches, especially in remote areas,
          were held in doubt by some, until their authenticity gradually became
          known. (2) Although some Epistles and the Book of Revelation were
          questioned in some churches, yet there were always many more that
          accepted them. But there was never any disagreement over the
          apocryphal books, because they were always rejected by the Jewish
          church.
