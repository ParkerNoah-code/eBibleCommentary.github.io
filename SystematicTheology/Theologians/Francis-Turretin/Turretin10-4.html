          FOURTH QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Whether the free will in a state of sin is so a servant of and
            enslaved by sin that it can do nothing but sin; or whether it still
            has the power to incline itself to good, not only civil and
            externally moral, but internal and spiritual, answering accurately
            to the will of God prescribed in the law. The former we affirm; the
            latter we deny, against the papists, Socinians and Remonstrants</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the preceding question, we treated free will absolutely (as to
          nature, in the genus of being). Now we treat of the same relatively
          (as to the state of sin and its powers in the genus of morals). There
          we saw what it is; now we are to see what it can do in reference to
          good. This is the primary controversy on this head of doctrine between
          us and the Pelagians and semi-Pelagians.
        </p>
        <h2>Statement of the question.</h2>
        <p>
          II. The question is not about the essential freedom from coaction and
          physical necessity (called such with reference to the subject and
          principle because it is always the same everywhere in every state of
          man, as has been said before), but about the accidental freedom from
          the slavery of sin, with reference to the object (about which the will
          is occupied, whether it is only evil or also good).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The question is not about civil and externally moral good. We do
          not deny that some strength still remains in man after the fall as to
          those external and civil good works, so that he can exercise justice
          and temperance, put forth acts of mercy and charity, abstain from
          theft and homicide, and exhibit the operations of similar virtues,
          with the antecedent concourse and general help of God, to which the
          virtues of the heathen belong (of which hereafter); but the question
          is about spiritual and supernatural good, pleasing and acceptable to
          God: whether man in the state of sin is so corrupt that the powers of
          his free will as to the latter good, are not only weakened and
          diminished, but wholly lost, so that he can neither know any saving
          truth, nor do any good thing; or, whether his will is always wavering
          (amphirrepes) and indifferent to each of the opposites. The orthodox
          affirm the former; our opponents affirm the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The question does not concern the natural power or faculty of the
          will (from which proceeds the willing or nilling itself, which can be
          called the first power and the material principle of moral actions).
          This always remains in man and distinguishes him from the brutes.
          Rather the question concerns its moral disposition to willing well
          (which is called the second power or formal principle of those
          actions). As from natural power the willing flows, so from the moral
          disposition flows the willing well.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Therefore the question returns to this—whether unregenerate man
          still has such strength of free will as to be indifferent to good and
          evil and is able not to sin without the grace of regeneration. The
          adversaries affirm; we deny.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Here we have as opponents the old and new Pelagians (who place the
          idol of free will in the citadel) and to make men free, make them
          sacrilegious. Although the more modern anxiously desire to remove the
          odious name and doctrine of Pelagius from themselves (nor dare to
          profess openly what he maintained, that man could by his own strength
          do something for the heavenly life), still they agree with him no
          less, while they are not ashamed to associate man and God in the
          business of salvation as partial causes. Thus they hold that the
          strength of free will even to good survives in fallen man. Concerning
          the Socinians, it is clear. “For if in the first man,” says Socinus,
          “before the fall there was free will, there is no reason why he should
          be deprived of it on account of the fall, since neither the nature of
          the thing itself demands, nor the justice of God suffers it”
          (Praelectionis theologicae 5 [1627], p. 14 [13]). However, although he
          afterwards confesses that there is in man after sin a great proclivity
          to sinning and feeble strength to do what the law commands, still he
          holds that it is not so small “as that man, the help of God
          approaching” (i.e., external help, as he interprets it) “if he wishes,
          to do violence to himself, cannot obey the divine law.” Volkelius
          maintains the same opinion and others with him (De vera Religione 5.18
          [1630], pp. 544—49).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. As to the papists, although sometimes seeming to acknowledge the
          depravation of nature and to press the necessity of grace, still they
          do not cease to extol beyond measure the strength of free will. Thus
          Bellarmine asserts that “man in things pertaining to piety and
          salvation can do or will nothing without the special grace of God”
          (“De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio,” 6.4 in Opera [1858], 4:438). Also
          “that man cannot by his own strength dispose himself to grace, or do
          anything on account of which divine grace is bestowed upon him”
          (ibid.). Elsewhere he takes off this mask when he maintains and
          endeavors to prove that “man can without special help do some moral
          good, if no temptation presses” (ibid., 5.9, p. 391). Nor does the
          Council of Trent have a different bearing when in Session 6 it
          denounces an anathema upon him who says that “the free will, moved and
          excited by God, cooperates nothing with him assenting and calling, by
          which it disposes and prepares itself to the grace of justification,
          nor can dissent if it wishes” (Canon 4, Schroeder, p. 42). Also “if
          anyone says that after the sin of Adam the free will was lost and
          extinguished ...” (Canon 5, ibid., p. 43). Not to refer here to the
          similitudes used by them to describe the sinner (such as that of a
          sick and wounded man whose strength is indeed weakened and broken, but
          not wholly lost; and of a fettered and chained man, who indeed has
          strength, but cannot exert it unless unbound). Nor can they think
          differently who pretend that its indifferency (adiaphorian) always
          remains to the will and hold that there are good dispositions and
          merits of congruity in man to grace. Still it is true that not a few
          papists (as many of the Thomists, Dominicans and especially the
          Jansenists) hold a different opinion, acknowledging the total
          inability (adynamian) of man and earnestly contending against the idol
          of free will.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. As to the Remonstrants, so plausibly indeed do they establish
          the corruption of man and the necessity of grace that it would appear
          that nothing beyond could be said when they confess that “man in the
          state of defection and sin can of himself think, will, or do nothing
          good, which indeed is truly good, such as saving faith, but that it is
          necessary for him to be regenerated, renewed in mind, affections, or
          will, and all his faculties by God in Christ through his Holy Spirit,
          to be able to know, will and perform any good thing” (Collato scripto
          habita Hagae Comitis, Art. 3 [1615], p. 225). They said this because
          it was an odious thing to impugn openly the grace of God. But if we
          search more deeply into their mind, it will plainly appear that they
          (no less than the papists) contend for the idol of free will and again
          call back Pelagianism when they make freedom of will to consist in
          indifference (adiaphoria) and assert free will to be flexible in
          either direction even without grace, according to Arminius (“Jacobi
          Armini ... Examen Modestium Libelli ... Gulielmus&#x27; Perkinsius...
          de Praedestinationis,” in Opera Theologica [1631], p. 604). They
          always make grace resistible, so that it is always in the power of
          man’s will to receive or reject it. They acknowledge that spiritual
          life in the animal man is not wholly separated from the mind, nor
          truly and properly from the will and that the will remains so free in
          itself that it can be excited to good before it is properly made alive
          or receives any new strength (Collatio scripto habita Hagae Comitis
          [1615], p. 298). They say with Grevinchovius (pages 209, 210+) that
          the grace of God and the free will are at the same time “partial
          causes” or “co-causes”; so that the free will can indeed do nothing by
          itself (that is alone), but still can do something with grace. All
          these things sufficiently indicate that whatever they loudly proclaim
          about the corruption of nature is said for the purpose of raising a
          smoke, to deceive the incautious reader and that their genuine opinion
          is that the free will has still sufficient strength to work its own
          salvation with grace. Nor would they so laboriously endeavor to meet
          all the arguments by which we are in the habit of proving inability
          (adynamian), unless they felt themselves to be attacked; so that you
          can really perceive that they are pleading their own cause. On the
          other hand, the orthodox, although maintaining that the free will of
          man always remains as to essentials, still think that no power to good
          survives in it.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The impotency of free will is proved: (1) from the servitude of sin.
        </h2>
        <p>
          IX. The reasons are: (1) man is called the “servant” of sin (Jn. 8:43)
          and a servant so bound by the fetters of concupiscence as to yield his
          members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin (eis anomian); and
          to be under the dominion of sin (Rom. 6:12, 14) who, bound by Satan,
          is brought into bondage to him (2 Pet. 2:19); under whom, as the
          prince of this world, he fulfils evil desires and does what pleases
          him whom nothing but evil pleases (Jn. 8:44); and in whom he most
          efficaciously works (Eph. 2:2); who, finally, cannot be brought into
          liberty except by Christ, the deliverer (Jn. 8:36). Now who would say
          that this most miserable slavery in evil can consist with the golden
          liberty to good; that the sinner enslaved to the flesh can do anything
          to free himself from the yoke of tyranny to which he has voluntarily
          submitted? Especially since that servitude (although most burdensome)
          still is pleasing to him and so far from desiring or seeking liberty,
          he rather kisses his chains and refuses deliverance. However in order
          to express more strongly the severity of this servitude, the Scripture
          attributes to us all kinds of servitude (as well of those who are born
          in a servile condition at home who are called “family slaves” when it
          says that we are “by nature the children of wrath,” Eph. 2:3) and
          therefore servants of punishment (as of those who were bought with a
          price and taken in war, when it asserts that we are sold under sin and
          driven into captivity by corruption and by Satan, Rom. 7:14; 2 Pet.
          2:19; 1 Tim. 3:7; Heb. 2:14, 15).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The objection is vain: (1) that the servitude of sin is not opposed
          to the liberty of the sinner because he serves not necessarily, but
          freely. We answer that although it is not opposed to the liberty of
          nature (by which he differs from brutes, because he always acts
          spontaneously whatever he pleases), yet it is opposed to liberty from
          sin (concerning which we dispute) because he is held so bound by
          conquering and enslaving desires that although he sins most freely,
          still he sins necessarily and cannot help sinning. (2) That believers
          are called the servants of righteousness who nevertheless are not free
          from all sin; so men can be the servants of sin although some liberty
          to good still survives in them. We answer that the nature of these two
          kinds of servitude is diverse. For the servitude of righteousness
          (which is true liberty) is not perfect in this world on account of the
          remains of sin adhering to us (from which we are not freed before
          death). Rather the servitude of sin is full and entire, so that man
          perfectly serves sin and lives wholly in it. Besides, when Paul thus
          speaks (Rom. 6:18), he refers not so much to the very life of
          believers as to their duty (to wit, that being freed from sin they
          should devote themselves wholly to God and indulge in not even the
          slightest sin, not otherwise than before they were entirely bound to
          sin and did not even dream of God). (3) That servitude does prevent
          man from being able to shake off the yoke of sin by his own strength,
          but does not hinder him from being able to be freed from sin by free
          will with the assistance of grace. We answer that man is able to be
          freed by free will with the help of God is said ambiguously. For
          either it is understood of passive liberation, that the free will
          itself may be delivered by grace (which we grant); or of active
          liberation, by which the free will applies itself to the assisting
          grace of God and by its own powers (although not alone) cooperates
          with it (which we deny).
        </p>
        <h2>(2) From spiritual death, Eph. 2:1.</h2>
        <p>
          XI. Second, man is “dead in sin” (Eph. 2:1), not only on account of
          afflictions (which in Scripture are called so many deaths, 2 Cor.
          11:23); not only on account of the mortality of the body (which on
          account of sin is said to be dead, Rom. 8:10); or on account of the
          guilt of eternal death (in which sense the Lord says that the
          unbelieving shall die in their sins, Jn. 8:21, 24); but especially on
          account of the dissolution of union with God and the privation of
          holiness (which is truly life, as the life passed in sin is not life),
          and they are dead who live in the pleasures of the world (1 Tim. 5:6).
          The same impotence therefore in the dead man to restore himself to
          life must be said to be in the sinner as to obtaining good or
          spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. To escape and blunt the point of this dart (which troubles them
          sorely), the adversaries make various objections here. First, the
          similitude should not be pressed because there are various differences
          between a dead man and the sinner. We answer that as we do not deny
          that this simile is dissimilar in various points, so it is precise in
          the point which the Holy Spirit especially urges here (viz., as the
          dead man is deprived of the life of nature and so of all sense and
          motion, so the sinner is destitute of the life of grace and loses all
          spiritual sense and motion; so that he can neither know anything true
          nor do anything good, any more than a dead man can bring himself to
          life). (2) This death does not hinder what little remains of spiritual
          life from surviving in sinful man sufficient to know God and to
          worship him in some measure. We answer that such remains do not kindle
          spiritual life or hinder the death (properly so called) of the soul
          because they are not of the same order and species with the spiritual
          life bestowed on us by Christ. They can also exist in the hardened
          (yea even in Satan himself, who although of most acute sight, does not
          cease to be dead, in its proper sense, in sin). (3) They who are said
          to be dead are also termed “sleepers” and “sick” to intimate that
          strength survives in them (although bound and hindered). We answer
          that this ought not to seem a wonder since in Scripture the dead are
          said to sleep and their resurrection is (as it were) a rousing from
          sleep: “Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead” (Eph. 5:14).
          In this sense, the death of Christ is called a blow, a stripe and
          wound. Thus Scripture uses various similitudes to describe the same
          thing; not that one and another should be considered apart or one be
          weakened by the other, but rather that what is wanting in one the
          other may supply. Thus the same sinner compared in some to a sick man
          and a sleeper, in others is well represented by a dead man in order
          that we may know that there is here not only a binding of the senses
          or feebleness of life, but a total extinction of life and privation of
          strength. (4) Death in sin designates rather the state of condemnation
          and the punishment of death with which they are to be visited, than
          the state of corruption in which they lie: “When the righteous turneth
          away from his righteousness, he shall die in his sin” (Ezk. 18:24);
          “Ye shall die in your sins” (Jn. 8:24). We answer that to be dead in
          sin in the past differs from to be about to die in the future. The
          former denotes a state of punishment to be brought on. The latter
          however denotes the state of present corruption. (5) Finally,
          believers are said to “be dead to sin” who nevertheless are not
          destitute of strength to sin; so they can be called dead in sins who
          still have some strength left for good. We answer that to “be dead to
          sin” differs from “being dead in sin.” That is said of believers who
          so crucify the old man as to abolish the body of sin and have no more
          intercourse with it, nor are any longer under its dominion, since laws
          have no power over the dead. But this is said of sinners who, being
          destitute of the life of God, walk in sins and lie entirely in them.
          Therefore, the phrases are diametrically opposed to each other; the
          one is not to be thoughtlessly explained by the other. Again “to die
          to sin” marks a total abolition of sin: (1) as well with reference to
          justification, so that its guilt is entirely taken away, and there is
          now no condemnation to believers (Rom. 8:1), as with reference to
          sanctification (if not as to fulfillment, still as to baptism—the
          symbol of entire regeneration); (2) as to duty, as believers are said
          to be perfect and holy because they ought to be so; thus they are
          called dead to sin because they are bound to extinguish and devote to
          death sin in themselves; (3) as to event because this will certainly
          and undoubtedly be the case; for thus the Scriptures speak of such,
          just as if they had already actually reached it.
        </p>
        <h2>(3) From the blindness and hardening of man.</h2>
        <p>
          XII. Third, man has no strength for heavenly things either in his
          intellect or will from which faculties the free will arises. For as to
          the intellect (the eye of the mind), not only is he called “blind” and
          “darkened in mind” (Eph. 4:18), but also “darkness itself”: “Ye were
          sometime darkness” (Eph. 5:8). As to the will, not only is he said to
          have a “depraved” and “deceitful” heart to be corrected, “unclean” to
          be purged, “shut up” to be opened, “uncircumcised” to be circumcised,
          but “stony” (Ezk. 36:26), which ought to be broken and taken away,
          rather than what is able to be softened and admit life. As therefore
          the blind man (especially from nature) has no power to see, and he who
          has a stony heart is devoid of sense and motion, so the sinner can
          know nothing true, nor do anything good, no more than a blind man can
          see or a stone think or move itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Nor in passing must we omit the figure of the stony heart (Ezk.
          36:26). It is most emphatic (emphatikotaton) whether drawn from
          natural things (as from the culture of fields and the seed which does
          not take root when thrown upon a stony place) or from the nature of
          spirit and life (of which a stone is not a receptive [dektikon]
          subject) or from the origin of waters (which cannot be pressed out of
          stones except by a miracle) or from artificial things, as from the
          sculptor’s art (because a stone is not ductile or malleable, but
          hard—rather to be broken than softened). As a stone neither is a
          subject receptive (dektikon) of life nor can feel or be moved or
          turned or softened, but is inflexible, insensible and impenetrable; so
          the heart of the unregenerate hardened in sin neither possesses
          spiritual life nor can dispose itself to it, but is inflexible to the
          Spirit, insensible to the word and the judgments of God, impenetrable
          to grace. It not only does not receive grace, but resists and
          obstinately struggles against it. Moreover, God wished to give a plain
          symbol of this thing in the writing of the law upon stony tables to
          intimate that the law is bore in a stony heart and cannot turn it
          (because devoid of the Spirit); but the gospel is borne in the fleshy
          tables of the heart because, animated by a life-giving spirit, it
          renews hearts and turns them to obedience (2 Cor. 3:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. To weaken the force of this argument, it is vainly objected: (1)
          that they are also called “blind” who believe the gospel (as the
          Laodiceans, Rev. 3:17), not because they could not understand at all,
          but because they were too negligent in doing their duty. We answer
          that there is one blindness (comparative and relative) attributed to
          the angel of Laodicea, on account of the vain boasting in which he
          indulged, as if he was rich and could see, while he should have
          professed that he was by nature poor, naked and blind. There is
          another, however, absolute and total, ascribed to the unregenerate,
          depriving them of all saving knowledge. (2) That believers are called
          “light in the Lord” (Eph. 5:8) who nevertheless are beclouded with
          their own darkness. We answer that the consequence does not hold good
          from the pious to the impious. They are called “light” not in
          themselves, but “in the Lord” (to wit, inasmuch as they are new
          creatures made by him, although not without darkness, because they are
          not as yet perfectly regenerated). But in the wicked there is not a
          double man, but only one nature—totally unregenerate and pure
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. No more solid is the argument brought against the similitude of
          the stony heart, that it is a figurative expression not to be pressed.
          We answer that figurative expressions have the force of common
          expressions when they are explained by Scripture itself, and when it
          is clear in what sense and for what purpose they are used. As in
          Ezekiel many simple words occur, explaining the figure itself, as that
          in the same place God promises to give “a new heart” and “a new
          spirit,” in order that we may walk in his ways. In vain, however, does
          Arnoldus (Corvinus) anxiously bring together the differences between
          the heart and a stone. In the one thing (concerning which it is here
          treated), the comparison is most apt (to wit, that just as a stone
          cannot soften itself, nor of itself become flesh, so neither can the
          unregenerate heart turn or dispose itself to regeneration; rather that
          can be done by the sole efficacy of God’s Spirit).
        </p>
        <h2>(4) From the passages which attribute impotence to man.</h2>
        <p>
          XVII. Fourth, Scripture everywhere attributes to sinners inability
          (adynamian) to good, when it is said that the imagination of the
          thoughts of man is evil continually from youth (Gen. 6:5), the force
          of which passage we have explained before. So Christ says “without me
          ye can do nothing” (Jn. 15:5). He does not say, without me ye can do
          little or can do something with difficulty, but without me ye can do
          nothing. He does not say, without me ye do nothing or will do nothing,
          but ye can do nothing (which excludes not only the act, but the power
          itself). Thus Paul: “The natural man receiveth not the things of the
          Spirit of God: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
          discerned” (1 Cor. 2:14). “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to
          think anything of ourselves” (2 Cor. 3:5). “The carnal mind is not
          subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be” (Rom. 8:7). “Neither
          can a corrupt tree” (such as men are by nature) “bring forth good
          fruit” (Mt. 7:18); not only does not, but cannot bring forth because
          the effect is like the cause. “How can ye, being evil, speak good
          things?” (Mt. 12:34). “No man can come to me, except the Father draw
          him” (Jn. 6:44). Now why should the Holy Spirit so often insist upon
          that impotence except to take away from man all power to good and
          ascribe to grace alone the entire work of regeneration and salvation?
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Falsely is it said here: (1) that “not to be able” does not
          always denote absolute inability (adynamian), but only its unusualness
          (i.e., that the thing is not accustomed to be done ordinarily or is
          not done easily). We answer that those passages prove that total
          impotence is meant and such that it is no more possible for man to
          overcome than for a dead man to raise himself, an Ethiopian to change
          his skin, a leopard to change his spots and a corrupt tree to bring
          forth good fruit. Otherwise if the Holy Spirit had intended to mark
          only the difficulty of the thing, why did he not think it sufficient
          to assert that the natural man receiveth not the things of God? Yet he
          immediately adds “neither can he”; not only that the flesh is not
          subject to the law, but “neither indeed can be” and the like (which
          clearly intimate that Paul takes away from man not only the act, but
          also the very power of doing good).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Nor do they make a better escape who pretend this impotence to be
          moral, not natural; and thus a thing not absolutely and simply
          impossible to man, but that man can do it if he wishes. We answer that
          whether this impotence be called natural or moral (of which
          hereafter), it is certainly inextricable to man. In vain is it said
          that man can do this or that if he will, since it is evident that he
          is not able to will; not because he is destitute of natural power to
          will (because thus he differs from brutes), but because he is without
          the disposition to will what is good (concerning which alone we are
          speaking in this question).
        </p>
        <h2>(5) From 1 Cor. 4:7.</h2>
        <p>
          XX. Fifth, man cannot separate himself from another and possesses
          nothing good which he has not received from another source. “Who
          maketh thee to differ?” says Paul (1 Cor. 4:7). “And what hast thou
          that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost
          thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?” And yet if after the
          fall the free will has still some strength by which it can dispose
          itself to good and admit the offered grace, man will make himself to
          differ from another and will have what he had not received and of
          which he may boast because the admission of grace (his own act)
          distinguishes him from another who rejects it. Thus man will rightly
          be called the architect of his own fortune, and the principal cause of
          his conversion and difference from others. Nor does the objection
          avail that man cannot do this without the grace of the Holy Spirit
          operating through the word. We answer that whatever may be held as to
          the action of the Holy Spirit through the word (since the word is
          presented equally both to the elect and the reprobate, and common
          things do not make a difference), the reason of the difference between
          one and another (why this one believes, that one does not) cannot
          depend upon the word or the Spirit operating through the word alone,
          for it ought to have had the same effect upon both. Rather it depends
          upon the free will, which in the one determines him to receive grace;
          in the other, however, to reject it. And the more certainly is this
          proved that on the hypothesis of our adversaries (whatever may be the
          operation of grace posited), the will always remains in equilibrium,
          so that it can use it or not. When, therefore, it makes a good use of
          it, it owes this to itself, not to the grace which is common.
          Bellarmine does not conceal this while he reproves Molina and his
          followers (without mentioning his name). “Cannot the believer say that
          he is distinguished from the unbeliever by free will because he
          received the inspiration which the other rejects? Could he not glory
          against the unbeliever because he cooperated with the grace of God
          which he despised? But the apostle prohibits all this” (“De Gratia et
          Libero Arbitrio,” 1.12 in Opera [1858], 4:291). No more successfully
          do they extricate themselves who wish the divine motion to be
          considered as twofold: either absolutely in itself (and so in thesi to
          be indifferent); or relatively with respect to the annexed congruity
          (as Bellarmine has it) or with respect to the due application (as
          others), and that hence arises the difference because the same alms do
          not affect equally the sated and the starving. For that congruous
          application of grace must either be referred to grace itself alone or
          to the free will alone or to both. If to the will, either in whole or
          in part—then Pelagius has conquered, not Paul. If to grace alone, then
          the idol of free will is demolished and grace will not be equal
          because a congruous application was wanting to one which the grace of
          another included. Nor ought it to be said that inequality of grace is
          granted in the genus of blessings, but not in the genus of motions;
          that the Same motion of grace is applied to both on the part of God,
          but on account of the diverse dispositions of the objects and the
          opportunity seized by the offerer it produces different effects. For
          if, on account of the diverse dispositions of those to be converted, a
          different effect of the same motion results, this difference (whatever
          it may be) does not flow from the grace, but from the promptitude of
          the recipient superadded. Therefore he makes himself to differ
          (contrary to Paul) and has what he did not receive, whence he may
          glory.
        </p>
        <h2>(6) Because the work of grace is a creation.</h2>
        <p>
          XXI. Sixth, the work of our conversion is a creation, resurrection,
          regeneration and the production of a new heart by which God not only
          gently persuades but powerfully effects in us to will and to do. As,
          however, man can contribute nothing to his creation, resurrection and
          regeneration, so neither can the sinner contribute anything to his
          conversion. He ought rather to ascribe it wholly to the grace of God.
          Nor is it an objection that the same action ascribed to God in
          conversion is often also enjoined upon man (as when we are commanded
          to rise and make for ourselves a new heart, Ezk. 18:31; Eph. 5:14). We
          answer that although conversion is enjoined upon us by God as a duty
          owed to him, it does not cease on that account to be promised as a
          gift by God in the covenant of grace; so that as it were a twofold
          conversion must be conceived (or rather two parts of one
          conversion)—one brought about by God, the other by man (of which the
          church speaks, “Turn thou us unto thee, and we shall be turned,” Lam.
          5:21). The former precedes, the latter follows; that is always
          ascribed to God (not to man), this always to man, never to God. In the
          former, the will is acted upon and does not act; in the latter, it is
          acted upon and acts (or itself reacts) when first acted upon by God.
          In the first, the grace of God is called “operating” because it alone
          operates; in the second, “cooperating” because now it operates not
          only in the will but with it. In the first, the will is a passive
          subject, but both capacious and conscious of grace; in the second, it
          is not only a capacious subject, but also a fit and living instrument
          of divine grace, being its “handmaid” (as Augustine frequently terms
          it) and an animated organ (organon empsychon). These words of Berard
          apply here: “What does the free will do? I answer briefly, It is
          saved. This work cannot be accomplished without two: one by whom it is
          done, the other in whom it is done; God the author of salvation; the
          free will only capacious of it” (Tractatus de Gratia et Libero
          Arbitrio [PL 182.1002]). And these of Hugo St. Victor: “Repairing
          grace breathes first into the free will that it may exist, then
          inspires it that it may be moved; first it works it, then through it”
          (On the Sacraments of the Christian Faith 1.6.17 [trans. R.J.
          Defarrari, 1951], p. 106; PL 176.274).
        </p>
        <h2>Sources of solution.</h2>
        <p>
          XXII. When God sets before the Israelites the choice between life and
          death (Dt. 30:15) and wishes their conversion (Dt. 32:29), he
          addresses those already instructed and enlightened that they may work
          in accordance with the liberty given. He does not address unbelievers
          and those lying in native depravity and darkness (of whom we now
          treat). Again, if any were still unregenerate in a state of sin (as
          undoubtedly many of them were according to 1 Cor. 10:5 and Heb. 4:6,
          9), he does not at the same time give them in this way for choosing
          good, the power to chose it without grace. Rather he teaches their
          duty that they may know what it is better for them to choose, and what
          they ought to seek from God, that through the promised grace they may
          be able to choose it. Finally, if they are unwilling to choose the
          good, they would be rendered inexcusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. God’s commands are not the measure of strength, but a rule of
          duty. They do not teach what we are now able, but what we are bound to
          do; what we could formerly do and from how great a height of
          righteousness we have been precipitated by Adam’s fall. Nor is it
          always true that the precepts which cannot be fulfilled are unjust.
          The intemperate man who has rendered himself callous by habit and
          cannot restrain himself from lust or drunkenness (habit being turned
          into nature) is still bound by the laws of sobriety and temperance. So
          from the debtor (who has lost by gambling a large sum of money
          borrowed on interest) not in vain nor unjustly is the debt demanded
          nor has the creditor lost his right by the crime of the debtor. Since,
          then, man by his own fault has contracted an inability to obey God,
          not in vain nor unjustly does God demand from him the obedience which
          he owes. It is not just that sin should be an advantage to man and he
          be irresponsible because he has corrupted himself by his own crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Although man cannot fulfill the commands enjoined upon him,
          still they cannot be called useless because they always obtain the end
          intended by God. For instance: (1) representation of God’s right and
          man’s duty; (2) a proposition of the rule of righteousness, that no
          one can offer ignorance as an excuse for his sins; (3) a conviction of
          our impotence, that it being recognized, we may the more earnestly
          seek the assistance of grace. Augustine urges, “O man, in precepts
          acknowledge what you ought to do; in correction know that you do not
          possess by your own fault; in prayer recognize whence you may receive
          what you desire to have” (Admonition and Grace 3 [5] [FC 2:249-50; PL
          44.918—19]). In particular, the ends of uses of the commands are
          multiplied with regard both to the pious and the impious. As to the
          former, the precepts serve to prepare them for the reception of grace
          by a consciousness of their own impotence; (2) to begin and carry
          forward the work of regeneration itself because the gospel commands
          are not only imperative, but also operative (which, with the
          prescription of duty, have the power of the Spirit working within what
          it commands without). As to the impious, however, the commands tend
          first to a knowledge of duty and of their own impotence; (b) to the
          affording of external obedience which can in some measure be done by
          them (Rom. 2:14, 15); (c) to reveal their latent hypocrisy and
          wickedness—to their inexcusableness (anapologesin) and just
          condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. No one is bound to an impossibility: (1) such absolutely and
          simply and in every state, for which man does not now have and never
          had power; but it does not hold good of that which is such relatively
          and in a certain state only (such as is the impotence of the sinner).
          (2) It holds good of an altogether involuntary and purely physical
          impossibility, arising either from coaction (as he who is bound with
          chains cannot run) or from a defect of natural power (such as the
          inability in the blind to see, in the dead to rise). But it does not
          hold good of an induced (epispasto) voluntary impossibility, arising
          from a depravation of powers and joined with great willingness of mind
          (such as the inability [adynamia] of the sinner). Although, therefore,
          the blind man is in vain ordered to see and the dead to rise (and they
          cannot be blamed for not seeing or not rising), the sinner is not
          forthwith in vain ordered to convert himself. The blind man, being
          deprived of the faculty of sight, is not bound any more to see; nor is
          the dead man (life being lost) bound to restore it to himself; but
          there is no impotence of man which absolves him from the debt of
          obedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. From the words of God to Cain (Gen. 4:7), nothing can be drawn
          to favor the strength of free will. Neither when he asks him, “Why art
          thou wroth?” For these words indeed show that he had no cause and
          reason for anger, but do not absolutely imply that Cain was able not
          to be angry. Again, although he might have been able not to be angry
          in the divided sense (because man is not necessarily determined to
          this or that sin), it does not follow that he was able to do any work
          truly good. Nor from what is added, “If thou doest well, shalt thou
          not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.”
          For thus is indeed denoted the connection of antecedent with
          consequent, between a good work and the reward, sin and punishment;
          but it is not implied that man has the power to do well. Nor from
          those which the adversaries insist upon especially: “Under thee shall
          be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.” First because it is not
          said “under thee,” but “unto thee” (pros se). (2) Although the
          relative should be referred to sin, it would point out only the duty
          of Cain (viz., to bring sin into subjection to himself and not his
          strength or the event). (3) It cannot be referred to sin, whether
          taken properly for the crime or improperly for its punishment (in
          which sense the words immediately preceding must be taken—‘sin lieth
          at the door’). This is evident from various reasons: from the scope;
          for what would the liberty of will ruling over sin conduce to the
          hatred conceived by Cain against Abel, or the assigning the cause why
          Abel’s sacrifice had been more pleasing to God? Again, although the
          desire of man can be said to be in some measure towards sin, still not
          without absurdity is the desire of sin or of punishment said to be
          “under man” or “unto man.” Third, it is unheard of in Scripture that
          man (especially one unrenewed, as Cain) rules over sin, since on the
          contrary he is everywhere called the servant of sin. But this is best
          referred to Abel, both because this phrase is always used elsewhere of
          a person and not of a thing. Thus God addressing Eve: “Thy desire
          shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee” (Gen. 3:16, 17).
          Nor because the pronoun “his” manifestly denotes the subject of the
          desire, which is no other than Abel himself (whose name, indeed, in
          this conversation of God with Cain is not expressed, but whose case,
          however, is treated of); for neither was Cain angry with any other one
          than his brother; nor does the address of God have any other object
          than to soothe his mind. This follows principally by three arguments:
          first, to teach him that the reason why he was not esteemed by God as
          his brother was not in his brother but in himself, who had not done
          well—“TIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?” Second, if he
          continues to do badly, he would not escape punishment—“if thou doest
          not well, sin lieth at the door” (i.e., the punishment of sin
          overhangs and is prepared for thee). Third, he should cherish his
          brother and subject him to him by the love as it were of a first born:
          as if he should say, Is it just for you to be angry with or to injure
          your younger brother who is under your power, whom therefore you are
          bound to love and from whom as an inferior you need expect no injury?
          Thus the Septuagint explains the words pros se hé apostrophé autou (to
          wit, of Abel, not “of sin” [hamartias]; cf. Chrysostom, “Homily 18*,”
          In Genesin [PG 53.158], Cyril of Alexandria, In Genesin 1* [PG
          69.31-—50], Procopius, Commentarii in Genesin [PG 87.240] and others).

          XXVII. Common works are attributed to the wicked and the pious, such
          as “to love,” “to do good,” “to lend” (Lk. 6:32, 33), but only in
          external appearance before men, not however of internal goodness
          before God. Of this kind were the sacrifices of Abel and of Cain (Gen.
          4:3, 4); the gift of the rich man and of the poor widow (Lk. 21:1, 2);
          the prayers of the Pharisee and of the publican (Lk. 18:10—13).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVIII. It is one thing “to do the things contained in the law” as to
          preception (i.e., to perform the office of the law, in commanding,
          prohibiting, promising and threatening); another, however, to do them
          as to obedience, by fulfilling its commands. The former is said of the
          Gentiles (Rom. 2:14, 15), who (since they have not the written law)
          “are a law unto themselves,” as their conscience does the things
          contained in the law by commanding and prohibiting. Nor if their
          thoughts are said to excuse them, this is not to be understood in the
          court of heaven, but of earth; nor from the whole, but from so much,
          in those who by abstaining from heavier crimes are not indeed
          absolutely better than others, but only less evil. Otherwise Paul
          wandered far from his design, for he declares in the same place that
          the Gentiles who sin without law, shall perish without law.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIX. The example of the midwives does not help our opponents (Ex.
          1:15). First, they were not Egyptians, but Hebrews. Even if the
          Scriptures did not tell us when it calls them “Hebrew midwives,” still
          the very names Shiphrah and Puah (the two who seem to have held the
          chief place among many others), which have a Hebrew origin, would
          sufficiently teach. Nor is it very likely that the Hebrew women had
          not obstetricians of their own nation, especially since there was a
          mutual alienation between the Egyptians and Hebrews. Again, even if
          they were Egyptians (as many after Josephus maintain, AJ 2.206 [Loeb,
          4:253]), their fearing God would indeed imply that they were
          influenced with some fear and reverence for him from the remains of
          natural light and sense of conscience (which dictated to them that the
          slaughter of innocent infants would be detestable to God). However it
          does not prove that they were also filled with a filial fear of God
          springing from faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXX. No more to the purpose is the example of Rahab, the harlot,
          because by faith she is said to have received the spies and to have
          obtained salvation (Heb. 11:31); or of Cornelius (Acts 10:31), whose
          alms came into the sight of God, and who is called “a just man, of
          good report, and one that feareth God” (dikaios, eusebés, kai
          phoboumenos ton Theon, v. 35). These praises cannot belong to the
          unregenerate and unbelieving. Cornelius, therefore, was a Gentile by
          birth, but in religion a proselyte. He believed with the Jews in the
          Messiah about to come, although he did not yet know him to be Jesus
          who had come (which he was taught by Peter). His faith, therefore,
          could increase and be strengthened by the preaching of Peter that he
          might know Jesus in hypothesi to be the Messiah, but had not just then
          its beginning. He had, therefore, before an implicit, if not explicit
          knowledge of Christ; and the Spirit as to ordinary gifts and grace
          making acceptable (although not as to extraordinary gifts and as to
          grace given to the grateful).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXI. All that is adduced concerning the virtues of the heathen shows
          indeed that there still remains in fallen man some strength for
          external and civil good (especially when special help is granted unto
          them, without which they could not perform even this). But this does
          not prove that he has any ability in reference to spiritual good, as
          will hereafter be more fully shown.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXII. Man is called a “coworker” (synergos) with God (1 Cor. 3:9),
          not as corrupt, but as renewed (who acts from the grace bestowed upon
          him). Again, he is not speaking there properly about cooperation to
          repentance, but to ecclesiastical functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXIII. When Paul says, “I labored more abundantly than they all: yet
          not I, but the grace of God which was with me” (1 Cor. 15:10), he does
          not wish to divide the cause of the good work between himself and
          grace. Rather he ascribes the whole to grace, as is evident to one
          attending to the Greek text. The apostle does not say hé charis theou
          syn emoi (“grace of God with me,” as the Vulgate improperly renders
          it), but he charis tou theou, hé syn emoi (“the grace of God which was
          with me”). Thus he does not wish to come into a companionship of
          labor, but what he had said of himself, he corrects by a certain
          epanorthosis and wishes to ascribe it to grace alone. Finally, this
          labor has reference to his ministry and not to his regeneration.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXIV. Although God is said “to stand at the door” (Rev. 3:20) and to
          “knock,” it does not follow that man has the power to open it of
          himself. Either he stands by the regenerate and knocks that they may
          use the grace already bestowed to open it by faith and obedience; or
          by the unregenerate who are either elected (to whom by knocking he
          gives by the Spirit the strength to open) or the reprobate (whose
          heart is not knocked at in vain, but in order to manifest that man is
          justly condemned, since God has witheld none of those things which
          conduce to conversion).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXV. From innocent to corrupt man the consequence does not hold. The
          Son of Sirach treats of the former, not of the latter when he says
          “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his
          counsel” (15:14) (in order to describe the state of innocence and the
          condition and liberty of the first man). Nor if life and death, good
          and evil, should be said to be set before corrupt man (in order that
          he might obtain that which he himself chose) should the liberty of
          positive indifference to either opposite be ascribed to him. Rather
          only a rational liberty should be ascribed to him that he may do
          nothing except what is done spontaneously and deliberately.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXVI. Although the unrenewed can be unwilling to come and can resist
          the call of God, it does not follow that they can equally will to come
          and follow that call. The former is a disease and imperfection of men
          so peculiar to them in the state of fallen nature that they can
          neither do nor will anything else. The latter belongs to restoration
          by grace and its special work in us. Therefore the censures and
          rebukes administered to them do not show what good they are able, but
          are in duty bound to do, and how voluntarily they have broken its
          laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXVII. The evils of punishment are deservedly said to be inflicted
          upon sinners for their crimes (Jer. 32:23), not because they were able
          to act rightly in their state of natural corruption (the contrary of
          which Jeremiah himself teaches: “Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or
          the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed
          to do evil,” Jer. 13:23), but because this is the law of God—that they
          who do such things are worthy of death. Nor in the punishment of
          crimes ought attention to be paid to what men could do, but what they
          are in duty bound to do. It suffices for their conviction that they
          commit evil deliberately, willingly and of their own accord, against
          what they knew perfectly well should be done by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXVIII. The cause of the difference between good and bad men, better
          and worse, is not to be sought in their natural indifference and
          inclination to good equally with evil without grace. For we are all
          born equally prone to evil; nor is anyone found better or worse than
          another. Rather it consists with respect to the regenerate in
          distinguishing grace by which they are separated from others (1 Cor.
          4:7). However, with respect to the unregenerate, it consists in the
          operation of common providence by which God does not indeed cleanse
          and renew the nature, but restrains and represses its wickedness and
          corruption in some more and others less (without whose presence, man
          would without restraint plunge into every excess and crime and the
          world would be turned into a robber’s den). However since he wishes
          human society to be preserved, he does not permit the wantonness of
          all equally to rage, but restrains some by a fear of punishment.
          Others he incites by the love of reward; otherwise there would prevail
          the greatest confusion, if in proportion to the proneness of all to
          every evil, they would break forth into them. Now to produce these
          results God sometimes employs certain means and second causes such as:
          (1) goodness of nature (euphyia), from which there is a greater or
          less inclination of vice according to the temperament; (2) education
          and instruction, of great force in the formation of morals and the
          correction of life; (3) custom and intercourse with others, having
          great influence on either side; we are almost such as those with whom
          we live; (4) civil discipline about rewards and punishments by which
          Plato said the republic is held together (cf. The Republic 2.6—9
          [Loeb, 1:127—45]); (5) fear of disgrace usually attending vices and
          crimes, and the preservation of a good reputation (held by the wiser
          heathen in the highest estimation). Hence the latter said that life
          and honor walk abreast and that fame was to be preserved above other
          things, according to this: “If you lose all things, remember to keep
          your reputation.”
        </p>
        <h2>
          The inability of the sinner can be called neither simply moral nor
          natural, but is well said to be both in a different respect.
        </h2>
        <p>
          XXXIX. The inability of sinful man is not to be called simply moral
          (in contradistinction to natural, as that is called by moral
          philosophers morally impossible which is such rather by habit than by
          nature; and what is indeed done with difficulty, still is at one time
          done); nor ought it to be reckoned among those things which are
          absolutely impossible (adynata) (since this inability [adynamia] is in
          us innate and insuperable); nor simply natural (as that is natural
          from which we are called neither good nor bad; while this inability is
          certainly vicious and culpable); or as_ natural is contradistinguished
          from voluntary (as in a stone or brute there is a natural inability to
          speak). Our inability is in the highest degree voluntary; or as that
          is called natural which arises from a defect of natural faculty or
          power (such as the inability to see in the blind, to walk in the
          paralytic, to rise in the dead). Our inability does not exclude, but
          always supposes in man a natural power to understand and will. Still
          it is best said to be both natural and moral in a different respect.
          Moral (1) objectively because it is conversant with moral duties; (2)
          originally because it is induced (epispastos), arising from moral
          corruption and voluntarily brought on by the sin of man; (3) formally
          because it is voluntary and culpable, reflected upon the habit of a
          corrupt will. Natural also (1) originally because it is born with us
          and from nature; not created by God, but corrupted by man, on account
          of which we are said by Paul to be “by nature children of wrath”
          (physei tekna orges, Eph. 2:3), and by David “to have been shapen in
          iniquity and conceived in sin” (Ps. 51:5)—as poison is natural to the
          serpent and rapacity to the wolf. (2) Subjectively because it taints
          our whole nature and implies a privation of that faculty of doing well
          (which was given to the first man and was natural, which was original
          righteousness). (3) Eventually because it is unconquerable and
          insuperable, no less than the purely natural inability of the blind
          man to see and of the dead man to rise. For the sinner can no more
          convert himself than the blind man can see and the dead man rise. As
          therefore it is rightly called moral and voluntary to prove the guilt
          of man and render him inexcusable, so it is best termed natural to
          heighten the magnitude of the corruption and demonstrate the necessity
          of grace. For as it is born with man, so it is incapable of being
          overcome by him so that he cannot shake it off in any other way than
          by the almighty and heart- turning grace of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          XL. Therefore a man laboring under such an inability is falsely said
          to be able to believe if he wishes, as if faith (so expressly called
          by Paul “the gift of God,” Eph. 2:8) belonged to the things in our
          power (ek ton eph’ hémin). For although the phrase can in some measure
          be tolerated when understood of the natural power of willing (never
          taken away from us in whatever state we may be; as that by which we
          are distinguished from the brutes), still it cannot be admitted when
          we speak of the moral disposition of the will to good; not only to
          willing, but to willing well. Concerning this alone we dispute with
          our opponents; unless we wish to pass into the camp of Pelagius who
          wished good will to be placed in the power of man. For although by sin
          man did not lose the faculty of willing (in the genus of being), still
          it is so corrupt in the genus of morals that it neither does nor can
          do anything good. Besides, since to will to believe and to believe do
          not differ (since indeed he who wills to believe actually believes, as
          he who wills to love God and his neighbor really loves God and his
          neighbor), to say that man can believe if he will is to say that man
          is able to believe if he has already believed (which is mere
          trifling). (3) In vain is man said to be able to believe if he will,
          since it is certain that he cannot of himself will. It is of no use to
          reply that it is owing to the wickedness of man that he is not able to
          will; that nothing prevents his believing except his will. For
          although it is true that this inability is voluntary and culpable, so
          that its cause can be ascribed to no one but man alone, still it
          cannot be said absolutely that the will of man alone prevents his
          believing. As the want and privation of grace (which being furnished,
          he would believe and without which it is impossible for him to
          believe) prohibits that also negatively; so it also prohibits it
          positively; not simply his will, but that native corruption which
          taints the will and by which (as a spiritual chain) he is so bound
          down to sin that he can never snap it asunder or shake it off by
          himself and in his own strength (without grace).
