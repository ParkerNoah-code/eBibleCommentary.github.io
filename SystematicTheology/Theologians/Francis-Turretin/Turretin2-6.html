        <h2>The Knowledge of Scriptural Authority</h2>
        <p>SIXTH QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Question 6: How does the authority of the Holy (divinus) Scripture
            become known to us? Does it, either in itself or on our part, depend
            upon the witness of the Church? Negative, against the Roman
            Catholics.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The purpose of the Roman Catholics, in this and other controversies
          which they maintain over the Scripture, is not obscure, namely, to
          reject the judgment of Scripture, in which they cannot find enough
          sanction to protect their errors, and to appeal to the church, that
          is, to their pope, and so become judges of their own case. Thus, when
          formerly doctrine was debated on the basis of its agreement or
          nonagreement with Scripture, now debate has begun on Scripture
          itself-whether it is proper for religious controversies to be settled
          by its authority and witness. A severe struggle has been carried on
          concerning its origin, necessity, perfection, and perspicuity, for the
          purpose of diminishing them [Scripture's authority and witness], if
          not completely rejecting them. Quite properly what Irenaeus said of
          the heretics of his day may be applied to them [Roman Catholics]:
          "When opposed by Scriptures they became opponents of the Scriptures,
          as if they were incorrect or without authority."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It must be noted that some of them go to extremes and some speak
          more moderately in this matter. Some indeed simply deny the authority
          of Scripture, in itself and apart from the church, and hold it to be
          no more worthy of faith (I shudder to say it) than the Qur'an or the
          works of Livy or Aesop. Those who began to dispute the authority of
          Scripture with our [theologians] in the past century uttered this
          blasphemy. Of this the impious words of Hosius, in his work against
          Brent, are an example, when he declares that it is possible to assert
          in a reverent sense "the Scriptures have only the weight of Aesop's
          fables if they are deprived of the authority of the Church," and Eck
          declared, "Scripture is not authoritative except by the authority of
          the church... ." Because it seemed to others that this blasphemy had
          been rightly attacked by our [theologians], they spoke more carefully,
          expressing their teaching in such a way as to admit that absolutely
          and in itself Scripture is authoritative and of divine quality, since
          it comes from God the source of all truth, but they hold that relative
          to us its authority exists only on the witness of the church, through
          whose ministry it becomes known to us and is understood as of divine
          quality. From this arose the distinction between authority as to its
          nature (quoad se) and as to our understanding (quoad nos), which
          Bellarmine, Stapleton, and others have since brought forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But however they present their teaching, if we think of the
          matter correctly, it will be obvious that this distinction results in
          confusion, and hides the evil of an impious doctrine, rather than
          clarifying the truth of the matter. For since the authority is that of
          communicators and relationships, it cannot be understood absolutely,
          but relatively; therefore; Scripture cannot be authoritative in itself
          unless it is so also to our understanding, for whatever arguments
          demonstrate its authority in itself ought also to move us to
          agreement, so that it will be authoritative to our understanding. If
          the authority of Scripture for our understanding depends on the
          witness of the church, as if that were the formal ground on account of
          which I believe that it has a divine quality (esse divinam), then of
          necessity its authority in itself depends [on such witness], which
          some admit fully. Nor is any other teaching easily derived from the
          other controversies that they keep up, for how can they deny the
          perfection, perspicuity, or purity [of Scripture] if they believe it
          to be truly of divine origin (authenticus)?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. That the state of the question may be clear: (1) It is not a
          question of whether the Holy Scriptures are authentic and of divine
          quality; this our adversaries do not deny, or at least they want to
          seem to believe it. But [the question is] how are they known to us to
          be of such quality, or by what argument can this divine quality
          (divinitas) be demonstrated for us? The Roman Catholics make it depend
          on the witness of the church, and want the chief cause by which we are
          moved to believe the authenticity of Scripture to be the voice of the
          church. On the other hand, although we do not deny that the witness of
          the church has its value, as will appear later, yet we maintain that
          primarily and essentially Scripture is to be believed by us of divine
          quality on account of itself, or of the marks imprinted upon it, not
          on account of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. (2) It is not a question of the principle, or efficient cause, of
          faith by which we believe the divine quality of Scripture, that is, of
          whether or not the Holy Spirit produces it in us. This belongs to
          another question concerning the freedom of the will, and adversaries,
          such as Stapleton and Cano, agree with us. But here the question is
          about the argument or chief means which that Spirit uses to convince
          us of this truth; is it a direct (inartificialis) witness of the
          church, as the Roman Catholics hold, or a rational (artificialis) one
          based on marks (notae) in Scripture itself, as we maintain?
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Just as it is possible to speak of a threefold cause of the
          manifestation of anything--objective, efficient, and instrumental--so
          a threefold question can be framed about the recognition of the divine
          quality of Scripture: first, the argument on account of which I
          believe; second, the principle, or efficient cause, by which I am led
          to belief; third, the means and instrument through which I believe.
          The threefold question is answered in a threefold manner. Scripture,
          in its marks, becomes the form of argument on account of which I
          believe; the Holy Spirit becomes the means or the efficient cause and
          principle by which I am made to believe; the church is the instrument
          and means through which I believe. So if it is asked why or on account
          of what I believe Scripture to be of divine quality, I will reply that
          this happens through Scripture itself which proves itself to be such
          by its marks. If it is asked how or by what it happens that I believe,
          I will reply, by the Holy Spirit, who produces this faith within me.
          Finally, if it is asked by what means or organ I believe this, I will
          reply, through the church, which God uses in giving me Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (3) There is no question concerning the means whose service the
          Holy Spirit uses in convincing us of the authority of Scripture; we
          readily grant that this is the church. But the question concerns the
          primary argument and cause whereby we are led to faith, not human but
          God-based (divinus), which they [Roman Catholics] place in the church;
          we believe it is not to be sought outside Scripture itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. (4) There is no question that divine revelation is absolutely
          and simply the formal ground of our faith. Our adversaries acknowledge
          this with us. But what is that first and clearest revelation which
          ought to be accepted by us through and on account of itself, not on
          account of anything else which is better known to us, and which is
          therefore the most universal and primary basis of faith through which
          all ought to be proved but which itself [is proved by] nothing beyond
          it: is such revelation to be sought in Scripture or in the church? We
          hold that such revelation is found only in the Scripture, which is the
          first and infallible rule of faith. The Roman Catholics maintain that
          it is to be sought in the word and witness of the church. Stapleton
          says, in his book On the Authority of the Church Against Whittaker,
          book 1: "The supreme external witness on earth is the voice of the
          church" (chap. 8), and, "God, when he speaks by the church, does not
          speak in any other manner than if he were speaking in visions and
          dreams, or in whatever other form of supernatural revelation God may
          have spoken through" (chap. 9), and "The entire formal ground of our
          faith is God revealing through the church" (chap. 14). . . .
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. The question is therefore reduced to these terms: Why or on
          account of what do we believe Scripture to be the Word of God? or,
          what argument does the Holy Spirit use primarily to convince us of the
          divine quality of Scripture? Is it the witness or voice of the church,
          or the marks and criteria imprinted in Scripture itself? Our
          adversaries assert the former, we the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. That the authority of Scripture does not depend, either in itself
          or with regard to our understanding, on the witness of the church, is
          proved (1) because the church is founded on Scripture (Eph. 2:20), and
          all its authority is received from Scripture. This our adversaries
          cannot deny, since, when the question is raised they can go nowhere
          but to Scripture for an answer. Therefore [the church] cannot produce
          the authority of Scripture either in itself or with regard to our
          understanding, unless we maintain that the cause depends on the
          effect, the beginning on that which has been begun, and the foundation
          on the superstructure. Nor should it be objected that both conclusions
          can be true; the church receives its authority from Scripture, and
          Scripture in turn from the church, as John [the Baptist] bore witness
          to Christ, who gave witness to John. For it is one thing to give
          witness to another as a servant, in which way John is a witness to
          Christ-one through whom the Jews might believe (John 1:7), but not on
          account of whom. It is quite another matter to offer authority as a
          lord, which Christ did toward John. (2) [If Roman Catholic doctrine
          were true] the authority of the church would be prior to that of
          Scripture and so the primary matter of belief, on which from the first
          our faith would depend and into which it would ultimately be resolved,
          [a doctrine] which our adversaries do not accept, for they wish the
          authority of the church to depend on Scripture. (3) Obviously it is to
          argue in a circle when the authority of the church is proved by
          Scripture and then the authority of Scripture by the church. (4) Our
          adversaries have never agreed on what is to be understood by the
          church whether it is the contemporary church or that of antiquity, the
          whole church or its representatives, particular or universal; or what
          will be the act that witnesses to the authority of Scripture--whether
          it is certified [at a given time] by some judicial decision, or made
          effective through a continual and unbroken tradition. (5) A fallible
          and human witness, such as that of the church, cannot establish
          supernatural faith (fides divina). Nor, if God does speak through the
          church today, does it follow that the church is infallible, because
          special and extraordinary, inspiration, such as kept apostles and
          prophets free from error, and of which Christ spoke strictly when he
          said that the Holy Spirit would lead the apostles into all truth (John
          16:14 [13]) is one thing, but common and ordinary [inspiration] is
          another, which does not produce [apostolically] inspired pastors.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. That Scripture becomes known to us through itself is proved (1) by
          the nature of Scripture. For just as the law does not receive its
          authority from the lower judges who interpret it, nor from the heralds
          who proclaim it, but only from the prince who establishes it, and as a
          will obtains its weight from the wishes of the testators, not from the
          notary by whom it is drawn, and as a measuring rod (regula) determines
          measurement because of its own perfection, not because of the workman
          who uses it, so Scripture, which is the law of the -highest prince,
          the will of the heavenly Father, and the undeviating rule of faith,
          cannot hold its authority over us from the church, but only from
          itself. (2) [By] the nature of final categories and first principles.
          For as these are known of themselves and are undemonstrated
          [principles] which cannot be proved from any others, which would lead
          to an infinite regression--"it is necessary that the beginning of
          every branch of knowledge be what cannot be investigated," says
          Basil--so Scripture, which is the first principle in the supernatural
          order, is known by itself, and there is no way in which it can be
          demonstrated and made known to us by arguments sought outside it. If
          God placed marks in all the principles by which they may be known by
          all, there can be no doubt that he placed such in this sacred
          principle which is supremely necessary for salvation. (3) By analogy.
          As sense objects are recognized and known without any other external
          argument, from the inner relationship and the inclination of the
          faculty to the object, provided that the faculties of sensation are
          healthy-light by its own splendor, food by its own flavor, odor by its
          fragrance, are immediately recognized by us even in the absence of a
          witness-so the Scripture, which with respect to the new creation is
          described for us in a spiritual sense by the symbol of glorious light
          (Ps. 119:105), delightful food (Ps. 19:10; Isa. 55:1- 2; Heb. 5:14),
          and most fragrant perfume (Song of Sol. 1:3), is easily recognized
          through itself by the senses of the new man and shows, itself to them,
          and demonstrates itself by its own light, pleasantness, and fragrance,
          so that there is no need to seek elsewhere for what this light, food,
          and perfume teach that they are. (4) By the testimony of adversaries
          [Roman Catholics], who demonstrate the divine quality of Scripture by
          its marks. Bellarmine says, "As to the Holy Scriptures, which are
          contained in the writings of prophets and apostles, nothing is more
          knowable or more certain, so that it must be a most stupid act to fail
          to have faith in them" (De Verba Dei 1.2)….
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. We do not deny that many functions of the church with respect to
          Scripture are proper. (1) That it be a guardian of the oracles of God,
          which were entrusted to it, who protects the authentic record of the
          covenant of grace with the highest fidelity, like a notary (Rom. 3:2).
          (2) A guide which points to the Scripture, and leads toward it. (3) A
          defender (vindex) who protects and vindicates it by distinguishing the
          genuine books from the corrupted, in which sense the church is called
          Scripture's bulwark (I Tim. 3:16 [15]). (4) A herald, who preaches and
          proclaims it (II Cor. 5:19; Rom. 10:16). (5) An interpreter who
          investigates and makes plain its true meaning. But these functions are
          all ministerial, not magisterial, so that indeed we believe through
          the church but not on account of the church, as those who believed in
          Christ believed through John the Baptist, not on account of him (John
          1:7), and Christ became known to the Samaritans through the Samaritan
          woman, not on account of her (John 4:39).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. The formation of faith, considered objectively, with regard to
          the facts to be believed, is one thing, and another when considered
          subjectively with regard to the act of believing. The first is in'
          Scripture and the external witness of the Holy Spirit expressed in
          Scripture; the second in the Spirit's internal witness impressed on
          the conscience and speaking in the heart. Since both the setting forth
          of truth in the Word and its application in the heart are necessary
          for the engendering of faith, the Holy Spirit operates in both, in the
          Word and in the heart. Therefore he is properly said to witness in the
          Word, objectively, by means of the argument on account of which we
          believe. Also, less properly, he is said to witness in the heart
          efficiently, through the means of the principle in virtue of which we
          believe, in which sense the Spirit who presents internal witness of
          the divinity of Christ and the truth of gospel is said to "witness,
          because the Spirit is truth" (I John 5:6 [7]); that is, the Spirit,
          acting in the hearts of the faithful; witnesses that the teaching of
          the gospel handed down by the Spirit is true and of divine quality.
          XIV. When the French Confession says (article 5), "We believe the
          books of Scripture to be canonical, not so much by the common consent
          of the church as by the witness and internal urging of the Holy
          Spirit," by "Holy Spirit" must be understood the Spirit speaking both
          in the Word and in the heart. So the same Spirit, acting objectively
          in the Word to set forth the truth, acts also efficiently in the heart
          to impress this truth on our minds, and so is very different from
          fanatical enthusiasm (Spiritus Enthusiasticus). XV. A personal
          decision of the Spirit, which is such with regard to the person
          (subjectus) whose it is, is one thing; but a personal decision which
          is such in terms of its origin (originaliter) , because it depends on
          the individual will of a human being, is another. We grant that the
          first is involved here, but not the second, because the Spirit that
          witnesses in us concerning the divine quality of Scripture is not
          limited to individuals with regard to his principle of operation and
          origin, but is common to the whole church, and to all believers in
          whom he has engendered the same faith, although he is such
          subjectively in regard to each individual, because given personally to
          individual believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Although the church, considered formally and in connection with
          the act of writing, is older than Scripture, it cannot be called such
          materially and with respect to the substance of teaching, because the
          Word of God is older than this church, since it is its foundation and
          seed. (1) The dispute is not over the witness of the church of the
          ancient patriarchs who lived before the Scripture, but of the
          contemporary church, which is much more recent.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Although believers are convinced of the divine quality of
          Scripture by the witness of the Holy Spirit, it does not follow that
          all who have this Spirit should agree in accepting particular books
          equally, because, since he is not given to all in the same measure, so
          neither does he endow all with the light of equal knowledge either
          with regard to the essential (principium) of religion or of its
          dogmas, or move them to consent with equal effectiveness. Therefore
          some Protestants have been able to doubt the canonicity of one or
          another canonical book, because they were not yet sufficiently
          illumined by the light of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. It is not always necessary for one thing to be proved by
          another. Some matters are self-evident, according to the philosophers,
          like the ultimate categories of things and final distinctions and
          first principles, which cannot be externally demonstrated but are
          evident in their own light, and so are presupposed as certain and not
          to be doubted, and if anyone does question them, he is not to be
          answered with arguments, but delivered to those responsible for him or
          coerced by punishments, as one who by the testimony of the philosopher
          lacks either reason or discipline. Thus in the Posterior Analytics he
          says that anything is axiomatic which has no external cause for its
          truth, "which must both exist and be known by itself;" that is, which
          is not only self-evident, but which also simply cannot be honestly
          denied by anyone whose reason is sound. Since Scripture is a first
          principle, and primary and infallible truth, what is strange in
          proving it by itself? (2) Scripture can prove itself, either a part
          proving the rest, as when we debate with Jews on the basis of the Old
          Testament, or the whole proving the whole, not by a direct argument of
          witness, but by a rational and logical one, because in it are found
          the divine marks which are not present in the writings of humans. This
          is not special pleading, for these criteria are separate from
          Scripture, not materially but formally, as adjuncts and properties
          which can be demonstrated with regard to the subject; nor is it a
          demonstration of an unknown through something equally unknown, because
          the marks are better known to us, just as we demonstrate a cause by
          its effects, and a subject by its properties. (3) The argument of the
          Roman Catholics, that Scripture cannot be proved by itself, because
          the better known and less known would be the same, can with greater
          force be turned back against the church.

          XIX. If there are those who do not acknowledge the divine quality of
          Scripture, it is not because the object itself -- is not knowable or
          understandable, but because they lack a healthy faculty of reception;
          from these the gospel is hidden because Satan has blinded their eyes
          (II Cor. 4:4), -- like those who deny the existence of God, who is
          supremely knowable, because they are lacking in understanding, or who
          do not see the sun because they are blind, as in Seneca's writing a
          woman who had lost her eyesight kept complaining that the sun had not
          risen; nonetheless the sun always sends forth its rays, as those who
          have eyes know from the phenomenon itself.

          XX. It is one thing to recognize and proclaim the canon of Scripture;
          another to establish this canon and make it authoritative. The church
          cannot do the latter, which is solely the privilege of God, the
          author. It can do the former, because it is servant, not lord. As a
          goldsmith who separates dross from the gold, or who seeks gold in the
          ore, does indeed see the difference between the true and the false,
          but does not make the true either for himself or for us, so the church
          by her investigation separates the true canonical books from the
          noncanonical and apocryphal, but does not make them [canonical], nor
          could the decision of the church give authority to books which do not
          have it in themselves, but it proclaims the authority already present
          by means of arguments from the books themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. Obscure knowledge of the matter is one thing, but distinct
          knowledge is another. By obscure knowledge the church can be known
          before Scripture but distinct knowledge of Scripture ought to come
          first, because the truth about the church can be grasped only from
          Scripture. Before [we know] Scripture the church may be known to us by
          "human faith," as an assembly of people using the same forms of
          worship, but it can be known and trusted as the assembly of the
          faithful and the communion of the saints, by "divine faith," only
          after the marks of the church which Scripture supplies have become
          known. XXII. When the apostle says that faith comes by hearing (Rom.
          10:17) he means only that the ministry of the church ought to be
          present as the ordinary means of awakening faith in adults, but he
          does not therefore teach that the church is more knowable than
          Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. It is one thing to raise questions about the number, authors,
          parts, and particular words of the books of Scripture, and another to
          raise questions about the fundamental teachings contained in these
          books. The second form of knowledge, but not the first, is given to
          every believer, and he who has questions as to who wrote the Gospel of
          Matthew does not thereby imperil his salvation, if only he believes it
          to be authentic and of divine quality. Knowing who is the primary
          author of a book is one thing; knowing who was his secretary is quite
          another. The latter is a question of historic faith; the former, of
          true religious faith (fides divina).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Although, in the language of the philosophers, the "circle" is a
          sophistic argument, by which something is proved by itself, [an
          argument] which is developed in a closed series using the same kind of
          cause recurring within itself, we cannot be accused of such circular
          reasoning when we prove the Scripture by the Spirit and then prove the
          Spirit by the Scripture. For there are two different questions, and
          two different middle terms or kinds of causes: we prove the Scripture
          by the Spirit, as efficient cause by which we believe, but we prove
          the Spirit from the Scripture as from the object and argument on
          account of which we believe. In the first case the question answered
          is "why, or in virtue of what, do you believe that the Scripture is of
          divine quality?" In the second, the question is "how, or on account of
          what, do you believe that the Spirit within you is the Holy Spirit?"
          The answer is, on account of the marks of the Holy Spirit that are in
          Scripture. But the Roman Catholics, who accuse us of circular
          reasoning, obviously fall into it in this matter, when they prove
          Scripture by the church and the church by Scripture; this is indeed
          done by the same middle term and the same kind of cause. If we ask
          them why, or on account of what, they believe the Scripture to have
          divine quality, they answer, that the church says so. If we ask
          further why they believe the church, they answer that the Scripture
          attributes infallibility to it, when it calls it the pillar and
          bulwark of truth. If we continue, asking why they believe the witness
          of Scripture to be trustworthy, they reply that the church has made
          them sure of it. Thus the argument is brought back to where it
          started, and can go around and around forever, and cannot be fixed in
          any first believable point. And these are not different kinds of
          questions; each deals with the ground and argument on account of which
          Ibelieve, not with the faculty or principle through which I believe.

          XXV. The church is called "pillar and bulwark of truth" (I Tim. 3:15),
          not because it keeps truth from falling and provides authority for it,
          since truth is rather the foundation of the church, upon which it is
          built (Eph. 2:20), but [1] because [the Scripture] offers itself and
          shows itself to the sight of all in the church as on a bulletin board.
          So "pillar" is used not in its architectural meaning, as pillars "'
          are placed to hold up a building, but in its forensic and political
          meaning, as the edicts of the princes and the decrees and laws of the
          magistrate used to 'be posted on pillars in front of the curias and
          praetoriums, and the doors of [secular] basilicas, so that they might
          become known by everybody, as Pliny and Josephus report (Historia
          Naturalis 6.28 [(32) 152]; Antiquities 1.4 [book 1. 69 - 71]). So the
          church is the pillar of truth both in the matter of its proclamation,
          for it is obliged to proclaim the laws of God, and the heavenly truth
          is posted on her so that it may be known by all, [and pillar] also in
          the sense of guardian, who not only proclaims the Scripture but also
          vindicates and protects it, and so it is called not only "pillar," but
          also "bulwark" (I Tim. 3:15), a support (firmamentum) by which known
          truth is vindicated and preserved, whole and safe against all
          corruptions, but not a foundation (qemelion; fundamentum), which gives
          truth itself its hypostasis and the basis on which it stands. (2) That
          which is called pillar and bulwark of truth is not for that reason
          infallible. The patristic writers (veteres) gave this designation to
          those who surpassed others by excellence of doctrine, or by" holiness
          of life, or firmness of faithful living, and who confirmed the
          doctrine of the gospel and the Christian faith either by teaching or
          by example. Thus the believers in Lyons give the designation to
          Attalus the martyr, according to Eusebius (Church History 5.1). Basil
          gives it to the orthodox bishops who struggled against the Arian
          heresy-"the pillars and the bulwark of truth" (epistle 120). And
          Gregory of Nazianzus designates Athanasius in this manner. In the same
          sense honest and uncorrupted judges in the civil state are called
          pillars and bulwarks of the laws. (3) This text [I Tim. 3:15] teaches
          the duty of the church, but not its infallible privilege; what it is
          supposed to db in the proclamation and defense of truth against all
          corruptions of its adversaries, not, however, what it ~ways will do,
          as names are often based on a duty rather than on what is actually
          done. Malachi 2':7 says that the lips of the priests guard knowledge,
          which it is their duty to do, although it is not always done, as verse
          8 teaches. (4) Whatever is here attributed to the church is attributed
          to the local church of Ephesus (I Tim. 1:3) to which the Roman
          Catholics do not attribute the privilege of infallibility, and it
          refers to the collective church of believers, in which Timothy ought
          to be included, not the representative one of pastors, much less to
          the pope, to whom alone they attribute complete freedom from error.
          (5) Here Paul refers to the use of pillars in the sanctuaries of the
          pagans, to which either images of the gods, or laws and moral
          teachings, or oracles, were attached, as Pausanias and Athenaeus tell
          us, to oppose these pillars of lies and falsehoods, where nothing was
          present except fables and images of false gods, to the mystic pillar
          of truth, on which the true image of the invisible God is shown (Col.
          1:15), and the heavenly oracles of God are set forth. He also refers
          to that memorable pillar which Solomon was responsible for setting up
          in the temple, which is mentioned in II Chronicles 6:13 and II Kings
          23:3, upon which, as a platform, the kings mounted whenever they
          wished to speak to the people or discharge some important
          responsibility. It was therefore called "the royal pillar" by the
          Jews. So truth sits in the church like a queen, not as if she derived
          her authority from it, just as Solomon did not receive his from this
          pillar, but because truth is set forth and preserved .in the church.

          XXVI. The text in Augustine, "I would not be believing the gospel
          unless the authority of the church convinced me" (Against the Epistle
          of Mani Which Is Called Fundamental 5), does not support the Roman
          Catholics. (1) Because Augustine speaks of himself while still a
          Manichean, not yet a Christian, and [here] uses the imperfect where
          the pluperfect would be expected, "I would not be believing" and "the
          church convinced" rather than "I would not have believed" and "the
          church had convinced," a common usage, scholars have noted, among
          African writers; for example, "if I was desiring those fruits" for "I
          had desired" (Augustine, Confessions 2.8). (2) The authority of which
          he speaks is not that of law and political power, as our adversaries
          hold, as if he had believed because the church was telling him to, but
          an authority of worthiness, founded on the wonderful and most glorious
          arguments from divine providence which can be seen in the church, such
          as miracles, antiquity, consensus of different peoples, and
          continuity, which can lead to faith, but not awaken it as first cause.
          (3) It is to be noted here, therefore, that it is an external thrust
          toward faith, and not an infallible source of belief, that Augustine
          advocates in looking for truth alone, when he tells us that truth is
          to be preferred above all things, if it is completely proven and
          cannot be brought into doubt (chap. 4), and when he says, "Let us
          follow those who invite us first to believe what we cannot yet
          understand, that, made stronger by this very faith, we may reach the
          point of knowing what we believe, our minds internally directed and
          illuminated not by men but by God himself" (chap. 14). So Pierre
          d'Ailly understands it, and Cano, Gerson, Driedo, and Durand may be
          understood as upholding the primitive and apostolic church, not the
          contemporary one, whose authority is here argued. See our disputation
          on the authority of Scripture.
