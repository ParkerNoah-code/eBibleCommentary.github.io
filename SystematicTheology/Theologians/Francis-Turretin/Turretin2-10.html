        <h2>The Purity of the Original Text</h2>
        <p>TENTH QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Has the original text of the Old and New Testaments come to us pure
            and uncorrupted? Affirmative, against the Roman Catholics.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This question is forced upon us by the Roman Catholics, who raise
          doubts concerning the purity of the sources in order more readily to
          establish the authority of their Vulgate and lead us to the tribunal
          of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. By "original texts" we do not mean the very autographs from the
          hands of Moses, the prophets, and the apostles, which are known to be
          nonexistent. We mean copies (apographa), which have come in their
          name, because they record for us that word of God in the same words
          into which the sacred writers committed it under the immediate
          inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. There is no question of the sources being pure in the sense that
          no error has crept into many sacred codices, either from the ravages
          of time, or the carelessness of copyists, or the malice of Jews and
          heretics. This is recognized on both sides, and the variant readings,
          which Beza and Robert Stephanus have noted in Greek, and the Jews in
          Hebrew, witness sufficiently to this. But the question is whether the
          original text, in Hebrew or in Greek, has been so corrupted, either by
          the carelessness of copyists or by the malice of Jews and heretics,
          that it can no longer be held as the judge of controversies and the
          norm by which all versions without exception are to be judged. The
          Roman Catholics affirm this; we deny it.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Not all Roman Catholics are of this opinion. There are many, who
          are called Hebraists, who uphold the purity of the sources, and defend
          it explicitly, among them Sixtus Senensis, Bannes, Andradius, Driedo,
          Arias Montanus, John Isaac, Jacob Bonfrerius, Simeon de Muis, and many
          others. Others, however, maintain strongly the corruption of the
          sources; among them, Stapleton, Lindanus, Cano, Cotton, Morinus,
          Perronius, Gordon, and others. There are some who, following a middle
          road, assert neither that the sources are corrupt nor that they flow
          with purity and integrity, so that they maintain everything must be
          studied and emended in connection with the versions. This is the
          teaching of Bellarmine (De Verbo Dei 22), who on this matter, as on
          others, must be understood as inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. That the sources are not corrupt is demonstrated by (1) the
          providence of God, which would not allow (cui repugnat) that the books
          which he had willed to be written by inspired men for the salvation of
          the human race, and which he willed to remain to the end of the world
          so that the waters of salvation could be drawn from them, should be so
          falsified that they would be useless for that purpose. And since new
          revelations are not to be expected after God has committed his whole
          will concerning the doctrine of salvation to the books of Scripture,
          what could be more derogatory to God, who has promised always to be
          with his church, than to assert that the books in which this doctrine
          is preserved have been corrupted so that they cannot be the canon of
          faith? (2) The faithfulness of the Christian church, and its diligent
          work in preserving Scripture. Since Christians always watched over it
          with great care, to preserve the sacred deposit unharmed, it is
          unbelievable that they either falsified it or allowed anyone else to
          do so. (3) The religion of the Jews, which looked upon the sacred
          codices with great faith and concern, to the point of superstition, so
          that Josephus could say that after the passage of centuries no one
          dared add to or subtract from or change the books of the Jews, and
          that among them it was almost instinctive to be prepared to die for
          Scripture (Against Apion, book 2). Philo in his work on the exodus of
          the children of Israel from Egypt, quoted by Eusebius, goes further
          when he states that, up to his time, during a period of more than two
          thousand years, no word in the Hebrew law was changed, and that any
          number of Jews would rather die than allow the law to undergo any
          change (Preparation for the Gospel 8.2). Indeed, they were overcome
          with foolish superstition about the sacred codex, so that if a written
          book of the law touched the ground they proclaimed a fast, and they
          said that it was to be feared that the universe would revert to
          primeval chaos--so far were they from allowing fraud with the sacred
          codices. (4) The care with which the Masoretes not only counted, but
          recorded in writing, all variations in pointing and writing, not only
          with regard to verses and words, but to individual letters, so that
          there could be neither place for, nor suspicion of, forgers, an
          argument used by Arias Montanus in his biblical preface. (5) The large
          number of copies. Since the sacred codices are so widely scattered,
          how could all of them have been corrupted either by the carelessness
          of copyists or by the malice of falsifiers? "Far be it," as Augustine
          says, "from any prudent man to believe that the Jews, however perverse
          and evil-minded, could have done this with so many and widely
          scattered copies" (City of God 15.2 [13]). Vives says that this
          argument should be used against those who "argue that the Hebrew
          manuscripts of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New have been
          falsified and corrupted, so that the truth of the sacred books cannot
          be found in them."
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. (6) If the sources were corrupted, it was done either before or
          after Christ. Neither is possible. Not before, for Christ never
          suggested it when he discussed various errors of doctrine, and he
          would not have upheld the use of corrupted books. Was the Lord so
          indifferent to the salvation of his people that he never even
          mentioned, personally or through the apostles, that the books of Moses
          and the prophets were falsified, when at the same time he refuted the
          Jews from these same books (but in vain, if they were corrupted and
          changed), and summoned and urged his 'disciples to read and examine
          them? Not afterward, both because the copies scattered among
          Christians would have made such effort useless, and also because there
          is no trace of such corruption. For if anything of the kind had taken
          place, why are the passages which Christ and the apostles quote from
          Moses and the prophets the same today and always, and not corrupted at
          all? Why did Origen and Jerome, who had magnificent knowledge of the
          sacred languages, so specifically absolve the Jews from this wrong?
          Therefore if the corruption was not done either before or after
          Christ, it follows that it was never done, an argument that Bellarmine
          brings forward (De Verba Dei 22).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (7) The Jews neither wanted to corrupt the sources nor could have
          done so. They did not want to, because, if they had wanted to corrupt
          any part, they would certainly have weakened the oracles which speak
          of Christ and confirm the Christian faith. Who indeed would believe
          that if, as is supposed, they did it from hatred of Christians, they
          would falsify the passages from which nothing against Christians can
          be drawn, and leave unchanged those in which Christians place the
          foundation for the triumph of the truth of the gospel? But this is
          exactly how the matter stands. The passages said to have been weakened
          by the Jews are little or no problem for Christians, while the most
          striking oracles concerning Christ remain unchanged, and are much
          plainer and more specific in Hebrew than in the translations, as has
          been pointed out by Jerome (epistle 74, to Marcellus), John Isaac
          (Against Lindanus 2), and Andradius in his defense of the Council of
          Trent, chapter 2. That they could not have done it no matter how badly
          they wanted to is shown not only by the large number of copies but
          also by the vigilance of Christians, not all of whose copies could the
          Jews have corrupted, and by the provident wisdom of God, who, if he
          will not permit one jot or tittle of the law to perish until all is
          fulfilled (Matt. 5:18), will be much less willing for the body of
          heavenly doctrine to be weakened by the Jews, and for us to be
          deprived of this treasure; rather, as Bellarmine well remarks, "for
          this purpose he willed to scatter the Jews throughout the world, and
          to disseminate the books of the law and the prophets, that,
          unwillingly, they might bear witness to our Christian truth" (De Verbo
          Dei 22 argument 5) .... and Augustine calls the Jews "a
          book-preserving people, carrying the law and the prophets; they used
          to carry the codices as a servant, that they might lose by carrying,
          and others gain by reading; they indeed serve us; the Jews were like
          book carriers and librarians, who by their efforts carried the codices
          for us," and again, "in their hearts, enemies; in their books,
          witnesses."
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Although various small changes (corruptulae) may have come into
          the Hebrew codices through the carelessness of copyists or the ravages
          of time, they would not therefore cease to be the canon of faith and
          conduct. For these represent matters of small importance, not
          connected with faith and conduct, which Bellarmine himself admits, and
          therefore he denies that they affect the integrity of Scripture (De
          Verbo Dei 2.2); and moreover they are not found in every manuscript,
          and are not such as cannot readily be corrected from Scripture itself
          and the comparison of different copies.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. The hatred of Jews for Christians could be a remote cause for the
          corruption of Scripture, but one that could be impeded by a greater
          cause, namely, the providence of God, who envisioned a sure rule of
          faith for Christians no less than for Jews, one deduced from the
          indubitable foundations of the gospel, which could not be done if he
          allowed the sources to be corrupt.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The difference between the Septuagint and the original text does
          not imply that the text is corrupt, but rather that the translation is
          faulty, as Jerome already recognized in his day (in his prefaces to
          Deuteronomy and Chronicles, and in his letter to Sunias and
          Fretellas). Bellarmine says (De Verbo Dei 2.6) that [the Septuagint]
          is so corrupt and faulty that it seems altogether a different work, so
          that it is not safe today to emend the Hebrew or Latin text [of the
          Old Testament] from a Greek manuscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. So far is it from true that the Keri and Kethib divergencies,
          which are commonly regarded as 848 in number, corrupt the text, that
          rather they show the variant readings of different copies, by which
          all corruption by innovators is prevented. The chasir and jothar,
          which indicate a grammatical deficiency or superfluity, belong to the
          same category and make evident the superstition with which the
          Masoretes cared for the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. The tikkun sopherim or "corrections of the scribes," of which
          there are only eighteen, do not imply any corruption of the text. Had
          there been any, Christ, if they were made before his time, or the
          orthodox fathers if they were made later, would not have allowed them
          to pass without rebuke. Nor are they necessarily corrections, as is
          evident to the reader, but stylistic improvements, and changes not so
          much of meaning as of words. They were made either by the men of the
          Great Synagogue, one of whom, Ezra, who, after the return from the
          Babylonian captivity, restored to integrity the scattered and damaged
          copies of the sacred books, and arranged them as we now have them, was
          inspired by God, as we have already mentioned in the proper place, or
          else by the authors themselves, who, after the custom of orators,
          edited what they had said. But the very content declares them to be of
          small moment, for the meaning is not lost even if the words are
          retained as spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. The similarity of some letters can indeed have resulted in
          errors appearing in some codices because of copyists' carelessness,
          but this was not universal, for they could easily be corrected from
          others, especially because of the thoroughness of the Masoretes, who
          counted not only all the words, but also the letters that were in the
          text.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. So far it is from truth that the Masoretes' work suggests
          corruption of the sources, that, on the contrary, it was undertaken to
          prevent errors, so that in days to come not a single letter could be
          changed or dropped out.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Although in Romans 10:18 the apostle writes "sound" for the "line"
          of Psalm 19:5 [4], it does not follow that the Hebrew text is corrupt
          and that "their line" was substituted for "their sound" or "voice."
          For qav means not only an extended or perpendicular line, but also a
          written line, or letter, by which young children are taught, as in
          Isaiah 28:10 the ignorant childishness of the Israelite people is
          shown when they are said to be taught like children "precept after
          precept, line after line." So the psalmist says, "Day teaches day, and
          one night shows forth knowledge to another." "Voice" (fqoggos), which
          signifies not only the sound but the writing of the letter, renders
          this word [qav] well, just as we call diphthongs and vowels written.
          Moreover, Paul does not quote this verse exactly, but applies it in a
          figurative manner to the preaching of the gospel by the apostles,
          following the meaning rather than the words.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Corruption of the meaning is one thing; corruption of
          interpretation is another. The Jews have been able to corrupt the
          interpretation of Isaiah 9:6 when the words "and he shall call his
          name" are referred to the father who calls, not to the son who is
          called, but they have not corrupted the words themselves. Whether they
          are rendered as active or passive makes no difference, since according
          to Hebrew idiom a future active without subject often has a passive
          meaning, and so the words, impersonally in the third person, although
          active, can be understood as passive. So the Hebrew reading "and he
          shall call his name" has not been changed, but the subject must be
          supplied--not "God the Father," as the Jews take it, but "everyone,"
          that is, all believers, shall call his (Christ's) name. To make this
          more plain, it is translated "his name shall be called." Likewise
          Jeremiah 23:6 has been somewhat corrupted in interpretation but not in
          the words, which are correctly translated either with a singular "he
          shall call him," as the seventy rendered it, as if the words referred
          to the nominative preceding "Israel and Judah," or with a plural,
          "they shall call him," as Pagninus, Vatable, and Arias Montanus render
          it, following the Chaldean, Syriac, Arabic, and the Vulgate. Jerome
          uses both renderings, and none of the Fathers called this passage
          corrupt.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Since three Targums understand "Shiloh" in Genesis 49:10 as
          "Messiah," it is clear that the Jews have not corrupted the passage in
          order to prove that the Messiah has not yet come. Moreover, this word
          Shiloh, which in the Talmud is attributed to the Messiah, refutes the
          Jews and points to Christ no less than "Shiloh" [with final hard "h"
          rather than soft] which is asserted to have been the original, whether
          it be derived from "son" or from "peaceful," or, which seems
          preferable, and the Septuagint follows, a [Hebrew] phrase meaning
          "whose is the kingly authority." There is a similar phrase in Ezekiel
          21:32 [27].
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Zechariah 9:9 is not corrupt when it says that the Messiah is
          to be a king who is just and to be saved, for the word can be
          understood either as passive, meaning that Christ would be saved from
          death (Heb. 5:7), or would save himself (Isa. 63:3[5]); or as a
          deponent form used actively, which is common among the Hebrews, and
          this would be a participle meaning "liberator" or "savior."
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Although in Exodus 12:40 the sojourn of the children of Israel in
          Egypt is said to have been of 430 years, which cannot be understood of
          the period of time spent in Egypt, which was 215 years, but of the
          time spent both in Canaan and in Egypt, as the Samaritan and the Greek
          explain the passage, the Hebrew ought not to be regarded as corrupt
          but as synechdoche, which remembers only the Egyptian period, because
          it was the principal exile of the Israelites, by naming the whole from
          the more important part.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. In Psalm 15 [14] no verses have been omitted [from the present
          Hebrew text], for what is quoted in Romans 3:11-12 was not taken by
          the apostle from there, but from many psalms put together, for
          example, Psalms 5, 11, 26, 36, and 140, and from Isaiah 59, as Jerome
          teaches in his commentary on Isaiah (book 16).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. I Corinthians 15:47 is not corrupt in the Greek text, but in the
          Vulgate, which omits the word Lord, which here means Christ, as he is
          not a mere man but the Lord Jehovah, and so the antithesis between the
          first and second Adam is much stronger: "the first man is of the
          earth, earthy, but the second man is the Lord from heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Although the doxology of Matthew 6:13, in the conclusion of the
          Lord's Prayer, is not found in Luke 11, nor in many manuscripts, it
          does not follow that this text is corrupt, because the Lord could have
          taught the same form of prayer twice; once without the doxology, and
          then again, with it added, for the general public. Nor is it
          impossible for one Gospel to leave out what another includes, for no
          necessity makes each one include everything; Matthew 6:33 reads, "Seek
          the kingdom of God and his righteousness," but Luke 6:31 has only,
          "Seek the kingdom of God." What Luke omits ought therefore not to be
          eliminated, but supplied from Matthew, since both are inspired,
          especially because this passage is found in all the Greek manuscripts
          of Matthew, as Erasmus and Bellarmine recognize.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. Although in a number of manuscripts Romans 12:11 reads "serving
          the time," this is not the case with all; indeed Franciscus Lucas says
          he has seen six which read "Lord." Beza says this is the reading of a
          number of the best, and Dominic a Soto states that that reading is now
          general, both in Greek and Latin.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. It is certain that all Greek manuscripts differ from the Latin
          in I John 4:3, for the Greek has "every spirit that does not confess
          that Jesus has come in the flesh," but the Latin, "every spirit that
          takes Jesus apart (solvit)." It does not follow that the sources are
          corrupt, for the Greek reading is more worthy (augustior), and much
          more specific against Nestorius and Eutyches.

          XXV. Corruption is one thing; a variant reading is another. We admit
          that there are a number of variant readings coming from the collation
          of various manuscripts, but we deny that there is a universal
          corruption.

          XXVI. It is one thing to speak of the effort of heretics to corrupt
          certain manuscripts. We readily concede this. The complaints of the
          Fathers, for example, Irenaeus with regard to Marcion, Origen on
          Romans 16:13, and Theodoret with regard to Tatian are relevant to
          this. But success, or complete and universal corruption, is another
          matter. This we deny, both because of the providence of God, who did
          not allow them to do what they planned, and because of the diligence
          of the orthodox fathers, who, having various manuscripts in their
          possession, were faithful in keeping them free from corruption.
