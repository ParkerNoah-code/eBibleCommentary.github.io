        <h2>The Necessity of Scripture</h2>
        <p>SECOND QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Was it necessary for the word to be committed to writing?
            Affirmative.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Since in the preceding question we have proved the necessity of the
          word, in this one the necessity of Scripture, or the written word, is
          argued against the Roman Catholics. For, just as to establish more
          easily their traditions and unwritten teachings, and the authority of
          their supreme pontiff, they strive earnestly to denigrate the
          authority of Scripture, they also try, in more ways than one, to
          disparage its necessity. They call it useful for the church, but not
          necessary, as Bellarmine argues in De Verbo Dei, book 4, chapter 4.
          Cardinal Hosius even utters such blasphemy as to say, "It would have
          been a better situation for the church if no Scripture at all had ever
          existed," and Valentia says, "It would have been more convenient had
          it not been written."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. With regard to the state of the question, let it be noted that
          "Scripture" may be understood in two ways--either materialiter with
          regard to the teaching transmitted, or formaliter with regard to the
          writing and form of transmission. In the first sense we regard it to
          be simply and absolutely necessary, as said above, so that the church
          can never live without it. But in the second sense, which is here
          under discussion, we acknowledge that it is not absolutely necessary
          on God's part because, just as he taught the church by the spoken word
          alone for two thousand years before Moses, so, if he had wished, he
          could have taught it later the same way. But [Scripture] is necessary
          hypothetically on account of the divine will, since it seemed good to
          God, for weighty reasons, to commit his word to writing. For this
          reason [Scripture] has, by divine ordinance, been made so necessary
          that it pertains not only to the well-being of the church, but to its
          very being, so that now the church cannot exist without the Scripture.
          Therefore, God is not bound to the Scripture, but has bound us to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The question, therefore, is not whether the writing of the word
          is absolutely and simply necessary, but whether it is necessary
          secundum quid on account of the hypothesis; not for every age, but for
          the present age and circumstances; not in relation to God's power and
          freedom, but in relation to his wisdom and to the economy of his
          dealing with the human race. For, just as in the economy of the
          natural order parents change their manner of dealing with their
          children as these grow older, so that infants are first directed by
          the spoken word, then by the voice of a teacher and the reading of
          books, and finally are freed from the guidance of the teacher and
          learn on their own from books, so the heavenly Father, who instructs
          his people as the head of a family (Deut. 8:5), taught the church,
          when it was still young and childish, by the spoken word, the most
          simple form of revelation. Then, as it began to mature and was
          established under the law in its early youth, he taught both by the
          spoken word, because of continuing childishness, and by writing,
          because of the beginnings of maturity, until the apostles' time. But
          when [the church] had reached adulthood, under the gospel, he wanted
          it to be satisfied with the most perfect form of revelation, that is,
          the written light. Therefore, Scripture is necessary not only by the
          necessity of a commandment, but also by the hypothesis of the divine
          economy, which God wanted to be varied and manifold in the different
          ages of the church (Eph.3:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The distinction between the word as written and as unwritten has
          arisen because of this process. This is not, as Roman Catholics hold,
          the division of a genus into species, as if the written word differed
          from the unwritten, but it is the division of the subject into its
          accidents, because the same Word is always involved; it was once
          unwritten, but now has been written. It is therefore called
          "unwritten," not with respect to the present, but to past time, when
          God chose to teach his church by a spoken word, not by writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Although God formerly spoke to the fathers "in many and various
          ways" (Heb. 1:1), sometimes by an audible voice, sometimes by internal
          and nonsensory action, sometimes in dreams and visions, sometimes
          taking the appearance of human form, often using the ministry of
          angels and other appropriate means, yet the teaching was always the
          same, and was not changed either by the form of revelation and
          transmission or by changing times.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Three [needs] in particular support the necessity of Scripture:
          (1) the preservation of the word; (2) its defense; (3) its
          proclamation. It was necessary for the written word to be given to the
          church to be the fixed and changeless rule of faith of the true
          religion, which could thus more readily be preserved pure and whole in
          spite of the weakness of memory, the perversity of humanity, and the
          shortness of life; more surely defended against the frauds and
          corruptions of Satan, and more readily proclaimed and transmitted not
          only to people who were scattered and separated from one another, but
          to future generations as well. As Vives reminds us (De causis
          corruptium artium 1), "By letters all the arts are preserved as in a
          treasury, so that they can never be lost, although transmission by
          hand is uncertain." "Divine and marvelous is this blessing of
          letters," says Quintilian, "which protects words and holds them like a
          deposit for an absent person." Nor are the statutes and edicts of
          kings and commonwealths inscribed in bronze or posted in public places
          for any other reason than that this is the surest means of preserving
          them in their original form, and of proclaiming throughout the ages
          matters which it is important for people to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Although before Moses the church did without the written word, it
          does not follow that it can do so now, for the situation of the infant
          church of those days, which did not yet form a numerous body, was very
          different from that of the present church, which is established and of
          large size. The church of former times differed from that of later
          days: in it the unwritten word could more easily be preserved because
          of the longevity of the patriarchs, the small number of covenant
          people, and the frequency of revelations (even if many of them
          underwent corruption). But in another age, when human life had been
          shortened, and the church was not limited to one or another family,
          but had increased to a very large company, and the divine oracles were
          more rarely given, another form of governance was called for, so that
          this sacred commonwealth was ruled not merely by the spoken word, but
          by written laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Although some individual churches may have been without the
          written word of God at some particular time, especially when they were
          first established, they were not without what was written in the Word
          of God, which certainly sounded in their ears through human ministry;
          nor did the church as a whole lack the Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. The Holy Spirit as helper (epicorhgia), by whom believers are to
          be taught by God (Jer.31; John 6:43[45]; I John 2:27), does not make
          the Scripture any less necessary, because (1) he is not given us to
          bring new revelations, but to impress the written word on our hearts,
          so that the Word can never be separated from the Spirit (Isa.59:21).
          The Word acts objectively; the Spirit, efficiently. The Word strikes
          the ears externally; the Spirit lays bare the heart, internally. The
          Spirit is the teacher; Scripture is the teaching that he gives us. (2)
          The words in Jeremiah 31 and I John 2:27 are not to be understood
          absolutely and simply, as if it were no longer necessary for
          believers, under the new covenant, to use the Scripture; if this were
          so, there would have been no point in John's writing to them. But they
          are to be understood in a relative sense, because, on account of the
          greater abundance of the Holy Spirit under the new covenant, believers
          were not to be taught in so burdensome a form as through the primitive
          and undeveloped elements of the old. (3) Jeremiah's promise will
          receive its complete fulfillment only in heaven, where, on account of
          the brilliant vision of God, there will no longer be need for the
          ministry of Scripture or of pastors, but everyone will see God
          directly, face to face.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. It is not true that the church was preserved without Scripture
          during the Babylonian captivity, for Daniel is said to have perceived,
          from the books, before the end of the seventy-year period, the number
          of the years (Dan. 9:2), and in Nehemiah 8:2, Ezra is said to bring
          forth the book of the laws, not to write it anew. IV Esdras [II
          Esdras] 4:23, being apocryphal, proves nothing. Even if Ezra gathered
          the sacred books into one corpus, and corrected the careless errors of
          scribes, it does not follow that the church had completely lacked
          Scripture [in his time].
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. There is no evidence for Bellarmine's assumption that, since the
          time of Moses, any from other nations who have been led to the true
          religion had tradition only, and lacked Scripture, for if any became
          proselytes, they were instructed thoroughly in Moses and the prophets,
          as the single example of the eunuch of Queen Candace in Acts 8 [26-39]
          proves adequately. Nor was Scripture completely unknown to the
          Gentiles, especially after it was translated into Greek in the time of
          Ptolemy Philadelphus.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Christ therefore is our only teacher (Matt. 23:8) in such a way
          that the ministry of Scripture is not excluded, but is included of
          necessity, because he now speaks to us in it only, and builds us up
          through it. Nor is Christ opposed to Scripture, but to the false
          teachers of the Pharisees, who ambitiously pretended to the
          magisterial authority that belongs to Christ alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Although formally Scripture has no personal value for
          illiterates, who cannot read, nevertheless it serves materially for
          their instruction and edification, inasmuch as the teaching which goes
          on in the church is not taken from any other source.
