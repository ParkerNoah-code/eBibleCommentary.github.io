        <h2>The Divine Imperative of Written Revelation</h2>
        <p>THIRD QUESTION</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Was the Holy Scripture written because of the circumstances of the
            time (occasionaliter), and without divine command? Negative, against
            the Roman Catholics.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This question is debated between us and the Roman Catholics, who,
          in order to minimize the authority and perfection of Scripture, teach
          not only that it is less than necessary, and that the church could do
          without it, but even that it was written without any express divine
          commandment, and simply passed on to the church as a result of special
          circumstances. [They also] teach that Christ gave the apostles no
          commandment to write, and that they had no intention of writing the
          gospel, except in a secondary sense and because of special
          circumstances, as Bellarmine argues (De Verbo Dei, book 4.3-4).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the sacred writers responded to circumstances of time and
          place is unquestioned. We do not deny that they often put the
          mysteries of God into writing under such influence. The question is
          whether they wrote under such circumstances that they did not write by
          divine revelation and commandment. We indeed hold that this is not a
          matter of opposition, but of combination. They could write under the
          influence of circumstances and at the same time from divine
          commandment and inspiration. Indeed, since such a circumstance was not
          presented to them except through divine action, the writing was in
          accordance with the divine commandment, and the situation neither
          arose without design (temere) nor was used of their own will (sponte).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. An implicit and general commandment is to be distinguished from
          an explicit and special one. Granted that all the sacred writers did
          not have a special commandment to write, although this is frequent
          (Exod.17[:14]; Deut. 31:19; Isa. 8:1; Jer. 36:2; Hab. 2:2; Rev.
          1:12[11]), yet they all had the general one. For the commandment to
          teach (Matt. 28:19) includes the commandment to write, since without
          writing we cannot teach those who are in another place or who come
          after us, whence preaching is said to be done in writing, in deed, and
          in word. Further, immediate inspiration and the internal direction by
          which they were led by the Holy Spirit were the equivalent of a
          commandment (loco mandati) for the sacred writers, so that Paul called
          Scripture "God-breathed" (II Tim. 3:16), and Peter said, "Prophecy did
          not come by the will of man, but men of God spoke, moved by the Holy
          Spirit" (II Peter 1:21): that is, the apostles wrote when God inspired
          and moved them, although not in a mechanical manner, under coercion.
          No more effective commandment could be given than by the inspiration
          of the things to be written, nor is any one of the promises made by
          ambassadors fulfilled except one they have been commanded to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Granted that the apostles do not always mention a special
          commandment of Christ, which however they often do (for instance,
          John, Jude, and others), yet they witness strongly enough to such a
          commandment (1) when they professed themselves to be universal
          teachers of all nations, (2) when they called themselves faithful
          servants of Christ, and therefore peculiarly anxious to carry out his
          commandments, (3) when they witness that they were guided by the
          Spirit (II Peter 1:21). Therefore, Gregory sums the matter up well:
          "He who uttered these words wrote them; he who was the inspirer of
          their works wrote them."
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Not all the apostles were required to write, although all were
          required to preach. As they were jointly sent of divine inspiration to
          the task of preaching, so they should all proclaim the same message
          and follow it with writing; there was an equal responsibility in all
          matters that were essential for the apostolate, since all were equal
          as God-breathed teachers. But they did not have equal responsibility
          in the performance of every particular action, so it is not strange
          if, through the freedom of the Holy Spirit, some were called to both
          preaching and writing, and others to preaching only.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. A single book was not put together by all the apostles conjointly,
          both so that they would not seem to have acted together in conspiracy,
          and so that it might not seem to have greater authority than what each
          one wrote individually; it would seem that for the same reason Christ
          refrained altogether from writing: that we might say that he is the
          one who wrote his teaching not with ink but by the Spirit of the
          living God, not on tablets but in the heart (II Cor. 3:2[-3]). It was
          therefore sufficient that that which was approved by all [the
          apostles] should be written by some of them. Indeed it adds much
          weight and authority to the apostolic writings that, although they
          were written in different places, for different purposes and
          circumstances, in different styles and different forms, addressed to
          different people, yet [they] are so harmonious.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. It was not necessary for a catechism to be written by the
          apostles; (1) it was sufficient for them to transmit that by which all
          symbolic books and catechisms were to be tested. (2) If they did not
          write a catechism formally, yet materially they passed on, both in the
          Gospels and in the Epistles, that from which we may do catechetical
          work in the best possible manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. As we ought not to impose law on the Holy Spirit, and prescribe
          to him the method of revealing his will, so we ought not to doubt that
          the form of writing that has been followed is the most suitable, not
          only because at that time teaching by means of letters was a widely
          accepted procedure, because this manner of teaching was most useful
          for spreading the gospel rapidly, which was the chief purpose of the
          apostles; but also because this simple and popular form of writing
          suits the capacities of all, the uneducated as well as the educated,
          and teaches a theology that is not ideal and merely theoretical, but
          practical and specific (in hypothesi).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX.The Apostles' Creed is so called, not efficiently because it was
          passed on by the apostles, but materially, because it was composed
          from the apostolic teaching, and is the kernel (medulla) and
          compendium of the apostolic teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Those who wrote under the influence and compulsion (necessitas) of
          circumstances could nevertheless be writing from a [special]
          commandment: two realities, one of which is subordinate to the other,
          ought not to be understood as contradictory. Christ's commandment was
          the primary activating cause and the circumstance a secondary, less
          significant (minus principalis) activating cause, by which, as they
          wrote for the glory of God and the edification of the neighbor, the
          apostles preached both from divine commandment and on account of
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Granted that it was proper for the apostles to write because they
          were under obligation to teach, it does not follow that pastors are
          now always under the same obligation to write as to teach, because
          they work under different conditions. The apostles were obligated to
          teach all nations, as ecumenical teachers, but this is not the case
          with ordinary pastors, who have a particular congregation (grex)
          committed to them.
