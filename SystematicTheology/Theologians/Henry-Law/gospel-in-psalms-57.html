          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 57</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Trouble, prayer, confidence, and praise are the pervading notes of
          this instructive hymn. Our faith will surely have its trials. May each
          trial cause it to grow stronger! The shaken tree takes firmer root.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy! I look to you for protection.
            I will hide beneath the shadow of your wings until this violent
            storm is past."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The help of mercy is here keenly felt. A reiterated cry calls down its
          aid. In prayer importunity can never be excessive. Sometimes answers
          are delayed that this sweet exercise may be prolonged. Abundant pleas
          enforce the soul's desires. Here confidence in God is urged. It is a
          prevailing utterance, 'Help me, for in You is all my trust.'
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As when storms give sign of near approach, or the hawk hovers in the
          sky, the frightened brood seek shelter beneath the parent's wings, so
          the believer hides himself in God, and will not leave his refuge while
          perils are still near. Faith knows well the Covenant, and cries in
          full assurance that no good thing will be withheld, and that God, who
          begins the work of grace, will carry it to its end in glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
            who would swallow me up. God shall send forth His mercy and His
            truth. My soul is among lions; and I lie even among those who are
            set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
            arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here faith looks not for mercy only, but for fulfillment of the
          pledged word. Happy are those who are well versed in the exceeding
          great and precious promises, and can confidently pray, 'Do as You have
          said.' It is this confidence which sustains God's children even when
          malignity most rages and cruelty is most fierce. Such was David's case
          when Saul and all his court pursued with every form of persecution. He
          knew their savage malice; his eyes were open to their unsparing
          violence; but he looked upwards, and fainted not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let Your glory be above all
            the earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a precious thought, that when God appears to vindicate His
          people's cause there is accession to the glories of His name. The
          adversaries cannot but discern the favoring and protecting arm. They
          tremble, and their fear gives reverence to God. Therefore when we
          beseech God to stand by our side, we ask that honor and praise and
          glory may be more truly given.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they
            have dug a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen
            themselves."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          After this prayer David reverts to his foes; he sees their plots, and
          is oppressed; he sees the pit prepared in his path, but he feels that
          his steps will not be entrapped, but that the ruin so craftily
          designed will be ruin to the contrivers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give
            praise."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In all his troubles his steadfast confidence in God could not be
          moved. He stood as a rock amid assailing billows; he realized his sure
          deliverance; his ready harp was tuned for praise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9, 10, 11.
          <i
            >"Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake
            early. I will praise You, O Lord, among the people; I will sing unto
            You among the nations; for Your mercy is great unto the heavens, and
            your truth unto the clouds. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
            let Your glory be above all the earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Intense is the desire of faith to glorify God. The believer chides his
          tongue for being dull and remiss in this delightful duty. He resolves
          to redeem time from unnecessary repose that the refreshed faculties
          may consecrate their powers to God. He resolves that all to whom his
          voice could extend should hear of the great attributes of God. His
          delight shall be to tell of mercy and truth. But how can their
          infinitudes be reached? High are the heavens above the earth, but
          higher far is mercy which overtops the skies, and truth which soars
          above our powers to comprehend. The chorus again sounds, "Be exalted,
          O God, above the heavens; let Your glory be above all the earth."
