          In the bright day of prosperity the gloom of adversity is not
          forgotten. The contrast elevates the joy of success. Abundant
          victories are realized, and God is acknowledged as the author and
          giver of all good things.

          The past miseries of the kingdom are vivid to the mind of David. He
          remembered the internal commotions, and the people like sheep
          scattered and imperilled on the mountain's brow. He traced this to the
          just displeasure of God. He well knew that sin produced this
          alienation of God's favor. The prayer goes forth that righteous
          displeasure might now cease, and that God would again visit His people
          with His favor. He realized the terrible effects of God being
          estranged. He compares it to the terrors which result when the earth
          quakes and trembles to its base. He acknowledges the hard sufferings
          of the people, and marks the astonishment which darkened every brow.
          <i
            >O sin, O sin! what miseries you have brought upon a fallen earth!

          4-5.
          <i
            >"But you have raised a banner for those who honor youâ€”a rallying
            point in the face of attack. Use your strong right arm to save us,
            and rescue your beloved people."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The retrospect increases the joy that God, who had afflicted, had not
          cast off. Signs of favor had reappeared. When the enemy came in like a
          flood, God had lifted up a standard against him. Around this banner
          David mustered his people. He saw in it a proof that God would not
          permit His truth to fail, nor His pledged word to be trampled beneath
          ungodly feet. He knew that God had a beloved flock, and that for their
          sakes deliverance would be granted. The Lord of hosts had left for
          Himself a blessed remnant "in the midst of His people, as a dew from
          the Lord, and as the showers upon the grass."

        <p align="justify">
          6-10.
          <i
            >"God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice; I will divide
            Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead is mine, and
            Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is
            my lawgiver; Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe;
            Philistia, triumph because of me. Who will bring me into the strong
            city? who will lead me into Edom? Will not You, O God, who have cast
            us off? and You, O God, who did not go out with our armies?"</i

          Bright prospects glitter before David's eyes. He sees not only the
          firm establishment of Israel's kingdom beneath his sway, but the
          extension also of his dominion among tributary states. The assurance
          of this grand supremacy is founded on the Word of his God. God had
          spoken in His holiness. What God had promised in His holy Word He
          would assuredly perform. Therefore David's heart, full of this faith,
          overflowed with joy. He realized the preeminence of Judah's tribe. He
          knew that laws and decrees should issue from it, and that in God's
          good time the great Deliverer would be among its sons. He realized too
          that other tribes would await His royal decrees, and that neighboring
          provinces would bow before him. Moab should be reduced to servile
          work; Edom would be trodden down beneath his conquering feet;
          Philistia's triumph should be annexation to his rule.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The spiritual meaning is most obvious. Relying on God's holy Word, we
          should rejoice in the secure establishment of grace within our hearts,
          and we should long more, and strive more for the rapid growth of the
          Spirit's empire within, and the subjugation of all lusts and godless
          passions. David views the almost impregnable strength of Edom's
          fortress; but he knew that it must quickly fall; for God had returned
          to give victory to His arms.
        </p>

          11-12.
          <i
            >"Give us help from trouble; for useless is the help of man. Through
            God we shall do valiantly; for it is He who shall tread down our
            enemies."</i

        <p align="justify">
          He sees that all his armaments are weak except upheld by God. He prays
          for this help. He believes that it will surely come. He believes that,
          through his God, valiant exploits would be performed, and that through
          his God his feet would crush the necks of His foes. We believe that
          through Jesus we too shall do valiantly, and that yet a little while
          and Satan will be crushed beneath our feet.
