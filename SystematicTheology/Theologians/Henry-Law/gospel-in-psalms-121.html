          True safety is from God alone. His protecting care is portrayed in
          attractive colors. May they win us to place all confidence in Him!

          The pious child of Israel turned in devotion to the hill on which the
          Temple stood. He saw in it a type of Jehovah's presence. The lesson is
          here taught that all protection comes directly from our Heavenly
          Father. With confidence let us uplift our eyes to Him. He is the
          fountain of all grace. He, whose omnipotent word called heaven and
          earth into existence, can by the same word make all providences to
          promote His people's good.

          The believer often moves on slippery ground. Various enemies, also,
          dash against him. Left to himself, how quickly will he fall! But the
          Lord upholds him, so he stands as a rock against the lashing billows.
          The care which preserves him never relaxes its watchful guardianship.
          The eyes of the Lord, through day and night, from the opening to the
          closing of the year, are fixed immovably on His waiting people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade upon your right
            hand. The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Volumes are contained in the words, The Lord is your keeper. It is
          re-echoed by the Apostleâ€”We are kept by the power of God through faith
          unto eternal life. They are indeed securely kept who are encircled by
          their omnipotent God. In their Zionward march they are exposed to
          scorching rays. But as the pillar of cloud spread sweet refreshment
          over Israel's hosts, so the Lord wards off the adversary's piercing
          darts. To His people He is as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
          land.

            soul."</i

        <p align="justify">
          All strength and joy are included in the promise that God shall
          preserve us from all evil. The believer may exult in the assurance
          that all the assaults of Satan and the powers of darkness shall
          inflict no deadly wound. The soul shall live unharmed. It shall be
          brought in safety to the heavenly home.
        </p>

            this time forth, and even forevermore."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The pilgrimage may seem tedious. We may have many changes. We may be
          emptied from vessel to vessel. But final rest is secured. Through
          God's protection, heaven shall be attained. Let us lift up our heads
          with joy, and shout thanksgivings.
