        <p align="justify">
          The greatness and the glory of God are shown in His dealings with
          Israel. Let us joyfully remember that this God is our God forever and
          ever.
        </p>

            >"When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of
            strange language; Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His
            dominion."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Grievous was Israel's slavery in the land of Egypt. They were
          oppressed by tyrants, aliens in blood and speech. Their history should
          remind us that when we were lost by sin God sent redemption through
          His beloved Son, and called us into the kingdom of liberty and grace.
          Israel thus delivered was raised to be a peculiar people. They were
          consecrated to the service of the Lord. They had His sanctuary and His
          laws, His temple and His ordinances. The priestly office solemnized
          its rites, and God was acknowledged as their King. So, also, we are no
          more our own. We are ransomed, that we may delight in His ordinances
          and serve Him as our rightful Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"The sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven back. The mountains
            skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the set time of deliverance comes, no obstacles can check. The
          waters of the Red Sea seem to forbid escape from Egypt. The waters of
          Jordan seem to forbid entrance into Canaan. But at God's word they
          parted, and there was a dry passage for the hosts. Thus departure from
          perils was effected; thus entrance into the promised land was gained.
          Let faith take courage. The same power still works. The chosen seed
          shall depart in triumph from the captivity of Satan, and in triumph
          enter their eternal home. In Israel's march, also, astounding
          prodigies were shown. The strongest mountains trembled at God's
          presence and the gaping earth obeyed His mandates. Mighty powers are
          arrayed in opposition to God's people; but when the Lord speaks,
          trembling and quaking shake their might. "Who are you, O great
          mountain; before Zerubbabel, you shall become a plain."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-8.
          <i
            >"What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? Jordan, that you were driven
            back? mountains, that you skipped like rams; and little hills, like
            lambs? Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence
            of the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a standing water, the
            flint into a fountain of waters."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These marvelous interpositions were the direct acts of God. No natural
          causes produced these prodigies. This truth is enforced by lively
          questions addressed to inanimate objects. The presence of the Lord
          effected all. We next are reminded that providential care supplied
          their needs in the wilderness; the flinty rock melted, and streams in
          abundance flowed. These emblems teach that God's people shall have
          every need relieved. "When the poor and needy seek water, and there is
          none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear them; I
          the God of Jacob will not forsake them." O Lord, be it unto us
          according to Your gracious word! Supply all our need, according to
          Your riches in glory by Christ Jesus!
