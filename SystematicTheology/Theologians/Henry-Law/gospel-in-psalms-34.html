          God's never-failing care demands unfailing praise. Sheltered beneath
          the refuge of His wings, may we sing gratefully!

          We hear the voice of Jesus. On earth He dwelt in prayer and praise.
          Shall the Head thus speak, and shall not each member lengthen out the
          strain? No moment comes which bears not blessings on its wings. Let
          each moment carry back thanksgivings. We should be ceaseless in
          telling out our mercies, that the lowly sons of God may be witnesses
          of our joys.

            not ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved
            him out of all his troubles."</i

          This precious record of experience is common to the whole family of
          faith. They have the common portion of fear and trouble; but in all
          distress their course is the same. They seek the Lord. They turn their
          eyes to Him. To Him they raise the suppliant cry. They all are
          gladdened by the like result. They are all heardâ€”relieved, delivered,
          saved. They never hang their heads depressed in shame. Oh! happy
          people! happy lot! One, also, is their grateful task. They call on all
          around to swell their praise.

          If eyes were opened to behold surrounding scenes, what companies of
          heavenly guards would brightly shine around! Their ministering aid
          averts innumerable evils. They were sent in support to our glorious
          Head. Unseen, as truly their camp defends us.

          Heavenly counsels call us to know by glad experience the goodness of
          the Lord. The cup is brought to our very lips. We are invited to
          exhaust these waters of delight. The strongest in their strength may
          suffer famine; but all abundance of real food is the rich table of the
          humble saint.

          The heart of Jesus calls us children. He bids us to sit as children at
          His feet. Blessed are the lessons of His lips! The foremost is the
          fear of God. Oh, may we truly learn that fear!

            see good? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking

          The love of earthly life is natural to man; but life eternal is to see
          the goodness and the glory of the Lord. This is the result of grace.
          Where grace is freely given, the evidence is surely seen. It is no
          barren tree. The lips are guarded. The tongue is free from deceit. The
          ways of the Lord are diligently sought. The peaceable fruits of
          righteousness abound.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

            to their cry. The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to
            cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous cry,
            and the Lord hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles. The
            Lord is near to those who are of a broken heart; and saves such as
            are of a contrite spirit."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Delight in prayer is evidence of grace. The righteous cannot be
          silent. The watchful Lord hears every movement of their humble
          spirits. He quickly comes to bind up the mourning heart, and to
          deliver from the grasp of sorrow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How sad is the reverse of this sweet picture! There is a multitude who
          throng the paths of evil. The Lord's averted look to them is misery
          and death.

            him out of them all. He keeps all His bones; not one of them is

          Jesus at once appears. We learn from this particular, to

          <i>seek Him throughout these hymns. </i>He never is far distant from
          the eye of faith. When He was lifted up on the cross, the soldiers
          drew near to break His legs; but He was marvelously dead, and so they
          touched Him not. He drank to the dregs the cup of sorrow; but sorrow
          issued in eternal joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Believers tread, also, the path of countless sorrows, but they lead to
          everlasting rest. No vital injury ensues. The Lord restrains the
          malice of the foe. There may be many wounds, but they are not to
          death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          21 ,22.
          <i

            be desolate. The Lord redeems the soul of His servants; and none of
            those who trust in Him shall be desolate."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The wicked embrace evil. It is a viper which will suck their blood.
          They greedily drink the cup, but it is deadly poison. Oh! seek the
          Lord. He gives His Son to be complete redemption. He gives the joy of
          His presence now. There is now no lonely day, and soon there will be
          union to the vast company of the countless saved. May we be there!
