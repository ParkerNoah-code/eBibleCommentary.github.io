        <p align="justify">
          Longing desires are expressed for the joy of public ordinances. The
          happiness is extolled of those who frequent God's court. The God, who
          hears and answers prayer, is magnified.

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist speaks as one far distant from the hill of Zion. He
          remembers the delight of gazing on the beautiful Temple. The very
          sight had kindled love and devotion. In the fervor of retrospective
          ecstasy he extols the much-loved spectacle. May the sight of every
          consecrated house of worship fill us with adoring thoughts of Him
          whose worship there is sought!

        <p align="justify">
          Passionate expressions pour forth intense desire for the enjoyment of
          God's presence in the sanctuary. The heart burns with longings; the
          internal feeling is warmly exhibited. May the like feeling ever swell
          within us!

          Some obscurity may hide the precise significance of this poetic image.
          Let us be content to gain edification. Regard the birds of the air.
          They seek and find some secret places of repose, where they may rest
          in calm security and nestle with their infant brood. Thus our souls
          should find their tranquil home in nearness to their King and their
          God.

            >"How happy are those who can live in your house, always singing
            your praises. Happy are those who are strong in the Lord, who set
            their minds on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. When they walk through the
            Valley of Weeping, it will become a place of refreshing springs,
            where pools of blessing collect after the rains! They will continue
            to grow stronger, and each of them will appear before God in
            Jerusalem."

        <p align="justify">
          We see the picture of the tribes pursuing their journey to the great
          festivals at Jerusalem. They faint not, neither are weary. The needful
          strength is supplied. They are upheld in the journey. A gloomy valley
          must be passed, but in it they find refreshment. Water fails not. The
          wells have been replenished by the seasonable rains. Their limbs each
          day are girded with fresh strength. At last each pious Israelite
          safely treads the sanctuary for which his heart had panted. This is a
          picture of believers toiling through the march of life. The way is
          sometimes long; dark valleys must be passed, but sweet streams are
          ever near. Needful vigor is maintained. The heavenly Zion is surely
          reached. No pilgrim has perished on the road. They went forth to go
          into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan they came.

          In such prospect who will not cry, 'Give ear, of Jacob, listen to my
          cry, and bring me safely to Your longed-for home?'

            For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand; I would rather
            be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents
            of wickedness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is good to cause our pilgrimage to resound with prayer, and ever to
          recognize God's protecting presence. It is good to remind Him that we
          have the unction of the Holy One, and have received the earnest of
          heaven into our hearts. It is good to add that we prefer the lowest
          station in His courts to the highest splendors of stately palaces. Let
          us be followers of Moses, who chose rather to suffer affliction with
          the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,
          esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
          Egypt; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.

            glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
            O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who is a God like our God? What can we require that is not ours in
          Him? What is the sun to the world? What is the shield in the day of
          battle? All this and more than this He is to us. What can they need,
          from whom no good thing is withheld? May the Spirit guide us to walk
          uprightly! Then shall we inherit the blessedness of all who trust in
          Him.
