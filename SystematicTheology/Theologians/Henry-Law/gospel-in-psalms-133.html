            together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head,
            that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; that went down to
            the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
            that descended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord
            commanded the blessing, even life forevermore."</i

          Countless blessings gladden and enrich the pilgrims whose feet happily
          climb the hill of life. True joy is the companion of a close walk with
          God. These pilgrims are dressed in a lovely robe. Their garment is
          love of the brethren in the faith. This is the evidence of real union
          with Christ. This grace was the admiration of the heathen of old. It
          was the well-known testimony, See how these Christians love one
          another. This precious hymn exhibits this union as good, and pleasant,
          and fragrant, and fertilizing. It is good, as it is in accordance with
          the character of our Heavenly Father, of whom it is sublimely said,
          God is love. It is good, as those who exhibit it show the lineaments
          and features of the first-born among many brethren. It is pleasant.
          What can be more charming than to see the smile of love, to listen to
          the words of love, and to feel assurance that we are encircled by
          those whose hearts are knit with ours! It is fragrant, for it sheds
          around the perfume of true happiness. Ointment poured forth cannot
          refresh the home more than the constant sweetness of harmonious
          feeling. It is fertilizing as leading to the growth of grace, and as
          uniting hearts in every holy word and work. Thus it is figured by the
          holy oil which, poured upon the head of Aaron, ran in fragrant streams
          to the lowest portion of the priestly robes. It is fruitful as the dew
          which moistened the summits of Hermon and softened the heights of
          Zion's range. Let us seek this grace, so blessed in itself, so blessed
          to all with whom there is communion. But this unity implies not
          tolerance of error. Two cannot walk together except they are agreed.
          Light can have no fellowship with darkness. Those who thus walk
          together must first have met in Christ. Oneness with Him is the only
          true bond of union.
