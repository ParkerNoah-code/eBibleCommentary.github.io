        <p align="justify">
          Exhortations to sing praises are here prolonged. Views of Christ's
          kingdom suggest ample topics. May they kindle holy warmth in our
          hearts!

            His right hand, and His holy arm, has gotten Him the victory."</i

          Praise can never be exhausted. The more we contemplate the exploits of
          our Lord, the more we are moved to uplift adoration. The lessons of
          yesterday are expanded by the lessons of today. Fresh discoveries
          awaken new songs. But still no words can fully sing the wondrous works
          of God. Wonder is inscribed on Creation in its every part, and on
          Providence in its perpetual evolutions. But the wonders of Redeeming
          Love shine with the brightest blaze. Here Christ appears the mighty
          conqueror. Hell and its legion had usurped dominion over man. Many
          chains enthralled him. He was bound in irons of captivity. Jesus
          undertakes the rescue. He leads captivity captive, and saves His
          people from the cruel grasp. Alone He does the work. He by Himself
          purges our sins. Alone He hangs upon the accursed tree. Alone He
          tramples Satan beneath His feet. To Him be all the praise. In Him
          salvation triumphs.

          <i
            >"The Lord has made known His salvation; His righteousness has He
            openly shown in the sight of the heathen. He has remembered His
            mercy and His truth toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the
            earth have seen the salvation of our God."</i

        <p align="justify">
          His glorious victory is proclaimed throughout earth's length and
          breadth. Those who dwell in heathen darkness shall hear the wondrous
          tidings. All the gracious promises to Israel's sons shall be
          abundantly fulfilled. Is mercy pledged? Mercy to the uttermost shall
          be given. Every word of eternal truth shall be established. Salvation
          shall be adored, wherever man draws breath.

            >"Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise,
            and rejoice, and sing praise. Sing to the Lord with the harp; with
            the harp, and the voice of a psalm. With trumpets, and sound of
            cornet, make a joyful noise before the Lord the King."</i

          The claims of the Lord upon resounding praise are here exhibited in
          emphatic terms. When the heart and affections are thoroughly engaged,
          every power will be used. Not only will the lips be loud in their
          utterance, but everything which art can supply and instruments
          contribute will be thus hallowed. Nothing will be withheld, which can
          with reverence give aid.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-9.
          <i
            >"Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; the world, and those who
            dwell in it. Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be
            joyful together before the Lord; for He comes to judge the earth;
            with righteousness shall He judge the world, and the people with
            equity."</i

          Universal nature is next addressed. Everything which the Lord made
          should in some sense be handmaid to His praise. Let us hear in the
          roaring of the billows the acknowledgment of His Being. Let us see in
          the forests and the hills evidence of His greatness. Above all let us
          praise Him for the glories of His coming kingdom. Blessed be His holy
          name, He comes, He surely comes, He quickly comes. He shall take to
          Himself His great power and reign, and His kingdom shall be
          righteousness. Then earth will be one wide expanse of universal joy.
          Nature will put on her renovated dress. The sea in all its amplitude,
          the earth with all who occupy its space, the floods, the hills, with
          joyful tongues will swell the triumph. Let us by glad anticipation
          learn to take our part.
