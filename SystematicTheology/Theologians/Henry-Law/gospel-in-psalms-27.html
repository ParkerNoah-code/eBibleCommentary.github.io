        <p align="justify">
          Faith makes strong professions, and utters earnest prayers. May such
          be the exercise of our hearts unto life eternal!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord
            is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This ode begins with a noble outbreak of triumphant confidence. Faith
          is in loftiest exercise. Foes indeed surround; they are distinctly
          seen. Their presence and their might is not ignored. But no fear
          troubles; no dismay appals. Why? The believer knows that he is united
          to his Lord, and one with Him in the closest bonds; and that he has
          full interest in all the Lord's perfections. No darkness can bewilder,
          for the Lord is his light. No destruction can overtake, for the Lord
          is his salvation. His life can never perish, for the Lord is its
          strength. May we never rest until our lips can sing thus happily!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i

            up my flesh, they stumbled and fell."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here is the character of the adversaries of the Lord. They are the
          wicked. They are Cain-like, who was of that wicked one, and killed his
          brother. And why did he slay him? Because his own works were evil, and
          his brother's righteous. We see striking fulfillment in the garden of
          Gethsemane. The traitor enters with his evil band. Jesus meets them
          calm in the majesty of deity. His eye, His voice shatter their
          boldness. They cannot stand before Him. They go backward and fall to
          the ground. Such is the sure downfall of all the foes of Jesus.

          Hosts of men are less than nothing compared with heavenly guards. When
          the trembling servant cried, "Alas! my master, what shall we do?" the
          prophet answered, "Fear not, for those who are with us are more than
          those who are with them." Elisha prayed, "Open his eyes that he may
          see." He saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots
          of fire round about Elisha. Even so, let us only believe and we are
          safe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that
            I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to
            behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in His temple."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One supreme desire occupies the believing heart. He longs for close
          communion with the Lord. He diligently uses all appointed means. He
          seeks the ordinances which God's presence sanctifies. Such is the
          constant habit of his soul. It is no passing impulse. He pursues this
          hallowed communion all the days of his life. His eyes would see the
          beauty of the Lord, the lovely charm of His transcendent grace,
          displayed in redemption's wondrous work. His soul thirsts after fuller
          knowledge. His ardent cry is, "Show me Your glory."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; in
            the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me; He shall set me up
            upon a rock."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The result of faithful obedience is assurance of security. When
          troubles come like a flood, they cannot reach the tranquil worshiper.
          He is calm in the recesses of his Lord's presence. The curtains of His
          pavilion are spread around him. He stands high upon a rock. That rock
          is Christ. Those who are thus uplifted are far above the reach of
          hostile shafts. From his high stronghold he can look down and smile on
          all the rage of those who would destroy him. This rock is near. We are
          invited to its refuge. Let our steps hasten; then we are safe indeed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"And now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about
            me; therefore will I offer in His tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I
            will sing, yes, I will sing praises unto the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Assurance should be ever sought, and it may be scripturally won. The
          head no longer will hang down. It will put on the helmet of salvation.
          It will look down in triumph on foes now impotent to hurt. This
          assurance brings offerings to the Lord's altar. They are the
          sacrifices of thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Assurance has, also, a joyful voice. It ever sings, and the song is
          praises to the Lord. Here is a test to prove our state. We, surely,
          are loiterers in the plain, and have not reached the height of
          scriptural delight, unless our hearts continually send up the incense
          of abounding thanks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice; have mercy also upon me,
            and answer me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Assurance is far from presumption. While earth is the home,
          necessities will be present. Grace must be sought, and, therefore,
          with all praise, petition will be intermixed. The sinner, with all
          knowledge of salvation, still has knowledge of his sinful state.
          Therefore he never ceases to seek mercy. Knowing that God will hear
          and answer, he still will importune, Let answers comeâ€”give sweet
          tokens that my prayers prevail.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith hears the voice of God sweetly speaking in the Scripture page.
          It calls, it invites, it allures. It warns to arise and flee the
          vanities of earth. It tells of their emptiness. It promises peace and
          delight in the reconciled smile of God. The enlightened soul simply
          obeys. It flies away, and basks beneath the rays of heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9, 10.
          <i
            >"Do not hide Your face far from me; Do not turn Your servant away
            in anger; you have been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O
            God of my salvation. When my father and my mother forsake me, then
            the Lord will take me up."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The brightest sun may soon be overcast. Clouds may arise, and storms
          threaten, and darkness and chilliness interpose. Thus sense of sin,
          and consciousness of deep corruption, may stir up misgivings. Prayer
          wrestlingly beseeches that the smile so gladly sought may not become
          averted, and that no just wrath may close the door of conscious
          acceptance. Former supports are urged in plea. God is addressed as
          pledged by covenant to save, and bound by strongest ties never to
          desert or fail.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Earthly relationships are easily dissolved. Affection may decay.
          Fickleness begets estrangement. Distance may part. Death comes, and
          desolation sits where happy fellowship once reigned. But God's love in
          Christ is strong, immutable, eternal. He has the Father's heart, which
          beats with tenderness, incapable of diminution or of change. O Father,
          ever be a Father unto us!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11.
          <i
            >"Teach me Your way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of
            my enemies."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We again see how warily assurance walks. The firm belief that God
          cannot forsake, increases diligence to desire for constant guidance.
          The holy fears awaken lest ignorance should lead into unrighteous
          ways, and cause the watchful enemy to exult. Teach me, lead me, are
          wise prayers. They bring the Spirit's light to shine upon the path,
          the Spirit's hand to give sustaining aid.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12.
          <i
            >"Deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies; for false
            witnesses have risen against me, and such as breathe out
            cruelty."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We tread no path of trial or of suffering which is not hallowed by our
          Lord's preceding step. We taste no bitter cup which His lips have not
          drained. No misery afflicts us which He has not previously endured.
          The stings of slander are keen. It is anguish when false tongues
          persist in charging falsely. Jesus felt this. No scrutiny could find
          fault in Him; but still His judges must have a facade of evidence;
          therefore, false witnesses were bribed to fabricate malicious tales.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is great mercy in these foreshadowing views of Jesus. They
          imprint the stamp of inspiration on the blessed Word. David not only
          stands a conspicuous type, but words are placed upon his lips which
          find fulfillment in the varied trials of our Lord. We thankfully adore
          the mercy. We feel in our grateful hearts, The Scriptures are eternal
          truth; we may firmly trust them. They cannot be broken.
        </p>

          13.
          <i
            >"I had fainted, unless I had believed I would see the goodness of
            the Lord in the land of the living."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The original sentence is strikingly incomplete. The words, "I had
          fainted", are adapted as implying the soul's forlorn and sinking
          state, if faith and hope had not sustained it. But amid all sorrows
          and fears a joyful expectation cheered our Lord. He looked onward to
          the final display of God's goodness in the land of the living. He knew
          that death could not detain Him. He foresaw the glorious land, where
          He would reign the living head of a living family. Let our hearts
          confidently look onward. Soon the shadows will have passed awayâ€”the
          day will dawn, goodness will be the one atmosphere, and living souls
          will ever live.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14.
          <i
            >"Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your
            heart; wait, I say, on the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The 'wonderful Counselor' exhorts His followers to be strong in Him.
          He asks them to trust as He had trusted, and they will find as He had
          found. May the Spirit help us to act out this precious lesson! May He
          so nerve our spirits that no despondency may ever weaken! And may our
          eyes be ever raised to heaven, waiting until mercies issue forth. If
          they tarry, still let us wait. In due time surely they will come.
