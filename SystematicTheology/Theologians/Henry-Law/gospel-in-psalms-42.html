        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Rejection is the pervading note of this hymn. The joys of the
          sanctuary are forbidden. Insulting foes augment distress. In
          conclusion, the soul is chided for yielding to despondency.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"As the deer pants after the water-brooks, so pants my soul after
            You, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall
            I come and appear before God?"</i

        <p align="justify">
          A tender and expressive image meets us. The deer, exhausted by long
          flight beneath the scorching sun, or in the dusty plain, pants for the
          cooling stream in which to quench the pangs of thirst. How eagerly
          relief is sought! Here is the believer banished from the sweet
          refreshments of the sanctuary. It is not so much the outward form
          which is the object of desire, but the intimate communion with God, to
          which the services, when duly used, would surely raise. In true
          worship God's presence is sought and found, and thoroughly enjoyed.

          3, 4.
          <i
            >Day and night, I have only tears for food, while my enemies
            continually taunt me, saying, "Where is this God of yours?" My heart
            is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the
            crowds of worshipers, leading a great procession to the house of
            God, singing for joy and giving thanks—it was the sound of a great
            celebration!
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Fast flowing tears testified the deep sorrows of the Redeemer's heart,
          when He heard the revilings of His foes. They taunted Him with the
          sneer, that surely His banishment from holy service was proof that God
          had forsaken Him. He remembered the happy seasons when, in happy
          company, He sought the sanctuary, and joined His praises to those of
          the multitude of fellow-worshipers. It is the very foretaste of
          heaven, with one mind, and one mouth, to unite in public adoration.

          <i
            >"Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disturbed in me?
            hope in God; for I shall yet praise Him for the help of His
            countenance."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Too much depression is a sign of weak faith—anxiety should never
          occupy a godly heart. It is well to chide the soul, and rouse it from
          its downcast state. Hope should go forth in lively exercise. In
          darkest days it should look to Jesus, and take courage. Nothing should
          weaken the assurance that the outcome of the most grievous trials will
          be increased thanksgiving to our God.
        </p>

          6.
          <i
            >"O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore will I
            remember You from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from
            the hill Mizar."</i

          Its consolation is not easily eradicated. Like the noxious weed again
          and again it reappears. But thoughts of God will still revive in the
          faithful breast. Though God may be apparently far distant, the eye of
          faith will turn towards Him. Though driven beyond Jordan, the Psalmist
          still remembers Zion, and the tabernacles of his God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7, 8.
          <i
            >"I hear the tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging
            tides sweep over me. Through each day the Lord pours his unfailing
            love upon me, and through each night I sing his songs, praying to
            God who gives me life."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          As wave upon wave, distress will sometimes follow distress. As
          descending rain swells the streams, and floods overwhelm the plains,
          so torrents of sorrow will oppress the heart. Yet the believer is
          sustained by undoubting trust. He knows that lovingkindness has
          received a mandate to visit him throughout the day, and to cheer him
          with songs in the night season, and to strengthen him to wrestle with
          God in prayer, as the God who maintains his life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9, 10.
          <i
            >"I will say to God my rock, Why have You forgotten me? why go I
            mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? As with a sword in
            my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say daily to me, Where
            is your God?"
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          When the believer can realize that God is his rock, he is bold to
          expostulate, and thinks it no presumption to implore attention to his
          suffering case. He states as the extremity of his anguish, that he is
          pierced to the quick by the impious insolence of cruel mockers, who
          reiterate the taunt, that God has forsaken him, and is indifferent to
          his woe. He appeals to God, Why am I thus afflicted?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11.
          <i
            >"Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disturbed within
            me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my
            countenance, and my God."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Admonition with the soul is repeated. Trials will return; and they
          must be met with renewal of spiritual reasoning. The covenant is
          forever settled in heaven. Hope, therefore, should never fail.
          Deliverance will surely come. The voice of praise will again shout,
          "He is the health of my countenance, and my God."
