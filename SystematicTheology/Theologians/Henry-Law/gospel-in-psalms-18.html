          Mighty deliverance is realized, and utter ruin of every foe. May we
          intelligently swell the note of praise!

          These fervent words show David's glowing heart. When seated on the
          throne of victory he saw his foes all low in dust, and felt that God
          had done it. He exhausts all warlike terms to show that God was his
          stronghold, God his armor, and God his power. God kept him safe; God
          gave him conquest. What can he render in return? He gives his heart.
          He gratefully exclaims, "I love You, O Lord."
        </p>
        <i> <p align="justify">David</p></i> soon disappears.
        <i>Jesus</i> Himself strides forth. David's typical career suggests this
        noble song; but in its fullness it is Messianic. Faith hears it flowing
        fresh from Jesus' heart. It reads here redemption's conflict,
        redemption's triumphs, and it is exceeding glad. How feelingly would
        Jesus' lips exclaim, O my Father, I love You. You have been my fortress!

          It is a precious gift to know that

            cried to my God; He heard my voice out of His temple, and my cry

          The Man of sorrows is before us. When bearing the penalty of our sins
          to the uttermost, His soul was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death.
          In prayer He sought relief; by prayer He gained support.

            mountains shook; they quaked because of his anger. Smoke poured from
            his nostrils; fierce flames leaped from his mouth; glowing coals
            flamed forth from him. He opened the heavens and came down; dark
            storm clouds were beneath his feet. Mounted on a mighty angel, he
            flew, soaring on the wings of the wind. He shrouded himself in
            darkness, veiling his approach with dense rain clouds. The
            brilliance of his presence broke through the clouds, raining down
            hail and burning coals. The Lord thundered from heaven; the Most
            High gave a mighty shout. He shot his arrows and scattered his
            enemies; his lightning flashed, and they were greatly confused. Then
            at your command, O Lord, at the blast of your breath, the bottom of
            the sea could be seen, and the foundations of the earth were laid
            bare."</i

          We may not pause to marvel at the dazzling splendor of this brilliant
          picture. It is a poetic fervor in full blaze. Image succeeds image,
          revealing almighty vengeance arrayed in terror, and flying in dreadful
          majesty to sustain His chosen. David, thus speaking, felt that
          miracles had helped his cause; that God Himself had fought in his
          behalf. If all the hidden wonders of his wondrous career were open to
          our view, if we had witnessed all the marvels which amazingly
          delivered him, we would not wonder that such fervent language burst
          from his lips.

          But in the Antitype the picture's colors are not overlaid. During the
          garden agony, during the horrors of the Cross, we conclude that a
          dreadful conflict was enacted unseen by mortal eye. We read indeed of
          nature's throes. In spirit we see darkness unparalleled; we feel the
          trembling of the quaking earth; but we do not see the hidden battle;
          we do not see all hell in fury to secure the victory; we do not see
          Jehovah arising in His strength, and rousing His instruments of wrath
          to crush the desperate foe and to sustain His suffering Son. We follow
          the guidance of this picture, and we ponder a deep mystery.

          We learn how real, how agonizing, was the anguish of our Lord. To pay
          sin's penalty was to endure hell. But He prevailed, for God was with
          Him. His trials were thus foreseen, but He encountered them. He waded
          conqueror through the many waters, for God was by His side. Let us
          thank and bless Him who suffered, and by suffering saved us; let
          grateful love adore Him.

          The conflict ended in most glorious life. Our Jesus was exalted to

          One zeal burned steadily in Jesus' heart. He came to earth to do His
          Father's will. To this polestar His course was always pointed. He came
          to do redemption-work, to save lost sinners, to atone for sin, to
          bring in perfect righteousness, to satisfy the law's demand, to keep
          its beautiful code, to honor all God's attributes, to bring glory to
          His name. He ceased not until He cried, "It is finished," and received
          the welcome, "Sit on My right hand."

          God's dealings with His incarnate Son all flowed in the channel of
          truth and justice. Pure godliness had claims. These claims were duly
          satisfied. So, also, no grace in the believer's heart is overlooked.
          God meets and cheers with blessings all those who by the Spirit's help
          strive to walk closely with Him. Each grace sows seeds of favor.
          Especial pity marks the sufferers in oppression's furnace. Bruised
          Israelites are comforted. Haughty Pharaohs are cast down.

          In darkest moments of desertion Jesus well knew that a bright dawn was
          near. The sun eclipsed is not the sun extinguished. The shadow will
          soon pass, and the returning rays will be more joyous. Thick troops
          may seem to choke the way, strong batteries may impede. But when God
          helps, no obstacles can check. A way is opened through opposing ranks.
          <i> Strength is supplied to overleap all hindrances. </i>

          Knowledge of God is comfort in all times. It was so to our Head on
          earth. It has been so to every saint. It will be so until Jesus shall
          return. His dealings with His Church are perfection. No flaw therein
          was ever found. There is one testimony, "He has done all things well."
          His truth is often tested; but each trial proves that it is firm and
          pure. Who ever stood behind His armor and received a wound? He is well
          shielded whose shield is the Lord. Vain is all other help. Besides
          Jehovah there is no God. All other confidences mock and deceive. He
          only stands as an immovable rock. All earthly props and supports are
          shifting sand; when the storm comes they shake and fall.

          ability are prepared. The armor is spiritual and wrought by God,
          because the enemy is bitter and satanic. Let us gird ourselves with
          every weapon. It will be found sufficient.

          whispers will encourage; gentle smiles will animate. Happy experience
          will at last clap the hand, and sing, "Your gentleness has made me

          David's experience here speaks. When calm in peace, high in supreme
          dominion, undisturbed by wars and hostile menace, he looked back on
          his eventful course. Many indeed had been his fights; perils
          frequently had been extreme; but conquest followed conquest, until he
          rested on a peaceful throne. But he knew well that conquering strength
          was not his own; he saw the source of his supremacy; he trampled on
          the necks of foes<i> because God laid them low before him.</i>

          Here is a picture of the aged pilgrim pondering his bygone trials. He
          has passed through outward troubles leaning on his God. The deep
          waters did not overwhelm him because the heavenly hand sustained him.
          The lusts, the passions, the corruptions of the inner man failed to
          destroy the inner life, because grace was infused to fan the
          threatened embers. Faith testifies, I live because Christ lived within
          me. Mine is the joy; the victory is the Lord's.

          against the Gospel-truth must gnash the teeth, all crushed beneath His
          chariot-wheels. A kingdom shall be set up in which pure righteousness

          Great deliverances are their portion; constant mercy is their

          succeed—that soon the warfare will be all accomplished, and that they
          shall magnify the conquering Lamb with conquering song! May we sing
          with them!
