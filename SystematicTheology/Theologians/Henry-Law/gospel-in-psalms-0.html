        <p align="justify">
          A brief statement will show the simple purpose of this work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Christian households will surely be assembled on each day for
          <b>domestic worship</b>. Piety cannot allow the morning to open and
          the evening to close without united prayer for common blessings and
          united praise for common mercies. Religion will cease to be the
          pervading element in the house in which the inhabitants fail thus to
          present themselves together at the throne of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is impossible to overestimate the blessings which may be expected
          from such family solemnities. They sweetly sanctify the home, and are
          a holy picture of celestial oneness. Love will then cement the hearts
          which together seek a heavenly Father's face—together vow obedience to
          His will—together consecrate their every faculty to His
          service—together bless Him for their common hope—together adore Him
          for the gift of Jesus, and all the preciousness of the
          Gospel-revelation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is presumed, also, that a portion of Scripture will have a place in
          these exercises, and that suitable comments will enforce God's Word.
          The Book of Psalms will doubtless not be excluded. Its central
          position as the heart of Scripture—its devotional character as part of
          the Jewish liturgy—its adaptation to every circumstance of life,
          rather entitle it to especial consideration.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Survey most superficially its contents.<i>
            It traverses every condition of man.</i
          >
          It roams with the shepherd in the meadows. It sits with the mighty
          monarch on the throne. It flees with the fugitive on the hills, and
          hides with him in the caves. It leads the conquering host to victory.
          It walks with the busy in the crowded haunts, and leaves not the
          lonely in their solitude. It is a <i>prop</i> for the staggering
          steps—a <i> guide</i> for the wanderer—a <i>counselor</i> when
          perplexities bewilder—a

          <i>pillow</i> for the weary head—a <i>sympathizing hand</i> to wipe
          the weeping eye—a voice to whisper <i>comfort</i> to the disconsolate.
          No words more cheer the dying saint.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The soul in extremest agony for sin finds here a ready outlet for the
          bitterest streams of sorrow. Words are here supplied to crave
          deliverance from wrath. When a saving interest in Christ is realized
          and joy is in the height of rapture, here are the wings to bear aloft
          to heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the main glory of this book is its <i>identity with Christ</i>. He
          brightly shines throughout its varied hymns. He is constantly the
          speaker, and in these breathings of His Spirit we receive convincing
          evidence that, without ceasing to be God, He was a perfect man, and
          preeminently a Man of Sorrows. We here are supplied with a vivid
          portrait of

          <i>His character, His work, His love, His sufferings, His glory. </i
          >It would be no difficult task to construct a Gospel from its
          prophetic language. It may be regarded as His manual during His career
          on earth. When, as the expiating God-man, He was uplifted on the
          accursed tree, and the iron entered into His soul, His misery goes
          forth in the moanings of a Psalm, "My God, My God, why have You
          forsaken Me?" He gives up the spirit uttering its confiding terms,
          "Into Your hands I commend My spirit." He ascends amid the shouts,
          "Lift up your heads, O you gates!" He receives the welcome, "Sit on My
          right hand."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In it the history of Israel's Church is shadowed out from its cradle
          in the iron furnace of Egypt, through its days of light and darkness,
          through its triumphs and reverses, through its rejection in unbelief,
          through its long and dreary desertion to its ultimate recovery and
          final glory. Prophets, apostles, ministering servants, have gathered
          flowers from this field. Whenever the Gospel is preached, weighty
          arguments, convincing proofs, telling exhortations, dreadful warnings,
          are extracted from its vast mine. Thus wide is the expanse of
          suggestions for prayer to which the Book of Psalms invites.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I thus reach the unpretending object of this work. It seeks to give
          some little aid, when in due course the Psalms are opened out.
          Divisions are made of appropriate length for such exercise, and
          <i>
            devotional thoughts are adjoined tending to excite the spirit of
            prayer and praise.</i
          >
          All attempt to elucidate by <i>critical acumen</i> is utterly
          eschewed. If it had been possible for the writer to introduce
          conclusions of learning, they would have been rejected as adverse to
          the plan. Time has not been employed to establish a connection between
          the speaker's feelings and historic events. When the reference is
          clear, no notice is needed. When it is obscure, it is more easy to
          increase than to remove uncertainty. It is enough to know that the
          Holy Spirit depicts real and not imaginary cases.
          <i>
            It is the reader's profit to find identity in his individual
            experience.
          </i>

          He will often be constrained to feel that He who inspired these words
          knew accurately the secrets of each heart, and presents a mirror
          thoroughly divine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may interest the scholar to investigate the claims of diverse
          versions for acceptance. But the hour of prayer is not suitable for
          such research. Therefore the reasoning powers have never been thus
          summoned to give aid.
          <i>To help devotion has been the one and only desire.</i> Other works
          abound in which the gifts of mind have been nobly used to display the
          wonders of this Book. The one design here has been to make it a
          vehicle of piety. The object is attained whenever worship is made a
          real approach of the heart unto God. It is hoped that the frequent
          appeals to the heart may exclude formality—that enemy to direct
          communion with God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This observation finds excuse in the growing desire to multiply the
          objective and the picturesque in places of public worship. Surely
          attention directed to artistic decorations and mimicry of Rome's showy
          service tends to divert from close dealings with Heaven. Real prayer
          is not kindled by extraneous sights. It is the Spirit moving in the
          inner man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"></p>
        <p align="justify">
          May He, whose glory only has been sought, give His blessing for the
          sake of Jesus Christ!
