          The happy state of the compassionate is depicted. The vindictive
          malevolence of the ungodly is also shown. Prayer to God and profession
          of faith follow with warm ascription of praise.

            time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive; and
            he shall be blessed upon the earth; and You will not deliver him to
            the will of His enemies. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed
            of languishing; You will make all his bed in his sickness."</i

          Tender compassion for the poor and suffering is the fruit of the
          Spirit in the minds of believers. It is a sweet feature in the family
          of faith. The Lord regards such with especial love. But they are not
          exempt from trouble. Their heavenward march is through much
          tribulation; sickness often assails their frames, languor depresses
          them, and weakness detains them to a bed of suffering. But they are
          not desertedâ€”no, they now are compassed with peculiar mercies. When
          heart and flesh appear to fail, the inner man is renewed with especial
          strength. Welcome all sickness which brings Jesus to the bedside!

          The suffering saint draws nearer to his God. He does not hide his sin;
          he sees in it the cause of soul-disease, and he supplicates for mercy
          to bring relief.

            perish? And if he comes to see me, he speaks vanity; his heart
            gathers iniquity to itself; when he goes abroad, he tells it. All
            that hate me whisper together against me; against me do they devise
            my hurt. An evil disease, say they, cleaves fast to him and now that
            he lies, he shall rise up no more."</i

          Sad is this picture of the treachery and deep malice of false friends.
          It is a grief to those who the godly live. They long for the day when
          the grave shall cover them, and their fame no more be heard. This is
          the very treatment which assailed the holy Jesus. Grievous sins were
          laid to His charge. Watchful spies marked His words and steps; and
          base accusations were continually propagated, and when the grave
          received Him, vigilance guarded the tomb lest His predicted
          reappearance should be verified.

          Doubtless, in the first instance, Absalom is here portrayed. But in
          his heartless and unnatural rebellion he is the type of the vile
          traitor, whose wickedness can find no parallel in the history of
          crime. We see in him to what a depth of sin the graceless heart can
          sink. He walked the familiar friend of Jesus, he was constantly by His
          side, he witnessed His heavenly walk, and with all knowledge of His
          truth, he took a paltry bribe to sell Him to His foes. We learn from
          this foreshadowing of the treason, that our blessed Lord approached
          redemption's work with full knowledge of the anguish and the
          sufferings before Him. O blessed Jesus! we adore You that, foreknowing
          all, You endured all to raise us from sin and sin's punishments to the
          heights of heavenly glory!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10, 11.
          <i
            >"O Lord, be merciful to me, and raise me up, that I may requite
            them. By this I know that You favor me, because my enemy does not
            triumph over me."</i

          Predictions still speak. From the dead Jesus was raised. All power in
          heaven and earth was surrendered to Him. All the enemies who fought
          against Him were crushed beneath the wheels of His chariot of triumph.
          Happy are those who meekly bow before Him, and accept His blessed
          sway!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12, 13.
          <i
            >"And as for me, You uphold me in my integrity, and set me before
            Your face forever. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from
            everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen."</i

          Jesus was upheld until He returned in triumph to the heaven of
          heavens, and took His seat as King of Glory on the right hand of the
          Majesty on High. So each believer may plead with confidence the
          promise, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Constant smiles
          will gild the passage to the realms of everlasting light. Let, then,
          the shout begin on earth, which shall continue through eternity's
          bright day, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting and
          to everlasting. Amen, and Amen!"
