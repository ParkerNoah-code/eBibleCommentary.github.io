        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Exhortations to praise the Lord are reiterated. Motives to this
          exercise are boundless, and are piously set forth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-3.
          <i
            >"Praise the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord; praise Him, O you
            servants of the Lord, you who stand in the house of the Lord, in the
            courts of the house of our God, praise the Lord; for the Lord is
            good; sing praises to His name; for it is pleasant."</i

          Fervor never should relax in awakening others to give praise. Every
          faculty should burn in efforts to promote this duty. Let ministering
          servants lead the van and wave the standard. It is most true that no
          praises can adequately extol God's goodness. Think of His mercies and
          overflowing love. The infinitude of His love is shown in the gift of
          His dear Son to accomplish salvation, to endure our curse, to bring us
          safely to the heaven of heavens, to present us faultless before the
          presence of His glory. Can we reflect on such grace and not exclaim,
          The Lord is good! This exercise of praise fills the soul with
          exquisite delight. It is the joy of joys. It is the foretaste of
          heaven. Let us then call upon all that is within us and around us to
          bless His holy name.

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          No height of praise can measure the wondrous grace of God in setting
          His love on sinful sons of men. Everything in them is calculated to
          excite alienation. Justice, holiness, and truth seem terribly to
          frown. Still He loves. The gift of Jesus for them is the main
          evidence. In this love He regards them as His peculiar treasure. He
          honors them as the riches of His kingdom, as the brightest jewels in
          His crown.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all
            gods. Whatever the Lord pleased, that He did in heaven, and in
            earth, in the seas, and all deep places."</i

          We cannot too often ponder the almightiness of God. Every view awakens
          admiration. The gods of the heathen are vanity, and less than dust and
          chaff. His will is power in the highest. His decrees prevail in every
          part of His dominions, in all the earth, in all above it, in all
          beneath it. His power rules unlimited and supreme.

            >"He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He
            makes lightnings for the rain; He brings the wind out of His
            treasuries."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The wild elements seem to unenlightened observation to act
          capriciously and without control. But His power holds them fast bound
          in His hands. No vapors arise, no lightning flashes, no rain descends,
          no wind blows furiously, but in accordance with His sovereign will.
          Let us bless God for His unbounded rule.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-9.

            tokens and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and
            upon all his servants."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Memory should review the manifestations of His power, when with mighty
          arm He rescued His people from the iron furnace of Egypt. Then wailing
          filled every house, for the first-born was stretched among the dead.
          Then terrible plagues swept the whole land with the broom of
          destruction. O God, who will not reverence Your glorious power!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-12.
          <i
            >"Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; Sihon king of the
            Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan; and
            gave their land for an heritage, an heritage to Israel His
            people."</i

        <p align="justify">
          He who rescued His children from Egypt left them not in the perils of
          the wilderness. Many foes confronted them, but their heavenly Lord
          raised them above all perils. Mighty potentates with powerful armies
          opposed their progress, but resistance opposed in vain. The victorious
          host marched in triumph into the promised land. But they entered not
          without a struggle. The kings of Canaan mustered all their forces to
          repel the invaders. But they vanished as the chaff of the summer
          threshing floor. The whole land fell prostrate before their feet.

        <p align="justify">
          In this sustaining and enabling help, we have a precious picture of
          God's unfailing care of His people. He who begins a good work in them
          performs it to the end. They are kept by the power of God through
          faith to eternal life. He never leaves them nor forsakes them until
          they sit as conquerors on their thrones of glory. Let us bless God for
          His converting grace. Let us bless Him not less for His guardian arm
          and for His ever-watchful aid.

            "Your name, O Lord, endures forever; your fame, O Lord, is known to
            every generation. For the Lord will vindicate his people and have

        <p align="justify">
          From everlasting to everlasting the name of the Lord shall be
          magnified. His wondrous works shall be the theme of never-ending
          praise. He will never fail to vindicate His people. If for a little
          season He may seem to be regardless of their trials, the purpose is to
          strengthen their grace. In due time it shall be apparent that His love
          failed not.

        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's
            hands. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but
            they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; neither is there
            any breath in their mouths. Those who make them are like them; so is
            every one that trusts in them."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The infatuation of those who form material images and call them gods
          is astonishing. Alas! multitudes as senseless as these idols still
          throng the benighted regions of this earth. Shall we remit our efforts
          to send to them the knowledge of the true and only God, and Jesus
          Christ whom He has sent?

          Blessings should ever sound from the lips of the ministers of His
          truth. His faithful servants should re-echo His praise. Who should
          bless Him more than ourselves? Let us loudly shout and never end our
          grateful hallelujahs.
