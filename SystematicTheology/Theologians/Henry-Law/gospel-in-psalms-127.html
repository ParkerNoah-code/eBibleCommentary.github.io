          Safety and success can only come from God. Pious families are
          multiplied by His blessing.

          It is a blessed lesson in the Spirit's school that God's all-ordering
          hand and all-controlling power direct events. He sits upon the throne
          of universal sway. Prosperity abounds only as furthered by His will.
          Failure undermines all efforts which rest not on His sovereign desire.
          All labor is but nothingness except He commands the blessing. Without
          Him workmen toil to gain vanity. Guards may surround the city with
          much show of force, but if the Lord is absent their weapons and
          vigilance end in defeat. Jesus comforts with the assurance that all
          power is His in heaven and in earth. Let us flee to Him and cling to
          Him. Then we shall surely prosper. Adversity can never frown when
          Jesus smiles.

          It is sad when men consume their time and energies in fruitless toil.
          If God is forgotten, and His aid unsought, the midnight hours and the
          early dawn are vainly spent in labors. Profitless is all exercise of
          mind and body if He is excluded who alone dispenses blessings. Shut
          out the sun, and there is no light. Omit the ball, and empty is the
          cannon's sound. Let His servants make Him their all, and He will cause
          them to repose in peace. Tranquil confidence will trust events to His
          guardian care, and thus sweet calm will soothe the breast.

            >"Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the
            womb is His reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so
            are children of the youth. Happy is the man who has his quiver full
            of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the
            enemies in the gate."</i

          It is a lovely scene when pious parents sit surrounded by a pious
          progeny. The happy circle gives evidence that God's favoring smile
          beams on the family. Heavenly feeling pervades the house. Love of God,
          faith in the redeeming blood and covering righteousness of Christ, are
          ruling principles. There is joy in present communion and in
          anticipation of eternal fellowship. The godly union, also, is
          strength. No enemies can resist the arrows aimed by a giant hand. Thus
          foes prevail not over this holy company. No shame or confusion
          depresses their heads. They boldly meet all adversaries. Who will not
          serve the blessed Lord, and delight in the heritage which is His
          people's crown!
