        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist resolves to be guarded in his speech. He reflects on the
          brevity of human life, and the vanity of earthly show. He prays in
          prospect of his near departure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2, 3.
          <i
            >"I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
            tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is
            before me. I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, even from good;
            and my sorrow was stirred. My heart was hot within me; while I was
            musing the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue."</i

          A grievous picture meets our eyes. Sad it is, and sadly common. The
          children of God are surrounded by the children of the evil one.
          Provocations press them to utter strong reproof; but holy wisdom
          restrains impatient utterance. The bridled tongue avails more than
          indignant remonstrance. But the inward agitation, like smoldering
          embers, will break forth in flames.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again we see the meek and lowly Jesus. Amid the frantic fury and cruel
          mockings of His unjust judges and the raging crowd, no railing word
          breaks from His holy lips.
        </p>

          <i
            >"Lord, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it
            is; that I may know how frail I am."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Troubles find mitigation in the thought that they are linked to
          fleeting time, and soon must reach their end. Sense of brief tenure
          and near dissolution check all outbreaks of impatience. Therefore it
          is good to pray, 'Lord, teach us our frailty.'
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5, 6.
          <i
            >"Behold, You have made my days as a handbreadth, and my age is as
            nothing before You; verily every man at his best state is altogether
            vanity. Surely every man walks in a vain show; surely they are
            disquieted in vain; he heaps up riches and knows not who shall
            gather them."</i

          The tiniest time is a fitting emblem of an earthly course. Its measure
          is as nothing when compared with eternal things. The things which are
          seen are temporal, the things which are not seen are eternal.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Look at the state which worldlings prize as the pinnacle of bliss. Let
          riches abound, and honors crown the brow, and power raise to loftiest
          station; let health bloom brightly, and strength nerve the limbs, let
          no worldly wish be ungratified—the whole is but a shadow, an empty
          husk, an unsubstantial facade. It is as the flower of the grass—green
          in the morning, in the evening dry and withered. The riches piled with
          toil, anxiety, and ceaseless effort, must be left. To whom?
          Uncertainty conceals the heir. No mind can tell who shall get them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. <i>"And now, Lord, what do I wait for? my hope is in You."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer waits in full assurance that aid will come from heaven in
          God's good time. Let all trials be welcomed which brighten the rays of
          godly hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9, 10, 11.
          <i
            >"Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of
            the foolish. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because you did it.
            Remove Your stroke away from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your
            hand. When You with rebukes correct man for iniquity, You make his
            beauty to consume away like a moth; surely every man is vanity."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Consciousness of sin as the indwelling root of suffering will always
          abide, and should always prompt the prayer for deliverance by the
          mighty power of grace; and this prayer should be quickened by the fear
          lest the ungodly should gain advantage, and impiously exult. The
          resolve should be renewed to endure patiently, from persuasion that
          the hand of God thus chastens, that the fruits of righteousness should
          spring up. Reiterated prayer calls for withdrawal of the heavy hand.
          The feeble and the withered look soon shows the anguish of the
          afflicted heart. Behold the moth-eaten garment, unsound and rotten—it
          is the emblem of the countenance of the sin-stricken.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12, 13.
          <i
            >"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry; hold not Your
            peace at my tears; for I am a stranger with You, and a sojourner, as
            all my fathers were. O spare me, that I may recover strength, before
            I go hence and be no more."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When troubles increase, prayers should grow more earnest. It is good
          to realize that this present world is not our rest. Our abiding city
          is not on earth. Where are our fathers? Are we better than they? But
          they are gone; and as they went, we follow. But it should be our deep
          desire that our last days should be our best, and that as life fades
          our faith should more exalt the praises of our God. For this we need
          increase of grace. May we be so strengthened that our departing steps
          may show the upward path, and allure beholders to follow our example!
