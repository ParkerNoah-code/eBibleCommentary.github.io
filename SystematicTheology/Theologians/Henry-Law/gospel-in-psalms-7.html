        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          David, stung by unjust reproach, appeals to God. He prays and foresees
          future judgment. The end is praise. When slanders fly around may we be
          similarly calm.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"O Lord my God, I put my trust in You; save me from all those who
            persecute me, and deliver me; lest he tear my soul like a lion,
            rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          David had felt the persecuting rage of man. In peril of life he often
          fled. Trembling, he had cried, "There is but a step between me and
          death." The enemy had pursued, athirst for blood, mad as the wildest
          beast of prey, with fangs extended to rend his limbs to atoms.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To this day malicious fury raves in sinful hearts. If no restraining
          barriers had interposed, all people of God would long since have been
          swept from earth. But when cruelty reviles, they know their
          stronghold. Their God is their high fortress of defense. They enter
          and are safe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4, 5.
          <i
            >"O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my
            hands; if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me;
            (yes, I have delivered him who without cause is my enemy;) let the
            enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yes, let him tread down my
            life upon the earth, and lay my honor in the dust."
          </i>

        <p align="justify">
          Pure conscience gives enlargement at the throne of grace. He can lift
          up the head who knows that every charge is false. David was pure of
          guilt towards Saul. He never sought to hurl him from his throne. He
          planned no traitorous plots; he sowed no seeds of insurrection. Far
          otherwise. When in the providence of God his cruel foe was helpless in
          his hands; when one blow would have crushed persecution, he would not
          strike. He cut off the mantle and bore off the spear to prove his
          power to slayâ€”his generosity to spare. Thus conscious of innocence, he
          appeals to God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here Jesus shows Himself to faith's adoring eye. His walk on earth was
          perfect purity and perfect love. His one work was to scatter blessings
          and do good. But enmity could not be softened. Hate causeless was hate
          furious. He meekly testifies, "They hated Me without a cause; they
          laid to my charge things that I knew not of." The servant must not
          expect an easier lot. The more clearly he reflects his Lord, the more
          bitterly will hatred rage, and viler will be falsehood's accusation.<i>
            Innocence does not stop man's mouth, but it gives bold access to the
            ears of God!
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          6, 7.
          <i
            >"Arise, O Lord, in Your anger; lift Yourself up because of the rage
            of my enemies; and awake for me to the judgment that You have
            commanded. So shall the congregation of the people compass You
            about; for their sakes therefore return on high."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Troubles last long that grace may more abound. The greater anguish
          kindles increased prayer. Importunity becomes more urgent. Heaven is
          assailed with cries that God would no longer seem indifferent, but
          awake, arise, and put on anger as a mantle. He is reminded of the
          known decree that judgment shall avenge His people and destroy
          rebellious foes. In all desires of execution of just wrath, faith's
          eye regards God's glory. When the Lord's wrathful arm is seen, His
          people will encircle Him with shouts of praise. Their sanctified joy
          will burn more brightly. Therefore, for their sake God is implored to
          show Himself on His high throne of power.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These words cast light on this world's final scene. Judgment is indeed
          arranged. Irreversible decree demands it. Our Jesus will appear as
          Judge. A high tribunal will be His glorious seat. His ransomed flock
          will all be gathered round Him. He comes to be glorified in His saints
          and admired in all those who believe. Where, then, will persecutors
          stand? Oh! that the Spirit would arrest their course and bring them as
          lowly suppliants to the saving cross; for soon the day of mercy will
          be fled.
        </p>

          <i

          True religion is strictly personal. It looks inward; it diligently
          probes the heart. It deals rigidly with motives and with ways; it
          prays God to observe and judge. So David, conscious of righteous
          dealing towards Saul, prays that favor may regard him. This plea is
          quite consistent with deep sense of sin and consciousness of all
          shortcomings towards God.
          <i>
            Low in deepest guilt before omniscient holiness, we may be free of
            injury towards man.</i
          >
          May this sweet consciousness enable us to lift up the head, and boldly
          seek God's aid!

          <i

            the just; for the righteous God tries the hearts and reins."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Sights and sounds of evil are anguish to a pious heart. They pain him,
          because they are abhorrent to his new nature. He turns from them as
          images of Satan; he loathes them as rebellion against God. Hence he
          burns with desire that they may be repressed. Hence he wearies heaven
          with cries that God would drive iniquity into outer darkness. No
          faithful prayer ascends in vain. Doubtless in answer to such cries
          much evil is restrained. God's servants are maintained, and grace is
          kept as a little candle in the world's deep gloom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But evil will not die until our Lord returns. Then shall the
          wickedness of the wicked reach its end. Faith waits expectantly for
          the blissful reign; it visits in anticipating thought the new heavens
          and the new earth. Throughout heaven there is no form of sin; its
          hideous features are forever gone; the reign of righteousness has
          come. Each heart is holy; each look reflects God's image; every sound
          is pure. All is transcendent happiness, for all is holiness. No evil
          will pollute the glorious scene. God's discerning eye will then have
          parted light from darkness. Outside is sin and all sin's slaves;
          within is the Lamb's bride, all glorious in her robes of white!

          10. <i>"My defense is of God, who saves the upright in heart." </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          How safe are those whom God's shield covers! No weapon wounds them.
          Satan's darts fall harmless at their feet. They live through all
          assaults, and they shall live forever. But their own arm brings no
          defense. They are "kept by the power of God through faith unto
          salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time." Their character is
          as clear as their protection is secure. Through grace their hearts are
          wholly changed. Uprightness is their one delight; uprightness is their
          constant path.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11, 12, 13.
          <i
            >"God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every
            day. If he turns not, He will whet His sword; He has bent His bow,
            and made it ready. He has also prepared for him the instruments of
            death; He ordains His arrows against the persecutors."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Pledges are added to pledges that the righteous have God to vindicate
          their cause. Faith treasures up these glad assurances, and gains
          strength and joy. There is no day nor hour in which God's anger
          against sin does not burn. But there is respite. Forbearance checks
          the final blow. The wicked yet may turn; he may abjure his vile
          rebellion. He may break Satan's yoke; he may seek mercy. In penitence
          and shame he may flee humbly to the Savior's cross. But if he will not
          turn, there is no hope. Destruction is then most sure. The Spirit
          gives a faithful picture of God ready to destroy. He stands in all the
          might of omnipotence. His arm uplifts His glittering sword; the edge
          is sharpened for resistless work. Other weapons are prepared. He holds
          His bow bent for execution. All instruments are ready, and all barbed
          with death. His arrows are prepared for action. The persecutors are
          the target to be pierced. Who can hear this and fail to flee for
          shelter to the wounds of Jesus!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14.
          <i
            >"Behold, he travails with iniquity, and has conceived mischief, and
            brought forth falsehood."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The faithful Word reveals the evil man. His inner man is all iniquity;
          it is the offspring which he bears. As deadly waters flow from noxious
          founts; as poison berries grow on toxic trees; so sin in all shapes
          flows from him. Plots of mischief are conceived; plans of falsehood
          are nurtured. They come to birth, they start to life, to fill the
          world with misery, and to blacken earth with crime. They are of their
          father the devil, and all their words and works savor of hellish
          origin.

            made. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent

          The unsaved labor hard to work their own destruction. Their feet are
          caught in their own net. Into their own pits they fall. They sharpen
          weapons mainly to wound themselves. Their arrows shot upwards fall
          back on their own heads. Goliath's sword severs his head. Haman hangs
          on his own gibbet. Adonibezek laments, "As I have done to others, so
          God has requited me." Dogs lick the blood of Jezebel in the place
          where she had slain Naboth. Eliphaz records a common experience, "I
          have seen that those who plough iniquity and sow wickedness reap the
          same." The man who rends the oak may be destroyed by its fall.

          The end comes on. It is all joy to the redeemed. They sing; they sing
          aloud; they sing forever. The praises of the Lord are their incessant
          and unwearied song. They laud Him according to His righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At present they give praises from their inmost souls; but oh, how dull
          their hearts! how weak their voice! how poor, how meager, their most
          lively efforts! Their harps are tuneless; their best melody lacks
          life. They turn with shame from their best attempts. They do not reach
          the very outskirts of their theme. But when they reach their home,
          their songs are commensurate with Jehovah's glorious name. They praise
          the Lord according to His righteousness. May this delight be ever
          ours!
