          Observance of public ordinances is enjoined. The path of obedience is
          the path of blessedness. May we listen to our God; He will appear rich
          to multiply mercies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful noise unto the God
            of Jacob. Take a psalm and bring here the timbrel, the pleasant harp
            with the psaltery. Blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the time
            appointed, on our solemn feast day."</i

          It is a constant duty publicly to worship God, and to assemble in
          joyful crowds within the sanctuary. It runs on through the year's
          course. But there are especial times which should awaken especial
          thanksgivings. It is most wise to celebrate appointed seasons with all
          the aids which reverence can bring. Thus gratitude and love will
          kindle into brighter flame, and sense of mercies will take deeper
          root. Thus shall we ripen for the day when every crown shall be cast
          at the Redeemer's feet, and endless Hallelujahs issue from all lips.

            This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through
            the land of Egypt; where I heard a language that I understood
            not."</i

          Such service was enjoined to the elders of faith's house. It was
          ordained to promote their wisdom, joy, and profit. Doubtless the true
          light now brightly shines, and we have passed from the shadowy forms
          of types and emblematic worship. But the essence of true religion
          abides the same. If forms are not observed, reality may soon be lost.
          We are called to note the period when these injunctions were given. It
          was at the moment of their deliverance from the slavery of Egypt; from
          the oppression of those who were aliens both in heart and tongue.

            from the pots. You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I
            answered you from the secret place of thunder; I proved you at the
            waters of Meribah."</i

          Grievous burdens oppressed the groaning people, but God delivered
          them, and their servile bondage ended. In the wilderness trouble
          continued; but from the cloud—the home of thunders—answers responded
          to their cry, and faith grew strong by frequent trial.

            will hearken unto Me; there shall no strange god be in you; neither
            shall you worship any strange god. I am the Lord your God, who
            brought you out of the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I
            will fill it."</i

          The Lord tenderly expostulates. He stoops to crave attention. He
          assures those who if they would obey, He, and He alone, would be their
          God, and no vile deluders should mislead them. He reminds them that He
          is the same God who wrought such wonders for them in their early days.
          He assures those who He is the same in the infinitudes of His love and
          power; that they were not straitened in Him; that if they would be
          willing to receive, He would fill them until no more could be
          contained. Let us thus open our hearts, and doubt not that He will
          fully occupy.

            submit to Me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust; and
            they walked in their own counsels."</i

          We shudder at the madness of rebellious man. He closes his ears; he
          rejects God, and thus God leaves him. Terrible curses follow. The
          decree goes forth, Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.

            My ways! I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand
            against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord would have
            submitted themselves unto Him; but their time would have endured
            forever. He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat;
            and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you."</i

          Mournful is this upbraiding note. The scene is darkened by a picture
          of the blessedness thus forfeited. No mercy would have been withheld
          from the obedient. Their enemies would have fallen low before them.
          There would have been no <i>evening</i> to their bright <i>days</i> of
          joy. Their life would have been a perpetual feast. Their table would
          have been luxuriantly spread by God's own hand. Let us be wise, and
          hearken diligently, that we may enjoy such blessedness.
