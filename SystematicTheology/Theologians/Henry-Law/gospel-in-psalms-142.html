        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist is beset with trouble on every side. All refuge failed
          him but his God. To God he has instant recourse.

            "I cried to the Lord with my voice; with my voice to the Lord did I
            make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before Him; I showed
            before Him my trouble."</i

          Troubles will surely meet us in our upward march. Let there be no vain
          attempt to endure in our own strength. We are weak to bear the
          crushing load. Let us rather bring all to the mercy-seat. Let us cast
          them at the feet of Him who cares for us. Who ever looked to heaven
          and failed to find relief? If God gives His presence, all burdens will
          be light.

          When troubles come in like a flood, Omniscience marks our every step.
          It is good when we can call God to witness that our true desire is to
          walk closely by His side. But the cruel enemy will strive to fill this
          path with snares.

          <i
            >"I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man who
            would know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cried
            to You, O Lord; I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land
            of the living."</i

          Vain is the help of man. Worldly friends soon vanish when the trouble
          is adverse. Such desertion is grievous aggravation of distress.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To this the blessed Jesus was most exposed. They all forsook Him and
          fled. Such, also, is the common lot of His true disciples. Paul
          mourned, Know you not that all who are in Asia have turned away from
          me. But God is still near, and full of compassion. We can approach His
          ready smile. We shall ever find in Him a sufficiency which no
          creatures could supply. Safe are those who can say, "You are my
          refuge." Rich are those who can add, "You are my portion." Let us flee
          to this fortress. Let us rejoice in this portion. Loneliness dwells
          not in this climate.

          <i
            >"Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from my
            persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of
            prison, that I may praise Your name; the righteous shall compass me
            about; for You shall deal bountifully with me."</i

        <p align="justify">
          There are no depths of fear, which prevent a cry to the throne of God.
          Mercy hears and flies to give relief. Strong may be the persecutors.
          They may bring us very low. Strong is the arch-enemy of our salvation,
          but omnipotence is the attribute of our Deliverer. Let us trust, then,
          and not be afraid. Often are our souls enthralled by the shackles of
          unbelief and sin and weakness. God can open every prison-cell, and
          remove every detaining chain. Grateful lips will then ascribe
          deliverance entirely to Him. The righteous shall see God's gracious
          dealings, and flock to our fellowship. Good Lord, increase our faith,
          animate our prayers, strengthen our every grace, that our glad
          experience may set our hand to the acknowledgment that You have dealt
          bountifully with us.
