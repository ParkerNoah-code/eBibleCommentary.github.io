        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Jesus leads His flock like a shepherd. May we rejoice in the delights
          of His fold!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. <i>"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not be in need."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Happy the soul that, looking to Jesus as the great, the good, the one
          Shepherd, can add in truth, "And He is mine. I have heard His calling
          voice; I have seen His inviting smile; I have fled to Him; I have
          entered into His fold; I have committed myself to His guardian care;
          He has received me; He has given me most gracious welcome; I am my
          Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine." With what joyous rapture may the
          inhabitant of the fold continue, "I shall not be in need!" How can
          need be mine? He who is pledged to my support has all resources in His
          hand; He has all power in heaven and earth. He who has promised to
          give me eternal life will not allow me to perish by the way. The end
          secured is security along the road.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We sometimes err in our desires. In blindness we crave injurious
          pastures. It is our wisdom to leave all to Him. He is all wisdom and
          all love. He will tend wisely and most kindly. All good things will
          assuredly abound. Perhaps we err if we claim this psalm as our
          exclusive portion. Jesus Himself once knew the need of the poor sheep;
          but He found a Shepherd in His heavenly Father, and He lacked nothing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the
            still waters."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A picture of rural beauty expands before us. We see a happy flock
          resting in calm quietness in fields rich in luxuriant plenty; we see
          them guided to meadows through which refreshing streams glide
          tranquilly. The scene is perfect. Here is repose amid abundance.
          Nothing disturbs the calm enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The antitype is the believer's soul secure from all alarms, peaceful
          in knowledge of the Lord's protection, feasting on the rich provision
          of His Word, regaled with sustaining promises, nurtured by the
          Spirit's rich supplies, reposing under the shadow of the cross,
          drinking the cooling streams of scriptural teaching, delighting in the
          sacramental feast. How ample is this sweet provision! Who will not
          thankfully exclaim, "I have all, and abound?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This picture also exhibits Jesus. Amid His many troubles His soul
          could calmly rest on the assurance of His Father's love, and feed
          rejoicingly on covenant engagement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness for
            His name's sake."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are times when grace appears to fade, when trials trouble and
          depress, when lively vigor faints and deadness chills the soul. Sad
          indeed would be the outcome unless the watchful Shepherd rendered
          help; but He assists the downcast; He shows reviving smiles; He brings
          the cordial of some precious promise. The withering leaf renews its
          freshness; the tottering limbs again are strong; the heavenward path
          in ways of righteousness is again stoutly trod.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Jesus often drank depression's weakening cup. His soul was troubled;
          but help from above restored unwavering strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
            will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff,
            they comfort me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our sorest trial is when, with feeble step, we traverse the cheerless
          valley of death. The climate is chilly. Nature fails. We shrink from
          the icy hand; but still there is no fear. The tender Shepherd is by
          our side; His gentle guidance removes apprehension. The waters fail to
          overwhelm. Sweet texts bring light, and the Spirit applies comfort.
          Your rod, Your staff, the emblems of the Shepherd's care, drive back
          the threatening foes, and give sustaining strength. To lean on Jesus
          in the darkest hour is light and joy and peace. The Good Shepherd
          knows the chilly hand of death. He has passed this dark valley; but
          His God was with Him. Ministering angels brought support. He found no
          evil, and no evil shall destroy His sheep.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You
            anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our enemies stand round in vast array, but they cannot destroy
          enjoyments. In their sight God spread a banquet of delights. His
          inward unction causes the heart to show all kinds of radiant joy, as
          the countenance refreshed with ointments. We hold a cup; God's hand
          supplies it; He pours in pleasures to the extent of capacity to
          receive. The overjoyed believer feels, "Stop, stop; it is enough;" but
          still the goblet overflows. Who can measure the delights of God's
          presence, smile, and word?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
            and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Such is faith's sweet assurance. While days below continue, goodness
          and mercy, close as closest shadow, shall bring up the rear. What good
          thing can be absent if the Lord is present, and Jesus confirms the
          pledge, "Lo, I am with you all the days, even to the end of the
          world?" Failure there can never be. No sheep will perish or be left
          behind. All will be safely gathered in the many-mansioned house. There
          will the Great Shepherd ever dwell amid His ransomed flock. Great
          Shepherd, You are our all; we lovingly adore You!
