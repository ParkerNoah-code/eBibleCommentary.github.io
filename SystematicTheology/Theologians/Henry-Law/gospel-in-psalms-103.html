          As in the firmament one star differs from another star in glory, so
          this hymn shines with surpassing luster. Through a long course of
          years it has been especial comfort to the Church. May it be especial
          comfort to our hearts!

          Praise is a plant of heavenly growth. It is the saint's choice garden
          of delights. Drowsy souls should be stirred up, and every faculty
          quickened to expend its language. Heaven is opened wide to pour down
          benefits. Every benefit should be received with adoration. Abundant
          crops of praise should spring from this abundant seed.

            good things; so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's."</i

          A throng of mercies crowd upon our view. Each presents large themes of
          praise. Who can bless God enough that He is ever ready to pardon—that
          He has provided a fountain in His dear Son's blood to wash out every
          iniquity. It is a soul-transporting truth that those who hide in the
          Savior's wounds are screened forever from His wrath. But the believer,
          though heir of forgiveness, is ever prone to fall into unhealthy
          malady. It is a true description, The whole head is sick—and the whole
          heart faint—from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head there
          is nothing in us but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores. Can
          these diseases be all healed? Jesus is full remedy. He gives health
          and a cure. He is Jehovah-Rophi. To Him, also, we may bring every
          malady of our sickly frames. During His earthly ministry diseases fled
          before Him. As many as touched Him were made perfectly whole. What an
          encouragement to bring all sickness to Him! He is Jesus still. Who can
          give thanks enough for redemption's wonders! It rescues us from
          destruction's grasp. It cries, Deliver him from going down to the pit;
          I have found a ransom. Lovingkindness, also, and tender mercies exalt
          the believer to grand eminence. A crown is set upon his head,
          sparkling with glory. Rich supplies too of sustenance are abundantly
          provided. All things necessary to cheer and to invigorate enrich his
          board. Thus, though at times he may appear to droop, he revives, as an
          eagle, rising from its languishing to the freshness and vigor of its
          youth.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He especially befriends His children, when oppressed by cruel foes. He
          stretches forth His hand to vindicate their cause. In His dealings
          with Moses and the children of Israel, He draws a chart in which His
          watchful guidance may be ever traced.

          <i
            >"The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plentiful in
            mercy. He will not always chide; neither will He keep His anger
            forever. He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us
            according to our iniquities."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord's tender dealings are here portrayed. It is Scripture's
          frequent testimony that He is rich in mercy, and that His mercy
          endures forever. Mercy looks upon our misery and flies to give
          alleviation. Grace, also, is its close comrade. It compassionates
          demerits. It brings the robe of Christ's righteousness to cover our
          unworthiness. We are quick to sin. But our God is long-suffering. He
          pauses and restrains due vengeance. The plenitude of His goodness
          outweighs the plenitude of our guilt. When He chides it is His strange
          work. The scourge is soon checked, and smiles of love dispel the
          frowns of wrath. Who can regard our mountains of mountains of
          iniquity, and not confess, We are undone. If God should dispense
          strict justice to our sins, we perish. But in Christ Jesus free grace
          triumphs.

            "For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy
            toward those who fear Him. As far as the east is from the west, so
            far has He removed our transgressions from us."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Infinitude is borrowed to exemplify God's mercy. Immeasurable distance
          parts the heaven from earth, so God's mercy exceeds all bounds.
          Thought cannot conceive it. Words cannot express it. Ransomed souls
          are its main recipients. They are aptly described as filled with the
          reverential grace of fear. Infinite space again expresses the removal
          of our sins. No traversing steps can join the east to west. As we
          advance from the one the other constantly recedes. Let us bless the
          Holy Spirit for employing this image to teach how utterly the guilt of
          sin is cancelled.

            "As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear
            Him. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Sweet is the picture of paternal love. Compassion melts a father's
          breast. He speaks and acts in constant tenderness. But what is earthly
          feeling compared to the benevolence of a heavenly Father's heart! He
          knows, also, our every infirmity. By fellow-feeling Jesus sympathizes
          with weak humanity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15-18.
          <i
            >"As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he
            flourishes; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and its
            place shall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from
            everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear Him, and His
            righteousness unto children's children; to such as keep His
            covenant, and to those that remember His commandments to do
            them."</i

        <p align="justify">
          This picture shows the frailty and instability of man. Enduring
          strength is not his property. Behold the grass of the meadow! The Word
          cries, "All flesh is grass." For a little moment it is green and
          vigorous. But in a speck of time it is dried up and withered. Behold,
          also, the flower of the field! It presents a lovely form. But
          evanescent is its beauty! A biting wind arises. Its bright hues all
          fade. It disappears and leaves no trace. Its place is vacant. We may
          search, but it is gone. View now in contrast the mercy of our God! It
          is from everlasting to everlasting. It endures forever. No age can
          change its loveliness, or dim its beautiful smiles. So, also, His
          righteousness beams from generation to generation. Covenant love
          blesses His faithful people, whose delight is to be steadfast in His
          ways, and in whose thoughts His commandments have perpetual sway.

        <p align="justify">
          Faith is invigorated by contemplating the sovereignty of God. In
          heaven He sits as King. His rule is unbounded over all the inhabitants
          of earth. What thought can be more cheering! What truth can give more
          solid support! How safe are they who shelter beneath His wings. They
          are kept as the very apple of His eye. Who can harm them? His sheep
          shall never perish, for who can pluck them out of His hands?

            all His hosts; you ministers of His, who do His pleasure. Bless the
            Lord, all His works, in all places of His dominion; bless the Lord,

          Let universal praise pervade all heaven and earth. Let all the angelic
          hosts, whose life is uninterrupted service, shout aloud. Marvelous
          powers are their inheritance. Let all be consecrated to one work.
          Theirs is the joy of hearkening to His voice. Let theirs be the joy of
          rendering blessing. Let all creation swell the strain. Throughout His
          realm let silence be unknown. O my soul, let noblest rapture emanate
          from you. Let loudest notes attest your love.
