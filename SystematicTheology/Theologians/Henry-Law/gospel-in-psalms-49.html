        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The truths of the Bible call for universal heeding. The mysteries will
          repay all study. Natural men, in their best state, are immeasurably
          inferior to the people of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"Hear this, all you people; give ear, all you inhabitants of the
            world; both low and high, rich and poor, together."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The revelation of God alike concerns the whole family of man. Wherever
          man lives, he lives defiled by sin, and justly exposed to wrath. As
          the malady is one, so too is the remedy. All need it; to all it is
          proclaimed in the Gospel. What madness can be greater than to close
          our ears to the precious tidings! The low are raised by it; the high
          are stripped of their lofty looks. The rich are ennobled by it with
          the true riches; the poor obtain the true treasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
            shall be of understanding. I will incline my ear to a parable; I
            will open my dark saying upon the harp."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The treasures of true wisdom are folded up in God's Word. There He,
          who is the wise, the all wise, the only wise, declares His mind and
          will. The Bible student will read, and will declare. His heart will
          meditate, but not concerning foolish trifles. Solid truths will be the
          food of his thoughts. He will diligently listen to the mysteries of
          redemption, shadowed out in great variety of images; and his melody
          will be concerning hidden wonders.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"There is no need to fear when times of trouble come, when enemies
            are surrounding me."</i

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Countless are the exhortations to the believer never to give place to
          fear. His constant response should be, I will trust and not be afraid.
          Days of evil will often overshadow him; reminiscences of past iniquity
          may leave impressions on the mind, deep as the prints of the heels
          upon a soft or sandy path. In this there may be ground of humiliation,
          but there is no cause for misapprehension. The covenant of peace
          stands sure, and never can be broken. The reconciliation is forever
          made; the promise will be realized; goodness and mercy shall follow
          him all the days of his life, and he shall dwell in the house of the
          Lord forever.

          <i
            >"Those who trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
            multitude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his
            brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (for the redemption of
            their soul is precious, and it ceases forever;) that he should still
            live forever, and not see corruption."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The riches of this world are eagerly sought by natural men. They
          delight in the enjoyments which are thus purchased, and the homage and
          adulation which are thus won. It is their pleasure to magnify
          themselves in their apparent distinction above their fellows. But what
          is their real value when viewed in spiritual light? They are light as
          chaff—they are worthless as the vilest dross. How can riches deliver a
          sinner from the grasp of death? How can they prolong his days on
          earth, or raise from the corruption of the grave?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Shall earthly riches be presented to God as an equivalent for the
          forfeited soul—shall they be offered as a redeeming price? Is there
          satisfaction in them to the outraged attributes of God? Can they avail
          to mitigate merited wrath? The very thought is folly. Man in the
          utmost grandeur of outward possession is utterly without avail to
          redeem his brother.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A glorious parenthesis is here inserted. It casts a ray of joy over a
          saddening truth. It speaks of redemption, and tells us that it
          requires vast price. Here the blessed Gospel brightly shines. We bless
          our dying Jesus, our curse-removing Lord, our death-enduring
          Substitute, that He has accomplished redemption. It was bought by a
          precious price—even by the price of His own blood—which had infinite
          efficacy because of His essential deity. It out-valued all the silver
          and the gold which earth ever produced. It outweighed all treasures.
          By it every attribute of God is satisfied, and magnified, and
          glorified. Let us, also, be satisfied with it. This ransom has no need
          of gradual progress. By the one death of Jesus it is forever secured.
          It needs no repetition. By His one offering once made, He has
          perfected forever those who are sanctified.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10.
          <i
            >"For He sees that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish
            person perish, and leave their wealth to others."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is an obvious fact, compelling universal acquiescence, that
          <i>mental faculties</i> cannot secure length of days. Men of the
          shrewdest intellect move onward to the grave. By their side men lie
          who are least endowed. Alike they might have been enriched with large
          abundance of this world's wealth. But their feeble hands cannot retain
          the grasp. They cannot take their treasure with them. Other inheritors
          must succeed and count the riches as their own.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11.
          <i
            >"Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue forever,
            and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands
            after their own names."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They seem to dream of earthly immortality. They imagine perpetuity of
          their names. They inscribe their titles on their stately homes, or on
          their wide possessions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12, 13.
          <i
            >"Nevertheless, man being in honor abides not; he is like the beasts
            that perish. This their way is their folly; yet their posterity
            approve their sayings."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As riches are no protection from the grave, neither do honors bring
          deliverance. Titles may be grand, distinctions may be brilliant, yet
          the possessors soon lie low. Mortality is common to them, even as it
          is to all the herds of animal creation. Their forgetfulness of
          short-lived continuance is justly termed their folly. But it is
          incredible, that their descendants tread the same senseless path. They
          are not instructed by the ignorance of their predecessors—they rather
          commend their seeming wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14.
          <i
            >"Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;
            and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and
            their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The titled and the wealthy worldlings do not have stronger tenure of
          life than the flocks of the meadows. Death claims them as its prey,
          and feeds upon their lifeless bodies—from their stately halls they
          must be carried to mingle with corruption. The morning of the
          resurrection comes—then the poor believer, however scorned in his
          passage through life, shall shine in manifested superiority, and shall
          put on the beautiful robes of everlasting glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15.
          <i
            >"But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave; for He
            shall receive me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer knows his foundation of perpetual joy. It is true that
          his body must taste corruption, and lie for a little season in the
          grave; but he knows that God who has redeemed his soul, by the
          precious blood of His dearly-beloved Son, will also soon raise his
          body from the transient tenure of the grave. The redeemed soul shall
          again inhabit a redeemed body. The blessed consummation shall be
          complete. The glorified body and the glorified soul shall constitute
          the glorified man. Thus perfect he shall be upraised to the palace of
          the King of kings, and shall reign in those bright realms into which
          death shall never enter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16, 17, 18, 19, 20.<i>
            "So don't be dismayed when the wicked grow rich, and their homes
            become ever more splendid. For when they die, they carry nothing
            with them. Their wealth will not follow them into the grave. In this
            life they consider themselves fortunate, and the world loudly
            applauds their success. But they will die like all others before
            them and never again see the light of day. People who boast of their
            wealth don't understand that they will die like the animals."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Established truths are here repeated. The believer is exhorted to keep
          his faith from wavering, when he sees prosperity gilding the path of
          the worldling. The brevity of all mortal condition should check all
          temptation to be staggered by its prosperity. Worldlings may hold
          dazzling superabundance; but how long can they call these things their
          own? They must leave all behind; they can carry nothing with them.
          Their prosperity might excite adulation and the homage of
          fellow-mortals. But departure must take place—even to eternal
          wretchedness—even to blackness of darkness forever. The cause of this
          misery is the lack of saving knowledge. There is ignorance of self, of
          sin, of God, of Christ, of redemption, of salvation. O Lord, open our
          eyes, give us understanding to know You, the only true God, and Jesus
          Christ whom You have sent.
