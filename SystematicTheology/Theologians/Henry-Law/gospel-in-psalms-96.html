        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Again we are loudly called to magnify the Lord in joyful song.
          Thoughts are directed to the extension of Christ's kingdom. He is
          proclaimed as coming to consummate salvation. May our souls respond,
          "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-3.
          <i
            >"O sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth.
            Sing to the Lord, bless His name; show forth His salvation from day
            to day. Declare His glory among the heathen, His wonders among all
            people."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Praise never can be too exuberant. Everything that has breath should
          live to praise the Lord. In this work there never should be weariness.
          Causes of praise are ever fresh, and fresh should be the responding
          notes. Let us sing a new song. New thoughts, new motives should
          enliven the soul. Our hearts should ever seek renewal, and be looking
          onward to the new heavens and the new earth, where He shall reign who
          has made all things new. Hence new should be our song. As day succeeds
          to day, so let praise succeed to praise. Let too our diligent efforts
          convey to the poor and ignorant of every climate the tidings of
          redeeming love. Let the heathen learn through us the glories of
          Christ's salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4-6.
          <i
            >"For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be
            feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols;
            but the Lord made the heavens. Honor and majesty are before Him;
            strength and beauty are in His sanctuary."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Behold the greatness, the supremacy, the glory of our God. Heathen
          idols are utter vanity. Let us call the poor heathen to cease to bow
          down to stocks and stones. Let us teach them to worship Him who has
          made heaven and earth. This worship is mighty to enliven and sanctify.
          It is beautified with all the radiancy of heaven's glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-9.
          <i
            >"Give to the Lord, O you kindreds of the people, give to the Lord
            glory and strength. Give to the Lord the glory due to His name;
            bring an offering, and come into His courts. O worship the Lord in
            the beauty of holiness; fear before Him, all the earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who can describe the pure delight of spiritual worship! Let us draw
          near to Him who is a Spirit in spirit and in truth. Let it be our
          choice joy, to magnify His holy name, to ascribe to Him the glory
          which is so greatly His, and to acknowledge the omnipotence with which
          He is invested. Let it be our delight to consecrate to Him all the
          resources with which we are endowed; to present to Him ourselves, our
          bodies, souls, and spirits, which are His by every right of creation,
          redemption, conquest, and our own surrender. Let us reverently seek
          His hallowed courts, and offer holy service. There is no beauty to be
          compared with holiness, which is the reflection of our God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-13.
          <i
            >"Say among the heathen, that the Lord reigns; the world also shall
            be established that it shall not be moved; He shall judge the people
            righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let
            the sea roar, and all its fullness. Let the field be joyful, and all
            that is in it; then shall all the trees of the forest rejoice before
            the Lord; for He comes, for He comes to judge the earth; He shall
            judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His
            truth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Nothing quickens praise more than constant expectation of the coming
          of the Lord. Yet a little while and He who shall come will come and
          will not tarry. Behold He comes leaping upon the mountains and
          skipping upon the hills. Oh thrice blessed, thrice glorious day! The
          heavens and the earth, with their ten thousand tongues, shall rejoice
          and sing. Righteous shall be His reign. Truth shall be exalted, and
          the tabernacle of God shall be with men. Should not this prospect warm
          our hearts to spread abroad His glorious name! Surely the very stones
          would rebuke our silence.
