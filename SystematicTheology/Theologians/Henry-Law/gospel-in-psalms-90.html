          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 90</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This Psalm is entitled "A Prayer of Moses, the man of God." As such it
          justly claims devout attention as the earliest of inspired songs. In
          adopting it may we move forward on the heavenward road!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. <i>"Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Happy has been the experience of the saints of God at every period.
          They could always find a home on high, in which they might repose and
          sweetly dwell. To all who approach in the name of Jesus the portals of
          heaven open, and smiles welcome. By faith may we thus enter, and in
          God continually abide. No monarch occupies so grand a palace.

          2.
          <i
            >"Before the mountains were brought forth, or before You had formed
            the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting You
            are God."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A glorious description of the self-existent and everlasting God here
          meets us. Before time was, while time rolls on, when time shall be no
          more, He livesâ€”the great "I am that I am."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-6.
          <i
            >"You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, you children of men.
            For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is
            past, and as a watch in the night. You carry them away as with a
            flood; they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass which
            grows up. In the morning it flourishes, and grows up; in the evening
            it is cut down, and withers."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In contrast mark the short-lived instability of man. Formed of the
          dust of the earth, God speaks the word, and to that dust he instantly
          returns. In God's sight time has no place. A thousand years are but as
          a fleeting day. Many images combine to show the brevity of man's
          existence. A rushing torrent bears him out of sight. Sleep soon
          ceases, and in the morning leaves no trace. The night-watch tarries
          not. When day dawns the grass is green, before evening it is withered
          up. Human life is but a momentary bloom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-9.
          <i
            >"For we are consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath are we
            troubled. You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in
            the light of Your countenance. For all our days have passed away in
            Your wrath; we spend our years as a tale that is told."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sin is the root of this nothingness. Our iniquities are many. They may
          be hidden from our view; but they are all unmistakable to the
          omniscience of God. When His anger is aroused, we vanish as the
          remembrance of a brief recital.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10.
          <i
            >"The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
            reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength
            labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who are permitted to count threescore years and ten, should
          regard their allotted course as fully run. The fleeting generations in
          the wilderness taught this lesson to Moses. Few who entered Canaan had
          seen that period. If unusual strength should lengthen out man's days,
          the failing powers bring labor and sorrow. The continuance is
          fleeting. Departure is at the door.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11-12.
          <i
            >"Who knows the power of Your anger? even according to Your fear so
            is Your wrath. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our
            hearts to wisdom."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God is not limited in any attribute. His anger then may work
          dreadfully. Let us tremble to provoke His wrath; and rather in
          knowledge of life's brevity give our little space to search for true
          wisdom. He is well taught who studies God in Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13-17.
          <i
            >"Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent You concerning Your
            servants. O satisfy us early with Your mercy; that we may rejoice
            and be glad all our days. Make us glad according to the days wherein
            You have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. Let
            Your work appear unto Your servants, and Your glory unto their
            children. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and
            establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of
            our hands."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Solemn prayers are the fitting conclusion. The Lord is implored to
          return, to relax displeasure, to cause mercy to overflow. Then joy and
          gladness will super-abound. He will not be slow to reveal His wondrous
          power to beautify His people with salvation, and to make all their
          work to prosper. May these prayers ever ascend from our hearts!
          Descending blessings will crown us with delights.
