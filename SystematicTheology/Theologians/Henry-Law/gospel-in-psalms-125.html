          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 125</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This ode sings a blessed description of God's children. Earnest prayer
          is the fitting conclusion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Those who trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot
            be removed, but abides forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the blessing of blessings to put all trust in God. Those who
          thus cling to Him shall never be cast off. Perils may surround them,
          but hostile might shall not prevail. As easily might puny man cast
          down the loftiest mountains as adverse power shake the firm stability
          of this faith. May this trust nerve us in the Christian warfare!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round
            about His people from henceforth, even forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Jerusalem was guarded by natural barriers. Surrounding mountains
          spread protecting arms. This image shows the safety of God's people.
          On all sides He stands their sure protection. He must be removed or
          vanquished before an adversary can touch them. Our life is hidden with
          Christ in God. Can safety be more safe?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i
            >"For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
            righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
            iniquity."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Hostile might may often rage against the righteous. Foes may threaten
          to trample them beneath their feet. But God will check the overbearing
          enmity. If trials should long prevail there might be peril, lest the
          spirits of the righteous should faint. Fear of desertion might open
          the door to many doubts. But all such danger is averted by the hand of
          God. His ready help restores confiding hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are
            upright in their hearts."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Believers are described as good. The name is explained by the Spirit
          as implying the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and of faith. It is
          proof that no deception is harbored in their hearts. Prayer is made
          that God would visit them with goodness. This prayer indited by the
          Spirit amounts to a heavenly promise that they shall receive such
          honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall
            lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace shall be
            upon Israel."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Transition of scene shows the deceitful followers of evil led forth by
          God to merited execution, while the true Israel rejoice in abundant
          peace. May this happy state be our glad portion! Grant it, Heavenly
          Father, for Your love's sake, in Christ Jesus.
