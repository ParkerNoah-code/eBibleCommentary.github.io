        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Attention to prayer in a season of great distress is supplicated in
          the experience of former mercies. Promises are remembered, and
          grateful service is vowed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer. From the end of the earth
            I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the Rock
            that is higher than I."</i

          Prayer, which is our precious privilege, and should be our continuous
          delight, should ever be from the very depths of the heart, and in the
          earnest wrestlings of the soul. Can there be coldness, can there be
          weakness, can there be formality when we draw near to the immediate
          presence of our God, and pour into His listening ear our every need
          and our every desire?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here David is all zeal and all intense effort. He doubles expression
          to awaken a gracious hearing. Doubtless His need now was very great.
          But that need is no small blessing which raises us direct from earth
          and places us before our God. He was an outcast—banished from his
          home, from his family, and his cherished friends. Strangers and aliens
          were around him. But on the outstretched wings of faith he soars to a
          Heavenly Father's house. He desires to be uplifted from his low
          estate, and his feet set on elevated ground. We have a Rock; and when
          standing upon it, impregnable is our position and glorious is our
          prospect. That Rock is Christ. May our prayer be constant that we may
          be kept grounded and settled on Him, and never moved away from the
          hope of our Gospel
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"For You have been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
            enemy. I will abide in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the
            shelter of Your wings."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Experience here supplies a prevailing argument. The Psalmist could
          look back on many perils, but the Lord had delivered him out of all.
          That arm was not shortened; that mercy was warm as ever. It had never
          failed; it will never fail. Therefore in his exile he had persuasion
          that he would be restored to the city of his God, and join again in
          the services which he loved. He knew that the wings which had
          sheltered him would shelter him to the end, and therefore his trust
          abided firm.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given me the heritage
            of those who fear Your name. You will prolong the king's life; and
            his years as many generations."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those who watch for answers to their vows will have abundant cause for
          joy. God's Word is pledged in many forms that prayer shall not go
          forth in vain. All these promises are yes and amen in Christ Jesus;
          and heaven and earth shall pass away, and all the universe be wrapped
          in ruin, before fulfillment can be denied. The answers come, and they
          abound in comfort and encouragement. David realized that through faith
          he was heir to an inheritance which paled all earthly possessions—the
          heritage of those who feared God's name. Blessings indeed are linked
          to this ennobling grace. It belongs to all who have found forgiveness
          in Christ Jesus. They love the Lord with all intensity of rapture;
          they love His Word and will; and nothing could induce them willingly
          to offend. Therefore mercy surrounds them. High as the heaven is above
          the earth, so great is His mercy towards those who fear Him. O Lord!
          implant Your fear in our longing hearts! It will enrich us now and
          ever. This David fully realized. He saw that His days were equivalent
          with the ages of eternity, and that all those days would be happiness
          and glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-8.
          <i
            >"He shall abide before God forever; O prepare mercy and truth which
            may preserve him. So will I sing praise to Your name forever, that I
            may daily perform my vows."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He looked onward to the fullness of joy in the presence of God, and to
          the pleasures which are at His right hand forever. With this bright
          prospect, who will not fear His name—who will not devote himself to
          God's service? But all our vows and all our efforts are utter weakness
          unless we are helped from on high. In deep knowledge of his own
          nothingness, he prays that mercy and truth may ever be at hand for his
          preservation; and then he resolves that suitable praises shall be
          rendered. Thus prayer and trust lead to everlasting joys.
