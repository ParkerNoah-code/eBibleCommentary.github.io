          <font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>Psalm 32</b></font>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          We are taught the blessedness of sin's pardon through the faith of
          Christ. O Lord, give us this blessing, and we shall be blessed!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
            covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes not iniquity,
            and in whose spirit there is no deceit."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If he alone was blessed whom no sin had ever stained, this world would
          have a wretched doom! If he alone was blessed, whose feet had never
          strayed from godly ways, where could we hide our heads? But
          blessedness belongs to the transgressor PARDONED—to the sinner, whose
          sins are no more seen by God—to the guilty, to whose account the guilt
          is no more reckoned. We are transgressors, we are sinners,
          <i>we are deep-steeped in guilt.</i> Is this blessedness given to us?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yes, truly, if through grace we have received Christ. There is
          redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of all our sins.
          His cross redeems from transgression, iniquity, and sin. His beautiful
          righteousness so hides all guilt, that God's omniscient eye no more
          discerns it. His blood wipes out all record of iniquity. For the
          believer's sins may be searched for, but they shall not be found. Such
          blessedness is the fruit of faith. Oh, precious grace! Blessed are
          those to whom it is freely given! From faith's deep roots all virtuous
          blossoms spring. The honest mind, the truthful heart, the honest
          purpose, are pre-eminently its fruits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"When I kept silence, my bones grew old, through my groaning all
            the day long; for day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my
            moisture was turned into the drought of summer."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Great is the anguish of the soul, when first the Spirit reveals sin.
          Day brings no joy, and night supplies no ease. An intolerable burden
          oppresses the mind. This is the Lord's hand. Thus He shakes from
          security's delusive pillow. Thus He directs the footsteps to the
          cross. But until Christ is seen, what misery is undergone! Feverish
          heat dries up the pores. The frame is parched, as plains beneath the
          sultry sun. The body weakens; the bones are tottering as in extreme
          old age; the howls of grief betray the tortured mind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"I acknowledge my sin to You, and I have not hidden my iniquity. I
            said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord; and You forgave
            the iniquity of my sin."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At length relief is found. God is revealed as pardoning all sin in
          Christ. The glories of the saving cross are shown. The contrite sinner
          flies in haste. He lies in deep humility. He pours out every secret of
          his melted heart. He recounts the train of life-long iniquity; He
          confesses, "Thus and thus have I done." The mass is mountain-high. The
          stain is deeper than the scarlet-dye. The language of the cross is
          heard—all is forgiven! all is blotted out!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"For this shall every one that is godly pray to You in a time when
            You may be found; surely in the floods of great waters they shall
            not come near him." </i
          >Because God is a God ready to forgive, His people throng the
          mercy-seat. If no mercy could be found, no prayers would plead. But no
          delays may check. Now God extends the scepter of His grace. But the
          morrow may proclaim, 'Too late.' Prayer brings security. Floods of
          trouble may rush in from all sides, but the godly are borne above all
          in a peaceful ark. A fiery deluge soon will drown the world; but the
          fierce billows will not reach the ransomed of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"You are my hiding-place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You
            shall compass me about with songs of deliverance."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No trouble can touch those who are securely hidden in God. The
          preserved shall dwell amid incessant songs. And every song shall
          testify, "You have delivered us from the wrath to come!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9.
          <i
            >"I will instruct you, and teach you in the way which you shall go;
            I will guide you with My eye. Do not be as the horse, or as the
            mule, which have no understanding; whose mouth must be held in with
            bit and bridle, lest they come near you."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          At each moment we lack wisdom. At each moment God waits to guide. We
          have large promises. Let us largely plead them. If our eyes are turned
          to Him, in His eye we shall read His will. Let us with all docility
          obey. The beasts give warning. Sharp discipline restrains the
          senseless and the stubborn.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10, 11.
          <i
            >"Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he who trusts in the
            Lord, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in the Lord, and
            rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy, all you who are upright
            in heart."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many sorrows now—many sorrows forever, must be the sinner's doom. The
          mouth of the Lord has spoken it. Justice demands it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In contrast view the faithful. Mercy precedes them. Mercy follows
          them. Mercy gleams on their right hand. Mercy smiles on their left.
          They dwell in mercy, and God's mercy is salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We cannot ponder too much the character of God's people. They are
          righteous. They are sincere. As such they have a right to joy. But all
          their joy has Jesus as its source. SELF only awakens grief and
          contempt. But they rejoice in the Lord, and in His finished work. May
          this delight be ever ours.
