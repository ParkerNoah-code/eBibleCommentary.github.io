          The pensive note of the preceding hymn is here prolonged. The
          circumstances are the same; the same, also, are the exercises and the
          expressions of the mind.

          <i
            >"Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; O
            deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man."</i

          Happy is the man who is conscious of his own integrity. He can lift up
          his eyes in holy confidence to his God, and ask Him to vindicate his
          cause against iniquitous oppression. If God is for us, who can be
          against us? There were many occasions in the checkered life of David
          in which this cry would be appropriate. The aged monarch, the
          heart-broken parent, would thus most fitly pray, when his own child
          rose up to hurl him from his throne, and the ungodly nation joined in
          the impious attempt. Here is the experience of many followers of
          Christ. Because they are not of the world, but Christ has chosen them
          out of the world, therefore the world hates them. In all these
          troubles they may appeal to God, and never will they cry in vain.

          It is the province of faith to realize that in all apparent weakness
          there is really strength. But where is the treasure-house of strength?
          It is not in SELF. For man unaided is a broken reed—light as the chaff
          before the wind—powerless as an infant in a giant's grasp.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But his strength is firm as the everlasting hills. It is Jehovah in
          His might. While he trembles, he can still cry, You are the God of my
          strength. But still he is perplexed. Outward troubles seem to indicate
          desertion and rejection. The enemy oppresses; he cannot but mourn.
          Many thoughts arise, that these trials are to recall from devious
          paths, and are the chastenings of just displeasure. He draws near with
          bold familiarity, and supplicates revealing grace. It should be a
          frequent prayer, "Search me, O Lord, and know my heart; prove me, and
          know my ways; and see if there be any wicked way in me."

          <i
            >"O send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me, let them

          Left to ourselves, we are in darkness, and we surely stray. Conscious
          of need and guidance, the disconsolate Psalmist prays for heavenly
          aid, and that light from above would clearly shine upon his path; and
          that all events in providence would be in accordance with the
          provisions of the everlasting covenant. Those who truly follow the
          Lamb shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. They
          know that the conditions of the covenant secure their everlasting
          happiness, and they confidently plead that God would do to them in
          accordance with its terms. He prays especially that he may be restored
          to the joys of holy worship. He thinks not so much of the comforts and
          splendor of his palace, of his costly provisions, and luxurious
          delights—his heart is fixed on the hill of Zion and the house of God.
          There he had sought spiritual communion—in comparison with this, he
          counted other things as less than dross.

            upon the harp will I praise You, O God, my God."</i

          The essence of delight in public ordinances is the knowledge that sin
          is pardoned through atoning blood, and that there is free access to
          God through the expiating sacrifice of the dying Lamb. Then the heart
          swells with all the ecstasy of joy, happiness rolls in fullest tide,
          delight ascends to its highest pinnacle. God thus realized as
          reconciled, is exceeding bliss. The cup overflows. The bliss exceeds
          all bounds. Every faculty and every power is awakened to sing praise.
          Rapturous is the theme, when the soul intelligently sings, O God, You
          are my God!

          <i
            >"Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disturbed within
            me? Hope in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my
            countenance and my God."</i

          To him who can call God his own God, no cause of anxiety remains. He
          can trample all fears and doubts beneath his feet. He can see clearly
          by the eye of hope the blissful prospect of deliverance.
