        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          A hymn here meets us earnest in prayer, bright in prospects, shining
          in prophecies, glorious in anticipations. Hope gazes with delight on
          the fullness of the Gentiles—on the consequent ingathering of the
          Jews, and all the glories of the second Advent. May we here find a
          subject for our supplications—a theme for rejoicing hope!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause His face to shine
            upon us. That Your way may be known upon earth, Your saving health
            among all nations."</i

        <p align="justify">
          We rightly use the promises of God when we turn them into earnest
          prayer. We cannot doubt that we pursue a track which leads to all
          riches of fulfillment, when our lips plead that God would do unto us
          according to His word. Often are we assured that God is rich in mercy
          unto His people, and that His blessing is their promised heritage. How
          earnestly, then, and joyfully may we put God in remembrance, and plead
          with Him to be merciful unto us, and to bless us, and to lift up upon
          us the light of His countenance, and to cause the shining of His smile
          to beam around us.

          But such prayer should not be limited to our own joys only. It should
          enfold in its embrace the whole family of man. Our supplications
          should beseech Him to look beyond our own needs, and to make known
          throughout the world His purpose, His will, His grace, His love, His
          design in sending Jesus to assume our flesh, His covenant of
          everlasting peace in Him. But such prayer lacks the essence of
          sincerity if it evaporates in word only, and makes no effort to secure
          fulfillment. How vain to pray and not to labor in the missionary
          cause!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"Let the people praise You, O God; let all the people praise You. O
            let the nations be glad, and sing for joy; for You shall judge the
            people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth."</i

          What a glorious prospect here rises to our view! What joy and gladness
          animate the scene! What sound prevails? It is the praises of our God.
          Where issue forth these precious notes? Not from one heart only; not
          from one family only, but from all who throng the earth. From every
          climate, from every nation, from all who breathe the breath of life,
          adoration is uplifted. "Let the people praise You, O God, let all the
          people praise You." How earnestly should we pray, 'Come, Lord Jesus,
          come quickly, and establish this reign of universal gladness. For then
          shall all nations sing for joy.'
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          How abundant will be the cause of this thanksgiving. The blessed Jesus
          shall sit upon the throne of His kingdom. His happy subjects shall
          adore Him as King of kings and Lord of lords. His rule shall be
          righteousness. The laws of His empire shall be perfect holiness. Sin,
          with all its miseries, shall be cast out. Its hideous features shall
          be no more seen. Nothing shall appear which shall mar the happiness of
          all the rejoicing subjects. The tabernacle of God shall be with them.
          The purposes of redeeming love shall be fully manifested. A righteous
          King shall govern righteous subjects. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-7.
          <i
            >"Let the people praise You, O God; let all the people praise You.
            Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God,
            shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth
            shall fear Him."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again and again shall prayer ascend for the ingathering of the
          Gentiles into the fold of Christ. The blessing is promised, and no
          rest should be given until the happy consummation comes, and the
          fullness of these new subjects shall be as life from the dead to the
          expectant world. Then, as when renewed fertility crowns the surface of
          the earth with goodness, so every token of joy and blessedness shall
          be seen throughout the world's length and breadth. "God shall bless
          us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him." Who can conceive
          the blessings which Christ Jesus bestows on His ransomed heritage? How
          can we adequately love and bless and praise and adore Him! Let us go
          forth in faith, and ponder the coming wonders of His reign. Let our
          lips often cry, "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly."
