        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Fervent praise acknowledges God's help and righteous judgments. Prayer
          follows for continued favors. May we thus praise! May we thus pray!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will show forth
            all Your marvelous works. I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will
            sing praise to Your name, O Most High."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Lord is worthy to be praised with all our energies, with all our
          powers, in every pulse of our affections, in every movement of our
          minds, in all places, and at all times. Heaven is unwearied praise.
          Earth would be heaven begun, if our whole hearts were wholly tuned to
          praise. It is our duty, and it should be our chief joy, to tell aloud
          God's wondrous works. But ah! how weak are our best efforts! Where
          shall we find beginning? Where shall we find an end?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Eternal love joyed in us before the worlds were framed. Goodness and
          mercy have followed us from the cradle to this hour. Christ died for
          us. Christ lives for us. Christ soon will come again to receive us
          unto Himself, that where He is there we may be also. Let us praise
          with our whole hearts. Let us be glad and rejoice in Him!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4, 5.
          <i
            >"When my enemies turn back, they shall fall and perish at Your
            presence. For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on
            the throne judging in righteousness. You have rebuked the nations,
            You have destroyed the wicked; You have blotted out their name
            forever and ever."
          </i>

        <p align="justify">
          Have not believers every cause for joy? They have foes around and they
          have foes within. Against these foes their own strength is as nothing;
          but God is their victory. He arises to their help. His presence
          crushes opposition. He does all for us, and we bless His name.
          <i>Present deliverance</i> is a pledge of the <i>coming triumph</i>. A
          day draws near when on our Lord shall sit on His glorious throne. This
          throne is based on righteousness. From it all righteous judgment will
          go forth. On it the rightful cause of believers will be maintained.
          Their cause is good. It cannot be disputed. They claim their pardon on
          the plea that all their debt is cancelled in Christ's blood—that all
          demands of justice are satisfied in Him. They ask for heaven on the
          ground that they are clothed in divine righteousness, and fitted in
          Christ for the marriage supper of the Lamb!

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The redeemed anticipate the <b>devil's</b> final fall. They are not
          afraid to confront him. They bid him mark, that as he destroyed, so
          now he is destroyed. They foresee his hateful work concluded, his
          destroying power broken, and his scepter forever shattered. Doubtless
          he wrought terrible destructions in the earth. He laid waste populous
          cities. He so utterly demolished them that no vestige could be found.
          As they were swept into oblivion, so the devil's empire shall forever
          perish.
        </p>

            judgment. He shall judge the world in righteousness, and He shall

        <p align="justify">
          What a glorious kingdom now follows! All rule, all authority and
          power, are now put down. God is enthroned the only Lord. His scepter
          is uprightness. Thus He shall reign forever and ever. Sin is forever
          annihilated. It can no longer disturb, or vex, or soil. The righteous
          God rules over a righteous world. His people shall be all holy.
          Holiness and love shall be on each brow. Holiness alone is the
          atmosphere of the new earth.

          9.
          <i

            times of trouble."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But until the restoration of all things shall arrive, oppression will
          not cease, and times of trouble will continue. The irreconcilable
          enemy will use each opportunity to malign, to vex, and to destroy. The
          prince of this world will hate the godly. His fiery darts will thickly
          fall.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But a ready refuge is at hand. That refuge is the Lord, and His
          shelter is impregnable. All acts of Satan are weak against it. He
          cannot force its barrier gates; he cannot scale its walls. Salvation
          is its ramparts; omnipotence is its strength.

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The knowledge of the Lord begets all confidence. It is ignorance which
          trembles. The <b>name</b> which manifests His glorious perfections
          annihilates distrust. We may, indeed, trust fully; for the Lord hates
          divorce.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those whom He loves He loves to the end. In Him there is no
          variableness nor shadow of turning. The mother may forsake her nursing
          infant; the father may forget his first-born son; friend may abandon
          friend; but the Word stands forever sure, "I will never leave you nor
          forsake you." Holy Spirit! show us more of this unchanging love!
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          To the Old Testament church the Lord revealed Himself as seated
          between the cherubim on the mercy-seat. Christ is this seat to us. In
          Him we have constant access to our God, and always find a ready
          welcome. In Him we draw near to God, and He draws near to us. But the
          fullness of this truth will not be known until the glorious
          manifestation of the incarnate God; until He shall take His seat on
          the throne of David, and sit royally on Zion's hill. In knowledge of
          His present mercy, in forethought of His coming kingdom, let praise be
          ever on our lips. Let our constant utterance magnify His doings
          <i>past</i>, His doings <i>present</i>, and His doings in the
          <i> coming age. </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          12.
          <i

        <p align="justify">
          This earth has drunk the blood of martyrs. Jesus bled on Calvary's
          tree. An apostate church is drunk with the blood of the saints. But
          will such wickedness escape unpunished? A disclosing day draws near.
          Then murderous hands will find that they were slaughterers of their
          own souls. Then shall the crown of martyrdom be found to be exceeding
          glory; then will it be fully seen that every mournful cry and every
          humble prayer of the afflicted saints made impression on the heart of
          God—were written there indelibly, fully to be answered in the
          appointed time. Faithful prayer can never be in vain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13, 14.
          <i
            >"Lord, have mercy on me. See how I suffer at the hands of those who
            hate me. Snatch me back from the jaws of death. Save me, so I can
            praise You publicly at Jerusalem's gates, so I can rejoice that You
            have rescued me."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          How sweet it is in the full confidence of faith to place all troubles
          in the hand of God! Such prayer is very humble.
          <i>Mercy is ever sought in deepest consciousness of unworthiness. </i
          >There is confession that the gates of death endanger, unless
          deliverance is marvelously wrought.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Why do believers thus seek aid? Their ruling motive is, that with
          their renewed lives they may praise Him who thus delivers, and may by
          lip and life exalt His praise. <i>Renewed mercies deepen joy.</i> It
          is the constant song, "I will rejoice in Your salvation." The theme
          demands our loudest adoration. Let us go forth in spirit and
          anticipate the day when we shall join the countless multitude, and
          cry, "Salvation to our God, who sits upon the throne, and to the
          Lamb."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15, 16, 17.
          <i
            >"The heathen have sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net
            which they hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is known by the
            judgment which He executes. The wicked is snared in the work of his
            own hands. The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations
            who forget God."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The final veil is here again withdrawn. The Spirit calls us to behold
          the wretched sinners' doom. They plotted ruin to the saints—in ruin
          they are overwhelmed. They craftily spread snares—they now are caught,
          and all escape is hopeless. Into a pit of deep and endless woe they
          sink. Their multitude is great—their numbers exceed calculation. But
          numbers vanish before God's might. They cast God from their minds—they
          would not think of His authority and power; but now they cannot fail
          to recognize His hand. The final execution proclaims His work. Over
          their prison-house there is inscribed, "A God forgotten is a God
          avenged. A God unknown in time must fearfully be known throughout
          eternity." Would that poor sinners, before it is too late, cease to
          kick against the goads! <i>Sin will recoil on sinful self. </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          18.
          <i
            >"For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the expectation of
            the poor shall not perish forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Times of trouble seem to have long course. Sighs often inquire, "When
          will this darkness cease—when will these sorrows end?" But a bright
          morn will surely dawn. The help expected will exceed all thought. No
          word will fail on which faith hopefully relied.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19, 20.
          <i
            >"Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in
            Your sight. Put them in fear, O Lord; that the nations may know
            themselves to be but men."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The cry is earnest. Fear seems to tremble lest God's cause should
          sink, and puny man stand conqueror. God tarries that the saints may
          stir Him up. Their supplications will be heard. The ungodly shall be
          taught that at their best they are weak flesh and blood. Their
          strength is nothingness before Jehovah's arm. It is mad folly for
          potsherds of the earth to strive against their Maker. May we be ever
          found one with our blessed Lord! May His cause be our cause! His
          victories our victories! His heaven our heaven! His throne our throne
          forever!
