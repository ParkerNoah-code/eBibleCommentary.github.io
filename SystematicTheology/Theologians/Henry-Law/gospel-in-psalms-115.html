        <p align="justify">
          Man's utter nothingness is here acknowledged. In God alone all power
          resides. The idols of the heathen are the vanity of vanities. Let all
          confidence be placed in God!

          Piety shudders at the thought of the assumption of any power by man.
          We cannot sink too low. We cannot raise our God too high. There is no
          depth from which we may not look up to Him. Let the assurance be
          always ours that His mercy and His truth will certainly befriend.

          Israel was often brought into heathen bondage. Insulting foes derided
          them as helpless, and tauntingly inquired, Where is their God? The
          reply was indisputable. God reigns on high. Heaven is His throne. His
          overruling hand moves everywhere. He works all things after the
          counsel of His own will.

            have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
            they have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell
            not; they have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they
            walk not; neither speak they through their throat. Those who make
            them are like them; so is everyone who trusts in them."</i

          What can be more contemptible than the idols of the heathen world!
          These images may be cased in silver and in gold. They may shine
          dazzlingly in the sight of prostrate crowds. But emptiness is their
          only property. Blind, deaf, motionless, speechless, they are less than
          nothing. Their worshipers are scarcely better. Where are the minds of
          those who kneel before the workmanship of their own hands? But while
          we pity such degraded folly, let us never forget that creature-worship
          is nature's religion. The love of silver and gold is innate idolatry
          of heart.

            house of Aaron, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their
            shield. You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; He is their help
            and their shield."</i

          From a view of worthless idols, the exhortation gains force to trust
          in the ever-living God, who has all power in heaven and in earth. Let
          all His people trust Him. Let all who fear Him trust Him. Especially
          let the ministers of His word be foremost in this holy confidence. The
          standard-bearers should precede the host. They have all cause to
          trust. He is ever ready and ever able to give help. His sure
          protection can never fail.

            the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron; He will bless
            those who fear the Lord, both small and great. The Lord shall
            increase you more and more, you and your children. You are blessed
            of the Lord, who made heaven and earth."</i

          The review of the past testifies of the ever-mindful hand of God. Each
          Ebenezer gives assurance that blessings will still incessantly
          descend. Though appearances may sometimes have an adverse look, yet
          from age to age generations of men shall rejoice under His gracious
          care. He has delivered us, and still delivers, and we trust that He
          will yet deliver us.

          <i
            >"The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's; but the earth has He
            given to the children of men. The dead praise not the Lord, neither
            any that go down into silence. But we will bless the Lord from this
            time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord."</i

        <p align="justify">
          While we continue inhabitants of earth our lips may praise the Lord,
          and lift up adorations to the heavens. But our life here may be very
          brief. Our opportunities may quickly pass. Lips mute in the grave can
          no more be heard on earth. Let us bear in mind, also, that dead souls
          on earth cannot have spiritual usefulness. Let us then pray, Quicken
          us, good Lord, more and more. The tribute of praise shall then respond
          in louder and holier notes.
