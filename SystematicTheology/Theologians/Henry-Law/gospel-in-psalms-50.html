        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          We have in this Psalm a revelation of glorious truth. The final
          judgment is announced in dreadful sublimity. Formalists are rebuked,
          and warned of the worthlessness of dependence on the Law. In
          conclusion we have directions as to true worship.

          1, 2.
          <i
            >"The mighty God, even the Lord, has spoken, and called the earth,
            from the rising of the sun to its going down. Out of Zion, the
            perfection of beauty, God has shined."</i

          May faith be granted that we may realize the scene. The great white
          throne is set. The mighty God is seated on His sovereign tribunal.
          Before Him all who have ever breathed the breath of life are summoned
          to appear. From all the regions of earth—from every quarter of the
          globe—the inhabitants are called. We are thus mercifully forewarned.
          We must take our station before the Judge of all mankind. Let us see
          to it that we are prepared to meet Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To prepare us for the great day, God has revealed to us all Gospel
          truth. Out of <i>Zion</i> He has shined. We have not been called to
          Mount <i>Sinai</i>, where the fiery law flowed, amid all the terrors
          of lightning, and thunder, and appalling clang. We have been invited
          to listen to the silver notes of the sweet Gospel. God has erected on
          earth His Church, the perfection of beauty. Here all grace and mercy
          shine. Here blood is presented to cleanse from all sin; a
          righteousness to cover all iniquity; and the plea is presented, Christ
          died for pardon at the judgment-bar and full admission to the glories
          of heaven. From this throne of Zion let us draw near to meet the final
          judgment.

          <i
            >"Our God shall come, and shall not keep silent; a fire shall devour
            before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He
            shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may
            judge His people. Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have
            made a covenant with Me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare
            His righteousness; for God Himself is judge."</i

          We return to the judgment-seat. As when God gave the law dreadful
          terrors surrounded Him, so when He comes to execute judgment all
          majesty shall be displayed. His irresistible voice shall ring through
          universal nature. All elements shall send forth the dead whom they
          contained. But now His professing people are specially named. But all
          professors are not real children. All who are of the Church are not
          the Church. Have we become His through the blood of the everlasting
          covenant? Have we made fellowship with Him through the true Sacrifice,
          even the Victim who died at Calvary? If so, let us joyfully exclaim,
          He who shall come to institute judgment is our God, and His right hand
          is full of righteousness.

          How tenderly this warning intervenes! God's people are disposed to
          settle on their lees, to slumber on the pillow of self-confidence, to
          drink the noxious goblet of carnal security. Therefore God, in the
          plenitude of His mercy, would rouse them. He beseeches them to listen
          to His gracious admonition. He will not hide from them their grievous
          faults, and He prefaces His reasonings with them by the loving
          assurance, that He who chides is God, even your God. O Lord, give us
          the hearing ear.

            "I have no complaint about your sacrifices or the burnt offerings
            you constantly bring to my altar. But I want no more bulls from your
            barns; I want no more goats from your pens. For all the animals of
            the forest are mine, and I own the cattle on a thousand hills. Every
            bird of the mountains and all the animals of the field belong to me.
            If I were hungry, I would not mention it to you, for all the world
            is mine and everything in it. I don't need the bulls you sacrifice;
            I don't need the blood of goats."</i

          How vain is all dependence on external service! As aids to faith all
          outward rites are valuable, but it is the vanity of vanities to dream
          that by such observance we make God our debtor. The universe and all
          which the universe contains is His created property.
          <i>In all our offerings we only bring Him what is His own.</i> Let us
          never fancy that there is merit in most costly rites. When we bring
          our best to Him we give no satisfaction to His justice, or make
          atonement to His outraged Law. In Christ—in Christ alone—satisfaction
          resides. Let us bring Him always in the arms of our faith, and plead
          for mercy only for His sake.

          There is an offering in which God delights—the offering of the calves
          of our lips—the praises of devoted hearts. Let thanks, like incense,
          ever reach the courts of heaven. There is a grateful fragrance which
          He will never scorn. When we entered into covenant with God in Christ
          we vowed to present unto Him ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a
          reasonable, holy, lively sacrifice. How happy is it to redeem this
          vow.

          Amid truths of dreadful grandeur this bright gem seems unexpectedly to
          shine. Its value is unspeakable. Its comfort to believers in all ages
          passes knowledge. Wondrous is the word, "Whoever shall call upon the
          name of the Lord shall be saved." The text before us gives special
          illustration. Many are the believer's troubles—they are necessary, and
          the chastening is not withheld. But an easy and ready remedy is
          prescribed. His strength may so fail that he cannot stir. But he can
          always call, and never shall he call in vain. His call shall bring his
          God to his aid; and His hand shall bring deliverance. Light shall
          spring up out of darkness. It shall be ever true, "This poor man
          cried, and the Lord heard him and delivered him out of all his
          trouble." God's glory shall be the outcome; increasing praises shall
          break from the delivered heart.

          <i

          The scene changes. Loving words are not now heard. The wicked, the
          gross transgressors, those whose steps are in the way of open offense,
          are addressed. God expostulates with such, if perhaps they will repent
          and turn in deep humility to Him.
          <i>Such is the deceitfulness of the unregenerate man</i> that it will
          be secure in profession of covenant relationship to God, while the
          Lord of grace is really hated, and all its saving truths are
          contemptuously rejected.

          An dreadful picture is exhibited of the extremity of iniquity into
          which carnal men will rush. They will practice the vilest dishonesty,
          and lie in the filth of the grossest uncleanness. Yet God in His mercy
          follows them with remonstrance, "Turn, turn, why will you die?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19, 20, 21.
          <i
            >"You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit. You
            sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's
            son. You have done these things, and I kept silence; you thought
            that I was altogether like you; but I will reprove you, and set them
            in order before your eyes."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The tongue, which betrays the inmost working of the heart, pours out
          torrents of evil and deceit. Even natural affection expires, and
          slanders assail the sons who hang on the same mother's breast. God
          shows abundance of patience; but deluded sinners misinterpret His
          gracious character. Because wrath is restrained, the impious thought
          is cherished, that the evil which they love and practice is not
          abomination in God's sight. But the day comes when God's patience can
          endure no more. Their wicked deeds, in all their enormities, shall
          confront the evil—all the circumstances shall stare them in their
          face; no extenuation can cloak the guilt which must be confessed to
          uttermost confusion.

          22.

          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Tender grace exhorts to deep thought. Let all who do not have God
          before them consider their dreadful state before the day of vengeance
          bursts upon them. Then the rejected Savior saves no more. But now
          Jesus stands ready to deliver from the wrath to come. To Him let us
          cling steadfastly.

            conversation aright I will show the salvation of God."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Precious conclusion of this wondrous Psalm! What condescension to
          accept our worthless praise! What godlike condescension to assure us
          that these praises augment His glory. Let our every breath be praise.
          In the paths of holiness God will be met revealing all the mercies of
          His Gospel. Christ will appear with uttermost salvation in His hands;
          and glorying in Him as full redemption, we shall boldly meet the
          judgment-seat.
