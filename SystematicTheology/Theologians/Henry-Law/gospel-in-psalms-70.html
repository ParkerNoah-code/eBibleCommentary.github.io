        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Respite from trouble is not of long duration. The tide flows back with
          unabated strength. Earnest prayer is the ready refuge; the confusion
          of foes is confidently expected, and faith looks with undimmed eye for
          sure deliverance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O
            Lord."</i

        <p align="justify">
          When perils are urgent, destruction seems at hand. If they are not
          instantly removed all strength must fail. Unless the storm abates the
          little bark must soon be a wreck. Unless the devouring wolves are
          stayed the little lamb cannot escape. Unless returning light should
          dawn the footsteps will stumble in the darksome course. This sense of
          imminent destruction urges the Psalmist to be importunate in prayer.
          Boldness in supplication grows very strong. He prays the Lord to
          awaken from appearance of indifference—instantly to put forth His
          strength—without delay to hasten to his rescue. Blessed be God, such
          importunity is not forbidden—no, rather, it is earnestly encouraged.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-3.<i>
            "Let those be ashamed and confounded who seek after my soul; let
            them be turned backward, and put to confusion, who desire my hurt.
            Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha,
            aha!"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist clearly saw the wicked malice of his foes. Nothing would
          satisfy them but to stain their hands in his blood—to take away his
          life was their one object. He as clearly saw how God could defeat
          their schemes and lay them low in disappointment and in shame. He
          spreads this out before his God, "Let them be ashamed and confounded."
          They were rushing forward in all the fury of malignity, reckoning that
          success would soon be theirs. The Psalmist's hope was bright, and he
          appealed to God to turn them backward, and overwhelm them in
          confusion. He heard their mocking and derision. Their insulting cries
          were anguish to his heart; but he felt that their noisome sneers and
          wicked merriment would soon be exchanged for bitterness of woe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The deliverance of the godly is just as sure as the deliverance of our
          great Head from the cruel taunts of those who mocked Him in His
          extremest anguish. They shall shine brightly as the sun in his
          strength, while the wicked shall cry in vain for rocks and mountains
          to conceal them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; and let
            those who love Your salvation say continually, Let God be
            magnified."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the extremity of anguish the saint will look beyond his own sad
          case. The Psalmist prays not for his own deliverance only, but for the
          joy and gladness of the whole family of faith. This prayer should
          often swell, also, in our hearts. It will not go forth in vain, for
          peace and happiness are secured for us in the covenant of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The desire is added, that one note should be full on the lips of those
          who delight to realize salvation's blessedness. That note should be,
          Let God be magnified! How can He be praised enough, who has wrought
          such wonders for us, and who never ceases to bless us and to do us
          good?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, O God; you are my
            help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The sense of need returns, and again the prayer is urged, that God
          would speedily put forth His mighty arm to save. Confidence is added
          that God would arise when thus importuned; and the Psalmist avows that
          he has no other hope of rescue. "You are my help and my deliverer."
          Surely the God of our salvation will show Himself to be a God ready to
          extend all needful aid.
