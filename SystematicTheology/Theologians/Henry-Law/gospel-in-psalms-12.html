        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Fearing that the godly cease and the ungodly vaunt, prayer is made and
          confidence is professed in God's pure Word. Supported by such comfort,
          may we never fear!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"Help, Lord; for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail from
            among the children of men."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Amid the trials of this sinful world there is sweet solace in the
          company of holy men. Their counsel strengthens; their example cheers;
          their fellowship delights; their meek endurance teaches patience;
          their zeal excites to work. We joy in their joy; we gain grace from
          their grace. But they are not always near. We often shed tears beside
          their graves. It may be that adverse circumstances fix our dwellings
          where evil is most prevalent. Many have mourned this desolation. Lot's
          heart is vexed in Sodom. Elijah wails his lonely state. Jeremiah weeps
          in friendless solitude. Paul sadly writes, "Only Luke is with me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But comfort is not linked to man. Faith can fly straight to heaven.
          Prayer can bring down the joy of joys, the presence of our God. The
          fervent cry, "Help, Lord," can turn earth's desert into smiling
          paradise. The saint feels that he is not alone when God is by his
          side. The heart is glad when Jesus holds communion.
        </p>

          <i
            >"Everyone speaks vanity with his neighbor; with flattering lips and
            with a double heart do they speak."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Where grace is absent insincerity prevails. Ungodly conversation has
          taint of unreality. The unconverted heart—the birthplace of all
          speech—is double. From an insincere source there must flow insincere
          words. Dissimulation within dissimulates without. Hatred and mischief,
          injury and wrong, fraud and oppression, are deeply plotted, while the
          look blandly smiles, and flattery conceals the base intent. Ah, world!
          ah, treacherous world! you are a truthless cheat!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
            speaks proud things; who have said, With our tongue will we prevail;
            our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Sad is the blinding power of sin. <i>Proud reason</i>

          dreams that independence is its heritage. It does not bow to God's
          sovereign rule. It claims a seat above the throne of God. It
          acknowledges no power superior to itself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The true believer widely differs. He feels, I am not my own. I am
          bought by the precious blood of Christ. I gladly give myself, my all,
          my every word, my every work, to my Redeemer's cause. My highest honor
          is to be the servant of my glorious Lord. My noblest work is to act
          out His will. My happiest life is to serve Him. But these deceivers
          mainly deceive themselves. Flattering others, they are self-injuring.
          Their lips prepare their own destruction. The Lord hears, records, and
          will most surely punish. Wisdom proclaims, "By your words you shall be
          justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5.
          <i
            >"Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the
            needy, I will now arise," says the Lord. "I will protect them from
            those who malign them."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The prayer ascends, "Help, Lord." The answer comes, "Now will I
          arise." <i>Prayer speedily brings heaven to aid.</i> God's eye never
          fails to observe the cruel treatment of His suffering saints. His ear
          receives each feeble breathing of His persecuted children. It was so
          when Israel groaned in the Egyptian furnace. "I have surely
          <i>seen</i> the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have
          <i>heard</i> their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know
          their sorrows." In every age it has been so. It will be so until the
          reign of peace is sweetly settled. Until that day the world will see
          oppression working and deliverance checking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6.
          <i
            >"The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace
            of earth, purified seven times."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          While falsehood, deceit, and wrong abound in evil men, the faithful
          Word is near to comfort. No insincerity pollutes it. It is pure from
          all alloy, as silver perfectly refined. It has been the staff of many
          suffering pilgrims, and it never fails. It will sustain when other
          props are gone.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"You shall keep them, O Lord; You shall preserve them from this
            generation forever."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Church has lived through every age, and still it lives. There have
          been times when signs of life were very feeble. The quivering spark
          has seemed almost extinct. The daughter of Zion has been left as a
          cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers. But God's
          power has not deserted them. They have been kept by His mighty power
          through faith unto eternal life. And safely they will be preserved,
          until they stand together a countless multitude in Emmanuel's land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8.
          <i
            >"The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
            exalted."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may be that earth's highest seats are occupied by the most
          reprobate men. A Pharaoh, a Herod, a Nero, may wield the tyrant's
          scepter; then vice and villainy will show unblushing front. On all
          sides wickedness will riot. Let us in such distress pour out the cry,
          "Help, Lord," and the Lord will speedily arise. With such assurance,
          let us not despond!
