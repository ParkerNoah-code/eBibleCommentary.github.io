        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          All things are naked and open to the omniscience of God. His presence
          is all-pervading. Suitable prayer concludes the hymn.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-5.
          <i
            >"O Lord, You have searched me, and known me. You know my
            down-sitting and my uprising; You understand my thought afar of. You
            compass my path, and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my
            ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, You
            know it altogether. You have beset me behind and before, and laid
            Your hand upon me."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God's all-seeing eye and all-pervading presence are indisputable. His
          thorough knowledge of all the events in which we are intermixed, His
          close reading of every movement of the inner man, His observation of
          the characters, His distinct perception of every thought, of every
          word and deed, of every step taken, of every wish conceived, are
          acknowledged truths. Never do we come in or go out, never do we rise
          or sit down, but His eye marks us. Our lips never open, no utterance
          ever sounds, but His all-hearing ear discerns the significance. A
          recording book is written. We are always surrounded by His power, and
          never can escape His hand.

        <p align="justify">
          This knowledge is quite infinite, and therefore cannot be comprehended
          by finite mind. We can only ponder, wonder, and adore. But when duly
          pondered, what comfort springs to the believer! Amid all his countless
          transgressions, he knows that he desires to walk at each moment in the
          faith and fear of God, and his constant prayer is, Lord, what will You
          have me do? Thus he thinks on God, and peace is his soft pillow.

        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"Where shall I go from Your Spirit? or where shall I flee from Your
            presence? If I ascend up into heaven, You are there; if I make my
            bed in hell, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the
            morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, Even there
            shall Your hand lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me. If I
            say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be
            light about me. Yes, the darkness hides not from You; but the night
            shines as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to
            You."</i

          No terms can fully describe God's omnipotence. There is no spot in
          heaven or earth which He does not fill. There is no covert which
          affords concealment. He sits above the highest heavens. He descends
          below the lowest depths.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Alas! the folly of poor blinded man, who deceives himself by hopes
          that he can elude discovery. His every step is in the clear light of
          God's countenance. The day is near when all shall be proclaimed. Oh!
          that the Holy Spirit would write this truth with power on our minds!
          The thought would operate as a strong warning against sin. The check
          would constantly operate, "how can I do this great wickedness and sin
          against God?"

            mother's womb. praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully
            made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was
            not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was
            woven together in the depths of the earth, our eyes saw my unformed
            body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before
            one of them came to be."

        <p align="justify">
          God's thorough knowledge of us and all our ways is patent from His
          creative power. Before we breathed, His will arranged our incipient
          being. What mechanism can be more exquisite in all its parts than the
          formation of our bodies! Divine skill is manifested in the design of
          its innumerable members. Wonder is exhausted in the contemplation.
          Select any part, it proclaims that infinite wisdom devised the plan,
          and infinite power brought it to perfection. Can this great Creator
          not have most intimate acquaintance with the beings which He thus
          formed?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17-18.
          <i
            >"How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! how great is the
            sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than
            the sand; when I awake, I am still with You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is much transport in the knowledge that God thinks on us. If we
          cannot escape His observant eye, so too we cannot be hidden from His
          vigilant love. He loved His people before their bodies were framed,
          and never has His love relaxed. The value of this knowledge is
          inestimable, even as the multitude of His thoughts exceed enumeration.
          The child of God delightedly ponders this truth throughout his waking
          hours. They attend him until he closes his eyes in nightly repose, and
          when perception again returns, and the mind resumes its exercise, the
          same truth continues to gladden.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19-22.
          <i
            >"Surely You will slay the wicked, O God; depart from me therefore,
            you bloody men. For they speak against You wickedly, and Your
            enemies take Your name in vain. Do I not hate those, O Lord, who
            hate You? and am not I grieved with those who rise up against You? I
            hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          When we remember how great is God's love, and how countless His
          fatherly thoughts, the mind mournfully turns to those who have no part
          in this precious portion. Alas! there are many who must be reckoned as
          haters of God. Terrible, indeed, is their doom. It is denounced,
          "Bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over
          them, and slay them before me." If their steps are in the way of
          destruction, surely we shall refuse to walk with them. Love to God
          will estrange from all who hate Him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          23-24.
          <i
            >"Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;
            and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
            everlasting."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith boldly calls upon God to thoroughly investigate the heart, and
          to search its recesses with the lamp of divine truth. The desire
          glows, that every detected error may be slain, and that the feet may
          be guided into the way of eternal life. May this be our constant
          prayer, and may the outcome of our walk through life be the heavenly
          home and the joys at God's right hand forevermore!
