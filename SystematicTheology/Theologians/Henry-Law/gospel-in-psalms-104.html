        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          A splendid picture is here exhibited of the greatness of God in
          creation and providence. Vows follow that the praises which are due
          shall be devoutly rendered.

            are clothed with honor and majesty."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A noble opening is herald to this hymn. Let us awaken our souls to
          render blessings unto Him whose blessing rests on all His works. Is He
          not worthy? Truly His greatness is unsearchable. What thought can
          estimate the honor and majesty which clothe Him!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2-3.
          <i
            >"Who covers Yourself with light as with a garment; who stretches
            out the heavens like a curtain; who lays the beams of His chambers
            in the waters; who makes the clouds His chariot; who walks upon the
            wings of the wind."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What mortal eye can look upon His glory! His robe is light. The sun in
          all its splendor pales in His presence. When He uplifts the light of
          His countenance the darkness of sin and ignorance and impurity flee
          away. Who can proclaim the habitation of His glory! The heavens enwrap
          it as a curtain. His chambers rest upon the waters above the
          firmament. When He comes forth as a mighty potentate, the rolling
          clouds are represented as His car of state. The mighty winds expand
          their wings to be His seat. Let the image be pondered. Enlargement
          only weakens.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Angels are intelligences created by His will. They are marvelously
          formed as spirits without outward frame. Swiftly do they fly to
          execute His purpose; brightly do they shine as kindled flames. Let us
          give thanks that they are all created to do His pleasure, and to
          minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation.
        </p>

          5-9.
          <i
            >"Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
            removed forever. You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the
            waters stood above the mountains. At Your rebuke they fled; at the
            voice of Your thunder they hurried away. They go up by the
            mountains; they go down by the valleys to the place which You have
            founded for them. You have set a bound that they may not pass over;
            that they turn not again to cover the earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Behold the earth, which is the work of His hands! He makes it to rest
          on solid foundations. No power can change its form or bring it to
          decay. Behold, also, the sea! It is His, and He made it. Imagination
          is encouraged to go forth and view all the waters at His command
          rushing into the basin prepared for them, and forming ocean's wide
          expanse. View, also, the boundaries by which it is encircled. His
          mighty voice curbs the wild billows, and says, "Thus far and no
          further."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-18.
          <i
            >"He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
            They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench
            their thirst. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their
            habitation, which sing among the branches. He waters the hills from
            His chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.
            He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service
            of man that He may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that
            makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and
            bread which strengthens man's heart. The trees of the Lord are full
            of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which He has planted; where the birds
            make their nests; as for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. The
            high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for the
            conies."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Marvelous is the adaptation of all things to man's comfort. All who
          breathe the breath of life are objects of God's care. Do they thirst?
          Springs of water give refreshing supply. Do they hunger? The earth is
          a table of sufficient food. Creatures untamed by man have also full
          provision. Branches are supplied on which the songsters of the air
          give melody. Pre-eminently man's comfort is the main care. There is
          provision made that his strength should be recruited, and that joy and
          gladness should sparkle on his brow. The Psalm commenced with, "Bless
          the Lord," and let us here pause, reiterating, "Bless the Lord, O my
          soul!"

        <p align="justify">
          19-22.
          <i
            >"He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows his going down.
            You make darkness, and it is night; wherein all the beasts of the
            forest do creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and
            seek their food from God. The sun arises, they gather themselves
            together, and lay down in their dens."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The devout mind finds rich meal in reading nature's volume. The
          construction and maintenance of the world is a large field for thought
          to traverse. The firmament claims foremost admiration. In it two grand
          luminaries shine. The sun and moon rule the hours of work and rest.
          They know their appointed times. They move with regularity, ordering
          the division of day and night. The light restores recruited powers to
          toil. Darkness calls the wild beasts to their prey. The inhabitants of
          the forest are thus heaven's care. They rove in darkness, and in light
          seek rest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          23-24.
          <i
            >"Man goes forth unto his work, and to his labor, until the evening.
            O Lord, how manifold are Your works! in wisdom have You made them
            all; the earth is full of Your riches."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Man is pre-eminent in heaven's plans. Creation's order subserves his
          needs and comforts. Who can ponder the arrangement without adoring the
          wisdom of God. High thought ordains nature's revolving course.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          25-30.
          <i
            >"So is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping
            innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the ships; there
            is that leviathan, whom You have made to play therein. These all
            wait upon You, that You may give them their food in due season. That
            You give them they gather; You open Your hand, they are filled with
            good. You hide Your face, they are troubled; You take away their
            breath, they die, and return to their dust. You send forth Your
            Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the earth."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Not less marvelous are the provisions of the sea. On its bosom ships
          ride, transporting men and commerce from climate to climate. Within
          its depths innumerable creatures roam. Some boast gigantic form;
          others show the tiniest mold. All receive being from God. He wills,
          they live. He wills, they disappear. During their brief career all
          their nourishment is His bountiful gift. Abundance is the offspring of
          His power. In His open hand all support finds birth. Life and the
          means of living result from His sovereign will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          31-32.
          <i
            >"The glory of the Lord shall endure forever; the Lord shall rejoice
            in His works. He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the
            hills, and they smoke."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These works have a loud voice proclaiming His glory, which shall last
          forever. But in addition to His love and tender care, they moreover
          prove that His power can frown terribly. At His bidding the trembling
          earth strikes the inhabitants with awe. The roar and flames of the
          volcano show that destructions move at His command.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          33-35.
          <i
            >"I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to
            my God while I have my being. My meditation of Him shall be sweet; I
            will be glad in the Lord. Let the sinners be consumed out of the
            earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
            Praise the Lord."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Heaven-kindled piety sums up the whole. The devout soul resolves that
          sweet meditation shall be its employ, and that joy in the Lord's work
          shall captivate the inner man. It looks onward to the time when sin
          shall no more mar the beauties of creation. Enraptured with the
          thought, it again stirs up the soul to sing, and bless, and praise.
          But many view with unconcern these all-instructive scenes. The
          loveliness enchants not. The skill produces no amaze. They are as
          little moved as if they saw some random work or freaks of undirected
          change. Alas! what streams of joy flow by them untasted by their lips.
          They do not hear all nature's chorus hymning the Creator's praise. To
          them the new heavens and the new earth would bring no charms. Where
          did this blinded state come from? They do not know God. To know Him is
          to love His Word, His will, and all the wonders of His hand.
