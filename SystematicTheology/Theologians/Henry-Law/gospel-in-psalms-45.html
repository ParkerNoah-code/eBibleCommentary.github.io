        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          This hymn is fitly termed a song of loves. It is a prelude to the Song
          of songs. The spiritual Bridegroom is rapturously commended. The
          Spouse is shown in lovely features. The extension of Christ's kingdom,
          and due praise is promised.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"My heart is inditing a good matter; I speak of the things which I
            have made concerning the king; my tongue is the pen of a ready
            writer."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          One object ever sits supreme in the believer's heart. Christ is the
          noble theme which claims his fervent commendation. Praises break forth
          as water bubbling from a heated caldron. They cannot be repressed.
          When Jesus is thus the subject in all the majesty and glory of His
          kingly office, the fluency cannot be checked. As a skilled writer
          quickly moves his pen, so the believer's tongue is prompt and ready to
          express due praise. Boundless is the subject, commensurate is the
          utterance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"You are the most handsome of all. Gracious words stream from your
            lips. God himself has blessed you forever."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Church, taught by the Spirit, warmly cries, "Behold you are
          beautiful, my love; behold you are beautiful." Christ is indeed the
          chief among ten thousand, the altogether lovely One. What eloquence
          can show His beauty? He is the brightness of His Father's glory, the
          express image of His person. Every charm which wins admiring gaze
          dwelt resplendently in Him. Wisdom in the highest flowed from His
          lips, and such power attended His words that the blessing of
          enlightening grace and saving impression touched His hearers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"Put on your sword, O mighty warrior! You are so glorious, so
            majestic! In your majesty, ride out to victory, defending truth,
            humility, and justice. Go forth to perform awe-inspiring deeds!"
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Faith in prophetic terms calls on the Lord to equip Himself for
          glorious triumphs, and to ascend the chariot of His majestic course.
          He is most mighty. Who can withstand Him? His weapons secure
          prosperous result. His truth lays error low in the dust of shame. His
          meekness sweetly allures sinners to receive Him. His righteousness
          conceals all guilt, and is a glorious robe for all who surrender to
          His sway. Who can contemplate without awe the exploits of His
          matchless might? Let our souls mark and tremble and adore.
        </p>

          <i
            >"Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby
            the people fall under You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sharp indeed are the arrows of conviction, when directed by the
          Spirit. The contrite sinner feels the grievous wound, and humbly
          mourns his miserable state. He who inflicts the wound alone can cure.
          The blood alone can ease the rankling misery.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6, 7.
          <i
            >"Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your
            kingdom is a right scepter. You love righteousness and hate
            wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil
            of gladness above Your fellows."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The glorious truth that Jesus is eternal God is here proclaimed. The
          Spirit speaks from heaven, and His voice addresses Him as God. His
          essential Deity is the foundation of salvation. This gives infinite
          efficacy to His atoning blood, indisputable perfection to His
          justifying righteousness, and enables Him to satisfy the claims of
          every attribute of Jehovah. Let the true believer constantly address
          Him, my Lord and my God. His throne is forever established, and His
          scepter rules over all, on principles most just and equitable.
          Righteousness is the government of His subjects. Holiness is
          happiness. Therefore happiness is the atmosphere of His happy kingdom.
          God gives the spirit of joy without measure unto the King, and His
          blessed subjects are joint-heirs with Him of all the gifts of
          righteousness and grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9.
          <i
            >"All Your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
            the ivory palaces, whereby they have made You glad. Kings' daughters
            were among Your honorable women; upon Your right hand stood the
            queen in gold of Ophir."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The image of royal pre-eminence is still continued. The King is
          pictured as coming forth from his beautiful palace arrayed in all the
          splendor of regal attire. The perfumes of his robes spread fragrance
          around. Upon his right hand is the Queen, the type of His believing
          people, arrayed in the splendor of the purest gold, the figure of that
          glorious righteousness which He bestows. The allegoric picture adds a
          circle of attendants to complete the group. No special lesson is
          conveyed by this company. But ardent feeling cannot be restrained that
          we may have a place in this gathering, and pay homage to the King in
          His beauty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10, 11.
          <i
            >"Listen, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget
            also your own people, and your father's house; so shall the King
            greatly desire your beauty; for He is your Lord; and worship
            Him."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Holy Spirit, speaking from heaven, invites attention to His words.
          It is sad that such exhortation should be needed. It is more sad that
          it should ever issue forth in vain. Not only should the ears be open,
          but the heart should diligently ponder. Words from above should be a
          perpetual feast. The Spirit here exhorts the bride to cast away
          remembrance of her first estate, the home of her birth and her native
          companions. By nature we are born in sin—the children of wrath, the
          inheritors of corrupt affections, the companions of aliens and
          outcasts. When the Spirit reveals Jesus, all tenderness and love, a
          marvelous change ensues, all things are counted less than dross in
          comparison of Him. In His loveliness we become lovely. Our cry is, You
          are our Lord—we love, we worship, and adore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12.
          <i
            >"And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich
            among the people shall entreat your favor."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It sometimes happens that those who receive honor from the Lord
          receive honor from men also. There is an inward recognition that
          respect is due to them and outward reverence is duly paid.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13.
          <i
            >"The King's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of
            wrought gold."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is a lovely picture of the true believer. His inward state is
          glorious. He is adorned with every grace, and grace is the seed of
          glory. The Spirit, by His power, rules throughout the inward man, and
          implants faith, and hope, and love, and every holy principle,
          affection, and desire. All that is vile, corrupt, base, and earthly,
          is cast out; that which is sown is glory in the bud, and soon will be
          glory in full flower.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But, though thus glorious, the believer cannot inherit glory, unless
          every sinful spot is hidden. Christ works for His people a
          righteousness which He imputes. It is His perfect obedience with which
          He invests His every member. It is pure, and perfect, and without one
          stain of blemish. Wrought gold depicts it. Brightly they shine on whom
          it is bestowed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14, 15.
          <i
            >"She shall be brought to the King in clothing of needlework; the
            virgins, her companions that follow her, shall be brought to You.
            With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; they shall enter
            into the King's palace."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The bridal allegory is continued. The bride is seen in clothing
          beautified by art's elaborate skill. Attendant maidens swell the
          procession. All sounds of joy give notice of the glad approach. The
          royal residence is reached, and gates are opened to give welcome.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The happy emblems aptly picture the triumphant scene, when the
          marriage of the Lamb shall have come, and His wife shall have made
          herself ready. Let all who love the Lord, and have in faith and truth
          devoted themselves to Him, rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
          glory. The day is coming when they shall be publicly recognized, and,
          clad in the perfect robe of righteousness, they shall enter heaven
          with all manifestations of joy and pure delight. With such bright
          prospects who will not sing, We bless You, we praise You, we adore
          You, O Lord, our God?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16.
          <i
            >"Your sons will become kings like their father. You will make them
            rulers over many lands."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Scripture is the exceeding joy of faith, because of the enchanting
          pictures which in ever-varying form it presents. We have seen the
          widespread family of the redeemed. In every climate, in every age,
          they live and flourish. High, also, is their dignity. Wherever they
          appear they excel as princes. They rule over sin and all the poor
          attractions of the world, while others yield, and toil as slaves
          beneath the lash of Satan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17.
          <i
            >"I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations;
            therefore shall the people praise You forever and ever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is the duty of the Church—it is, also, her most happy work—to
          celebrate the praises of the Lord, and to tell aloud of His love and
          goodness, of His majesty and glory. Thus, from age to age, and in
          earth's utmost range, the name of Jesus is magnified and glorified.
          Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let all saints prolong the song of
          thankful praise!
