        <p align="justify">
          The soul trembling under God's displeasure is in extreme anguish. Its
          misery pours out a multitude of complaints. Various images lend their
          aid. Hope is found only in God and His unchanging love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto You. Hide not
            Your face from me in the day when I amt in trouble; incline Your ear
            unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily."</i

          An inviting hand is always beckoning us to the mercy-seat. Its gates
          are widely open. Tender compassion calls us. Abundant promises insure
          success. We may draw near boldly and plead the all-atoning blood.
          Especially in times of distress we are encouraged to utter the desires
          of our hearts. We may use holy violence, and wrestle with our God. We
          may refuse to give Him rest until responses come. It is not
          presumption to be urgent for immediate answers, and to pray that God
          would speedily cause His smile to dissipate our trouble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-5.
          <i
            >"For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an
            hearth. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I
            forget to eat my bread. By reason of the voice of my groaning my
            bones cleave to my skin."</i

          Prayer should be more importunate when sorrows press with overwhelming
          weight. The effects of such distress are soon apparent. The strength
          of the frame quickly declines. It vanishes like the curling smoke,
          which rises to evaporate in air. The bones grow feeble, and crumble to
          decay as fuel on the burning hearth. Mourning withers all energy. The
          grass when cut soon becomes dry and sapless, in like manner the
          smitten heart loses all freshness. The appetite declines. There is no
          desire for food, no relish for the customary sustenance. Misery finds
          vent in moans and sighs, so that the flesh is wasted, and the form
          moves as a living skeleton.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6-7.
          <i
            >"I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the
            desert. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Images from nature aid the portrait of this misery. The afflicted
          shuns all companionship. He retires as the lonely pelican, seeking the
          solitude of the wilderness, or, as the owl, hiding in the recesses of
          the desert. Alone he utters wails to heaven, as a solitary sparrow
          moping on the summits of the house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-11.
          <i
            >"My enemies reproach me all the day; and those who are mad against
            me have sworn against me. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and
            mingled my drink with weeping, because of Your indignation and Your
            wrath; for You have lifted me up, and cast me down. My days are like
            a shadow that declines; and I am withered like grass."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Misery is enhanced by the cruel mockery of the ungodly. No compassion
          melts their hearts. They rather rejoice to aggravate the sufferer's
          woe. No comfort is found in natural refreshment. Bread is rejected, as
          unpalatable ashes, and tears are mingled with the cup. Again we hear
          that the days are as a fleeting shadow, and as the withered grass. The
          cause of this misery is the withdrawal of God's presence. The mercies
          once so dear are hidden in displeasure.

          But let the fear never intrude that there is variableness with God. He
          is unchangeable in all His attributes. There may be change in outward
          manifestations, but He ever lives, the eternal and immutable One. Let
          this thought be cherished constantly. Let it be as a companion ever
          walking by our side. Let our delighted gaze dwell on the eternal
          oneness of our God. His power and love endure forever. All generations
          shall give this testimony.

          <i

            her, yes, the set time, is come. For Your servants take pleasure in
            her stones, and favor the dust thereof."</i

          Apparently the scene now changes. A sorrowing individual disappears.
          An afflicted people becomes prominent. It is a sound conclusion, that
          the Psalmist was thus inspired, when signs announced Israel's near
          deliverance from distress. Her children had long wept under
          oppression's heavy hand; but now the set time of sorrow reached its
          close, and the set time of deliverance dawned. It is a blessed truth,
          that God works all things after the counsel of His own will. When He
          decrees the rescue, the tyrant's hand can no more fetter. Ardent
          longings had arisen that the temple should again be built. God who has
          power to move all hearts now awakened this desire. We know, also, that
          Israel's sons shall be recalled from their long dispersion. When we
          see growing anxiety to hasten their return, we trust that this
          awakening is heaven-born, and indicates that the set time is drawing
          near.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15-16.
          <i
            >"So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings
            of the earth Your glory. When the Lord shall build up Zion, He shall
            appear in His glory."</i

          The return of Israel, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, the rising again of
          God's temple were grand events; and attracted worldwide attention. It
          was seen that the Lord's power was put forth to accomplish
          restoration. Heathen nations acknowledged God's hand, and viewed with
          awe His majesty. So again when Israel's glory is revived, it shall be
          admiration through the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17-22.
          <i
            >"He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their
            prayer. This shall be written for the generation to come; and the
            people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. For He has
            looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven the Lord
            beheld the earth. To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose
            those who are appointed to death. To declare the name of the Lord in
            Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem. When the people are gathered
            together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord."</i

        <p align="justify">
          At the appointed time, redoubled cries for aid were heard. Mercy
          spread rapid wings. Again the time draws near when the groanings of
          the dispersed shall grow more deep. Heaven will open wide to help, and
          God's praises shall again resound throughout Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i

            O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; Your years are

          This deliverance is wholly the Lord's work. Man's innate strength is
          as cradled infancy. The feeble pilgrim totters if not upheld. Appeal
          is made unto God. His never-failing power pervades all time. To trust
          in self is to lean on emptiness. To trust in the Lord is sure support.
          As He was in the beginning, so will He be forevermore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          25-28.
          <i
            >"Of old You have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens
            are the work of Your hands. They shall perish, but You shall endure;
            yes, all of them shall grow old like a garment; as a vesture You
            shall change them, and they shall be changed. But You are the same,
            and Your years shall have no end. The children of Your servants
            shall continue, and their seed shall be established before You."</i

          Bright and glorious is this conclusion. The Spirit teaches that this
          splendid picture exhibits the blessed Jesus. In the beginning the
          heavens and the earth were His work. When the consummation is
          complete, the scaffold shall be taken down, and this framework shall
          be laid aside as a decayed vest. But to Him no age shall come.
          Throughout eternity His redeemed shall praise Him and magnify His
          glorious name. Let us now learn the happy art. Let us go forth in
          lowly contemplation of dissolving nature, and hasten the day when
          Jesus shall appear arrayed in never-ending glory, and admired in all
          those who believe.
