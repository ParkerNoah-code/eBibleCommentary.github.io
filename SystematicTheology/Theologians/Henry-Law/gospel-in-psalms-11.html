        <p align="justify">
          Confidence relies on God when storms of trouble threaten. The
          terribleness of final judgment is revealed. May perfect shelter be our
          happy lot!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"In the Lord I put my trust; how can you say to my soul, Flee as a
            bird to your mountain?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Happy the soul which calmly rests on God! He is a rock so firmly based
          and so exceeding high, that swelling billows dash in vain, and raging
          storms harmlessly beat. Feet planted on it are as safe as God is safe.
          His power is omnipotence. Who can upset it? His love can never change.
          His wisdom knows no bounds. His truth can never fail. Let us then
          trust Him, at all times, in all places, under all trials. Let us trust
          Him with our souls and bodies, for time and for eternity. Let us trust
          Him with all our matters and with all our friends. Safe in His arms we
          may defy all foes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But they will taunt with sneering malice. They will exclaim, Make
          haste to flee. There is no safety but in flight. As the frightened
          bird seeks refuge in the high and distant hills, so fly with rapid
          wing. To tarry is destruction. Tarry not.

            >"For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows
            against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in
            heart."</i

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Peril may be near. The wicked hate and plotâ€”their bow is strong; their
          arrows ready; their eyes are watchful. If given the opportunity, their
          venomed shafts will inflict deadly wounds. Thus Jesus walked amid
          incessant snares. At every turn some ambush was concealed. What crafty
          questions spread entangling nets! So too it is each day with us. The
          enemy is ever near. Let us look up. Let our daily cry be heard, "In
          the Lord I put my trust."

          <i>"If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"</i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The foundations of our trust are firm, and never can be moved. We have
          received a kingdom that cannot be shaken. What is the strong
          foundation of our trust? It is Christ. It is His glorious person, His
          deity and manhood indissolubly joined, His everlasting love, His
          finished work, His precious blood, His expiating death, His
          all-atoning cross, His resurrection-might, His rule at the right hand,
          His never-ceasing intercession, His well-ordered providence, His
          coming kingdom, His eternal reign. How blessed, how encouraging, are
          these truths! Not one can be opposed, not one can disappoint. We may
          rest all our weight on them. They cannot sink. If any flaw could be
          discerned, if any weak part showed insecurity, we might indeed
          despond. But building on this solid base, we may indeed reject all
          taunts. We have a strong city. God has appointed Salvation for walls
          and bulwarks.

          <i
            >"The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven;
            His eyes behold, His eyelids try the children of men."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Ours is no visionary trust. Of old our God was present in the
          sanctuary. True worshipers might there approach and find that He drew
          near to them. Christ is our mercy-seat. In Him we meet our God; in Him
          our God meets us. What then shall be our fear?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But more; our God sits high enthroned in heaven. He rules arrayed in
          omnipotent power. How safe are those who are protected by His arm! His
          eye sees every outward act and searches every inward thought. His
          people never are unseen. No darkness can conceal His foes. We may then
          confidently trust.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          <i
            >"The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked, and him who loves
            violence, His soul hates."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many are indeed our trials, but all are ordered for our good. Thus
          faith is tested; leaks in the vessel are discovered; sincerity is
          discerned; weak parts are strengthened; the walk becomes more close,
          more vigilant, and more strict. These probings are among our
          blessings. "Blessed is the man that endures trial, for when he is
          tried he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised
          to those who love Him." But all iniquity is hateful in His sight. His
          holy nature abhors sin.

          6.
          <i
            >"Upon the wicked He shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and a
            horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They cannot escape just wrath. Their frightful doom is here portrayed.
          Mercy warns of this destruction, that men forewarned may flee to
          Christ. Images of agony are here combined. What Sodom and her plains
          foreshowed is coming reality. A fiery deluge overwhelms its victim. A
          flaming lake engulfs. There is a cup which they must drink. The cup is
          hot to overflowing with all extremity and intensity of torment. Wrath
          has not yet gone forth. Let all who hear fly speedily to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7.
          <i
            >"For the righteous Lord loves righteousness; His countenance
            beholds the upright."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Righteousness will execute what righteousness denounces. Justice
          maintains forever that rebels are thus punished. But saving smiles
          beam sweetly over the redeemed flock. God now beholds them in all
          love. They soon shall see Him in all glory. Holy Spirit! keep us ever
          in the light of His countenance.
