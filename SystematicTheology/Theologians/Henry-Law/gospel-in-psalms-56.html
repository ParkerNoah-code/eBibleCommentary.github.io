          Similarity of circumstance leads to similarity of conduct. Continued
          troubles prompt continued prayer. Prayer may wrestle long, but it will
          never strive in vain. Answers will come—the answers will be
          deliverance. In reading this, may we gain holy comfort!

            >"Be merciful to me, O God; for man would swallow me up; he fighting
            daily oppresses me. My enemies would daily swallow me up; for they
            are many who fight against me, O Most High."

          We are not left in doubt as to the occasion which prompted this hymn.
          David flees from the persecuting Saul. His steps guide him to a
          persecuting land. He would make Gath his hiding-place; but vain is his
          hope of refuge in man. There is no friendly support for him there. The
          men of Gath would give him up to Saul. His eyes are open to his
          perilous condition. A multitude pursue him with inveterate hate. The
          wild beasts rushing with open mouths to devour their prey are the fit
          emblem of his pursuing foes. He clearly sees that in man there is no
          safety for him. He looks away. He looks above. He asks no pity from
          surrounding foes, but he asks pity from Him whose pitying ears are
          ever open to the cry of faith. He humbly prays, Be merciful to me, O
          God! There is mighty power in the cry, "God be merciful to me, a
          sinner!" It never will go forth in vain. It takes Him by storm whose
          delight is mercy, whose riches is His mercy, whose mercy is built up
          forever.

          3, 4.
          <i
            >"When I am afraid, I will trust in You. In God I will praise His
            word; in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do
            to me."

          Natural feelings have deep root, and will continue to spring up in the
          most enlightened hearts. When David looked around he saw encompassing
          enemies. Saul threatened in the rear—the Philistines encamped in
          front. Thus when he looked to MAN timidities were prone to rise.
          Tremblings allowed that he knew fear, but happy confidence was not
          extinct. Many waters cannot drown love; many troubles cannot slay
          faith. Out of the lowest depths he looked above, and saw bright light.
          His heart responded, I am afraid, but I will trust. God was his
          confidence. God's word was the strong foundation on which his heart
          was fixed. Realizing his oneness with his God, he felt that all God's
          promises were his unfailing heritage. His word was a safeguard which
          shielded his breast; it was the helmet which guarded his head; it was
          the sword before which no foe could stand; it was the light which
          dispelled all darkness; it was the song which drowned the clattering
          of advancing foes. Blessed is the man who can similarly cry, In God I
          will praise His word. But what praise can do justice to its exceeding
          excellence!

          <i
            >"Every day they wrest my words; all their thoughts are against me
            for evil. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,
            they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. Shall they escape by
            iniquity? In your anger cast down the people, O God."</i

          The constant effort of the godly to walk without reproach in the sight
          of man fails to secure success. Words uttered in loving spirit and in
          pious frame are perverted by the lips of slander. The ungodly unite in
          cruel plots, and watch, with base design, the most blameless walk.

          Instantly the case of our beloved Lord appears. False witnesses were
          obtained; things were laid to His charge from which he was entirely
          apart. If these things were done in the green tree, what shall be done
          in the dry? Faith then puts the crucial question, 'Shall they escape
          by iniquity?' They may escape the censure and condemnation of the
          world, but there is a judgment coming, in which assuredly they will be
          cast.

          "God sees me," is the sweet solace of the true believer. "He knows the
          way that I take," will make that rugged way seem smooth. If perils and
          distress so shake the heart that plenteous tears give evidence of
          suffering, these tears are marked on high, and tender compassion will
          wipe them all away. The day has not yet come when there shall be no
          more tears. But the day is always present when they awaken sympathy in
          the Redeemer's breast. He who wept on earth will soon wipe all tears
          away.

            for God is for me. In God will I praise His word; in the Lord will I
            praise His word. In God have I put my trust; I will not be afraid
            what man can do to me."</i

          Faith boasts of near and assured deliverance. It is confident of
          success. Its deep feeling is, 'This I know.' But where does this
          knowledge come from? There is assurance that God is a present help.
          Hence the fear of man vanishes as mist before the rising sun.

          <i

            You have delivered my soul from death; will You not deliver my feet
            from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the
            living?"</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In days of trouble vows are often made that merciful deliverance shall
          be duly praised. Let these vows be fully paid, and let the assurance
          brighten, that He who died to save the soul from eternal death, will
          never permit that soul to perish in the upward path. The haven is
          sure; the voyage shall be without a wreck.
