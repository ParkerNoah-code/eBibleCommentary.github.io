        <p align="justify">
          Restoration from captivity is the Lord's gracious work. In due time
          the sorrow of the righteous shall be swallowed up in joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
            those who dream."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          When the days of Babylonish bondage were fully run, what transports of
          joy thrilled through Israel's sons! Their minds were almost bewildered
          by the grand event. The good tidings seemed almost as the mocking of
          an illusive vision of the night. So when deliverance from Satan's yoke
          is realized, what floods of delight overpower the soul! We were born
          captives in the devil's prison-house, his shackles held us tightly
          bound. We were slaves toiling under a cruel tyrant. But when Jesus
          comes and grants liberty we awake to a new world of happiness. We
          breathe the air of freedom. We exult with joy unspeakable and full of
          glory. We are tempted to exclaim, "Can this be real?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2.
          <i
            >"Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with
            singing; then said they among the heathen, The Lord has done great
            things for them."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Their homeward march was lively with exuberant thanksgiving. The voice
          of pious melody was heard around. The heathen beheld the marvelous
          return. At once they exclaimed that One mightier than man had come
          forth for their rescue. May we ever ascribe our redemption to free
          grace!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3.
          <i>"The Lord has done great things for us, whereof we are glad."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Lord, indeed, has done great things for us. Omnipotence has
          mightily come forth to save us from the grasp of Satan. Jesus, the
          incarnate God, has grappled with our deadly foe. He has snatched us
          from his thraldom. The great God brings salvation. Shall we not
          rejoice and sing!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4.
          <i
            >"Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When the heat of summer burns, many torrents show dry channels. The
          cattle, thirsting for refreshing waters, are mocked with empty beds.
          But when the rains return, their channels are again replenished, and
          gladness smiles beside their banks. So when the days of banishment are
          passed, the captives move homeward with delight. May the Lord speedily
          bring this joy to those who groan beneath Satan's cruel yoke!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-6.
          <i
            >"Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy. He who goes forth and
            weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with
            rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An image from rustic life gives comfort. The husbandman in hopeful
          toil casts the seed into the furrows. Months pass and there is no sign
          of life. In due season spring returns. The fields again are clad with
          verdure. Summer glows with ripening rays. The harvest is gathered in
          amid full shouts of joy. So a long period of dreary waiting may
          depress the soul; but the promised deliverance comes, and sorrow flees
          in shouts of fervent joy. May this be speedily our glad experience.
