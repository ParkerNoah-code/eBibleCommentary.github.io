          Blessings are ascribed to God for great success and victories.
          Continuance of such mercies is implored. The happiness of God's people
          is depicted in glowing colors.

            >"Blessed be the Lord my strength, who teaches my hands to war, and
            my fingers to fight. My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower,
            and my deliverer; my shield, and He in whom I trust; who subdues my
            people under me."</i

          The royal Psalmist sat undisturbed on the throne. He looked back and
          surveyed the many conflicts and the hard-won triumphs. He knew that
          God was the author of all his success. To Him he ascribes the praise
          and glory. Pictures are largely selected from scenes of war. They
          vividly describe the help and might of God. Whenever we prevail over
          sin and Satan and temptation, let us remember God, who is all our
          strength and deliverance. Let us magnify His holy name, with all the
          energies of our hearts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-4.
          <i
            >"Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of him, or the son of
            man, that You make account of him? Man is like vanity; his days are
            as a shadow that passes away."</i

        <p align="justify">
          Wondrous is God's condescending love. While we ponder let us adore.
          Though we are nothing, and less than nothing, the very vanity of
          vanities, the shadow of a shade, yet from the high throne of His glory
          His eye of compassion ever tenderly rests on us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5-8.
          <i
            >"Bow Your heavens, O Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, and
            they shall smoke. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; shoot out
            Your arrows, and destroy them. Send Your hand from above; rid me,
            and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange
            children; whose mouth speaks vanity; and their right hand is a right
            hand of falsehood."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To realize God's wondrous goodness is a great encouragement in prayer.
          Let us take courage and flee to Him in every strait, and seek His aid
          against all our foes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9-11.
          <i
            >"I will sing a new song to You, O God upon a psaltery, and an
            instrument of ten strings, will I sing praises unto You. It is He
            who gives salvation unto kings; who delivers David His servant from
            the hurtful sword. Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange
            children, whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right
            hand of falsehood."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The mercies so freely and so largely given should awaken fervent
          praise. It was so with David; let it be so with us. While he
          acknowledged that God was all his strength and salvation, he continues
          to wrestle in entreaties. The more we receive the more we should
          desire. Let us never cease to encircle the mercy-seat with cries from
          our adoring souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12-15.
          <i
            >"That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our
            daughters may be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a
            palace; that our garners may be full, affording all manner of store;
            that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
            streets; that our oxen may be strong to labor; that there be no
            breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our
            streets. Happy is that people that is in such a case; yes, happy is
            that people whose God is the Lord."</i

          Prayer will obtain floods upon floods of blessings. The prayerful
          monarch will reign over a happy, prosperous, glorious people. The
          subjects will shine in the beauties of holiness, and plenty will
          super-abound in their garners. Let us have confidence that our prayers
          will call down blessings, and that many will rejoice because we
          frequent the throne of grace. If there be happiness on earth, it is
          the happiness of those who live in the service of the God of their
          salvation.
