        <p align="justify">
          God is called to mark the confederacy of the ungodly, and to avenge
          His cause as in times of old. God thus appearing shall be acknowledged
          as Jehovah.
        </p>

          It is the happy privilege of faith to deal intimately at the
          mercy-seat. As a child it may boldly cling to a loving Father. With
          importunity it may crave attention. It may give God no rest until His
          power is displayed. Thus God is here implored to raise His voice
          against the enemies of His kingdom.

        <p align="justify">
          Shall God be silent, while those who hate Him are loud in insults?
          Shall He sit indifferent, while the earth rings with the tumult of
          rebellion? Speak, Lord, Your voice causes earth to be mute.

          3-5.
          <i
            >"They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, and consulted
            against Your hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them
            off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in
            remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they
            are confederate against You."</i

          Not only do they loudly rave; they plot in secrecy, and craftily
          devise rebellious plans. Hate is the moving principle within. It is
          misery to them that God's people live, are honored and exhibit power.
          In dark conclave they consult to extinguish their name, and to bury
          them in oblivion. But God watches His hidden ones. They may not be
          conspicuous upon earth. No pomp may signalize their course. No
          grandeur may court homage. But God has known them before the world's
          birth, and will in due time proclaim them as kings and princes to
          Himself.<i>
            Let none of His children complain that their way is hidden from
            their God. He has engraved them on the palms of His hands. They
            shall shine brightly in the day when He makes up His jewels.</i

            Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines, with the
            inhabitants of Tyre; Assur also is joined with them; they have held
            the children of Lot."</i

          If God knows His meek and humble followers, and calls them all by
          their names, so, also, He well knows the multitude of confederate
          hosts. The catalogue of Israel's adversaries classified by name,
          proves that the haters of God are individually perceived. The powers
          allied against Israel were all overthrown. Separately they perished.
          So all God's enemies shall be arraigned in distinct personality, and
          each shall receive his due reward. They will each hear, 'O you wicked
          one, thus and thus have you done; thus and thus must you be requited.'
          Crowds shall not hide individuality.

            the brook of Kison; which perished at Endor; they became as refuse
            for the earth. Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb; yes, all
            their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna; who said, Let us take to
            ourselves the houses of God in possession."</i

          It is true piety to remind God of His former deeds of wrath, and to
          implore Him again to do as He has done.

            wind. As the fire burns a forest, and as the flame sets the
            mountains on fire; so persecute them with Your tempest, and make
            them afraid with Your storm. Fill their faces with shame, that they
            may seek Your name, O Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled
            forever; yes, let them be put to shame, and perish."</i

          Graphic images show the weakness of rebellious men. Their stability is
          as a <i>tumbleweed</i>. Their firmness drifts as stubble before the
          wind. They yield as the trees of the forest to the power of devouring
          flame. God is besought to overthrow them with shame, that they may
          humbly seek His knowledge.

          The ultimate desire is that He who alone bears the incommunicable name
          of Jehovah, the self-existent, and the cause of all life, may be
          exalted above all the earth, and that every tongue may praise, and
          honor, and adore Him. In accordance may the longings of our hearts be
          to magnify His name.
