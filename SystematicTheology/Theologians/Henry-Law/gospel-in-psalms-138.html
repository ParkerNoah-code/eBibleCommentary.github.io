          Praise is vowed to the Lord. This debt should be devoutly paid. The
          Lord is worthy to be trusted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.<i>
            "I will praise You with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing
            praise to You. I will worship toward Your holy temple, and praise
            Your name for Your lovingkindness, and for Your truth; for You have
            magnified Your word above all Your name."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          No joy can surpass the delight of thanksgiving. It is a thrice blessed
          exercise. It brings down heaven into the heart. It should engage all
          the affection of the inner man. Cold praise is an insulting mockery.
          No fear of man should check this utterance. Before earth's highest
          potentates timidity should not bring silence. But especially should we
          take pleasure in the praises of holy ordinances. God's love and truth
          should have the loudest notes. His faithful performance of His
          precious promises demand acknowledgment. There is no brighter jewel in
          the crown of His attributes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

        <p align="justify">
          Experience is a grand encouragement in holy duties. The soul is lively
          and hopeful, when it can point to promises all fully redeemed. It is
          delight to know that when in Christ's name we seek spiritual strength
          we offer petitions which will surely have response, because in
          accordance with God's mind.

            >"All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O Lord, when they
            hear the words of Your mouth. Yes, they shall sing in the ways of
            the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord."</i

          The day shall surely come when the kingdoms of this world shall become
          the kingdoms of the blessed Jesus, and He shall reign forever and
          ever. Let us by constant prayer hasten this happy time.

        <p align="justify">
          Our Heavenly Father humbles Himself to behold the things which are in
          heaven and earth; but His eyes regard the lowly with especial favor.
          Let us be clothed with humility, thus shall we be fit for robes of
          glory.

          <i
            >"Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You
            shall stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and
            Your right hand shall save me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In our heavenward course troubles will beset us on the right hand and
          on the left. But let no fears depress us. The Lord will strengthen and
          refresh us. He will cause our graces to blossom like the rose. His
          mighty power shall be manifested in our behalf, and we shall stride
          victorious over all hindrances.
        </p>

          <i
            >"The Lord will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy, O Lord,
            endures forever; forsake not the works of Your own hands."</i

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          May the Lord give us grace to clasp to our hearts the truths of this
          most precious verse! He who has begun the work will surely bring it to
          perfection. If the foundation be truly laid, the topstone will be
          brought forth with shouts of, Grace to it, Grace to it! Desertion is
          unknown in the kingdom of the blessed Jesus.
