        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Sounds of bitter grief wail through this Psalm. We hear the mourning
          of a wounded spirit. All earthly refuge is shunned; help only is in
          God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before You.
            Let my prayer come before You; incline Your ear to my cry."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This Psalm is received as the wailing of Heman the son of Zerah. He
          was illustrious among men for mental gifts. Solomon scarcely exceeded
          him in wisdom. But under sense of sin he did not find relief in
          intellect. He flies to God, and pours out his heart in prayer. The
          whole strain is misery at its full. There is but one word of comfort.
          He calls upon God, as the God of his salvation. Grasping the plank of
          saving grace, he could not sink. Let us learn the happy art of
          wrestling with God, in like spirit of supporting faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3-5.
          <i
            >"For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to the
            grave. I am counted with those who go down into the pit; I am as a
            man who has no strength. Free among the dead, like the slain who lie
            in the grave, whom You remember no more; and they are cut off from
            Your hand."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          His soul is faint through excess of anguish. All vital power seems to
          be extinct. He regards himself as utterly cut off from life, and as
          now moldering in the grave. So terrible was his grief that he speaks
          of himself as already an inhabitant of the tomb.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6-7.
          <i
            >"You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
            Your wrath lies hard upon me, and You have afflicted me with all
            Your waves."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Misery sighs in deeper notes. He mourns as now separated from God. He
          wails as though lying in the very pit—amid all blackness of
          darkness—in the uttermost depths. Can misery be more miserable! Let us
          look up to Jesus. He has delivered us from all wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8-9.
          <i
            >"You have put away my acquaintance far from me; You have made me an
            abomination to them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. My eye
            mourns by reason of affliction; Lord, I have called daily upon You;
            I have stretched out my hands to You."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Troubles lose much of their burden, when loving friends are near to
          solace. This comfort was denied to Heman. Alone he mourned. Such too
          was the lonely state of our beloved Lord. All His friends forsook Him
          and fled. Prayer will bring Jesus to our side. We may plead His
          promise, I will never leave You, nor forsake You.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-12.
          <i
            >"Will You show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise
            You? Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or Your
            faithfulness in destruction? Shall Your wonders be known in the
            dark? and Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The plea is urged, that relief delayed may be too late. When we lie
          down in the grave, we can no more show forth God's praise, or spread
          abroad His wonders. While life continues, let us strive to magnify
          Him, before all our powers are silent in the grave.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13-14.
          <i
            >"But to You have I cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my
            prayer comes before You. Lord, why do You cast off my soul? Why do
            You hide Your face from me?"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          While we have life let it be prayer. This grace will prevail. Let the
          earliest dawn witness our supplications. Let our cry be the first
          utterance which reaches God. Let us thus seek to learn why He is
          absent from us, and why His smile no longer cheers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15-18.
          <i
            >"I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up; while I suffer
            Your terrors I am distracted. Your fierce wrath goes over me; Your
            terrors have cut me off. They came round about me daily like water;
            they compassed me about together. You have put lover and friend far
            from me, and my acquaintance into darkness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fearful is this picture of a soul agonizing under a sense of God's
          withdrawal. What must be the misery of those realms, into which hope
          never comes!
          <i
            >Let us strive to look off from sin's deserts, to the boundless
            merits of the dying Savior. </i
          >He verily redeems from all iniquity. He is the Lamb of God who takes
          away the sin of the world. Let us flee to Him. Let us cling to Him.
          Let us rejoice in Him.
          <i>Sheltered in Him we cannot be exposed to wrath.</i> There is
          redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of our sins. O
          Jesus! we bless You, we adore You!
