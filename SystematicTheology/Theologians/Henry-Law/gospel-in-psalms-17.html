        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Abundant prayers are made. The end is confirmation of confidence. May
          we thus pray, and thus be comforted!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1, 2.
          <i
            >"Hear the right, O Lord, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer,
            that goes not out from deceitful lips. Let my sentence come forth
            from Your presence; let Your eyes behold the things that are
            equal."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us scan narrowly the character of true prayer. It wears no mask of
          truthless insincerity. It speaks not falsely with hypocritical
          pretense. It utters deep-felt truth from honest heart. Thus it
          wrestles like agonizing Jacob, and prevails. This boldness gains much
          strength from inward consciousness of uprightness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who secretly loves evil may pretend to pray, but he fails to pray.
          In strict exactness, no lips but those of Jesus could adopt these
          words. On earth He was as pure from sin as God in heaven. Truth was
          constrained to say, I find in Him no evil. But a great day is coming,
          when all believers shall thus plead before the judgment-seat. We shall
          crave justice, because in Jesus we have fulfilled each tittle of the
          law, because in Him we have endured each penalty. "Hear the right"
          will be a conquering cry. God will be just, and justify
          Christ-pleading sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4.
          <i
            >"You have proved my heart; You have visited me in the night; You
            have tried me, and shall find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth
            shall not transgress. Concerning the works of men, by the Word of
            Your lips I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          No man but the God-man could court omniscient scrutiny. We know this,
          and we adore Him; for His pure righteousness was wrought for us, and
          is imputed to us. But though sin is mixed with all we do, our every
          nerve should strive for righteousness without one flaw. Here the
          heart, the mainspring of the man, is uncovered before God. In times of
          darkness, when no mortal eye can see, and interruption cannot
          distract, close communion is held with God. He is invited to visit and
          to search. There is resolve that erring words shall not offend. A
          godly bridle shall restrain the lips. Grace from the
          <i>tongue</i> shall answer grace in the <i>heart</i>. The walk, also,
          shall be far from Satan's devious paths. His broad road is a downward
          path. He is the fell destroyer. All who are led by him go headlong
          into destruction's pit. The Spirit has supplied a perfect chart. His
          Book gives guidance for every word, for every work, at every moment,
          in all circumstances. Feet planted on this rock can never fall. The
          students of Scripture will ever shine as lights. They will reach
          heaven's haven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5, 6.
          <i
            >"Hold up my goings in Your paths, that my footsteps slip not. I
            have called upon You, for You will hear me, O God; incline Your ear
            to me, and hear my speech."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Purposes may be sincere and strong; but our own strength is utter
          weakness. The firmest staff of human growth is but a feeble reed.
          Grace must support us or we fall. The Spirit must enable or we fail.
          Hence prayer increases in intensity.
          <i>The more we grow in grace, the more we feel our need.</i> The more
          we climb the heavenward hill, the more we dread backsliding. Each
          advance makes us more fearful of decline. Hence the ripest saint is
          most intent in prayer.

          7.
          <i
            >"Show Your marvelous loving-kindness, O You who save by Your right
            hand those who put their trust in You, from those who rise up
            against them."</i
          >
          Many rose up against our blessed Lord. From all He was delivered. He
          trusted and was not confounded. The same foes are ours. But let no
          fears depress us. We shall laugh all to scorn. But in the conflict,
          nothing so cheers as the sense of God's love. Moses prayed, "Show me
          Your glory." The reply was, "I will make all My goodness pass before
          you." His goodness is His glory. The sun at midday is a wondrous
          sight. How glittering are the countless rays! But the sun is darkness
          beside the effulgence of God's love. When it encircles and inspirits
          us, we are waived to victory's high ground. Let us often pray, "Show
          Your marvelous lovingkindness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9.
          <i
            >"Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of Your
            wings, from the wicked who oppress me, from my deadly enemies who
            surround me."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The <i>pupil</i> of the eye is the body's tenderest part. The
          slightest touch—a particle of dust—inflicts keen pain. Therefore skill
          and care elaborately screen it. Safeguards are multiplied around.
          Similar is the care which saints implore. A promise is dispensed which
          tells that this care is ever near. The Lord in tender mercy cries, "He
          who touches you touches the apple of My eye."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Nature's most tender proof of <i>protecting love</i> is shown in the
          parent bird. When the storm threatens, or danger from some enemy
          appears, the little brood is quickly gathered, and extending wings are
          spread around them. They are so covered that no eye can see them; they
          nestle in warm shelter and are safe. This is fit emblem of God's
          guardian care. Hear the sweet voice of Jesus, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!
          how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen
          gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not." This prayer
          involves a promise of all help. Let faith often shoot these darts to
          heaven. Full answers will come down.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10.<i>
            "They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with
            arrogance."
          </i>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The faithful often plead the character of their foes. They are
          sensuous and carnal; they trench themselves in pleasures, indulgences,
          and vain-glory. Pride dwells within, and arrogance makes boast.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11, 12.
          <i
            >"They track me down, surround me, and throw me to the ground. They
            are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart—like young lions in
            hiding, waiting for their chance."</i
          >
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Intent to catch, they spread their nets around. Their stratagems and
          snares beset. With look demure, they seem to be harmless; but they are
          cruel as the ravenous lion, and crafty as the lion's whelp which
          springs from secret ambush. Such are the features of the persecutor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13, 14.
          <i
            >"Arise, O Lord! Stand against them and bring them to their knees!
            Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! Save me by your mighty
            hand, O Lord, from those whose only concern is earthly gain. May
            they have their punishment in full. May their children inherit more
            of the same, and may the judgment continue to their children's
            children."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "Arise, O Lord; disappoint him, cast him down; deliver my soul from
          the wicked, which is Your sword; from the men which are Your hand, O
          Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life,
          and whose belly You fill with Your hidden treasure; they are full of
          children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Adopting this version, our minds receive a weighty lesson. We are
          taught that <i>the wicked are God's sword</i>; that the men of the
          world are His hand. The Spirit in other Scriptures has revealed the
          same. Of the <i>Assyrian</i> it is said that he is
          <i>the rod of God's anger and the staff of His indignation. </i>It is
          the Lord's voice, "You are my battle-ax and weapons of war; for with
          you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy
          kingdoms." Thus evil passions are employed to chasten, to reprove, to
          keep us low, to do us good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus Satan raging in man's heart is only instrumental to subserve
          God's ends. Man's violence and spite are overruled. They will
          accomplish the predetermined work; they little know their true design;
          they are real blessings, though disguised to God's own people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But while they are employed to harass, the saints must pray; they must
          be suppliants for speedy help. "Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and cast
          him down." And we may plead the vile condition of our foes. They are
          of the earth and earthly; they seek no portion beyond this sin-soiled
          world; they glean abundance of its worthless husks; they feast on its
          unsubstantial pleasures; they amass its gilded baubles, and transmit
          their hoarded treasures to their babies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15.
          <i
            >"As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; I shall be
            satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Contrast the true believer's lot. He loves to gaze on God's unclouded
          face. Clothed in pure righteousness, enrobed in beauty, compared with
          which the sun is pale, decked in perfection fit for the palace of the
          King, he will be welcomed to the heaven of heavens. Though for a
          little time his flesh may slumber in the grave, yet he will surely
          wake. The hour is coming when all who are in the grave shall hear His
          voice and shall come forth. Then He will change our vile body, that it
          may be fashioned like His glorious body. We shall be like Him, for we
          shall see Him as He is. Then indeed we shall be satisfied. What more
          could be desired? What more could be conceived? What more could Heaven
          bestow? The glorified spirit re-inhabits a glorious frame; the
          resurrection robes are now put on, and they must shine forever. No
          lapse of age can change their hue. This wedding garment is ever new.
          Gazing on this glorious prospect, we may care little for those
          short-lived troubles.
          <i
            >They need not fear the face of man who soon will see the face of
            God.
