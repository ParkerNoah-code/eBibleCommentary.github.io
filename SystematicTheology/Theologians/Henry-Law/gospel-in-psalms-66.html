          Praise is the note which sounds throughout this hymn. Marvelous
          mercies are recounted, both temporal and spiritual. All demand devout
          thanksgiving. As recipients of mercy, may our hearts joyfully respond!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1-2.
          <i
            >"Make a joyful noise unto God, all you lands; sing forth the honor
            of His name; make His praise glorious."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          An exhortation sounds to all the dwellers upon earth. All lands, with
          all their inhabitants, are called to loud and joyful praise. What
          mighty motives urge to this work. How sweetly mercy beams upon the
          world. Behold creation in its every part. How suited to provide for
          happiness and comfort. In every part we see benevolent contrivance for
          man's good. There is no moment when blessings are not strewn around.
          There should be no moment when responding praises should not ascend.
          Away with <i>meager</i>

          praise and <i>scanty</i> payment of blessing. The exhortation bids us
          to make His praise to be <i>glorious</i>. It should be our noblest
          exercise. It should call forth the grandest energies of our noblest
          powers. But if temporal blessings require these bursts of adoration,
          how much more do the blessings of the Gospel demand the overflowings
          of this grace!

          We are encouraged to recite to God the manifestations of His awesome
          power. Thus to enumerate them is to deepen in us the sense of their
          greatness. It is a sad fact that from creation's hour hostile powers
          have armed themselves against God. In vile hatred they have raised
          their puny arm against His majesty and rule. They have vainly thought
          to subvert His empire—to wrest the scepter from His hands. But how
          tremendous has been their overthrow! He who sits in the heavens has
          laughed. The Lord has had them in derision.

          Prediction here proclaims the glories of the coming kingdom. "The

          Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever." Every lip shall praise
          Him. Every heart shall swell with adoration—one loud hallelujah shall
          pervade the world.

          We are here invited to draw instruction from the study of God's works.
          How precious is the contemplation! It shows in large and wondrous page
          how God has manifested Himself in olden times. It tells of
          deliverances in extremest times and from extremest perils. Great is
          the value of such study. For the God of our fathers is the God of His
          present family, and will be the God of His children to the last day.
          He is the same yesterday, and today, and forever in love and power. In
          His lovingkindness and in His truth there is no variableness, neither
          shadow of turning.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Ponder these manifestations in the deliverance of Israel from Egyptian
          bondage. In the rear the king pursues with overwhelming hosts—on each
          side heights impassable forbid escape—in the front the sea presents
          the obstruction of impeding billows. Moses is commanded to wave his
          rod. The waters part. A dry pavement opens the passage of deliverance.
          The people march as on dry land. In safety they look back and see the
          returning billows rolling their foes to fearful death. Awesome was the
          work. The past deliverance bids us take courage. So, also, when
          Canaan's promised land was reached, the rolling Jordan did not impede
          entrance. The waters parted. The hosts marched onwards as on by
          ground. Marvelous was the deliverance—a type that no opposing foes
          shall check our entrance to our promised home.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7-9.
          <i
            >"He rules by His power forever; His eyes behold the nations; let
            not the rebellious exalt themselves. O bless our God, you people,
            and make the voice of His praise to be heard; who holds our soul in
            life, and allows not our feet to be moved."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The same power still sits on the throne of universal sway. The same
          eye still looks down upon the fury of the nations. Let the rebels take
          heed. Their destruction cannot be escaped. But let God's people bless
          and praise Him. Their souls yet live far above the reach of injury.
          Their feet still stand immovable. Let us trust more and more. Let us
          praise more and more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10-12.
          <i
            >"For You, O God, have proved us; You have tried us, as silver is
            tried. You brought us into the net; You laid affliction upon our
            loins. You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
            fire and through water; but You brought us out into a wealthy
            place."</i

        <p align="justify">
          The dealings of God are all mercy and truth to His chosen heritage,
          but these dealings often show a dark and trying aspect. A scourge is
          used, and grievous troubles multiply. But such discipline is needful.
          Without it we would slumber in our nests, and indolently indulge
          sloth. Our feet would go astray, and we would not ripen for the
          heavenly home. The vine will not be fruitful unless pruned; the silver
          will not be purged from dross unless the furnace be again and again
          employed. It is our wisdom thus to see the hand of love in all our
          seasons of affliction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist recognizes God's hand in bringing him into his many
          difficulties. The afflictions which oppress are the burdens which the
          Lord imposes. Afflictions do not arise from the dust; they are all
          designed to humble, to excite watchfulness, to purify, to sanctify, to
          bless, to produce conformity to our Elder Brother's image. For a
          season our adversaries are permitted to trample on us with insulting
          feet. This is a grievous passage in our pilgrimage; but it has its
          end, and proves to be the entrance of enlarged prosperities.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          14-15.
          <i
            >"I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay my vows
            to You, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken, when I
            was in trouble. I will offer unto You burnt-sacrifices of fatlings,
            with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Times of trouble strongly attract us to the mercy-seat. Prayer becomes
          more fervent, and grateful service is devoutly vowed. These pledges
          should be all redeemed, and public acknowledgment should be rendered.
          Gratitude does not forget the large mercies of deliverance. It
          delights to pour forth streams upon streams of pious adoration.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist brought his appointed victims to the altar; he shed the
          prefiguring blood; he presented the foreshadowing offerings. We know
          that these types were emblems of our blessed Lord, through whom alone
          we can draw near to God; and who, by the incense of His blood, gives
          perfume to our every service. In the full faith of Christ may we thus
          ever worship; pleading His blood, may we bring all our vows.
          Acceptance comes when in His name we thus approach.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16-17.
          <i
            >"Come and hear, all you that fear God, and I will declare what He
            has done for my soul. I cried to Him with my mouth, and He was
            extolled with my tongue."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist invites the saints who are around him to come and listen
          to his grateful tale. Right indeed it is to encircle God's throne with
          praises; but gratitude should not be limited to such devotion. Our
          lips should tell aloud to all around His gracious dealings. Those who
          fear the Lord speak often to one another. This exercise is not
          disregarded on high. A book of remembrance is written.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Of what did the Psalmist speak? Of all that God had done for his soul.
          Oh! the breadth and length, the depth and height, of this most
          marvelous declaration! He visited his soul in darkness, and gave the
          light of life. He found it in the prison-house of the devil, and
          translated it into the kingdom of grace and glory. He saw it laden
          with all iniquities, and removed the total burden. He saw it filthy in
          all the mire of evil, and clothed it with the garments of
          righteousness and salvation. Such is the theme of the believer's
          story; but heaven must be reached and eternity exhausted before the
          whole can be told.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He adds the assurance that he was incessant in prayerful cries, and
          that his tongue was ever loud in raising high the praises of his God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          18-20.
          <i
            >"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. But,
            truly, God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.
            Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy
            from me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He adds the solemn warning, that if iniquity is fondled in the heart,
          vain will be the utterance of his lips. Prayer is a holy exercise; the
          admixture of unholiness reduces it to nullity. But his prayer was the
          offspring of sincerity and truth; the answers which came gave evidence
          that the petitions were sanctified by the Spirit and accepted of the
          Lord. With what happiness would he exclaim, "Blessed be God, who has
          not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me."
