          The deepest anguish of <b>our suffering Lord</b> is here portrayed.
          The story of the Cross is told in minute detail. Light breaks forth at

            helping me, and from the words of my groaning? O my God, I cry in

          We take our stand at Calvary. The Cross is erected. Jesus, the
          God-man, our substitute, our Redeemer, hangs there. We look, and we
          receive assurance that truly He is bearing our curse, and drinking to
          the dregs our cup of wrath, and receiving into His inmost soul the
          sword of justice, and suffering the extremities of anguish as the
          penalty for our sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          For three hours ebony <i>darkness</i> veils the world. We may not
          pierce the mystery. What mind could bear to realize the tremendous
          transaction? We learn all that we need to know from the shrill cry
          which burst from the sufferer's heart. He testifies that God, His God,
          was no more present. His countenance was wholly hidden. Utter
          desertion overwhelmed Him. He cried for help, but no help came. He
          groaned through extremest anguish, and was not silent; but no answer
          came. It was the hour and power of darkness. Hell could not do more to
          terrify and excruciate. He was abandoned to its fury. He was
          surrendered to its worst.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here we have fullest proof that our Lord's sufferings were
          <i>real;</i> but they were not for Himself. They were all really
          substitutional. We have a real curse-bearer, and we really suffer in
          Him. But against all feeling, when all things were most adverse, faith
          still survived and retained hold of God. From desertion's lowest depth
          faith cried, "My God, my God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3, 4, 5.
          <i
            >"But You are holy, O You who inhabit the praises of Israel. Our
            fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them. They
            cried to You, and were delivered; they trusted in You, and were not
            disappointed."</i

        <p align="justify">
          It is faith's happy province, when outward comforts utterly depart,
          still to justify God. Faith cannot blame, disparage, or cast doubt on
          Him. Against all outward sense it knows and witnesses that God is
          holy; it knows that God is entitled to all praise. Praise is His due
          desert. His people's praises are His home. In darkest times faith
          gathers strength from ages of experience; it looks to the elders of
          God's house; they all were partakers of confiding grace. It is thrice
          repeated that they trusted. To trust they added prayer. The end was
          sure. Deliverance came, and they were not ashamed. Though He slays us,
          yet let us trust Him. Light is sown for the righteous. We read a
          wonderful word as falling from the lips of Jesusâ€”"Our fathers." He
          states that He is thoroughly one with us. He is born very man, a
          member of our family; our fathers are His fathers, and His Father is
          our Father.

          Jesus foresaw His deep humiliation. He takes the place of a scorned
          reptile. He is considered scarcely worthy to be ranked on a level with
          the human race. In after days the prophet sounded a similar note of
          degradation. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
          acquainted with grief, and we hid, as it were, our faces from Him. Let
          us gratefully remember that His low estate is our exaltation. He thus
          sinks that we may be uplifted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7, 8.
          <i
            >"All those who see Me laugh Me to scorn; they shoot out the lip,
            they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that He would
            deliver Him; let Him deliver Him, since He delighted in Him."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We return to Calvary. The whole scene here appears in predictive
          light. As the prophet wrote, so literally it was transacted. Hear the
          inspired historian; "Those who passed by reviled Him, wagging their
          heads. Likewise also the chief priests, mocking Him, with the scribes
          and elders, said, He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now, if He
          will have Him." The sight of extremest misery did not move their cruel
          hearts. They reveled in their victim's pain; their sneers and taunts
          wound deeper than the nails. His grief surpassed all grief, even as
          His love exceeded love. By these His stripes we are healed.
        </p>

          9, 10.
          <i
            >"But You are He who took Me out of the womb; You made Me hope when
            I was upon my mother's breasts. I was cast upon You from birth; You
            are my God from My mother's womb."</i

          Faith draws support from recollection of the earliest mercies. The
          goodness which watched over infancy and childhood are too often
          overlooked as common dealings. But the enlightened eye in all this
          watchful care discerns God's gracious hand. It is our wisdom to trace
          each providence to special love. They dwell in regions of delight who
          see God everywhere, and in all concerns. In all things Christ is our
          bright example! May He who is the giver of all faith give to us faith
          strong as His own! As He trusted, so may we trust!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

        <p align="justify">
          Faith quickly flies to God. Its feet frequent the well-known path of
          prayer. In nearness of trouble it finds nearness to the mercy-seat.
          Absence of human help is not a loss if it secures the help of heaven.
          Welcome all earthly destitution, if God supplies the void.

          We return in spirit to the cross. The dying Jesus looks around;
          multitudes encircle Him; with open mouth ferociously they assault Him.
          Throughout the mass there is no sign of pity; all hearts seem dead to
          common feelings of humanity; they show the properties of the wildest
          beasts; they are savage as the untamed bull; they thirst for blood as
          the devouring lion. This is the saddest picture of man's malignity.
          What frightful fury raged against Jesus, the perfect model of holiness
          and love! His only offense was that He walked this earth as God. We
          see what man is when no grace restrains. If we love Jesus, whom the
          world thus hated, let us give praise to grace, which causes us to
          differ.

          <i
            >"My life is poured out like water, and all my bones are out of
            joint. My heart is like wax, melting within me. My strength has
            dried up like sunbaked clay. My tongue sticks to the roof of my
            mouth. You have laid me in the dust and left me for dead."</i

        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The suffering Jesus thus described His miserable state. In graphic
          terms He tells of His extremity of agony and His extremity of
          weakness. The pain of the cross was bitterest pain; the weight of the
          body, suspended by the nailed hands and feet, violently strained the
          whole frame. It was almost dislocation of each bone; every joint was
          wrenched. But still no bone may suffer fracture. A clear type
          announced their soundness, and wondrously was the type fulfilled. The
          picture shows the whole frame dissolving; it retains no firmness, no
          consistency; it utterly yields and flows away in weakness, as
          resistless water yields to touch. Strength of spirit, also, collapses.
          As wax melts, softens, and offers no resistance to subduing heat, so
          the heart lay prostrate beneath subduing misery. What is so weak and
          brittle as the clay of the potter baked and dried up by fire? So the
          fire of God's wrath brought down to nothingness the Sufferer's
          strength. The parched mouth showed that the vital fluids were dried
          up, and death usurped undisturbed dominion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In all this anguish Jesus realizes His heavenly Father's hand. This is
          Your doing. I sink into the dust of death. But Your hand thus lays Me
          low. Jesus thus dies, because His people were thus sentenced; and He
          thus mounts the cross to die their death, that He might bear to the
          uttermost their curse. He mercifully selects a term to show how
          exactly He bore their penalty. The sentence said, "Unto dust you shall
          return." Jesus calls God to witness, "You have brought Me into the
          dust of death."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16, 17, 18.
          <i
            >"My enemies surround me like a pack of dogs; an evil gang closes in
            on me. They have pierced my hands and feet. I can count every bone
            in my body. My enemies stare at me and gloat. They divide my clothes
            among themselves and throw dice for my garments."</i

          This wonderful passage establishes beyond all controversy that none
          but Jesus is the subject of this Psalm. To no one else can these terms
          apply. In Him they receive entire and exact fulfillment. Another
          prophet writes, "They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced." The
          history relates the very fact. No ground is left on which unbelief can
          place its foot. Let us give thanks, knowing that by these wounds we
          are saved, by these stripes we are healed. The very garments of our
          suffering Lord are here foretold; the seamless texture of His upper
          vest; the mode in which they are distributed; the Roman soldiers
          utterly without knowledge of this Scripture, devoid of all intention
          to accomplish, worked them out to the very letter. It is a wondrous
          word, "These things also the soldiers did."

        <p align="justify">
          Here new images appear to show the bloodthirsty rage of the
          unrelenting murderers. We have seen their fury as bulls and lions; we
          now see their fierceness as dogs and wild oxen. Fierce fury could not
          be more fierce. Again, we see that no trials can quench the flame of
          faith, or check its rapid flight to God. It ever realizes, When I am
          weak in myself, I have God for my strength. In the lowest depths of
          misery, it clings to deliverance as a sure anchor. Jesus testifies on
          the cross, "You have heard Me." He was not saved from dying; but He
          was saved from death. He died, for He must endure our death. But death
          could not detain. He lives again; He was fully heard. Glorious
          victory! He dies for us, and by His death, He has abolished death.

        <p align="justify">
          The horrors of the cross give place to joy. From this deepest misery
          we hear a jubilant note. Jesus now speaks as risen from the dust of
          death, as going forth arrayed in power, and crowned with majesty and
          honor. He states His mission to reveal to the Church all the
          perfections of His heavenly Father, and ever present by His Spirit in
          the assemblies of His people, to fill their mouths with Jehovah's
          praise. He will make their hearts a flood of gratitude, and cause the
          streams of thanksgiving to overflow. How great is His mercy and
          condescension in thus uniting us to Himself as brethren! He who is
          Jehovah's fellow, one in essence with the Father, God over all,
          blessed forevermore,
          <i

          In the days of His abode on earth we hear His voice, "Go to My
          brethren;" again, "Go, tell My brethren." We adore Him as Firstborn
          among many brethren. Let us with all boldness ever draw near, and tell
          Him our every sorrow and our every need. He has a loving brother's
          loving heart towards us.

          From the cross the voice of Jesus stirs up His people to laud and
          glorify His Father's name. They are described as those who fear. Their
          filial love is ever tremulous of giving offense. Their love is mingled
          with revering awe. Mercy to Jesus on the cross is a rich topic of
          thanksgiving. He was, indeed, the despised and rejected of men. He
          drank the bitterest dregs of affliction's cup. But though for a while
          forsaken by the Father, He was ever His dearly beloved, and His every
          prayer was heard and answered. Warmed by this thought, let us obey our
          Lord, and sing God's praises, ardent with love, lowly in fear.

          The heart of Jesus is ever intent to bring glory to the Father. It is

          He remembers, also, the work which He is pledged to execute. Never
          will He cease, never will He remit His efforts, until the whole
          company, given by the Father's love, are sought and found, are melted
          and renewed, and brought by faith to welcome His complete salvation.

          Another distinctive mark of Christ's little flock is meekness. They
          are true followers of Him who sweetly said, "I am meek and lowly in
          heart." Abundance of refreshing feast is provided for them. Christ is
          their bread of life. Christ is their daily manna. Christ is their
          feast of fat things. They hear His welcome, "Eat, O friends, drink,
          yes, drink abundantly, O beloved." They are fully satisfied, and they
          return abundant praise. Jesus, though dying, knew that He would live
          forever, and living would be the life of all who trusted in Him.
          Surely their life is far from harm who know that "their life is hidden
          with Christ in God." At present the world is full of all turmoil and
          evil. But this confusion and iniquity will soon give place to the
          reign of righteousness. Christ is heir of all things, His righteous
          throne will soon be set, and then from the rising of the sun to its
          decline pure worship will be given to Him.

          The sorrows of the cross end in glorious triumph. What marvels of

          Word shall receive full accomplishment, "Therefore, God also has
          highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name,

          His Spirit, adopted into His family, shall spring up to call Him Lord,

          their robe to justify, as their ornament for heaven. Rejoicing in full
          salvation, they shall ascribe all to His finished work. Deep in
