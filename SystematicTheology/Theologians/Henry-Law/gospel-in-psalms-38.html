        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist, in deep sense of sin, and writhing under just
          chastisement, spreads his sad condition before God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1.
          <i
            >"O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your wrath; neither chasten me in Your
            hot displeasure."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What anguish follows subsequent to sin! Sin is the prolific source of
          every woe. It sows vile seed, and crops of suffering spring up. It is
          so in the case of God's own children. Through lack of vigilance,
          through restraint of prayer, through deafness to the Spirit's voice,
          through stiflings of conscience, through yielding to the craving of
          the flesh, and neglect of the sacred Word, they often stumble and fall
          grievously. God sees. His displeasure is justly kindled. Indignation
          puts forth angry hand. The scourge is not withheld, and miserable is
          the offender's case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But he well knows that his afflictions spring not from the dust. He
          knows the hand which chastises is the hand of paternal love. He feels
          that his sufferings call him to the mercy-seat. He cries not for
          entire removal of what is so fully merited, but for alleviation and
          relief. He pleads, Let not anger wholly crush me. Let not hot
          displeasure be too fierce a furnace. "O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your
          wrath; neither chasten me in Your hot displeasure."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2, 3, 4, 5.
          <i
            >"For Your arrows stick fast in me, and Your hand presses me sore.
            There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger; neither is
            there any rest in my bones because of my sin. For my iniquities have
            gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. My
            wounds stench, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As piercing arrows inflict rankling pain, as heavy burdens overwhelm
          and crush, thus sense of sin, and realized displeasure of God, bring
          agony of soul, and lay it low in sorrow. A wounded and bruised spirit,
          who can bear? There is close sympathy between the mind and body. The
          wasted flesh reflects the pining spirit, and the whole frame shows
          ravages of malady. Iniquities, which seemed at first but tiny drops,
          soon swell into the billows of the overwhelming deep, and threaten to
          engulf the struggling sufferer. When the floodgates open, descending
          torrents come, as a drowning deluge. No images can exhaust the
          anguish. The putrid sores but faintly show the miseries of the
          sin-stricken soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6, 7, 8.
          <i
            >"I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
            long. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease; and there is
            no soundness in my flesh. I am feeble and sore broken; I have
            groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Spirit still draws back the veil and shows in fearful colors the
          deep afflictions of the awakened conscience. Trouble occupies the
          heart. The head hangs down. The stooping gait is evidence of failing
          strength. Let those who seek to find delight in sin ponder this
          portrait. Through the whole day, from rising to declining sun,
          mourning is the constant comrade. The falling tears, the sighing
          heart, proclaim that misery presents no respite. The ruined health
          adds woe to woe. Loud lamentations prove that deep anxiety prevails
          within. Who can contemplate these results, and not detest the cruel
          monster!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9.
          <i
            >"Lord, all my desire is before You; and my groaning is not hidden
            from You."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Out of these fearful depths there is a ready access to the throne of
          grace. The afflicted soul looks upward and appeals to God. No direct
          application is expressed, but attention is humbly craved to the
          desires which have a language in the ears of God. "The Spirit itself
          makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; and
          He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10, 11, 12.
          <i
            >"My heart pants, my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes,
            it also is gone from me. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from
            my sore, and my kinsmen stand afar off. Those also who seek my life
            lay snares for me; and those who seek my hurt speak mischievous
            things, and imagine deceits all the day long."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Psalmist, in the bitterness of his sorrow, enlarges on the
          aggravations of his misery. When sorrows multiply, how sweet is the
          solace of sympathizing friends! The complaint is heard that not only
          such relief was denied, but that enemies endeavored to ensnare him,
          and ceased not to propagate injurious deceits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith sees that a greater than David is here. The "Man of Sorrows"
          thus shows the writhings of His heart, when He appeared as by
          imputation, the bearer of His people's sins. While in spirit we hear
          His moans, let us bless Him from our inmost souls for all
          <i>His substitutional anguish</i>. He was bruised for our iniquities.
          He was wounded for our sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          13, 14.
          <i
            >"But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
            opens not his mouth. Thus I was as a man that hears not, and in
            whose mouth are no reproofs."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Affliction's school is not a joyous place. Lessons of mirth and
          merriment are not learned there. Sorrow sits pensive on the pupil's
          brow; but it is a sorrow which leads to abiding fruits of peace.
          Tribulation works patience. Proud petulance receives a death-blow.
          Reproof upbraids not. Meek submission bows its humble head.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Surely here the blessed Jesus is conspicuous. "He was led as a lamb to
          the slaughter; and as a sheep before its shearers is dumb, so He
          opened not His mouth." No cruel taunts drew from His lips an angry
          reply. Majestic silence was His rebuke to Pilate. To keep our mouths
          as it were with a bridle is divine art. This is the blessed fruit of
          discipline under sorrow's scourge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          15.
          <i>"For in You, O Lord, do I hope; You will hear, O Lord my God."</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The true believer looks not to himself for power of defense or triumph
          over foes. His hope is fixed on Heaven. He knows that aid is at hand,
          even the aid which God alone can give. His prayers will stir up God to
          help, even the God who promises to hear. Thus patience works
          experience, and experience hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          16.
          <i
            >"For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me;
            when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith is permitted humbly to expostulate with God. Come, let us reason
          together. Audience with God is craved on the plea that if no answer
          comes, and no upholding grace supported, ungodly triumph would
          rejoice, and God's great name would be blasphemed.
          <i>God's children are always watched with spiteful malice. </i>The
          slightest tottering in the upward path causes the foe to raise
          insulting head, and boast of his happy and superior lot.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          17, 18.
          <i
            >"For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
            For I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer is always conscious that in himself no strength resides.
          Unless upheld, he will surely fall. He knows his weakness; and he
          deeply mourns. He knows how often he has sadly fallen. He tells out
          his iniquity into the ears of God, and spreads out his sorrowing case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          19, 20.
          <i
            >"But my enemies are lively, and they are strong; and those who hate
            me wrongfully are multiplied. Those also who render evil for good
            are my adversaries; because I follow the thing that is good."</i
          >

        <p align="justify">
          If outward circumstances proved internal state, the ungodly would
          often seem to have the favorite's lot. Lively mirth is frequently in
          their dwelling. Their bow remains in strength; their ranks expand in
          numbers. The Psalmist witnessed this superficial prosperity. In every
          age the enemies of God are thus allowed to have their short-lived
          triumph. The godly are not thereby provoked either to distrust God, or
          to retaliate on their foes. They know that their godliness is the
          cause of all their persecution, and that the path of righteousness
          leads through the land of hate and cruelty. But their constant effort
          is to overcome evil with good; and to be meek followers of the patient
          Lamb of God, the holy Jesus, who could testify, "Many good works have
          I shown you from My Father, for which of those works do you stone Me?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          21, 22.
          <i
            >"Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, do not be far from me. Make
            haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer is <i>the believer's constant refuge.</i> Blessed are the
          trials which impel to the mercy-seat. Here triple supplications call
          down the presence of the Lord. Forsake me not—do not be far from me,
          or be very near me—make haste to help me. The prayer is intensified by
          the invocation, O Lord, O my God, O Lord, my salvation. It is a grand
          privilege to be permitted to use such wrestling earnestness. It will
          assuredly prevail. Answers will richly come; and God will show Himself
          a very present help in time of trouble.
