          Sorrows are transient. Joys are forever. May we so mourn, that we may
          be comforted!

          A train of mercies fills the Psalmist with thanksgivings. He had been
          brought low. His foes were ready to exult, but he was rescued. A
          saving arm had raised him. He who thus uplifts should be uplifted.
          Praise should magnify deliverance. In this praise there is the echo of
          the voice of Jesus. In His experience, also, His saints concur. They
          should sing as He sang.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2, 3.
          <i
            >"O Lord my God, I cried to You, and You have healed me. O Lord, You
            have brought up my soul from the grave; You have kept me alive, that
            I should not go down to the pit."

          These bodies are exposed to countless maladies. Our souls, also,
          suffer from disease and weakness. Prayer brings the Good Physician to
          our aid. He comes, and from His wings drop health and freshness.
          Sometimes the body totters over the grave. Sometimes spiritual life is
          almost extinct. But the Lord can grant revival. To all appearance the
          life of Jesus had expired. He was lain, as a dead man, in the grave;
          but He arose to live forevermore. In spirit we here see the glorious
          resurrection. Let all the members who revived in Him adopt these notes
          of praise.

          4, 5.
          <i
            >"Sing to the Lord, O you saints of His, and give thanks at the
            remembrance of His holiness. For His anger endures but a moment; in
            His favor is life; weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in
            the morning."

          The believer feels that a universal chorus should rise as incense to
          the skies. Every heart should swell the hymn. All share the mercies,
          all should return thanksgivings. Memory suggests abundant themes. In
          all His dealings God is a God of holiness and truth. May we delight to
          sing, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts." There are times when
          lovingkindness is obscured by signs of displeasure. His seeming anger
          is as the chill of death; but soon the cloud withdraws, and favor,
          which is life, returns. The darkness passes, fears vanish. The joyful
          morning dawns, and all is bright.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here we see the resurrection-morn of Christ. There had been darkness,
          but it soon vanished. There is now the brightness of eternal day. We
          too have now a night of trouble, but the trouble is light; it lasts
          but for a moment. It works for us a far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory. While we weep still let us sing, "Joy comes in the
          morning."

          6, 7.
          <i
            >"And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. Lord, by Your
            favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face,
            and I was troubled."</i

        <p align="justify">
          David was raised from deep troubles to great prosperity. Zion's
          stronghold seemed to be impregnable. Sleeping in the lap of ease, he
          forgot his true support. The Lord in mercy shook the pillow of carnal
          security, and trouble brought him to a right mind.
          <i>Seasons of prosperity are full of peril. </i>They induce
          forgetfulness of Him by whom alone we stand. But God remembers us when
          we turn from Him. He looks away. Troubles instantly rush in.
          <i>The shining of His face is the true joy.</i> His look averted makes
          the prospect dark.

          8, 9, 10.
          <i
            >"I cried to You, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication.
            What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall
            the dust praise You? shall it declare Your truth? Hear, O Lord, and
            have mercy upon me; Lord, be my helper."</i
          >

        <p align="justify">
          Trouble is sent in mercy. It subserves a blessed end. It rouses the
          sleepy soul from dangerous lethargy. It is a scourge which drives the
          careless to the mercy-seat. Here, when God's smile ceases, importunate
          petitions are in full activity. The gate of mercy opens to the
          returning knock.
          <i
            >Faith is an inventive grace. From every trouble it can draw a
            plea.</i
          >
          It here reasons, My destruction brings no glory to the courts of
          heaven; if my lips are silent in the grave, no longer can my praise be
          heard; my grateful tribute can no more set forth Your truth. Then the
          prayer renews its strength, and cries for audience, mercy, help.
          Therefore may our faith gather strong arguments to supplicate for
          joyful resurrection. Let our deep longings ever be to join the eternal
          hallelujahs, which are God's glory in the highest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11, 12.
          <i
            >"You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have put off
            my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; to the end that my glory
            may sing praise to You, and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will
            give thanks to You forever."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Images of exuberant joy conclude this ode. Mourning is gone. The
          sackcloth of woe is put aside. Every movement testifies exhilaration.
          The girdle of the loins is gladness. For what purpose is this glad
          exchange? The design is that God may be loudly praised by every
          utterance of the lips. This scene will soon be realized. The day of
          Christ draws near. Then will be fullness of joy. Then, O Lord our God,
          we will give thanks to You forever.
