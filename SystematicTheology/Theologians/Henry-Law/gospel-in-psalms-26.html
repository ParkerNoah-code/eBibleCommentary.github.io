          Prayers, professions, and resolves are here interlinked. May the Holy
          Spirit draw holy lessons for us!

          The voice of Jesus should be here first heard. He appeals from all
          injustice of the courts of men to Heaven's tribunal. He could claim
          vindication of His cause on the firm ground that all His ways were
          perfect holiness. Every one that is born of Him will strive to be pure
          and holy, even as He is pure and holy. May our faith be strengthened
          by ceaseless effort and ceaseless prayer; for when our trust is firm,
          we shall move firmly along the slippery paths of life.

          The heart is deceitful above all things. Who can know it? Who can have
          full acquaintance with its intricate and devious windings? Therefore
          the sincere man will often pray God to come with the light of His
          Spirit, and the torch of His Word, to search each deep and hidden
          corner, that no Achan may lurk undetected. Happy the prayer which is
          supported by the plea, 'My eyes are ever gazing on Your wondrous love,
          and all my steps are set in the holy way of Your revealed truth.'

          4, 5.<i>
            "I do not spend time with liars or go along with hypocrites. I hate
            the gatherings of those who do evil, and I refuse to join in with
            the wicked."</i

          There is no communion of light with darkness. There is no fellowship
          between righteousness and unrighteousness. The believer must come out
          and be separate. He must not touch the unclean thing. How rich his
          gain! The Lord will receive all who thus withdraw, and He will dwell
          in them, and walk in them. He will be their God; they shall be His
          people.

          The Temple and all its rites and all its furniture was one clear
          Gospel-lesson. The laver was the cleansing blood of Jesus. Constant
          ablutions typified the washing out of guilt. The altar, with its dying
          victims, streaming blood, and curling smoke, proclaimed the
          all-atoning sacrifice. Jesus often tarried in these courts. His eyes
          would rest on symbols significant of His work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The believer, in spirit, will frequent this holy ground. Abhorring sin
          he seeks the laver that no stain may soil him. His happy walk is round
          the altar; gazing on it at each step, delighting by faith to see his
          dying Lord, clasping to his heart the truth, for me He died, for me
          His blood was shed, in Him I am completely saved.

          Views of redemption lead to grateful love, and prompt the voice of
          praise. They warm the heart; they cause the lips to sing; they fill
          the inner cistern; and the waters overflow. There is no theme so
          joyful as the Lord's wonderful works. Faith strives to speak, but due
          utterance fails.

          <i
            >It is far easier to count ocean's drops, than to portray the
            Savior's love, His worth, His righteousness, and the glories which
            He has purchased. </i
          >But still, the more we speak, the more we feel; the more we feel, the
          more we speak.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8, 9, 10.
          <i
            >"Lord, I have loved the habitation of Your house, and the place
            where Your glory dwells. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my
            life with bloody men; in whose hands is mischief, and their right
            hand is full of bribes."</i

          The sanctuary displayed God's glory. Bright rays shone forth from many
          symbols. The blessed Jesus loved to frequent this mystic spot. The
          ordinances of God were His delight. It became Him to fulfill all
          righteousness. This mark distinguishes His children. In public worship
          they joy to lift up the voice of praise. They hasten with happy step
          to join the assemblies in which united prayer is made.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is an dreadful contrast.
          <i
            >There is a bundle of tares that shall be burned. There is an
            assembly in which every form is sin, and every sight is unmasked
            ungodliness. Hell is no fiction. The very thought is horror. What
            must be the dreadful reality!</i
          >
          Let the thought give power to the prayer—Oh, gather not my soul with
          such!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11.
          <i
            >"But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be
            merciful to me."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The thought of the second death gives energy to the resolve to walk
          with God now, that we may dwell with Him forever. The resolve is
          scarcely formed, but life returns. The truth appears that
          <i>our best is only evil.</i> The frightened believer flies to
          redeeming blood; he cries for mercy; he avows that his only hope is in
          the cleansing blood. His constant prayer must be, God be merciful to
          me a sinner!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          12.
          <i
            >"My foot stands in an even place; in the congregations will I bless
            the Lord."</i

          Hope revives. Faith realizes that it firmly rests on immovable ground.
          It receives a kingdom which cannot be shaken. It looks beyond the
          earthly courts and congresses of pious men to the innumerable throng.
          It forgets the present praise in forethought of the never ending song.
          Their one ecstatic chorus will forever swell—Blessings to our God, and
          to the Lamb. Lord, fit us to bear our part!
