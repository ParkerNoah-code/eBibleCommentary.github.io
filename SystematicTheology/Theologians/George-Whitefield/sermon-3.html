          Genesis 5:24 -- "And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God
          took him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Various are the pleas and arguments which men of corrupt minds
          frequently urge against yielding obedience to the just and holy
          commands of God. But, perhaps, one of the most common objections that
          they make is this, that our Lord's commands are not practicable,
          because contrary to flesh and blood; and consequently, that he is an
          hard master, reaping where he has not sown, and gathering where he has
          not strewed'. These we find were the sentiments entertained by that
          wicked and slothful servant mentioned in the 25th of St. Matthew; and
          are undoubtedly the same with many which are maintained in the present
          wicked and adulterous generation. The Holy Ghost foreseeing this, hath
          taken care to inspire holy men of old, to record the examples of many
          holy men and women; who, even under the Old Testament dispensation,
          were enabled cheerfully to take Christ's yoke upon them, and counted
          his service perfect freedom. The large catalogue of saints,
          confessors, and martyrs, drawn up in the 11th chapter to the Hebrews,
          abundantly evidences the truth of this observation. What a great cloud
          of witnesses have we there presented to our view? All eminent for
          their faith, but some shining with a greater degree of luster than do
          others. The proto-martyr Abel leads the van. And next to him we find
          Enoch mentioned, not only because he was next in order of time, but
          also on account of his exalted piety; he is spoken of in the words of
          the text in a very extraordinary manner. We have here a short but very
          full and glorious account, both of his behavior in this world, and the
          triumphant manner of his entry into the next. The former is contained
          in these words, And Enoch walked with God'. The latter in these, and
          he was not: for God took him'. He was not; that is, he was not found,
          he was not taken away in the common manner, he did not see death; for
          God had translated him. (Heb.11:5.) Who this Enoch was, does not
          appear so plainly. To me, he seems to have been a person of public
          character; I suppose, like Noah, a preacher of righteousness. And, if
          we may credit the apostle Jude, he was a flaming preacher. For he
          quotes one of his prophecies, wherein he saith, Behold, the Lord
          cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all,
          and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly
          deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard
          speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him'. But whether
          a public or private person, he has a noble testimony given him in the
          lively oracles. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews saith, that
          before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God';
          and his being translated, was a proof of it beyond all doubt. And I
          would observe, that it was wonderful wisdom in God to translate Enoch
          and Elijah under the Old Testament dispensation, that hereafter, when
          it should be asserted that the Lord Jesus was carried into heaven, it
          might not seem a thing altogether incredible to the Jews; since they
          themselves confessed that two of their own prophets had been
          translated several hundred hears before. But it is not my design to
          detain you any longer, by enlarging, or making observations, on
          Enoch's short but comprehensive character: the thing I have in view
          being to give a discourse, as the Lord shall enable, upon a weighty
          and a very important subject; I mean, walking with God. And Enoch
          walked with God.' If so much as this can be truly said of you and me
          after our decease, we shall not have any reason to complain that we
          have lived in vain.
        </p>
        <p>In handling my intended subject, I shall,</p>
        <p>
          First, Endeavor to show what is implied in these words, walked with
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I shall prescribe some means, upon the due observance of
          which, believers may keep up and maintain their walk with God. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Offer some motives to stir us up, if we never walked with God
          before, to come and walk with God now. The whole shall be closed with
          a word or two of application.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I am to show what is implied in these words, walked with God';
          or, in other words, what we are to understand by walking with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And First, walking with God implies, that the prevailing power of the
          enmity of a person's heart be taken away by the blessed Spirit of God.
          Perhaps it may seem a hard saying to some, but our own experience
          daily proves what the scriptures in many places assert, that the
          carnal mind, the mind of the unconverted natural man, nay, the mind of
          the regenerate, so far as any part of him remains unrenewed, is
          enmity, not only an enemy, but enmity itself, against God; so that it
          is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be. Indeed,
          one may well wonder that any creature, especially that lovely creature
          man, made after his Maker's own image, should ever have any enmity,
          much less a prevailing enmity, against that very God in whom he lives,
          and moves, and hath his being. But alas! so it is. Our first parents
          contracted it when they fell from God by eating the forbidden fruit,
          and the bitter and malignant contagion of it hath descended to, and
          quite overspread, their whole posterity. This enmity discovered itself
          in Adam's endeavoring to hide himself in the trees of the garden. When
          he heard the voice of the Lord God, instead of running with an open
          heart, saying Here I am; alas! he now wanted no communion with God;
          and still more discovered his lately contracted enmity, by the excuse
          he made to the Most High: The woman (or, this woman) thou gavest to be
          with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat'. By saying thus, he
          in effect lays all the fault upon God; as though he had said, If thou
          hadst not given me this woman, I had not sinned against thee, so thou
          mayest thank thyself for my transgression. In the same manner this
          enmity works in the hearts of Adam's children. They now and again find
          something rising against God, and saying even unto God, What doest
          thou? It scorns any meaner competitor (says the learned Dr. Owen, in
          his excellent treatise on indwelling sin) than God himself.' Its
          command is like that of the Assyrians in respect to Ahab -- shoot only
          at the king. And it strikes against every thing that has the
          appearance of real piety, as the Assyrians shot at Jehoshaphat in his
          royal clothes. But the opposition ceases when it finds that it is only
          an appearance, as the Assyrians left off shooting at Jehoshaphat, when
          they perceived it was not Ahab they were shooting at. This enmity
          discovered itself in accursed Cain; he hated and slew his brother
          Abel, because Abel loved, and was peculiarly favored by, his God. And
          this same enmity rules and prevails in every man that is naturally
          engendered of the offspring of Adam. Hence that a averseness to prayer
          and holy duties which we find in children, and very often in grown
          persons, who have notwithstanding been blessed with a religious
          education. And all that open sin and wickedness, which like a deluge
          has overflowed the world, are only so many streams running from this
          dreadful contagious fountain; I mean a enmity of man's desperately
          wicked and deceitful heart. He that cannot set his seal to this, knows
          nothing yet, in a saving manner, of the Holy Scriptures, or of the
          power of God. And all that do know this, will readily acknowledge,
          that before a person can be said to walk with God, the prevailing
          power of this heart-enmity must be destroyed: for persons do not use
          to walk and keep company together, who entertain an irreconcilable
          enmity and hatred against one another. Observe me, I say, the
          prevailing power of this enmity must be taken away; for the in-being
          of it will never be totally removed, till we bow down our heads, and
          give up the ghost. The apostle Paul, no doubt, speaks of himself, and
          that, too, not when he was a Pharisee, but a real Christian; when he
          complains, that when he would do good, evil was present with him'; not
          having dominion over him, but opposing and resisting his good
          intentions and actions, so that he could not do the things which he
          would, in that perfection which the new man desired. This is what he
          calls sin dwelling in him. And this is that phronhma sarko", which (to
          use the words of the ninth article of our church,) some do expound the
          wisdom, some sensuality, some the affectation, some the desire, of the
          flesh, which doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated.' But as
          for its prevailing power, it is destroyed in every soul that is truly
          born of God, and gradually more and more weakened as the believer
          grows in grace, and the Spirit of God gains a greater and greater
          ascendancy in the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Secondly, Walking with God not only implies, that the prevailing
          power of the enmity of a man's heart be taken away, but also that a
          person is actually reconciled to God the Father, in and through the
          all-sufficient righteousness and atonement of his dear Son. Can two
          walk together, (says Solomon, [actually Amos 3:3]) unless they are
          agreed?' Jesus is our peace as well as our peace-maker. When we are
          justified by faith in Christ, then, but not till then, we have peace
          with God; and consequently cannot be said till then to walk with him,
          walking with a person being a sign and token that we are friends to
          that person, or at least, though we have been at variance, yet that
          now we are reconciled and become friends again. This is the great
          errand that gospel ministers are sent out upon. To us is committed the
          ministry of reconciliation; as ambassadors for God, we are to beseech
          sinners, in Christ's stead, to be reconciled unto God, and when they
          comply with the gracious invitation, and are actually by faith brought
          into a state of reconciliation with God, then, and not till then, may
          they be said so much as to begin to walk with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, Thirdly, Walking with God implies a settled abiding communion
          and fellowship with God, or what in scripture is called, The Holy
          Ghost dwelling in us'. This is what our Lord promised when he told his
          disciples that the Holy Spirit would be in and with them'; not to be
          like wayfaring man, to say only for a night, but to reside and make
          his abode in their hearts. This, I am apt to believe, is what the
          apostle John would have us understand, when he talks of a person
          abiding in him, in Christ, and walking as he himself also walked'. And
          this is what is particularly meant in the words of our text. And Enoch
          walked with God', that is, he kept up and maintained a holy, settled,
          habitual, though undoubtedly not altogether uninterrupted communion
          and fellowship with God, in and through Christ Jesus. So that to sum
          up what has been said on this part of the first general head, walking
          with God consists especially in the fixed habitual bent of the will
          for God, in an habitual dependence upon his power and promise, in an
          habitual voluntary dedication of our all to his glory, in an habitual
          eyeing of his precept in all we do, and in an habitual complacence in
          his pleasure in all we suffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, walking with God implies our making progress or advances in
          the divine life. Walking, in the very first idea of the word, seems to
          suppose a progressive motion. A person that walks, though he move
          slowly, yet he goes forward, and does not continue in one place. And
          so it is with those that walk with God. They go on, as the Psalmist
          says, from strength to strength'; or, in the language of the apostle
          Paul, they pass from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord'.
          Indeed, in one sense, the divine life admits of neither increase nor
          decrease. When a soul is born of God, to all intents and purposes he
          is a child of God; and though he should live to the age of Methuselah,
          yet he would then be only a child of God after all. But in another
          sense, the divine life admits of decays and additions. Hence it is,
          that we find the people of God charged with backslidings and losing
          their first love. And hence it is that we hear of babes, young men,
          and fathers in Christ. And upon this account it is that the apostle
          exhorts Timothy, to let his progress be made known to all men'. And
          what is here required of Timothy in particular, by St. Peter is
          enjoined on all Christians in general. But grow in grace, (says he),
          and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'. For the new
          creature increases in spiritual stature; and though a person can but
          be a new creature, yet there are some that are more conformed to the
          divine image than others, and will after death be admitted to a
          greater degree of blessedness. For want of observing this distinction,
          even some gracious souls, that have better hearts than heads, (as well
          as men of corrupt minds, reprobates concerning the faith) have
          unawares run into downright Antinomian principles, denying all growth
          of grace in a believer, or any marks of grace to be laid down in the
          scriptures of truth. From such principles, and more especially from
          practices naturally consequent on such principles, may the Lord of all
          lords deliver us!
        </p>
        <p>
          From what then has been said, we may now know what is implied in the
          words, walked with God', viz. Our having the prevailing enmity of our
          hearts taken away by the power of the Spirit of God; our being
          actually reconciled and united to him by faith in Jesus Christ; our
          having and keeping up a settled communion and fellowship with him; and
          our making a daily progress in this fellowship, so as to be conformed
          to the divine image more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          How this is done, or, in other words, by what means believers keep up
          and maintain their walk with God, comes to be considered under our
          second general head.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, First, Believers keep up and maintain their walk with God by
          reading of his holy word. Search the scriptures', says our blessed
          Lord, for these are they that testify of me'. And the royal Psalmist
          tells us that God's word was a light unto his feet, and a lantern unto
          his paths'; and he makes it one property of a good man, that his
          delight is in the law of the Lord, and that he exercises himself
          therein day and night'. Give thyself to reading', (says Paul to
          Timothy); And this book of the law, (says God to Joshua) shall not go
          out of thy mouth'. For whatsoever was written aforetime was written
          for our learning. And the word of God is profitable for reproof, for
          correction, and for instruction in righteousness, and every way
          sufficient to make every true child of God thoroughly furnished unto
          every good work. If we once get above our Bibles, and cease making the
          written word of God our sole rule both as to faith and practice, we
          shall soon lie open to all manner of delusion, and be in great danger
          of making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. Our blessed Lord,
          though he had the Spirit of God without measure, yet always was
          governed by, and fought the devil with, It is written'. This the
          apostle calls the sword of the Spirit'. We may say of it, as David
          said of Goliath's sword, None like this'. The scriptures are called
          the lively oracles of God: not only because they are generally made
          use of to beget in us a new life, but also to keep up and increase it
          in the soul. The apostle Peter, in his second epistle, prefers it even
          to seeing Christ transfigured upon the mount. For after he had said,
          chap.1:18. This voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
          with him in the holy mount'; he adds, We have also a more sure word of
          prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light
          shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in
          your hearts': that is, till we shake off these bodies, and see Jesus
          face to face. Till then we must see and converse with him through the
          glass of his word. We must make his testimonies our counselors, and
          daily, with Mary, sit at Jesus' feet, by faith hearing his word. We
          shall then by happy experience find, that they are spirit and life,
          meat indeed and drink indeed, to our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Believers keep up and maintain their walk with God by secret
          prayer. The spirit of grace is always accompanied with the spirit of
          supplication. It is the very breath of the new creature, the fan of
          the divine life, whereby the spark of holy fire, kindled in the soul
          by God, is not only kept in, but raised into a flame. A neglect of
          secret prayer has been frequently an inlet to many spiritual diseases,
          and has been attended with fatal consequences. Origen observed, 'hat
          the day he offered incense to an idol, he went out of his closet
          without making use of secret prayer'' It is one of the most noble
          parts of the believers' spiritual armor. Praying always', says the
          apostle, with all manner of supplication.' Watch and pray', says our
          Lord, that ye enter not into temptation.' And he spake a parable, that
          his disciples should pray, and not faint. Not that our Lord would have
          us always upon our knees, or in our closets, to the neglect of our
          other relative duties. But he means, that our souls should be kept in
          a praying frame, so that we might be able to say, as a good man in
          Scotland once said to his friends on his death-bed, Could these
          curtains, or could these walls speak, they would tell you what sweet
          communion I have had with my God here'. O prayer! Prayer! It brings
          and keeps God and man together. It raises man up to God, and brings
          God down to man. If you would there, O believers, keep up your walk
          with God; pray, pray without ceasing. Be much in secret, set prayer.
          And when you are about the common business of life, be much in
          ejaculatory prayer, and send, from time to time, short letters post to
          heaven upon the wings of faith. They will reach the very heart of God,
          and return to you again loaded with spiritual blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Holy and frequent meditation is another blessed means of
          keeping up a believer's walk with God. Prayer, reading, temptation,
          and meditation', says Luther, make a minister.' And they also make and
          perfect a Christian. Meditation to the soul, is the same as digestion
          to the body. Holy David found it so, and therefore he was frequently
          employed in meditation, even in the night season. We read also of
          Isaac's going out into the fields to meditate in the evening; or, as
          it is in the margin, to pray. For meditation is a kind of silent
          prayer, whereby the soul is frequently as it were carried out of
          itself to God, and in a degree made like unto those blessed spirits,
          who by a kind of immediate intuition always behold the face of our
          heavenly Father. None but those happy souls that have been accustomed
          to this divine employ, can tell what a blessed promoter of the divine
          life, meditation is. Whilst I was musing', says David, the fire
          kindled.' And whilst the believer is musing on the works and word of
          God, especially that work of works, that wonder of wonders, that
          mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh', the Lamb of God
          slain for the sins of the world, he frequently feels the fire of
          divine love kindle, so that he is obliged to speak with his tongue,
          and tell of the loving-kindness of the Lord to his soul. Be frequent
          therefore in meditation, all ye that desire to keep up and maintain a
          close and uniform walk with the most high God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, Believers keep up their walk with God, by watching and
          noting his providential dealings with them. If we believe the
          scriptures, we must believe what our Lord hath declared therein, That
          the very hairs of his disciples' heads are all numbered; and that a
          sparrow does not fall to the ground, (either to pick up a grain of
          corn, or when shot by a fowler), without the knowledge of our heavenly
          Father'. Every cross has a call in it, and every particular
          dispensation of divine providence has some particular end to answer in
          those to whom it is sent. If it be of an afflictive nature, God does
          thereby say, My son, keep thyself from idols': if prosperous, he does,
          as it were by a small still voice, say, My son, give me thy heart'. If
          believers, therefore, would keep up their walk with God, they must
          from time to time hear what the Lord has to say concerning them in the
          voice of his providence. Thus we find that Abraham's servant, when he
          went to fetch a wife for his master Isaac, eyed and watched the
          providence of God, and by that means found out the person that was
          designed for his master's wife. For a little hint from providence',
          says pious Bishop Hall, is enough for faith to feed upon.' And as I
          believe it will be one part of our happiness in heaven, to take a view
          of, and look back upon, the various links of the golden chain which
          drew us there; so those that enjoy most of heaven below, I believe,
          will be the most minute in remarking God's various dealings with them,
          in respect to his providential dispensations here on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly, In order to walk closely with God, his children must not only
          watch the motions of God's providence without them, but the motions
          also of his blessed Spirit in their hearts. As many as are the sons of
          God, are led by the Spirit of God', and give up themselves to be
          guided by the Holy Ghost, as a little child gives its hand to be led
          by a nurse or parent. It is no doubt in this sense that we are to be
          converted, and become like little children. And though it is the
          quintessence of enthusiasm, to pretend to be guided by the Spirit
          without the written word; yet it is every Christian's bounden duty to
          be guided by the Spirit in conjunction with the written word of God.
          Watch, therefore, I pray you, O believers, the motions of God's
          blessed Spirit in your souls, and always try the suggestions or
          impressions that you may at any time feel, by the unerring rule of
          God's most holy word: and if they are not found to be agreeable to
          that, reject them as diabolical and delusive. By observing this
          caution, you will steer a middle course between the two dangerous
          extremes many of this generation are in danger of running into; I
          mean, enthusiasm, on the one hand, and deism, and downright
          infidelity, on the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixthly, They that would maintain a holy walk with God, must walk with
          him in ordinances as well as providences, etc. It is therefore
          recorded of Zachary and Elizabeth, that they walked in all God's
          ordinances, as well as commandments, blameless'. And all rightly
          informed Christians, will look upon ordinances, not as beggarly
          elements, but as so many conduit-pipes, whereby the infinitely
          condescending Jehovah conveys his grace to their souls. They will look
          upon them as children's bread, and as their highest privileges.
          Consequently they will be glad when they hear others say, Come, let us
          go up to the house of the Lord'. They will delight to visit the place
          where God's honor dwelleth, and be very eager to embrace all
          opportunities to show forth the Lord Christ's death till he come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventhly and Lastly, If you would walk with God, you will associate
          and keep company with those that do walk with him. My delight', says
          holy David, is in them that do excel' in virtue. They were, in his
          sight, the excellent ones of the earth. And the primitive Christians,
          no doubt, kept up their vigor and first love, by continuing in
          fellowship one with another. The apostle Paul knew this full well, and
          therefore exhorts the Christians to see to it, that they did not
          forsake the assembling of themselves together. For how can one be warm
          alone? And has not the wisest of men told us, that As iron sharpeneth
          iron, so doth the countenance of a man his friend?' If we look,
          therefore, into church history, or make a just observation of our own
          times, I believe we shall find, that as the power of God prevails,
          Christian societies, and fellowship meetings prevail proportionably.
          And as one decays, the other has insensibly decayed and dwindled away
          at the same time. So necessary is it for those that would walk with
          God, and keep up the life of religion, to meet together as they have
          opportunity, in order to provoke one another to love and good works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proceed we now to the third general thing proposed: to offer some
          motives to excite all to come and walk with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, First, walking with God is a very honorable thing. This generally
          is a prevailing motive to persons of all ranks, to stir them up to any
          important undertaking. O that it may have its due weight and influence
          with you in respect to the matter now before us! I suppose you would
          all think it a very high honor to be admitted into an earthly prince's
          privy council, to be trusted with his secrets, and to have his ear at
          all times and at all seasons. It seems Haman thought it so when he
          boasted, Esther 5:11, that besides his being advanced above the
          princes and servants of the king; yea, moreover, Esther the queen did
          let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had
          prepared, but myself; and to-morrow am I invited unto her also with
          the king'. And when afterwards a question was put to this same Haman,
          Chap.6:6. What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to
          honor?' he answered, verse 8. Let the royal apparel be brought which
          the king used to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and
          the crown royal which is set upon his head; and let this apparel and
          horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble
          princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth
          to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city
          and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the
          king delighteth to honor.' This was all, then, it seems, that an
          ambitious Haman could ask, and the most valuable thing that he thought
          Ahasuerus, the greatest monarch upon earth, could give. But, alas,
          what is this honor in comparison of that which the meanest of those
          enjoy, that walk with God! Think ye it a small thing, sirs, to have
          the secret of the Lord of lords with you, and to be called the friends
          of God? And such honor have all God's saints. The secret of the Lord
          is with them that fear him: and Henceforth(says the blessed Jesus)
          call I you no longer servants, but friends; for the servant knoweth
          not the will of his master'. Whatever you may think of it, holy David
          was so sensible of the honor attending a walk with God that he
          declares, he had rather be a door-keeper in his house, than to dwell
          even in the tents of ungodliness'. O that all were like-minded with
          him!
        </p>
        <p>
          But, Secondly, As it is an honorable, so it is a pleasing thing, to
          walk with God. The wisest of men has told us, that wisdom's ways are
          ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace'. And I remember pious
          Mr. Henry, when he was about to expire, said to a friend, You have
          heard many men's dying words, and these are mine: A life spent in
          communion with God, is the pleasantest life in the world'. I am sure I
          can set to my seal that this is true. Indeed, I have been listed under
          Jesus' banner only for a few years; but I have enjoyed more solid
          pleasure in one moment's communion with my god, than I should or could
          have enjoyed in the ways of sin, though I had continued to have gone
          on in them for thousands of years. And may I not appeal to all you
          that fear and walk with God, for the truth of this? Has not one day in
          the Lord's courts been better to you than a thousand? In keeping God's
          commandments, have you not found a present, and very great reward? Has
          not his word been sweeter to you than the honey or the honeycomb? O
          what have you felt, when, Jacob-like, you have been wrestling with
          your God? Has not Jesus often met you when meditating in the fields,
          and been made known to you over and over again in breaking of bread?
          Has not the Holy Ghost frequently shed the divine love abroad in your
          hearts abundantly, and filled you with joy unspeakable, even joy that
          is full of glory? I know you will answer all these questions in the
          affirmative, and freely acknowledge the yoke of Christ to be easy, and
          his burden light; or (to use the words of one of our collects), His
          service is perfect freedom'. And what need we then any further motive
          to excite us to walk with God?
        </p>
        <p>
          But methinks I hear some among you say, How can these things be? For,
          if walking with God, as you say, is such an honorable and pleasant
          thing, whence is it that the name of the people of this way is cast
          out as evil, and every where spoken against? How comes it to pass that
          they are frequently afflicted, tempted, destitute, and tormented? Is
          this the honor, this the pleasure, that you speak of?' I answer, Yes.
          Stop a while; be not over hasty. Judge not according to appearance,
          but judge righteous judgment, and all will be well. It is true, we
          acknowledge the people of this way', as you, and Paul before you, when
          a persecutor, called them, have their names cast out as evil, and are
          a sect every where spoken against. But by whom? Even by the enemies of
          the most high God. And do you think it is disgrace to be spoken evil
          of by them? Blessed be God, we have not so learned Christ. Our royal
          Master has pronounced those blessed, who are persecuted, and have all
          manner of evil spoken against them falsely'. He has commanded them to
          rejoice and be exceeding glad', for it is the privilege of their
          discipleship, and that their reward will be great in heaven. He
          himself was thus treated. And can there be a greater honor put upon a
          creature, than to be conformed to the ever-blessed Son of God? And
          further, it is equally true that the people of this way are frequently
          afflicted, tempted, destitute, and tormented. But what of all this?
          Does this destroy the pleasure of walking with God? No, in no wise;
          for those that walk with God are enabled, through Christ strengthening
          them, to joy even in tribulation, and to rejoice when they fall into
          divers temptations. And I believe I may appeal to the experience of
          all true and close walkers with God, whether or not their suffering
          times have not frequently been their sweetest times, and that they
          enjoyed most of God when most cast out and despised by men? This we
          find was the case of Christ's primitive servants, when threatened by
          the Jewish sanhedrin, and commanded to preach no more in the name of
          Jesus; they rejoiced that they were accounted worthy to suffer shame
          for the sake of Jesus. Paul and Silas sang praises even in a dungeon;
          and the face of Stephen, that glorious proto-martyr of the Christian
          church, shone like the face of an angel. And Jesus is the same now as
          he was then, and takes care so to sweeten sufferings and afflictions
          with his love, that his disciples find, by happy experience, that as
          afflictions abound, consolations do much more abound. And therefore
          these objections, instead of destroying, do only enforce the motives
          before urged, to excite you to walk with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But supposing the objections were just, and walkers with God were as
          despicable and unhappy as you would represent them to be; yet I have a
          third motive to offer, which if weighed in the balance of the
          sanctuary, will over-weigh all objections, viz. That there is a heaven
          at the end of this walk. For, to use the words of pious bishop
          Beveridge, Though the way be narrow, yet it is not long: and though
          the gate be strait, yet it opens into everlasting life'. Enoch found
          it so. He walked with God on earth, and God took him to sit down with
          him for ever in the kingdom of heaven. Not that we are to expect to be
          taken away as he was: no, I suppose we shall all die the common death
          of all men. But after death, the spirits of those who have walked with
          God shall return to God that gave them; and at the morning of the
          resurrection, soul and body shall be for ever with the Lord; their
          bodies shall be fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body, and their
          souls filled with all the fullness of God. They shall sit on thrones;
          they shall judge angels. They shall be enabled to sustain an exceeding
          and eternal weight of glory, even that glory which Jesus Christ
          enjoyed with the Father before the world began. O gloriam quantam et
          qualem', said the learned and pious Arndt, just before he bowed down
          his head, and gave up the ghost. The very thought of it is enough to
          make us wish to leap our seventy years', as good Dr. Watts expresses
          himself, and to make us break out into the earnest language of the
          royal Psalmist, My soul is athirst for God, yea, for the living God.
          When shall I come to appear in the presence of my God?' I wonder not
          that a sense of this, when under a more than ordinary irradiation and
          influx of divine life and love, causes some persons to faint away, and
          even for a time lose the power of their senses. A less sight than
          this, even the sight of Solomon's glory, made Sheba's queen
          astonished; and a still lesser sight than that, even a sight of
          Joseph's wagons, made holy Jacob faint, and for a while, as it were,
          die away. Daniel, when admitted to a distant view of this excellent
          glory, fell down at the feet of the angel as one dead. And if a
          distant view of this glory be so excellent, what must the actual
          possession of it be? If the first fruits are so glorious, how
          infinitely must the harvest exceed in glory?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, what shall I, or, indeed, what can I well say more to excite
          you, even you that are yet strangers to Christ, to come and walk with
          God? If you love honor, pleasure, and a crown of glory, come, seek it
          where alone it can be found. Come, put ye on the Lord Jesus. Come,
          haste ye away and walk with God, and make no longer provision for the
          flesh, to fulfill the lust thereof. Stop, stop, O sinner! Turn ye,
          turn ye, O ye unconverted men, for the end of that way you are now
          walking in, however right it may seem in your blinded eyes, will be
          death, even eternal destruction both of body and soul. Make no longer
          tarrying, I say: at your peril I charge you, step not one step further
          on in your present walk. For how knowest thou, O man, but the next
          step thou takest may be into hell? Death may seize thee, judgment find
          thee, and then the great gulf will be fixed between thee and endless
          glory for ever and ever. O think of these things, all ye that are
          unwilling to walk with God. Lay them to heart. Show yourselves men,
          and in the strength of Jesus say, Farewell, lust of the flesh, I will
          no more walk with thee! Farewell, lust of the eye, and pride of life!
          Farewell, carnal acquaintance and enemies of the cross, I will no more
          walk and be intimate with you! Welcome Jesus, welcome thy word,
          welcome thy ordinances, welcome thy Spirit, welcome thy people, I will
          henceforth walk with you. O that there may be in you such a mind! God
          will set his almighty fiat to it, and seal it with the broad seal of
          heaven, even the signet of his holy Spirit. Yes, he will, though you
          have been walking with, and following after, the devices and desires
          of your desperately wicked hearts ever since you have been born. I,
          the high and lofty One', says the great Jehovah, that inhabiteth
          eternity, will dwell with the humble and contrite heart, even with the
          man that trembleth at my word.' The blood, even the precious blood of
          Jesus Christ, if you come to the Father in and through him, shall
          cleanse you from all sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the text leads me to speak to you that are saints as well as to
          you that are open and unconverted sinners. I need not tell you, that
          walking with God is not honorable, but pleasant and profitable also;
          for ye know it by happy experience, and will find it more and more so
          every day. Only give me leave to stir up your pure minds by way of
          remembrance, and to beseech you by the mercies of God in Christ Jesus,
          to take heed to yourselves, and walk closer with your God than you
          have in days past: for the nearer you walk with God, the more you will
          enjoy of him whose presence is life, and be the better prepared for
          being placed at his right hand, where are pleasures for evermore. O do
          not follow Jesus afar off! O be not so formal, so dead and stupid in
          your attendance on holy ordinances! Do not so shamefully forsake the
          assembling yourselves together, or be so niggardly or indifferent
          about the things of God. Remember what Jesus says of the church of
          Laodicea, Because thou art neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out
          of my mouth'. Think of the love of Jesus, and let that love constrain
          you to keep near unto him; and though you die for him, do not deny
          him, do not keep at a distance from him in any wise.
        </p>
        <p>
          One word to my brethren in the ministry that are here present, and I
          have done. You see, my brethren, my heart is full; I could almost say
          it is too big to speak, and yet too big to be silent, without dropping
          a word to you. For does not the text speak in a particular manner to
          those who have the honor of being styled the ambassadors of Christ,
          and stewards of the mysteries of God. I observed at the beginning of
          this discourse, that Enoch in all probability was a public person, and
          a flaming preacher. Though he be dead, does he not yet speak to us, to
          quicken our zeal, and make us more active in the service of our
          glorious and ever-blessed Master? How did Enoch preach! How did Enoch
          walk with God, though he lived in a wicked and adulterous generation!
          Let us then follow him, as he followed Jesus Christ, and ere long,
          where he is there shall we be also. He is not entered into his rest:
          yet a little while and we shall enter into ours, and that too much
          sooner than he did. He sojourned here below three hundred years; but
          blessed be God, the days of man are now shortened, and in a few days
          our walk will be over. The Judge is before the door: he that cometh
          will come, and will not tarry: his reward is with him. And we shall
          all (if we are zealous for the Lord of hosts) ere long shine as the
          stars in the firmament, in the kingdom of our heavenly Father, for
          ever and ever. To Him, the blessed Jesus, and eternal Spirit, be all
          honor and glory, now, and to all eternity. Amen, and Amen.<br />
