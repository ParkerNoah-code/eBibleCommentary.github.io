        <p>Luke 10:42 -- "But one thing is needful."</p>
        <p>
          It was the amiable character of our blessed Redeemer, that "he went
          about doing good," this great motive, which animated all his actions,
          brought him to the house of his friend Lazarus, at Bethany, and
          directed his behavior there. Though it was a season of recess from
          public labor, our Lord brought the sentiments and the pious cares of a
          preacher of righteousness into the parlor of a friend; and there his
          doctrine dropped as the rain, and distilled as the dew, as the little
          happy circle that were then surrounding him. Mary, the sister of
          Lazarus, with great delight made one amongst them; she seated herself
          at the feet of Jesus, in the posture of an humble disciple; and we
          have a great deal of reason to believe, that Martha, his other sister,
          would gladly have been with her there; but domestic cares pressed hard
          upon her, and "she was cumbered with much serving," being, perhaps,
          too solicitous to prepare a sumptuous entertainment for her heavenly
          master and the train that attended him. Happy are they, who in a crowd
          of business do not lose something of the spirituality of their minds,
          and of the composure and sweetness of their tempers. This good woman
          comes to our Lord with too impatient a complaint; insinuating some
          little reflection, not only on Mary, but on himself too. "Lord, dost
          thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her,
          therefore, that she help me." Our Lord, willing to take all
          opportunities of suggesting useful thoughts, answers her in these
          words, of which the text is a part, "Martha, Martha, thou art careful
          and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful; and Mary,
          has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
          Alas, Martha! The concerns of the soul are of so much greater
          importance than those of the body, that I cannot blame your sister on
          this occasion: I rather recommend her to your imitation, and caution
          you, and all my other friends, to be much on your guard, that in the
          midst of your worldly cares, you do not lose sight of what much better
          deserves your attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall consider these words, "One thing is needful," as a kind of
          aphorism, or wise and weighty sentence, which dropped from the mouth
          of our blessed Redeemer, and is evidently worthy of our most serious
          regard. I shall,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Consider what we are to understand by "The one thing" here spoken
          of.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Show you what is intended, when it is said to be the one thing
          needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I will show how justly it may be so represented, or prove that it
          is, indeed, the one thing needful. And then conclude with some
          reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends, the words which are now before us, are to this day, as
          true, as they were seventeen hundred years ago. Set your hearts to
          attend to them. O that you may, by divine grace, be awakened to hear
          them with a due regard, and be so impressed with the plain and serious
          things which are now to be spoken, as you probably would, if I were
          speaking by your dying beds, and you had the near and lively view of
          eternity!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I am to consider, what we are to understand by the "one thing
          needful."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in a few words, it is the "Care of the soul," opposed, as you see
          in the text, to the care, the excessive care of the body; to which
          Martha was gently admonished by our Lord. This is a general answer,
          and it comprehends a variety of important particulars, which is the
          business of our ministry often to open to you at large: The care of
          the soul, implies a readiness to hear the words of Christ, to seat
          ourselves with Mary at his feet, and to receive both the law and the
          gospel from his mouth. It supposes, that we learn from this divine
          teacher the worth of our souls, their danger, and their remedy; and
          that we become above all things solicitous about their salvation.
          That, heartily repenting of all our sins, and cordially believing the
          everlasting gospel, we receive the Lord Jesus Christ for righteousness
          and life, resting our souls on the value of his atonement, and the
          efficacy of his grace. It imports, the sincere dedication of ourselves
          to the service of God, and a faithful adherence to it, notwithstanding
          all oppositions arising from inward corruptions, or outward
          temptations; and a resolute perseverance in the way of gospel
          dependence, till we receive the end of our faith in our complete
          salvation. This is the "one thing needful," represented indeed in
          various scriptures by various names. Sometimes it is called
          "Regeneration," or "the new creature," because it is the blessed work
          of God's efficacious grace. Sometimes the "Fear of God," and sometimes
          "his love, and the keeping his commandments;" and very frequently in
          the new testament it is called "faith," or "receiving Christ, and
          believing on him," which therefore is represented as the "great work
          of God," John 6:20 the great thing which God in his glorious gospel
          requires, as well as by his spirit produces in us: each of these, if
          rightly understood and explained, comprehends all that I have said on
          this head. On the whole, we may say, that, as the body is one, though
          it has many members, and the soul is one, though it has many
          faculties, so in the present case, this real vital religion is "one
          thing," one sacred principle of divine life, bringing us to attend to
          the care of our souls, as of our greatest treasure. It is one thing,
          notwithstanding all the variety of views in which it may be
          considered, and of characters under which it may be described. I
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, To consider what may be intended in the representation which
          is here made of it, as the "one thing needful."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I think it naturally includes these three particulars: it is a
          matter of universal concern; of the highest importance; and of so
          comprehensive a nature, that every thing which is truly worthy of our
          regard, may be considered as included in, or subservient to it. Let me
          a little illustrate each of these particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The care of the soul may be called the "one thing needful," as it
          is matter of universal concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord, you see, speaks of it as needful in the general. He says
          not, for this or that particular person; or for those of such an age,
          station, or circumstance in life, but needful for all. And indeed,
          when discoursing on such a subject, one might properly introduce it
          with those solemn words of the psalmist, "Give ear, all ye people,
          hear, all ye inhabitants of the earth, both high and low, rich and
          poor, together," Psalm 49:1, 2. For it is the concern of all, from the
          king that sits upon the throne, to the servant that grindeth at the
          mill, or the beggar that lieth upon the dunghill. It is needful for us
          that are ministers, for our own salvation is concerned: and woe,
          insupportable woe will be to our souls, if we think it enough to
          recommend it to others, and to talk of it in a warm, or an awful
          manner, in public assemblies, or in our private converse, while it
          does not penetrate our hearts, as our own greatest care. Our case will
          then be like that of the Israelitish lord in Samaria, 2 Kings 7:2, who
          was employed to distribute the corn when the siege was raised; though
          we see it with our eyes, and dispense it with our hands, we shall
          ourselves die miserably, without tasting the blessings we impart. It
          is needful to all you that are our hearers, without the exception of
          one single person. It is needful to you that are rich, though it may
          on some accounts be peculiarly difficult for you, even as difficult,
          comparatively speaking, as for a "Camel to go through the eye of a
          needle," Mat.19:24, yet if it be neglected, you are poor in the midst
          of all your wealth, and miserable in all your abundance; a wretch
          starving for hunger, in a magnificent palace and a rich dress, would
          be less the object of compassion than you. It is needful for you that
          are poor; though you are distressed with so many anxious cares, "what
          you shall eat, and what you shall drink, and wherewithal you shall be
          clothed." Matt.6:31. The nature that makes you capable of such
          anxieties as these, argues your much greater concern in the "bread
          which endures to eternal life," John 6:27, than in that by which this
          mortal body must be supported. It is needful for you that are advanced
          in years; though your strength be impaired so that the "grasshopper is
          a burthen," Eccl.12:5, and though you have by your long continuance in
          sin, rendered this great work so hard, that were it less important,
          one would in pity let you alone without reminding you of it; yes, late
          as it is, it must be done, or your hoary heads will be brought down to
          the grave with wrath, and sink under a curse aggravated by every year
          and by every day of your lives. It is needful to you that are young,
          though solicited by so many gay vanities, to neglect it, though it may
          be represented as an unseasonable care at present, yet I repeat it, it
          is needful to you; immediately needful, unless you who walk so
          frequently over the dust of your brethren and companions, that died in
          the bloom and vigor of their days, have made some secret covenant with
          the grave for yourselves, and found out some wonderful method,
          hitherto unknown, or securing this precarious life, and of answering
          for days and months to come, while others cannot answer for one single
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The care of the soul is "a matter of the highest importance;"
          beyond any thing which can be brought into comparison with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Solomon says of wisdom, that "it is more precious than rubies, and
          that all things which can be desired are not to be compared with her,"
          Prov.3:15. So I may properly say of this great and most important
          branch of wisdom; whatever can be laid in the balance wit it, will be
          found altogether lighter than vanity. This is strongly implied when it
          is said in the text, "one thing is needful;" one thing, and one thing
          alone is so. Just as the blessed God is said to be "only wise," 1
          Tim.1:17, and "only holy," Rev.15:4. Because the wisdom and holiness
          of angels and men is as nothing, when compared with his. What seems
          most great and most important in life, what kings and senates, what
          the wisest and greatest of this world are employing their time, their
          councils, their pens, their labors upon, are trifles, when compared
          with this one thing. A man may subsist, he may in some considerable
          measure be happy, without learning, without riches, without titles,
          without health, without liberty, without friends, nay, though "the
          life be more than meat, and the body than raiment," Matt.6:25, yet may
          he be happy, unspeakably happy, without the body itself. But he cannot
          be so, in the neglect of the one thing needful. I must therefore
          bespeak your regard to it in the words of Moses, "it is not a light
          thing, but it is your life," Deut.32:47.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The care of the soul is of so comprehensive a nature, that "every
          thing truly worthy of our regard may be considered as included in it,
          or subservient to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As David observes, that "the commandment of God is exceeding broad,"
          Psalm 119:96, so we may say of this one thing needful; or as Solomon
          very justly and emphatically expresses it, "to fear God and to keep
          his commandments is the whole duty of man," Eccl.12:13. His whole
          duty, and his whole interest; and every thing which is wise and
          rational does in its proper place and connection make a part of it. We
          should judge very ill concerning the nature of this care, if we
          imagined, that it consisted merely in acts of devotion, or religious
          contemplation; it comprehends all the lovely and harmonious band of
          social and human virtues. It requires a care of society, a care of our
          bodies, and of our temporal concerns; but then all is to be regulated,
          directed, and animated by proper regards to God, Christ, and
          immortality. Our food and our rest, our trades and our labors, are to
          be attended to, and all the offices of humanity performed in obedience
          to the will of God, for the glory of Christ, and in a view of
          improving the mind in a growing meekness for a state of complete
          perfection. Name anything which has not reference at all to his, and
          you name a worthless trifle, however it may be gilded to allure the
          eye, or however it may be sweetened to gratify the taste. Name a
          thing, which, instead of thus improving the soul, has a tendency to
          debase and pollute, to enslave and endanger it, and you name what is
          most unprofitable and mischievous, be the wages of iniquity ever so
          great; most foul and deformed, be it in the eyes of men ever so
          honorable, or in their customs ever so fashionable. Thus I have
          endeavored to show you what we may suppose implied in the expression
          of "one thing being needful." I am now,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, To show you with how much propriety the care of the soul may
          be represented under this character, as the one thing needful, or as a
          matter of universal and most serious concern, to which every thing
          else is to be considered as subservient, if at all worthy of our care
          and pursuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          There let me appeal to the sentiments of those who must be allowed
          most capable of judging, and to the evident reason of the case itself,
          as it must appear to every unprejudiced mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Let me argue "from the opinions of those who must be allowed most
          capable of judging in such an affair," and we shall quickly see that
          the care of the soul appears to them, the one thing needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is the judgment of the blessed God "according to truth," how evidently
          and how solemnly is that judgment declared? I will not say merely in
          this or the other particular passage of his word, but in the whole
          series of his revelations to the children of men, and the whole tenor
          of his addresses to them. Is not this the language of all, from the
          early days of Job and Moses to the conclusion of the canon of
          scripture. Job 28:21, 23, 28, "If wisdom be hid from the eyes of all
          the living, surely God understandeth the way thereof, he knoweth the
          place thereof;" and if he does, it is plainly pointed out, for "unto
          man he still saith, behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and
          to depart from evil, that is understanding." By Moses he declared to
          the Israelites, that "to do the commandments of the Lord would be
          their wisdom and their understanding in the sight of the nations, who
          should hear his statutes, and say, surely this is a wise and an
          understanding people," Deut.4:6. When he had raised up one man on the
          throne of Israel, with the character of the wisest that ever lived
          upon the face of the earth, he chose to make him eminently a teacher
          of this great truth. And though now all that he spoke on the curious
          and less concerning subjects of natural philosophy is lost, "though he
          spoke of trees from the cedar to the hyssop, and of beasts, and of
          fowls, and of creeping things, and of fishes," 1 Kings 4:33, that
          saying is preserved in which he testifies, that "the fear of the Lord
          is the beginning of wisdom," Prov.1:7, 9, 10, and those Proverbs, in
          almost every line of which, they who neglect God and their own souls,
          are spoken of as fools, as if that were the most proper signification
          of the word, while the religious alone are honored with the title of
          wise. But in this respect, as attesting this truth in the name of God
          and in his own, "a greater than Solomon is here."
        </p>
        <p>
          For if we inquire what it was that our Lord Jesus Christ judged to be
          the one thing needful, the words of the text contain as full an answer
          as can be imagined; and the sense of them is repeated in a very lively
          and emphatical manner, in that remarkable passage wherein our Lord not
          only declares his own judgment, but seems to appeal to the conscience
          of all, as obliged by their own secret convictions to subscribe to the
          truth of it. "What is a man profited, is he gain the whole world, and
          lost his own soul; or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
          Matt.16:26. If it were once lost, what would he not be willing to give
          to redeem it? But it depends not on the words of Christ alone. Let his
          actions, his sufferings, his blood, his death, speak what a value he
          set on the souls of men. Is it to be imagined, that he would have
          relinquished heaven, have dwelt upon earth, have labored by night and
          by day, and at last have expired on the cross, for a matter of light
          importance? Or can we think that he, in whom "dwell all the treasures
          of wisdom and knowledge, and all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,"
          Coloss.2:3, 9, was mistaken in judgment so deliberately formed, and so
          solemnly declared?
        </p>
        <p>
          If after this, there were room to mention human judgment and
          testimonies, how easy would it be to produce a cloud of witnesses in
          such a cause, and to show that the wisest and best of men in all ages
          of the world have agreed in this point, that amidst all the
          diversities of opinion and profession, which succeeding generations
          have produced, this has been the unanimous judgment, this the common
          and most solicitous care of those whose characters are most truly
          valuable, to secure the salvation of their own souls, and to promote
          the salvation of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let me beseech you seriously to reflect, what are the characters
          of those who have taken the liberty, most boldly and freely to declare
          their judgment on the contrary side? The number of such is
          comparatively few; and when you compare what you have observed of
          their temper and conduct, I will not say with what you read of holy
          men of old, but with what you have yourselves seen in the faithful,
          active, and zealous servants of Christ, in these latter ages, with
          whom you have conversed; do you on the whole find, that the rejecters
          and deriders of the gospel, are in other respects so much more prudent
          and judicious, so much wiser for themselves, and for others, that are
          influenced by them, as that you can be in reason obliged to pay any
          great deference to the authority of a few such names as these, in
          opposition to those to whom they are here opposed?
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will say, and you will say it too truly, Though but a few may
          venture in words to declare for the neglect of the soul and its
          eternal interest, that the greater part of mankind do it in their
          actions. But are the greater part of mankind so wise, and so good, as
          implicitly to be followed in matters of the highest importance? And do
          not multitudes of these declare themselves on the other side, in their
          most serious moments? When the intoxications of worldly business and
          pleasures are over, and some languishing sickness forces men to
          solitude and retirement; what have you generally observed to be the
          affect of such a circumstance? Have they not then declared themselves
          convinced of the truth we are now laboring to establish? Nay, do we
          not sometimes see, that a distemper which seizes the mind with
          violence, yet does not utterly destroy its reasoning faculties, fixes
          this conviction on the soul in a few hours, nay, sometimes in a few
          moments? Have you never seen a gay, thoughtless creature, surprised in
          the giddy round of pleasures and amusements, and presently brought not
          only to seriousness, but terror and trembling, by the near views of
          death? Have you never seen the man of business and care interrupted,
          like the rich fool in the parable, in the midst of his schemes for the
          present world? And have you not heard one and the other of them owning
          the vanity of those pleasures and cares, which but a few days ago were
          every thing to them? Confessing that religion was the one thing
          needful, and recommending it to others with an earnestness, as if they
          hoped thereby to atone for their own former neglect? We that are
          ministers, frequently are witnesses to such things as these, and I
          believe few of our hearers are entire strangers to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, what if to the testimony of the dying, we could add that of
          the dead? What if God were to turn aside the veil between us and the
          invisible world, and permit the most careless sinner in the assembly
          to converse for a few moments with the inhabitants of it? If you were
          to apply yourself to a happy Spirit, that trod the most thorny road to
          paradise, or passed through the most fiery trial, and to ask him, "was
          it worth your while to labor so much, and to endure so much for what
          you now possess?" Surely if the blessed in heaven were capable of
          indignation, it would move them to hear that it should be made a
          question. And, on the other hand, if you could inquire of one
          tormented in that flame below, though he might once be "clothed in
          purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day," Luke 16:19. If
          you could ask him, "whether his former enjoyments were an equivalent
          for his present sufferings and despair?" What answer do you suppose he
          would return? Perhaps an answer of so much horror and rage, as you
          would not be able so much as to endure. Or if the malignity of his
          nature should prevent him from returning any answer at all, surely
          there would be a language even in that silence, a language in the
          darkness, and flames, and groans of that infernal prison, which would
          speak to your very soul what the word of God is with equal certainty,
          though less forcible conviction, speaking to your ear, that "one thing
          is needful." You see it is so in the judgment of God the Father, and
          the Lord Jesus Christ, of the wisest and best of men, of many, who
          seemed to judge most differently of it, when they come to more
          deliberate and serious thought, and not only of the dying, but of the
          dead too, of those who have experimentally known both worlds, and most
          surely know what is to be preferred. But I will not rest the whole
          argument here; therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I appeal to the evident reason of the case itself, as it must
          appear to every unprejudiced mind, that the care of the soul is indeed
          the one thing needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still consider myself as speaking not to atheists, or to deists, but
          to those who not only believe the existence and providence of God, and
          a future state of happiness and misery, but likewise who credit the
          truth of the Christian revelation, as many undoubtedly do, who live in
          a fatal neglect of God, and their own souls. Now on these principles,
          a little reflection may be sufficient to convince you, that it is
          needful to the present repose of your own mind; needful, if ever you
          would secure eternal happiness, and avoid eternal misery, which will
          be aggravated, rather than alleviated by all your present enjoyments.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The care of the soul is the one thing needful, because, "without it
          you cannot secure the peace of your own mind, nor avoid the
          upbraidings of your conscience."
        </p>
        <p>
          That noble faculty is indeed the vicegerent of God in the soul. It is
          sensible of the dignity and worth of an immortal spirit, and will
          sometimes cry out of the violence that is offered to it, and cry so
          loud, as to compel the sinner to hear, whether he will or not. Do you
          not sometimes find it yourselves? When you labor most to forget the
          concerns of your soul, do they not sometimes force themselves on your
          remembrance? You are afraid of the reflections of your own mind, but
          with all your artifice and all your resolution can you entirely avoid
          them? Does not conscience follow you to your beds, even if denied the
          opportunity of meeting you in your closets, and, though with an
          unwelcome voice, there warn you, "that your soul is neglected, and
          will quickly be lost." Does it not follow you to your shops and your
          fields, when you are busiest there? Nay, I will add, does it not
          sometimes follow you to the feast, to the club, to the dance, and
          perhaps, amidst all resistance, to the theater too? Does, it not
          sometimes mingle your sweetest draughts with wormwood, and your gayest
          scenes with horror? So that you are like a tradesman, who, suspecting
          his affairs to be in a bad posture, lays by his books and his papers,
          yet sometimes they will come accidentally in his way. He hardly dares
          to look abroad for fear of meeting a creditor or an arrest: and if he
          labors to forget his cares and his dangers, in a course of luxury at
          home, the remembrance is sometimes awakened, and the alarm increased,
          by those very extravagancies in which he is attempting to lose it.
          Such probably is the case of your minds, and it is a very painful
          state; and while things are thus within, external circumstances can no
          more make you happy, than a fine dress could relieve you under a
          violent fit of the stone. Whereas, if this great affair were secured,
          you might delight in reflection, as much as you now dread it; and
          conscience, of your bitterest enemy, would become a delightful friend,
          and the testimony of it your greatest rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The care of the soul is the one thing needful, "because without
          this your eternal happiness will be lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          A crown of everlasting glory is not surely such a trifle as to be
          thrown away on a careless creature, that will not in good earnest
          pursue it. God doth not ordinarily deal thus, even with the bounties
          of his common providence, which are comparatively of little value. As
          to these, the hand of the diligent generally makes rich, and he would
          be thought distracted, rather than prudent, who should expect to get
          an estate merely by wishing for it, or without some resolute and
          continued application to a proper course of action for that purpose.
          Now, that we may not foolishly dream of obtaining heaven, in the midst
          of a course of indolence and sloth; we are expressly told in the word
          of God, that "the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent
          take it by force," Matt.11:12, and are therefore exhorted to "strive,"
          with the greatest intenseness, and eagerness of mind, as the word
          properly signifies, "to enter in at the strait gate," for this great
          and important reason, "because many shall another day seek to enter
          in, and shall not be able," Luke 13:24. Nay, when our Lord makes the
          most gracious promises to the humble petitioner, he does it in such a
          manner as to exclude the hopes of those who are careless and
          indifferent. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall
          find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you, Matt.7:7. If, therefore,
          you do not ask, seek, and knock, the door of mercy will not be opened,
          and eternal happiness will be lost. Not that heaven is to be obtained
          by our own good works: no, no; for having done all, we must account
          ourselves unprofitable servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          And surely if I could say no more as to the fatal consequences of your
          neglect, than this, that eternal happiness will be lost, I should say
          enough to impress every mind, that considers what eternity means. To
          fall into a state of everlasting forgetfulness, might indeed appear a
          refuge to a mind filled with the apprehension of future misery. But O
          how dreadful a refuge is it! Surely it is such a refuge, as a vast
          precipice, (from which a man falling would be dashed to pieces in a
          moment) might appear to a person, pursued by the officers of justice,
          that he might be brought out to a painful and lingering execution. If
          an extravagant youth would have reason to look round with anguish, on
          some fair and ample paternal inheritance, which he had sold or
          forfeited merely for the riot of a few days: how much more melancholy
          would it be for a rational mind to think that its eternal happiness is
          lost for any earthly consideration whatever? Tormenting thought! "Had
          I attended to that one thing which I have neglected, I might have
          been, through the grace of God in Christ Jesus, great and happy beyond
          expression, beyond conception: not merely for the little span of ten
          thousand thousand ages, for ever. A line reaching even to the remotest
          star would not have been able to contain the number of ages, nor would
          millions of years have been sufficient to figure them down; this is
          eternity, but I have lost it, and am now on the verge of being. This
          lamp, which might have outlasted those of the firmament, will
          presently be extinguished, and I blotted out from amongst the works of
          God, and cut off from all the bounties of his hand." Would not this be
          a very miserable case, if this were all? And would it not be
          sufficient to prove this to be the better part, which, as our Lord
          observes, can "never be taken away?" But God forbid that we should be
          so unfaithful to him, and to the souls of men, as to rest in such a
          representation alone. I therefore add once more,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The care of the soul is the one thing needful, because "without it,
          you cannot avoid a state of eternal misery, which will be aggravated,
          rather than alleviated by all your present enjoyments."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing can be more evident from the word of the God of truth. It
          there plainly appears to be a determined case, which leaves no room
          for a more favorable conjecture or hope. "The wicked shall be turned
          into hell, even all the nations that forget God," Psalm 9:17. "They
          shall go away into everlasting punishment, Matt.25:46, into a state
          where they shall in vain seek death, and death shall flee from them.
          Oh! brethren, it is a certain, but an awful truth, that your souls
          will be thinking and immortal beings, even in spite of themselves.
          They may indeed torment, but they cannot destroy themselves. They can
          no more suspend their power of thought and perception, than a mirror
          its property of reflecting rays that fall off its surface. Do you
          suspect the contrary? Make the trial immediately. Command your minds
          to create from thinking but for one quarter of an hour, or for half
          that time, and exclude every idea and every reflection. Can you
          succeed in that attempt? Or rather, does not thought press in with a
          more sensible violence on that resistance; as an anxious desire to
          sleep, makes us so much the more wakeful. Thus will thought follow you
          beyond the grave, thus will it, as an unwelcome guest, force itself
          upon you, when it can serve only to perplex and distress the mind. It
          will for ever upbraid you, that notwithstanding all the kind
          expostulations of God and man, notwithstanding all the keen
          remonstrances of conscience, and the pleadings of the blood of Christ,
          you have gone on in your folly, till heaven is lost, and damnation
          incurred; and all, for what for a shadow and a dream?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh think not, sinners, that the remembrance of your past pleasures,
          and of your success in your other cares, whilst that of the one thing
          needful was forgotten, think not that this will ease you minds. It
          will rather torment them the more. "Son, remember that thou in thy
          life-time receivedst thy good things." Bitter remembrance! Well might
          the heathen poets represent the unhappy spirits in the shades below,
          as eagerly catching at the water of forgetfulness, yet unable to reach
          it. Your present comforts will only serve to give you a livelier sense
          of your misery, as having tasted such degrees of enjoyment; and to
          inflame the reckoning, as you have misimproved those talents lodged in
          your hands for better purposes. Surely, if these things were believed,
          and seriously considered, the sinner would have no more heart to
          rejoice in his present prosperity, than a man would have to amuse
          himself with the curiosities of a fine garden, through which he was
          led to be broken upon the rack.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I will enlarge no farther on these things. Would to God that the
          unaccountable stupidity of men's minds, and their fatal attachment to
          the pleasures and cares of the present life, did not make it necessary
          to insist on them so frequently and so copiously!
        </p>
        <p>
          I now proceed to the reflections which naturally arise from hence, and
          shall only mention two.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How much reason have we to lament the follow of mankind in
          neglecting the one thing needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          If religion be indeed the truest wisdom, then surely we have the
          justest reason to say with Solomon, "the folly and madness is in men's
          hearts," Eccl.9:3. Is it the one thing needful? Look on the conduct of
          the generality of mankind, and you would imagine they thought it the
          one thing needless: the vainest dream, and the idlest amusement of the
          mind. God is admonishing them by ordinances, and providences,
          sometimes by such as are most awful, to lay it to heart;" he speaks
          once, yea twice, (yes a multitude of times) but man regards not, Job
          33:14. They profess perhaps to believe all that I have been saying,
          but act as if the contrary were self- evident; they will risk their
          fouls and eternity for a thing of nought, for that, for the sake of
          which they would not risk so much as a hand, or a finger, or a joint,
          no, nor perhaps a toy that adorns it. Surely this is the wonder of
          angels, and perhaps of devils too, unless the observation of so many
          ages may have rendered it familiar to both. And can we, my Christian
          brethren, behold such a scene with indifference? If some epidemical
          madness had seized our country, or the places where we live, so that
          as we went from one place to another, we every where met with
          lunatics, and saw amongst the rest, some perhaps of the finest genius,
          in the most eminent stations in life, amusing themselves with others;
          surely were we ever so secure from the danger of infection or assault,
          the fight would cut us to the heart. A good-natured man would hardly
          be able to go abroad, or even be desirous to live, if it must be
          amongst so many sad spectacles. Yet these poor creatures might,
          notwithstanding this, be the children of God, and the higher their
          frenzy rose, the nearer might their complete happiness be. But alas!
          the greater part of mankind are seized with a worse kind of madness,
          in which they are ruining their souls; and can we behold it with
          indifference? The Lord awaken our compassion, our prayers, and our
          endeavors, in dependence on divine grace, that we may be instrumental
          in bringing them to their mind, and making them wise indeed, that is,
          wise to salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How necessary is it that we should seriously inquire, how this one
          thing needful is regarded by us!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me entreat you to remember your own concern in it, and inquire --
          Have I thought seriously of it? Have I seen the importance of it? Ha
          it lain with a due and abiding weight on my mind? Has it brought me to
          Christ, that I might lay the stress of these great eternal interests
          on him? And am I acting in the main of my life, as one that has these
          convictions? Am I willing, in fact, to give up other things, my
          interests, my pleasures, my passions to this? Am I conversing with God
          and with man, as one that believes these things; as one that has
          deliberately chosen the better part, and is determined to abide by
          that choice?
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe the answer which conscience returns to these inquiries, and
          you will know your own part in that more particular application, with
          which I shall conclude.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Let me address those that are entirely unconcerned about the one
          thing needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, I have been stating the case at large, and now I appeal to
          your consciences, are these things so, or are they not? God and your
          own hearts best know for what the care of your soul is neglected; but
          be it what it will, the difference between one grain of sand and
          another, is not great, when it comes to be weighed against a talent of
          gold. Whatever it is, you had need to examine it carefully. You had
          need to view that commodity on all sides, of which you do in effect
          say, For this will I sell my soul; for this will I give up heaven, and
          venture hell, be heaven and hell whatever they may. In the name of
          God, brethren, is this the part of a man, of a rational creature? To
          go on with your eyes open towards a pit of eternal ruin, because there
          are a few gay flowers in the way: or what if you shut your eyes, will
          that prevent your fall? It signifies little to say, I will not think
          of these things, I will not consider them: God has said, "In the last
          days they shall consider it perfectly," Jer.23:20. The revels of a
          drunken malefactor will not prevent nor respite his execution. Pardon
          my plainness; if it were a fable or a tale, I would endeavor to amuse
          you with words, but I cannot do it where souls are at stake.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I would apply to those who are, in some sense, convinced of the
          importance of their souls, and yet are inclined to defer that care of
          them a little longer, which, in the general, they see to be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know you that are young, are under peculiar temptations to do this;
          though it is strange that the death of so many of your companions,
          should not be an answer to some of the most specious and dangerous of
          those temptations. Methinks, if these were the least degree of
          uncertainty, the importance is too weighty to put matters to the
          venture. But here the uncertainty is great and apparent. You must
          surely know, that there are critical seasons of life for managing the
          concerns of it, which are of such a nature, that if once left, they
          may never return: here is a critical season: "Now is the accepted
          time, now is the day of salvation," 2 Cor.6:2. "today, if ye will hear
          his voice, harden not your hearts," Heb.3:7, 8. This language may not
          be spoken tomorrow. Talk not of a more convenient season; none can be
          more convenient; and that to which you would probably refer it, is
          least of all so, a dying time. You would not choose then to have any
          important business in hand; and will you of choice refer the greatest
          business of all to that languishing, hurrying, amazing hour? If a
          friend were then to come to you with the balance of an intricate
          account, or a view of a title to an estate, you would shake your
          fainting head, and lift up your pale trembling hand, and say, perhaps,
          with a feeble voice, "Alas, is this a time for these things?" And is
          it a time for so much greater things than these? I wish you knew, and
          would consider, into what a strait, we that are minister are sometime
          brought, when we are called to the dying beds of those who have spent
          their lives in the neglect of the one thing needful. On the one hand,
          we fear, lest if we palliate [sugarcoat] matters, and speak smooth
          things, we shall betray and ruin their souls; and on the other, that
          if we use a becoming plainness and seriousness, in warning them of
          their danger, we shall quite overwhelm them, and hasten the dying
          moments, which is advancing by such swift steps. O let me entreat you
          for our sakes, and much more for your own, that you do not drive us to
          such sad extremities; but if you are convinced, as I hope some of you
          may now be, that the care of the soul is that needful thing we have
          represented, let the conviction work, let it drive you immediately to
          the throne of grace; from thence you may derive that wisdom and
          strength, which will direct you in all the intricacies which entangle
          you, and animate you in the midst of difficulty an discouragement.

          3. I would in the last place address myself to those happy souls, who
          have in good earnest attended to the one thing needful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope, that when you see how commonly it is neglected, neglected
          indeed, by many, whose natural capacities, improvements, and
          circumstances in life, appear to you superior to your own; you will
          humbly acknowledge, that it was distinguishing grace which brought you
          into this happy state, and formed you to this most necessary care.
          Bless the Lord, therefore, who hath given you that counsel, in virtue
          of which you can say, "He is your portion." Rejoice in the thought,
          that the great concern is secured: as it is natural for us to do, when
          some important affair is dispatched, which has long lain before us,
          and which we have been inclined to put off from one day to another,
          but have at length strenuously and successfully attended. Remember
          still to endeavor to continue acting on these great principles, which
          at first determined your choice; and seriously consider, that those
          who desire their life may at last be given them for a prey, must
          continue on their guard, in all stages of their journey through a
          wilderness, where daily dangers are still surrounding them. Being
          enabled to secure the great concern, make yourselves easy as to others
          of smaller importance. You have chosen the kingdom of God, and his
          righteousness; other things, therefore, shall be added unto you: and
          if any which you desire should, not be added, comfort yourselves with
          this thought, that you have the good part, which can never be taken
          away. And, not to enlarge on these obvious hints, which must often
          occur, be very solicitous that others may be brought to a care about
          the one thing needful. If it be needful for you, it is so for your
          children, your friends, your servants. Let them, therefore, see your
          concern in this respect for them, as well as for yourselves. Let
          parents especially attend to this exhortation; whose care for their
          offspring often exceeds in other respects, and falls in this. Remember
          that your children may never live to enjoy the effects of your labor
          and concern to get them estates and portions: the charges of their
          funerals may, perhaps, be all their share of what you are so anxiously
          careful to lay up for them. And O think what a sword would pierce
          through your very heart, if you should stand by the corpse of a
          beloved child with this reflection: "This poor creature has done with
          life, before it learnt its great business in it; and is gone to
          eternity, which I have seldom been warning it to prepare for, and
          which, perhaps, it learned of me to forget."
        </p>
        <p>
          On the whole, may this grand care be awakened in those by whom it has
          been hitherto neglected: may it be revived in each of our minds. And
          that you may be encouraged to pursue it with greater cheerfulness, let
          me conclude with this comfortable thought, that in proportion to the
          necessity of the case, through the merits of Christ Jesus, is the
          provision which divine grace has made for our assistance. If you are
          disposed to sit down at Christ's feet, he will teach you by his word
          and Spirit. If you commit this precious jewel, which is your eternal
          all, into his hand, he will preserve it unto that day, and will then
          produce it richly adorned, and gloriously improved to his own honor,
          and to your everlasting joy.
