        <p>Luke 13:3 -- "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."</p>
        <p>
          When we consider how heinous and aggravating our offenses are, in the
          sight of a just and holy God, that they bring down his wrath upon our
          heads, and occasion us to live under his indignation; how ought we
          thereby to be deterred from evil, or at least engaged to study to
          repent thereof, and not commit the same again; but man is so
          thoughtless of an eternal state, and has so little consideration of
          the welfare of his immortal soul, that he can sin without any thought
          that he must give an account of his actions at the day of judgment; or
          if he, at times, has any reflections on his behavior, they do not
          drive him to true repentance: he may, for a short time, refrain from
          falling into some gross sins which he had lately committed; but then,
          when the temptation comes again with power, he is carried away with
          the lust; and thus he goes on promising and resolving, and in breaking
          both his resolutions and his promises, as fast almost as he has made
          them. This is highly offensive to God, it is mocking of him. My
          brethren, when grace is given us to repent truly, we shall turn wholly
          unto God; and let me beseech you to repent of your sins, for the time
          is hastening when you will have neither time nor call to repent; there
          is none in the grave, whither we are going; but do not be afraid, for
          God often receives the greatest sinner to mercy through the merits of
          Christ Jesus; this magnifies the riches of his free grace; and should
          be an encouragement for you, who are great and notorious sinners, to
          repent, for he shall have mercy upon you, if you through Christ return
          unto him.
        </p>
        <p>
          St. Paul was an eminent instance of this; he speaks of himself as "the
          chief of sinners," and he declareth how God showed mercy unto him.
          Christ loves to show mercy unto sinners, and if you repent, he will
          have mercy upon you. But as no word is more mistaken than that of
          repentance, I shall
        </p>
        <p>I. Show you what the nature of repentance is.</p>
        <p>II. Consider the several parts and causes of repentance.</p>
        <p>
          III. I shall give you some reasons, why repentance is necessary to
          salvation. And
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Exhort all of you, high and low, rich and poor, one with another,
          to endeavor after repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Repentance, my brethren, in the first place, as to its nature, is
          the carnal and corrupt disposition of men being changed into a renewed
          and sanctified disposition. A man that has truly repented, is truly
          regenerated: it is a different word for one and the same thing; the
          motley mixture of the beast and devil is gone; there is, as it were, a
          new creation wrought in your hearts. If your repentance is true, you
          are renewed throughout, both in soul and body; your understandings are
          enlightened with the knowledge of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ;
          and your wills, which were stubborn, obstinate, and hated all good,
          are obedient and comformable to the will of God. Indeed, our deists
          tell us, that man now has a free will to do good, to love God, and to
          repent when he will; but indeed, there is no free will an any of you,
          but to sin; nay, your free-will leads you so far, that you would, if
          possible, pull God from is throne. This may, perhaps, offend the
          Pharisees; but (it is the truth in Christ which I speak, I lie not)
          every man by his own natural will hates God; but when he is turned
          unto the Lord, by evangelical repentance, then his will is changed;
          then your consciences, nor hardened and benumbed, shall be quickened
          and awakened; then your had hearts shall be melted, and your unruly
          affections shall be crucified. Thus, by that repentance, the whole
          soul will be changed, you will have new inclinations, new desires, and
          new habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may see how vile we are by nature, that it requires so great a
          change to be made upon us, to recover us from this state of sin, and
          therefore the consideration of our dreadful state should make us
          earnest with God to change our condition, and that change, true
          repentance implies; therefore, my brethren, consider how hateful your
          ways are to God, while you continue in sin; how abominable you are
          unto him, while you run into evil: you cannot be said to be Christians
          while you are hating Christ, and his people; true repentance will
          entirely change you, the bias of your souls will be changed, then you
          will delight in God, in Christ, in his law, and in his people; you
          will then believe that there is such a thing as inward feeling, though
          now you may esteem it madness and enthusiasm; you will not then be
          ashamed of becoming fools for Christ's sake; you will not regard being
          scoffed at; it is not then their pointing after you and crying, "Here
          comes another troop of his followers," will dismay you; no, your soul
          will abhor such proceedings, the ways of Christ and his people will be
          your whole delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the nature of such repentance to make a change, and the greatest
          change as can be made here in the soul. Thus you see what repentance
          implies in its own nature; it denotes an abhorrence of all evil, and a
          forsaking of it. I shall now proceed
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, To show you the parts of it, and the causes concurring
          thereto.
        </p>
        <p>The parts are, sorrow, hatred, and an entire forsaking of sin.</p>
        <p>
          Our sorrow and grief for sin, must not spring merely from a fear of
          wrath; for if we have no other ground but that, it proceeds from
          self-love, and not from any love to God; and if love to God is not the
          chief motive of your repentance, your repentance is in vain, and not
          to be esteemed true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many, in our days, think their crying, God forgive me! or, Lord have
          mercy upon me! or, I am sorry for it! Is repentance, and that God will
          esteem it as such; but, indeed, they are mistaken; it is not the
          drawing near to God with our lips, while our hearts are far from him,
          which he regards. Repentance does not come by fits and starts; no, it
          is one continued act of our lives; for as we daily commit sin, so we
          need a daily repentance before God, to obtain forgiveness for those
          sins we commit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not your confessing yourselves to be sinners, it is not knowing
          your condition to be sad and deplorable, so long as you continue in
          your sins; your care and endeavors should be, to get the heart
          thoroughly affected therewith, that you may feel yourselves to be lost
          and undone creatures, for Christ came to save such as are lost; and if
          you are enabled to groan under the weight and burden of your sins,
          then Christ will ease you and give you rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          And till you are thus sensible of your misery and lost condition, you
          are a servant to sin and to your lusts, under the bondage and command
          of Satan, doing his drudgery: thou are under the curse of God, and
          liable to his judgment. Consider how dreadful thy state will be at
          death, and after the day of judgment, when thou wilt be exposed to
          such miseries which the ear hath not heard, neither can the heart
          conceive, and that to all eternity, if you die impenitent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I hope better things of you, my brethren, though I thus speak, and
          things which accompany salvation; go to God in prayer, and be earnest
          with him, that by his Spirit he would convince you of your miserable
          condition by nature, and make you truly sensible thereof. O be
          humbled, be humbled, I beseech you, for your sins. Having spent so
          many years in sinning, what canst thou do less, than be concerned to
          spend some hours in mourning and sorrowing for the same, and be
          humbled before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look back into your lives, call to mind thy sins, as many as possible
          thou canst, the sins of thy youth, as well as of thy riper years; see
          how you have departed from a gracious Father, and wandered in the way
          of wickedness, in which you have lost yourselves, the favor of God,
          the comforts of his Spirit, and the peace of your own consciences;
          then go and beg pardon of the Lord, through the blood of the Lamb, for
          the evil thou hast committed, and for the good thou hast omitted.
          Consider, likewise, the heinousness of thy sins; see what very
          aggravating circumstances thy sins are attended with, how you have
          abused the patience of God, which should have led you to repentance;
          and when thou findest thy heart hard, beg of God to soften it, cry
          mightily unto him, and he will take away thy stony heart, and give
          thee a heart of flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resolve to leave all thy sinful lusts and pleasures; renounce,
          forsake, and abhor thy old sinful course of life, and serve God in
          holiness and righteousness all the remaining part of life. If you
          lament and bewail past sins, and do not forsake them, your repentance
          is in vain, you are mocking of God, and deceiving your own soul; you
          must put off the old man with his deeds, before you can put on the new
          man, Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          You, therefore, who have been swearers and cursers, you, who have been
          harlots and drunkards, you, who have been thieves and robbers, you,
          who have hitherto followed the sinful pleasures and diversions of
          life, let me beseech you, by the mercies of God in Christ Jesus, that
          you would no longer continue therein, but that you would forsake your
          evil ways, and turn unto the Lord, for he waiteth to be gracious unto
          you, he is ready, he is willing to pardon you of all your sins; but do
          not expect Christ to pardon you of sin, when you run into it, and will
          not abstain from complying with the temptations; but if you will be
          persuaded to abstain from evil and choose the good, to return unto the
          Lord, and repent of your wickedness, he hath promised he will
          abundantly pardon you, he will heal your back-slidings, and will love
          you freely. Resolve now this day to have done with your sins for ever;
          let your old ways and you be separated; you must resolve against it,
          for there can be no true repentance without a resolution to forsake
          it. Resolve for Christ, resolve against the devil and his works, and
          go on fighting the Lord's battles against the devil and his
          emissaries; attack him in the strongest holds he has, fight him as
          men, as Christians, and you will soon find him to be a coward; resist
          him and he will fly from you. Resolve, through grace, to do this, and
          your repentance is half done; but then take care that you do not
          ground your resolutions on your own strength, but in the strength of
          the Lord Jesus Christ; he is the way, he is the truth, and he is the
          life; without his assistance you can do nothing, but through his grace
          strengthening thee, thou wilt be enabled to do all things; and the
          more ready Christ will be to help thee; and what can all the men of
          the world do to thee when Christ is for thee? Thou wilt not regard
          what they say against thee, for you will have the testimony of a good
          conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resolve to cast thyself at the feet of Christ in subjection to him,
          and throw thyself into the arms of Christ for salvation by him.
          Consider, my dear brethren, the many invitations he has given you to
          come unto him, to be saved by him; "God has laid on him the iniquity
          of us all." O let me prevail with you, above all things, to make
          choice of the Lord Jesus Christ; resign yourselves unto him, take him,
          O take him, upon his own terms, and whosoever thou art, how great a
          sinner soever you have been, this evening, in the name of the great
          God, do I offer Jesus Christ unto thee; as thou valuest thy life and
          soul refuse him not, but stir up thyself to accept of the Lord Jesus,
          take him wholly as he is, for he will be applied wholly unto you, or
          else not at all. Jesus Christ must be your whole wisdom, Jesus Christ
          must be your whole righteousness, Jesus Christ must be your whole
          sanctification, or he will never be your eternal redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          What though you have been ever so wicked and profligate, yet, if you
          will not abandon your sins, and turn unto the Lord Jesus Christ, thou
          shalt have him given to thee, and all thy sins shall be freely
          forgiven. O why will you neglect the great work of your repentance? Do
          not defer the doing of it one day longer, but today, even now, take
          that Christ who is freely offered to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now as to the causes hereof, the first cause is God; he is the author,
          "we are born of God," God hath begotten us, even God, the Father of
          our Lord Jesus Christ; it is he that stirs us up to will and to do of
          his own good pleasure: and another cause is, God's free grace; it is
          owing to the "riches of his free grace," my brethren, that we have
          been prevented from going down to hell long ago; it is because the
          compassions of the Lord fail not, they are new every morning, and
          fresh every evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the instruments are very unlikely: a poor despised minister,
          or member of Jesus Christ, may, by the power of God, be made an
          instrument in the hands of God, of bringing you to true evangelical
          repentance; and this may be done to show, that the power is not in
          men, but that it is entirely owing to the good pleasure of God; and if
          there has been any good done among many of you, by preaching the word,
          as I trust there has, though it was preached in a field, if God has
          met and owned us, and blessed his word, though preached by an
          enthusiastic babbler, a boy, a madman; I do rejoice, yea, and will
          rejoice, let foes say what they will. I shall now
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Show the reasons why repentance is necessary to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this, my brethren, is plainly revealed to us in the word of God,
          "The soul that does not repent and turn unto the Lord, shall die in
          its sins, and their blood shall be required at their own heads." It is
          necessary, as we have sinned, we should repent; for a holy God could
          not, nor ever can, or will, admit any thing that is unholy into his
          presence: this is the beginning of grace in the soul; there must be a
          change in heart and life, before there can be a dwelling with a holy
          God. You cannot love sin and God too, you cannot love God and mammon;
          no unclean person can stand in the presence of God, it is contrary to
          the holiness of his nature; there is a contrariety between the holy
          nature of God, and the unholy nature of carnal and unregenerate men.
        </p>
        <p>
          What communication can there be between a sinless God, and creatures
          full of sin, between a pure God and impure creatures? If you were to
          be admitted into heaven with your present tempers, in your impenitent
          condition, heaven itself would be a hell to you; the songs of angels
          would be as enthusiasm, and would be intolerable to you; therefore you
          must have these tempers changed, you must be holy, as God is: he must
          be your God here, and you must be his people, or you will never dwell
          together to all eternity. If you hate the ways of God, and cannot
          spend an hour in his service, how will you think to be easy, to all
          eternity, in singing praises to him that sits upon the throne, and to
          the Lamb for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is to be the employment, my brethren, of all those who are
          admitted into this glorious place, where neither sin nor sinner is
          admitted, where no scoffer ever can come, without repentance from his
          evil ways, a turning unto God, and a cleaving unto him: this must be
          done, before any can be admitted into the glorious mansions of God,
          which are prepared for all that love the Lord Jesus Christ in
          sincerity and truth: repent ye then of all your sins. O my dear
          brethren, it makes my blood run cold, in thinking that any of you
          should not be admitted into the glorious mansions above. O that it was
          in my power, I would place all of you, yea, you my scoffing brethren,
          and the greatest enemy I have on earth, at the right hand of Jesus;
          but this I cannot do: however, I advise and exhort you, with all love
          and tenderness, to make Jesus your refuge; fly to him for relief;
          Jesus died to save such as you; he is full of compassion; and if you
          go to him, as poor, lost, undone sinners, Jesus will give you his
          spirit; you shall live and reign, and reign and live, you shall love
          and live, and live and love with this Jesus to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am, Fourthly, to exhort all of you, high and low, rich and poor, one
          with another, to repent of all your sins, and turn unto the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I shall speak to each of you; for you have either repented, or you
          have not, you are believers in Christ Jesus, or unbelievers.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, you who never have truly repented of your sins, and never
          have truly forsaken your lusts, be not offended if I speak plain to
          you; for it is love, love to your souls, that constrains me to speak:
          I shall lay before you your danger, and the misery to which you are
          exposed, while you remain impenitent in sin. And O that this may be a
          means of making you fly to Christ for pardon and forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          While thy sins are not repented of, thou art in danger of death, and
          if you should die, you would perish for ever. There is no hope of any
          who live and die in their sins, but that they will dwell with devils
          and damned spirits to all eternity. And how do we know we shall live
          much longer: we are not sure of seeing our own habitations this night
          in safety. What mean ye then being at ease and pleasure while your
          sins are not pardoned. As sure as ever the word of God is true, if you
          die in that condition, you are shut out of all hope and mercy for
          ever, and shall pass into ceaseless and endless misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is all thy pleasures and diversions worth? They last but for a
          moment, they are of no worth, and but of short continuance. And sure
          it must be gross folly, eagerly to pursue those sinful lusts and
          pleasures, which war against the soul, which tend to harden the heart,
          and keep us from closing with the Lord Jesus; indeed, these are
          destructive o four peace here, and without repentance, will be of our
          peace hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          O the folly and madness of this sensual world; sure if there were
          nothing in sin but present slavery, it would keep an ingenuous spirit
          from it. But to do the devils drudgery! And if we do that, we shall
          have his wages, which is eternal death and condemnation; O consider
          this, my guilty brethren, you that think it no crime to swear, whore,
          drink, or scoff and jeer at the people of God; consider how your
          voices will then be changed, and you that counted their lives madness,
          and their end without honor, shall howl and lament at your own madness
          and filly, that should bring you to so much woe and distress. Then you
          will lament and bemoan your own dreadful condition; but it will be of
          no signification: for he that is not your merciful Savior, will then
          become your inexorable Judge. Now he is easy to be entreated; but
          then, all your tears and prayers will be in vain: for God hath
          allotted to every man a day of grace, a time of repentance, which if
          he doth not improve, nut neglects and despises the means which are
          offered to him, he cannot be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, therefore, while you are going on in a course of sin and
          unrighteousness, I beseech you, my brethren, to think of the
          consequence that will attend your thus mispending your precious time;
          your souls are worth being concerned about: for if you can enjoy all
          the pleasures and diversions of life, at death you must leave them;
          that will put an end to all your worldly concerns. And will it not be
          very deplorable, to have your good things here, all your earthly,
          sensual, devilish pleasures, which you have been so much taken up
          with, all over: and the thought for how trifling a concern thou hast
          lost eternal welfare, will gnaw thy very soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thy wealth and grandeur will stand in no stead; thou canst carry
          nothing of it into the other world: then the consideration of thy
          uncharitableness to the poor, and the ways thou didst take to obtain
          thy wealth, will be a very hell unto thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you enjoy the means of grace, as the preaching of his word,
          prayer, and sacraments; and God has sent his ministers out into the
          fields and highways, to invite, to woo you to come in; but they are
          tiresome to thee, thou hadst rather be at thy pleasures: ere long, my
          brethren, they will be over, and you will be no more troubled with
          them; but then thou wouldst give ten thousand worlds for one moment of
          that merciful time of grace which thou hast abused; then you will cry
          for a drop of that precious blood which now you trample under your
          feet; then you will wish for one more offer of mercy, for Christ and
          his free grace to be offered to you again; but your crying will be in
          vain: for as you would not repent here, God will not give you an
          opportunity to repent hereafter: if you would not in Christ's time,
          you shall not in your own. In what a dreadful condition will you then
          be? What horror and astonishment will possess your souls? Then all thy
          lies and oaths, thy scoffs and jeers at the people of God, all thy
          filthy and unclean thoughts and actions, thy mispent time in balls,
          plays, and assemblies, thy spending whole evenings at cards, dice, and
          masquerades, thy frequenting of taverns and alehouses, thy
          worldliness, covetousness, and thy uncharitableness, will be brought
          at once to thy remembrance, and at once charged upon thy guilty soul.
          And how can you bear the thoughts of these things? Indeed I am full of
          compassion towards you, to think that this should be the portion of
          any who now hear me. These are truths, though awful ones; my brethren,
          these are the truths of the gospel; and if there was not a necessity
          for thus speaking, I would willingly forbear: for it is no pleasing
          subject to me, any more than it is to you; but it is my duty to show
          you the dreadful consequences of continuing in sin. I am only now
          acting the part of a skillful surgeon, that searches a wound before he
          heals it: I would show you your danger first, that deliverance may be
          the more readily accepted by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, that however you may be for putting the evil day away from
          you, and are now striving to hide your sins, at the day of judgment
          there shall be a full discovery of all; hidden things on that day
          shall be brought to light; and after all thy sins have been revealed
          to the whole world, then you must depart into everlasting fire in
          hell, which will not be quenched night and day; it will be without
          intermission, without end. O then, what stupidity and senselessness
          hath possessed your hearts, that you are not frighted from your sins.
          The fear of Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace, made men do any thing to
          avoid it; and shall not an everlasting fire make men, make you, do any
          thing to avoid it?
        </p>
        <p>
          O that this would awaken and cause you to humble yourselves for your
          sins, and to beg pardon for them, that you might find mercy in the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not go away, let not the devil hurry you away before the sermon is
          over; but stay, and you shall have a Jesus offered to you, who has
          made full satisfaction for all your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me beseech you to cast away your transgressions, to strive against
          sin, to watch against it, and to beg power and strength from Christ,
          to keep down the power of those lusts that hurry you on in your sinful
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you will not do any of these things, if you are resolved to sin
          on, you must expect eternal death to be the consequence; you must
          expect to be seized with horror and trembling, with horror and
          amazement, to hear the dreadful sentence of condemnation pronounced
          against you: and then you will run and call upon the mountains to fall
          on you, to hide you from the Lord, and from the fierce anger of his
          wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had you now a heart to turn from your sins unto the living God, by
          true and unfeigned repentance, and to pray unto him for mercy, in and
          through the merits of Jesus Christ, there were hope; but at the day of
          judgment, thy prayers and tears will be of no signification; they will
          be of no service to thee, the Judge will not be entreated by thee: as
          you would not hearken to him when he called unto thee, but despised
          both him and his ministers, and would not leave your iniquities;
          therefore, on that day he will not be entreated, notwithstanding all
          thy cries and tears; for God himself hath said, "Because I have
          called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man
          regarded, but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would have one
          of my reproof; I will also laugh at your calamity, and mock when your
          fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;
          when distress and anguish cometh upon you, then shall they call upon
          me, but I will not answer, they shall seek me early, but they shall
          not find me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you may call this enthusiasm and madness; but at that great day,
          if you repent not of your sins here, you will find, by woeful
          experience, that your own ways were madness indeed; but God forbid it
          should be left undone till then: seek after the Lord while he is to be
          found; call upon him while he is near, and you shall find mercy:
          repent this hour, and Christ will joyfully receive you.
        </p>
        <p>
          What say you? Must I go to my Master, and tell him you will not come
          unto him, and will have none of his counsels? No; do not send me on so
          unhappy an errand: I cannot, I will not tell him any such thing. Shall
          not I rather tell him, you are willing to repent and to be converted,
          to become new men, and take up a new course of life: this is the only
          wise resolution you can make. Let me tell my Master, that you will
          come unto, and will wait upon him: for if you do not, it will be your
          ruin in time, and to eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will at death wish you had lived the life of the righteous, that
          you might have died his death. Be advised then; consider what is
          before you, Christ and the world, holiness and sin, life and death:
          choose now for yourselves; let your choice be made immediately, and
          let that choice be your dying choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would not choose to die in your sins, to die drunkards, to die
          adulterers, to die swearers and scoffers, &amp;c. live not out this
          night in the dreadful condition you are in. Some of you, it may be,
          may say, You have not power, you have no strength: but have not you
          been wanting to yourselves in such things that were within your power?
          Have you not as much power to go to hear a sermon, as to go into a
          playhouse, or to a ball, or masquerade? You have as much power to read
          the Bible, as to read plays, novels, and romances; and you can
          associate as well with the godly, as with the wicked and profane: this
          is but an idle excuse, my brethren, to go on in your sins: and if you
          will be found in the means of grace, Christ hath promised he will give
          you strength. While Peter was preaching, the Holy Ghost fell on all
          that heard the word: how then should you be found in the way of your
          duty? Jesus Christ will then give thee strength; he will put his
          Spirit within thee; thou shalt find he will be thy wisdom, thy
          righteousness, thy sanctification, and thy redemption. Do but try what
          a gracious, a kind, and loving Master he is; he will be a help to thee
          in all thy burdens: and if the burden of sin is on thy soul, go to him
          as weary and heavy laden, and thou shalt find rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not say, that your sins are too many and too great to expect to
          find mercy! No, be they ever so many, or ever so great, the blood of
          the Lord Jesus Christ will cleanse you from all sins. God's grace, my
          brethren, is free, rich, and sovereign. Manassah was a great sinner,
          and yet he was pardoned; Zaccheus was gone far from God, and went out
          to see Christ, with no other view but to satisfy his curiosity; and
          yet Jesus met him, and brought salvation to his house. Manassah was an
          idolater and murderer, yet her received mercy; the other was an
          oppressor and extortioner, who had gotten riches by fraud and deceit,
          and by grinding the faces of the poor: so did Matthew too, and yet
          they found mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you been blasphemers and persecutors of the saints and servants
          of God? So was St. Paul, yet her received mercy: Have you been common
          harlots, filthy and unclean persons? So was Mary Magdalene, and yet
          she received mercy. Hast thou been a thief? The thief upon the cross
          found mercy. I despair of none of you, however vile and profligate you
          have been; I say, I despair of none of you, especially when God has
          had mercy on such a wretch as I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember the poor Publican, how he found favor with God, when the
          proud, self-conceited Pharisee, who, puffed up with his own
          righteousness, was rejected. And if you will go to Jesus, as the poor
          Publican did, under a sense of your own unworthiness, you shall find
          favor as he did: there is virtue enough in the blood of Jesus, to
          pardon greater sinners than he has yet pardoned. Then be not
          discouraged, but come unto Jesus, and you will find him ready to help
          in all thy distresses, to lead thee into all truth, to bring thee from
          darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not let the devil deceive you, by telling you, that then all your
          delights and pleasures will be over: No; this is so far from depriving
          you of all pleasure, that it is an inlet unto unspeakable delights,
          peculiar to all who are truly regenerated. The new birth is the very
          beginning of a life of peace and comfort; and the greatest
          pleasantness is to be found in the ways of holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solomon, who had experience of all other pleasures, yet saith of the
          ways of godliness, "That all her ways are ways of pleasantness, and
          all her paths are paths of peace." Then sure you will not let the
          devil deceive you; it is all he wants, it is that he aims at, to make
          religion appear to be melancholy, miserable, and enthusiastic: but let
          him say what he will, give not ear to him, regard him not, for he
          always was and will be a liar.
        </p>
        <p>
          What words, what entreaties shall I use, to make you come unto the
          Lord Jesus Christ? The little love I have experienced since I have
          been brought from sin to God, is so great, that I would not be in a
          natural state for ten thousand worlds; and what I have felt is but
          little to what I hope to feel; but that little love which I have
          experienced, is a sufficient buoy against all the storms and tempests
          of this boisterous world: and let men and devils do their worst, I
          rejoice in the Lord Jesus, yea, and I will rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And O if you repent and come to Jesus, I would rejoice on your
          accounts too; and we should rejoice together to all eternity, when
          once passed on the other side of the grave. O come to Jesus. The arms
          of Jesus Christ will embrace you; he will sash away all your sins in
          his blood, and will love you freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, I beseech you to come unto Jesus Christ. O that my words would
          pierce to the very soul! O that Jesus Christ was formed in you! O that
          you would turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, that he might have mercy upon
          you! I would speak till midnight, yea, I would speak till I could
          speak no more, so it might be a means to bring you to Jesus; let the
          Lord Jesus but enter your souls, and you shall find peace which the
          world can neither give nor take away. There is mercy for the greatest
          sinner amongst you; go unto the Lord as sinners, helpless and undone
          without it, and then you shall find comfort in your souls, and be
          admitted at last amongst those who sing praises unto the Lord to all
          eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my brethren, let me speak a word of exhortation to those of you,
          who are already brought to the Lord Jesus, who are born again, who do
          belong to God, to whom it has been given to repent of your sins, and
          are cleansed from their guilt; and that is, be thankful to God for his
          mercies towards you. O admire the grace of God, and bless his name
          forever! Are you made alive in Christ Jesus? Is the life of God begun
          in your souls, and have you the evidence thereof? Be thankful for this
          unspeakable mercy to you: never forget to speak of his mercy. And as
          your life was formerly devoted to sin, and to the pleasures of the
          world, let it now be spent wholly in the ways of God; and O embrace
          every opportunity of doing and of receiving good. Whatsoever
          opportunity you have, do it vigorously, do it speedily, do not defer
          it. If thou seest one hurrying on to destruction, use the utmost of
          thy endeavor to stop him in his course; show him the need he has of
          repentance, and that without it he is lost for ever; do not regard his
          despising of you; still go on to show him his danger: and if thy
          friends mock and despise, do not let that discourage you; hold on,
          hold out to the end, so you shall have a crown which is immutable, and
          that fadeth not away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the love of Jesus to you, keep you also humble; do not be high-
          minded, keep close unto the Lord, observe the rules which the Lord
          Jesus Christ has given in his word, and let not the instructions be
          lost which you which you are capable of giving. O consider what reason
          you have to be thankful to the Lord Jesus Christ for giving you that
          repentance you yourselves had need of: a repentance which worketh by
          love. Now you find more pleasure in walking with God one hour, than in
          all your former carnal delights, and all the pleasures of sin. O! the
          joy you feel in your own souls, which all the men of the world, and
          all the devils in hell, though they were to combine together, could
          not destroy. Then fear not their wrath or malice, for through many
          tribulations we must enter into glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few days, or weeks, or years more, and then you will be beyond their
          reach, you will be in the heavenly Jerusalem; their is all harmony and
          love, there is all joy and delight; there the weary soul is at rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we have many enemies, but at death they are all lost; they cannot
          follow us beyond the grave: and this is a great encouragement to us
          not to regard the scoffs and jeers of the men of this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          O let the love of Jesus be in your thoughts continually. It was his
          dying that brought you life; it was his crucifixion that paid the
          satisfaction for your sins; his death, burial, and resurrection that
          completed the work; and he is now in heaven, interceding for you at
          the right hand of his Father. And can you do too much for the Lord
          Jesus Christ, who has done so much for you? His love to you is
          unfathomable. O the height, the depth, the length and breadth of this
          love, that brought the King of glory from his throne, to die for such
          rebels as we are, when we had acted so unkindly against him, and
          deserved nothing but eternal damnation. He came down and took our
          nature upon him; he was made of flesh and dwelt among us; he was put
          to death on our account; he paid our ransom: surely this should make
          us rejoice in him, and not do as too many do, and as we ourselves have
          too often, crucify this Jesus afresh. Let us do all we can, my dear
          brethren, to honor him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, all of you, come, and behold him stretched out for you; see his
          hands and feet nailed to the cross. O come, come, my brethren, and
          nail your sins thereto; come, come and see his side pierced; there is
          a fountain open for sin, and for uncleanness: O wash, wash and be
          clean: come and see his head crowned with thorns, and all for you. Can
          you think of a panting, bleeding, dying Jesus, and not be filled with
          pity towards him? He underwent all this for you. Come unto him by
          faith; lay hold on him: there is mercy for every soul of you that will
          come unto him. Then do not delay; fly unto the arms of this Jesus, and
          you shall be made clean in his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          O what shall I say unto you to make you come to Jesus: I have showed
          you the dreadful consequence of not repenting of your sins: and if
          after all I have said, you are resolved to persist, your blood will be
          required at your own heads; but I hope better things of you, and
          things that accompany salvation. Let me beg of you to pray in good
          earnest for the grace of repentance. I may never see your faces again;
          but at the day of judgment I will meet you: there you will either
          bless God that ever you were moved to repentance; or else this sermon,
          though in a field, will be as a swift witness against you. Repent,
          repent therefore, my dear brethren, as John the Baptist, and as our
          blessed Redeemer himself earnestly exhorted, and turn from your evil
          ways, and the Lord will have mercy on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Show them, O Father, wherein they have offended thee; make them to see
          their own vileness, and that they are lost and undone without true
          repentance; and O give them that repentance, we beseech of thee, that
          they may turn from sin unto thee the living and true God. These
          things, and whatever else thou seest needful for us, we entreat that
          thou wouldst bestow upon us, on account of what the dear Jesus Christ
          has done and suffered; to whom, with Thyself, and holy Spirit, three
          persons, and one God, be ascribed, as is most due, all power, glory,
          might, majesty, and dominion, now, henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.
