          This psalm is called the song of loves, the most pure and spiritual,
          the most ear and delightful loves; namely, those which are between
          Christ the beloved, and his church, which is his spouse; wherein is
          set forth, first, the Lord Jesus Christ in regard of his majesty,
          power, and divinity, his truth, meekness and equity: And then the
          spouse is set forth, in regard of her ornaments, companions,
          attendants and posterity; and both in regard of their comeliness and
          beauty. After the description of Christ, an invitation to his
          espousals, is given the children of men, called by the name of
          daughter; and therefore, particularly applicable unto you, my dear
          sisters, as being the daughters of men, yet not so as excluding the
          sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall now, therefore, consider the words, as spoken to you in
          particular, and containing this doctrine;
        </p>
        <p>
          That the Lord Jesus Christ doth invite the daughters of men to be his
          spouse; and is exceeding desirous of their beauty; who, forgetting
          their people and father's house, do hearken, consider and incline to
          his invitation, and join themselves to him in this relation.
        </p>
        <p>I shall show,</p>
        <p>
          I. How Christ doth espouse himself unto the children, but, more
          especially, unto the daughters of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus Christ, doth espouse himself unto the children of men,
          in the world, but the public solemnization of the marriage, is
          reserved until the last day; when his spouse shall be brought forth to
          him, in white robes, and a raiment of perfect righteousness, more rich
          and curious, my dear sisters, than any of your needle-work; and the
          marriage feast will be kept in his Father's house, in heaven, when
          they shall be received into the nearest and closest embraces of his
          love. The marriage knot is tied here, in which are included four
          things:
        </p>
        <p>First; Mutual Choice,</p>
        <p>Secondly, Mutual Affection,</p>
        <p>Thirdly, Mutual Union,</p>
        <p>Fourthly, Mutual Obligation.</p>
        <p>
          First, my dear sisters, there is a mutual choice, which is not only in
          Christ, as Mediator, but also by Christ as the eternal Son of God,
          yea, God himself; notwithstanding all that the polite Arians and
          Socinians say to the contrary. The Lord Jesus Christ, my dear sisters,
          doth choose you merely by his free grace; it is freely of his own
          mercy, that he brings you into the marriage covenant: You, who have so
          grievously offended him, yet, the Lord Jesus Christ hath chosen you;
          you did not, you would not have chosen him; but when once, my dear
          sisters, he hath chosen you, then, and not till then, you make choice
          of him for your Lord and Husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus Christ when he first comes to you, finds you full of
          sin and pollution; you are deformed, defiled, enslaved, poor,
          miserable and wretched, very despicable and loathsome, by reason of
          sin; and he maketh choice of you, not because of your holiness, nor of
          your beauty, nor of your being qualified for them; no, the Lord Jesus
          Christ puts these qualifications upon you, as may make you meet for
          his embrace; and you are drawn to make choice of the Lord Jesus Christ
          because he first chose you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, In this espousal of yours, my dear sisters, there is a
          mutual affection; this doth accompany the choice. Your hearts are
          drawn out after Christ; your souls pant and long for him; you cannot
          be at rest until you are engaged to this Jesus: You are ready to cry
          out continually, none but Christ, none but Christ: this is the
          language of your hearts, if you are truly sensible of your need of
          him. The more acquaintance you have of this Lord Jesus, the more
          pleased you are with your choice, and the more your affections are
          drawn towards him. And where can you place your affections better than
          upon that Jesus who shed his blood for your sakes? Surely he deserves
          both your loves and affections: Go on, go on, my dear sisters, that
          your affections may grow stronger and stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, There is not only mutual choice, and mutual affection, but
          likewise mutual union: And here doth the marriage lie chiefly, in this
          union; Christ and souls are contracted, and the knot is tied so fast,
          that neither men on earth, how great soever they be, nor devils in
          hell, though they should combine all their wrath and rage together,
          still they cannot dissolve, they cannot untie it; no, my dear sisters,
          it is indissolvable, for the union is, by the spirit, on Christ's
          part, and by faith on yours: By the spirit, Christ doth lay hold on
          you; and by faith, you do lay hold on him; and thus the match is made;
          Christ becomes yours, his person, portion, and all his benefits are
          yours; and you become Christ's, your persons, your hearts, and all
          that you have is resigned up unto him, and O that they may be so more
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, There is a mutual obligation between Christ and his spouse.
          Christ obliges himself to love you here, he will not, indeed he never
          will leave you, he will protect you from the malice of the Pharisees
          of this generation, he will provide for you in all difficulties; he
          will live with you here, and at last he will take you to himself, to
          live with him forever. And you are engaged to him to be loving, loyal,
          faithful, obedient; and you are to stick close to him as long as you
          live; and then you will find yourselves to be married to the best
          advantage, both for soul and body, for time and for eternity.
        </p>
        <p>II. Christ doth invite all of you to be his spouse.</p>
        <p>
          And it on this account that he sends forth his ministers to preach. It
          is this, that makes me thus come among you; that you would accept of
          this invitation, to which, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I do
          call and entreat you to take him, on his own terms. He calls all of
          you, my sisters, whether elder or younger, whether married or
          unmarried, of higher degree, or of the meanest quality, the poorest
          servants, yea, the rabble of this world, as the world calls you, who
          are willing to be espoused unto the Lord Jesus Christ. I say, the poor
          are as welcome to be Christ's spouse as those that are rich. He
          regardeth not the rich more than the poor; he chose a mean virgin,
          espoused to a carpenter, to be his mother; and he chooseth and calleth
          all such to be his spouse; then be not discouraged at your being
          despised in the world; for if you are but loved by Christ, and
          espoused to him, it will be an over-sufficiency for all the trouble
          that you have met with here.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Those who would be espoused unto Christ, must hearken, consider,
          and incline to his invitation, and forget even their father's house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such as would be espoused unto Christ must hearken. "Hearken, O
          daughter." Many amongst you, my sisters, stop their ears against the
          calls of the gospel; they shut their ears like the deaf adder, which
          will not hearken unto the voice of the charmer, though he charm never
          so wisely. You will not hearken unto the invitations of Christ; you
          can hearken unto the vanities of the world, and be delighted with the
          espousals of the world, but never think or are delighted with the
          espousals of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was by the ear, that the temptation of sin was received by the
          first man, when he departed from God; and by the ear, the invitation
          to be Christ's spouse must be received, before the heart will be
          opened to receive Jesus Christ in this conjugal relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would, my dear sisters, be espoused to Christ, you must
          consider Christ's invitation. It is not a slight or bare hearing of
          Christ's invitation, which will be of any service to you, or make up
          the match between Christ and your souls; no, you must receive Christ
          in the heart; you must consider the thing itself, the advantages of
          it, the difference between Christ's invitations and the devil's
          temptations, or any of the world's proffers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who would be espoused to Christ, must be inclined to accept of
          Christ's invitation. "Hearken, O daughter, consider and incline thine
          ear." This is to incline your hearts: You must consent with your
          wills; there must be a compliance to the motion of Christ, and you
          must have desires after Christ, and then your hearts will say, "Lord,
          let us be thy spouse, and be thou our beloved."
        </p>
        <p>
          You must likewise forget your father's house. "Hearken, O daughter,
          and consider, and forget thy father's house." You are not here to cast
          off all affections unto natural relations; but you must forget all
          relations, so as to be ready to forgo all their favor, when it
          standeth in competition with that of the Lord Jesus Christ: and do not
          let your carnal friends and relations hinder you from closing with,
          and espousing the Lord Jesus. I earnestly beseech you to suffer the
          loss of any thing, rather than to lose his favors; you must indeed
          forget your own people, that is, you must forget all your evil customs
          which you have learned in your father's house, and forsake all your
          vain conversation, your reading of plays, novels, or romances; and you
          must keep from learning to sing the songs of the drunkard; for Christ,
          if you are his spouse, hath redeem you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such of you, my dear sisters, as are espoused to the Lord Jesus Christ
          are very beautiful. I do not mean in respect of your bodies; you may
          have less of external comeliness than others, in respect of your
          bodies, but as to your souls you will exceed in beauty, not so much in
          the eyes of man, as in the eyes of God; such have the most beautiful
          image of God stamped upon them; none in the world beside them, have
          the least spark of spiritual beauty. Such as are not married to
          Christ, are unregenerated, they are not born again, nor brought from
          sin unto God, which must be done before you be espoused to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the Lord Jesus Christ desireth to see this beauty in his spouse,
          for he cries out, "O my dove, thou are in the clefts of the rock, in
          the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me
          hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
          comely." He calleth his spouse his love, being the dear object of his
          love; and he admireth her loveliness; he repeats it twice in one
          verse, "Behold thou art fair, my love, behold thou art fair." Thus you
          see he describes their beauty. And then, my sisters, we have wonderful
          expression of Christ to his spouse, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my
          sister, my spouse, thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
          with one chain of thy neck." Thus you see how pleased the Lord Jesus
          Christ is with his spouse; and will not you, therefore, be espoused
          unto the Lord Jesus? I offer Jesus Christ to all of you; if you have
          been never so notorious for sin, if you have been as great a harlot as
          Mary Magdalen was, when once you are espoused to Christ, you shall be
          forgiven. Therefore be not discouraged, at whatever slights and
          contempts the world may pass upon you, but come and join yourselves to
          the Lord Jesus Christ, and all your sins shall be washed away in his
          blood; and when once you are espoused to Jesus, you are disjoined from
          sin, you are born again. You are now, as it were, espoused unto sin;
          sin is your husband, and you are too fond of it, but when once you are
          married to Christ, when you are born again, then you may be said to
          die unto sin; but till then, sin liveth in your affections; therefore,
          my sisters, give sin its death-wound in your hearts; you have been
          called by the word time after time, and it has had no effect upon you;
          but when you are espoused unto the Lord Jesus Christ, then you will be
          brought to him by his Spirit: You will then lay hold on him by faith,
          his Spirit will draw you unto himself; he will make you to be willing
          in the day of his power; he will give you faith in him. Faith is the
          hand of the soul which layeth hold on Christ; therefore do not rest
          contented till you have this grace of faith wrought in you with power;
          do not be contented till you have received the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Embrace Christ in the arms of your dearest love; then you love the
          Lord Jesus Christ with sincerity, when you love and esteem him before
          father, mother, or all the delights and pleasures of this life, but if
          you do delight in any thing that this world can produce, more than in
          the Lord Jesus Christ, you have not true love to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are espoused to Christ, you have acquaintance and converse with
          him; you will endeavor to promote his interest, and advance his name
          in the world; when others are going to the polite and fashionable
          diversions of life, you will be laboring to bring honor to the Lord
          Jesus Christ; you will commend your beloved above all other beloveds,
          and endeavor to bring others into love to him. Can you, my dear
          sisters, who are now assembled to worship God, show such evidence of
          your espousals unto the Lord Jesus Christ? O! how joyful, how
          comfortable an estate is this! Surely this is a marriage worth seeking
          after; this is the only desirable marriage, and the Lord Jesus Christ
          is the only lover that is worth seeking after.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear sisters, I shall speak a few words to those of you who
          have not yet espoused yourselves to the Lord Jesus. It is a great sin,
          and surely you highly affront the Lord that bought you. It is likewise
          your folly to refuse and neglect the gracious proffers of being the
          spouse of Christ; hereby you forfeit all that love which he would
          bestow upon you; hereby you choose rags before robes, dross before
          gold, pebbles before jewels, built before a pardon, wounds before
          healing, defilement before cleansing, deformity before comeliness,
          trouble before peace, slavery before liberty, the service of the devil
          before the service of Christ. Hereby you choose dishonor before a
          crown, death before life, hell before heaven, eternal misery and
          torment before everlasting joy and glory. And need there a further
          evidence of your folly and madness, in refusing and neglecting Christ
          to be your spouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear sisters, I should exceed the limits of your time, should I
          particularize all the advantages which you would obtain by being
          espoused to the Lord Jesus. This is your wisdom; they are foolish
          virgins who refuse; but you are the wise virgins who have accepted of
          the Lord Jesus Christ, and have disposed of yourselves to him; you
          have made the wisest choice; and however the blind world may deem you
          fools, and despise you as being methodically mad, yet you are wise in
          the esteem of God, and will, one day, appear so in the esteem of them
          that now despise you. It is your glory that you are espoused unto the
          Lord Jesus; and therefore glory is your espousal; glory not in
          yourselves, but in the Lord who hath thus freely and graciously
          bestowed these favors upon you. It is your safety to be espoused unto
          the Lord Jesus Christ, he will protect and defend you even from sin
          and Satan, and eternal ruin; and therefore thus far you are safe; he
          hath a regard for you in times of danger from men, and these times of
          danger seem to be hastening; it is now arising as a black cloud no
          bigger than a man's hand, and by and by it will overspread the
          heavens, and when it is full it will burst; but if you are espoused to
          Christ, you are safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear sisters, I shall conclude with an earnest exhortation to
          high and low, rich and poor, one with another, to be espoused unto
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me speak unto you, young women, who are not yet espoused unto
          Christ, in an especial manner. It may be to satisfy your curiosity,
          has brought many of you here; though, perhaps, this may be the time
          when you shall be brought home to embrace the Lord Jesus, and be
          espoused to him. And O, that I may persuade you, by his Spirit, to
          espouse yourselves unto the Lord of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you are but brought to close with the Lord Jesus Christ, I
          shall attain my end, and then both you and I shall rejoice that I
          preached this sermon to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come virgins, will you give me leave to be a suitor unto you, not in
          my own name, but in the name of the Lord? O! that I may prevail with
          you for your affections, and persuade you to give them unto Christ!
          May I be instrumental of bringing your souls unto Christ! May I be
          instrumental to join you and Christ together this day!
        </p>
        <p>
          Be not coy (bashful, shy; showing reluctance to make a definite
          commitment), as some of you possibly are in other loves: modesty and
          the virgin blush may very well come you, when proposals of another
          kind are made unto you; but here coyness is filly, and backwardness to
          accept of this motion, is shame: you have ten thousand times more
          reason to blush at the refusal of Christ for your beloved, than at the
          acceptance; when otherwise the devil and sin would ravish your virgin
          affections. Never had you a better motion made to you; never was such
          a match proffered to you as this, of being matched and espoused unto
          the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider who the Lord Jesus is, whom you are invited to espouse
          yourselves unto; he is the best husband; there is none comparable to
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that is great? He is of the highest dignity, he is
          the glory of heaven, the darling of eternity, admired by angels,
          dreaded by devils, and adored by saints. For you to be espoused to so
          great a king, what honor will you have by this espousal?
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that is rich? None is comparable to Christ, the
          fullness of the earth belongs to him. If you be espoused to Christ,
          you shall share in his unsearchable riches; you shall receive of his
          fullness, even grace for grace here, and you shall hereafter be
          admitted to glory, and shall live with this Jesus to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that is wise? There is none comparable to Christ for
          wisdom. His knowledge is infinite, and his wisdom is correspondent
          thereto. And if you are espoused to Christ, he will guide and counsel
          you, and make you wise unto salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that is potent, who may defend you against your
          enemies, and all the insults and reproaches of the Pharisees of this
          generation? There is none that can equal Christ in power; for the Lord
          Jesus Christ hath all power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that is good? There is none like unto Christ in this
          regard; others may have some goodness, but it is imperfect; Christ's
          goodness is complete and perfect, he is full of goodness and in him
          dwelleth no evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that is beautiful? His eyes are most sparkling, his
          looks and glances of love are ravishing, his smiles are most
          delightful and refreshing unto the soul: Christ is the most lovely
          person of all others in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you desire one that can love you? None can love you like Christ:
          His love, my dear sisters, is incomprehensible; his love passeth all
          other loves: The love of the Lord Jesus is first, without beginning;
          his love is free without any motive; his love is great without any
          measure; his love is constant without any change, and his love is
          everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the love of the Lord Jesus Christ, my dear sisters, which
          brought him down from heaven; and which veiled his divinity in a human
          soul and body; for he is God over all blessed for ever: It was love
          that made him subject to hunger, thirst and sorrow; he was humbled,
          even unto death for you; for you who are espoused to him, he underwent
          the painful, shameful and ignominious death of the cross: and can you,
          my sisters, hear this, and not be concerned to think that the blessed
          Jesus underwent all this for such sinful creatures as you and I are?
          And when out of love he had finished the redemption on earth, as to
          what was needful for satisfaction; it was his love that carried him
          back to heaven, where he was before, that he might make application of
          what he had purchased, that there he might make intercession for those
          whom he had redeemed, and prepare a place for them, even glorious
          mansions with himself, in the house not made with hands, which is
          eternal in the heavens. It is out of love that he sendeth such tokens
          to his people from heaven to earth, which he conveyeth through his
          ordinances, by his Spirit unto them. Surely then none is so deserving
          as the Lord Jesus Christ for you to espouse yourselves unto: if you be
          espoused unto Christ he is yours, all that he is, all that he hath;
          you shall have his heart, and share in the choicest expressions of his
          dearest love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus Christ, my dear sisters, doth beseech you to be his
          spouse. We ministers have a commission from the Lord Jesus Christ to
          invite you, in his name, unto this very thing; and Christ's
          invitations are real; general; frequent; earnest; free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's invitations of you, to be his spouse, are real: and as the
          thing is real, so you, my dear sisters, are really invited unto it.
          The Lord doth not mock and dissemble with you, as some pretending
          lovers, who dissemble love unto virgins, until they have gained their
          affections, and then falsely and basely relinquish them, never really
          intending either to espouse, or marry them: but the Lord doth really
          intend the thing, in his invitations of you; he never cast off any
          whose consent and affections he had gained. Again,
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's invitations of you, my dear sisters, are general. All of you
          are invited, none of you are excluded; all sorts of sinners are
          invited; the most vile and abominable sinners, the most notorious
          transgressors are invited to be Christ's spouse, and shall be as
          welcome as any unto the embraces of his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's invitations of you are frequent: Jesus Christ calls on you
          frequently; he hath waited on you time after time, one year after
          another; and he doth now invite you, by me this day, to come unto Him.
          Do not slight this invitation, but receive it with joy and
          thankfulness. Come, I beseech you, to this Jesus, who thus, invites
          you to be his spouse. Again,
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's invitations to be his spouse are earnest: he doth call upon
          you, and not only call, but call earnestly too; yea, he useth many
          arguments with you; he will press you to come unto him; he is loth
          (loathe) to take any denial from you: he knocks, and knocks hard at
          the door of your hearts for entertainment; and surely you will not
          deny the Lord of life and glory who died for you, and gave himself for
          you: O my dear sisters, let this be the evening of your espousals to
          the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          He invites you freely to be his spouse, for all his invitations are
          free; he doth not expect a portion with you, as worldly lovers do; He
          wants nothing of you: nay, you must have nothing, if you be espoused
          unto the Lord Jesus Christ. If you be poor, miserable, blind, naked,
          Jesus Christ will supply all these defects of his own free mercy; he
          will fill and supply you with all things out of his treasury; he will
          make you meet for himself; he will prepare you to live with him for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, if you be once espoused unto Christ, if once joined in this
          relation, you shall never be separated from him; neither men nor
          devils shall be able to separate you: none, none, shall disjoin you;
          and when death doth break all other bonds, it shall not break the
          conjugal bond between you and Christ, but bring you unto the most full
          and everlasting possession of your beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what do you now say, young women? Shall I have a grant for my
          master, or be sent away with a repulse and refusal; no, I cannot carry
          such a message to my master; I hope better things of you, my sisters,
          and things which accompany salvation: methinks by this time ye should
          begin to have a mind unto Jesus Christ; you look as if you did desire;
          you hearken as if you would consent. What do you say? Shall the match
          be made up this evening between Christ and your souls? O that I may be
          instrumental in joining your hands, or rather your hearts together: O
          that I may be instrumental to tie that knot, which never can be
          unloosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some marry in haste, and repent at leisure; but if you were once
          espoused unto Jesus Christ, you would never repent; nothing would
          grieve you, but that you were not joined to him sooner; and you would
          not be disjoined again for all the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall this be the day of your espousals? Some of you have stayed a
          long time; and will you defer any longer? If you will not now, perhaps
          you may never have another opportunity; this may be the last time of
          asking; and therefore it is dangerous to refuse; some of you are very
          young, too young for other espousals; but none of you, by dear
          sisters, are too young to be espoused unto the Lord Jesus Christ: in
          other espousals, you must have the consent of your parents; but in
          this you are at your own disposal; you may give, and ought to match
          yourselves to Christ, whether parents do consent or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if any of you should ask, what you must do that you may be
          espoused unto Christ? You must be sensible of your need of being
          espoused to him, and until you are sensible of your need of the Lord
          Jesus Christ, you cannot be espoused to him: You must have desires
          after this Jesus, and seek unto him for an interest in him, you must
          cry nightly unto him to espouse you to himself; put off the filthiness
          of sin and all its defilements; and then, my sisters, put on the white
          raiment, and clean garments, which Christ hath provided for you, the
          robes of his righteousness; in these garments you shall be beautiful;
          and in these garments you shall be accepted: you must have the wedding
          garment on; you must put off all your own good works, for they will be
          but a means to keep you from Christ; no, you must come as not having
          your own righteousness, which is of the law, but you must have the
          righteousness of Christ. Therefore, come unto the Lord Jesus Christ,
          and he will give it to you; he will not send you away without it.
          Receive him upon his own terms, and he is yours forever: O devote
          yourselves to him, soul and body, and all, to be his for ever; and
          Christ will be yours and then happy, happy you, that ever you were
          born! But if any of you die before this espousal unto the Lord Jesus
          Christ, then woe, woe, unto you, that ever you had a being in life;
          but if you go to Christ you shall be espoused unto the Lord Jesus:
          though your sins have been never so great, yea, the blood of Christ
          will cleanse you from them; the marriage covenant between Christ and
          your souls will dissolve all your sins; you will then be weary of your
          old ways, for all things will become new in your souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear sisters, I shall conclude by just speaking a word or two
          to those of you, who are already espoused unto the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          O admire, admire the rich and free grace, which hath brought you to
          this relation: Is not this an instance of the greatest of love, that
          you should be the spouse of the Lord Jesus Christ? You that had no
          beauty, you that had no comeliness, that was full of sin, that He
          should embrace such as you and I are; that we should be taken into the
          embrace of this Lord Jesus. O infinite condescending kindness! O
          amazing love! Reverence, reverence, I beseech you, this Lord Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is you Lord, and you must reverence him, love and be faithful unto
          him, be subject to him, and careful to please him in every thing;
          endeavor to keep up a daily communion with him; look, long and prepare
          for Christ's second appearance, when the nuptials between you shall be
          solemnized, and you live with him in mansions of everlasting joys,
          where you shall love and live with this king of glory for ever and
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know not how to conclude; methinks I could speak to you till
          midnight, if it would bring you unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and make
          you be espoused to him, for indeed, that will be the espousal which
          will turn to the greatest advantage, as you will find by experience,
          if you will but make the trial; and that you may do so, my prayers and
          my constant endeavor shall be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will, my dear sisters, spend and be spent for you, and by the
          assistance of God, will persevere in this that I have begun; and as
          many of you may have opportunity some evening in the week, without
          breaking in on the business of life; I shall therefore, my sisters,
          either be here, or where you shall be publicly acquainted with: I will
          not mind being reproached or despised: the men of this world may use
          what language the please; they may say I am a Methodist. Indeed, my
          sisters, I am resolved, by the grace of God, to use all methods I can,
          to pluck you from Satan, that you may be as brands plucked from the
          burning fire: this shall be my method, which I hope will be the means
          of effectually having your precious and immortal souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if I am the instrument of this, I shall rejoice, yea, and I will
          rejoice in spite of what men, or devils, can say or do to the
          contrary: and may the Lord Jesus Christ direct, and assist me at all
          times, to act what will be most for is glory, and the welfare of your
          souls: and may you all say a hearty Amen thereto.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God over all, blessed for ever,
          assist and watch over you, keep you from all evil and sin here, and
          present you before his Father faultless at the great day of account!
          To this Lord Jesus Christ, the Father , and the blessed Spirit, three
          persons and but one eternal and invisible God, be ascribed all honor,
          power, glory, might, majesty and dominion, now, henceforth, and for
          ever more. Amen, Amen."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the
          fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with you all, to comfort under, and
          deliver you from tribulation; to preserve you to your respective place
          of abode; and when there, to keep you in his fear, that you may live
          to his glory; that to live may be Christ's, and to die by your eternal
          gain; so that you may live with him through eternal ages, and sing
          Hallelujahs to him for ever. Amen."<br />
