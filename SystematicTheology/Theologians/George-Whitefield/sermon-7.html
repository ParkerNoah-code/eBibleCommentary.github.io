          Psalm 55:45 -- "That they might observe his statutes and keep his
          laws."
        </p>
        <p>
          Men, brethren, and fathers, and all ye to whom I am about to preach
          the kingdom of God, I suppose you need not be informed, that being
          indispensably obliged to be absent on your late thanksgiving day, I
          could not show my obedience to the governor's proclamation, as my own
          inclination led me, or as might justly be expected from, and demanded
          of me. But as the occasion of that day's thanksgiving is yet, and I
          trust ever will be, fresh in our memory, I cannot think that a
          discourse on that subject can even now be altogether unseasonable. I
          take it for granted, further, that you need not be informed, that
          among the various motives which are generally urged to enforce
          obedience to the divine commands, that of love is the most powerful
          and cogent. The terrors of the law ma affright and awe, but love
          dissolves and melts the heart. "The love of Christ," says the great
          apostle of the Gentiles, "constraineth us." Nay, love is so absolutely
          necessary for those that name the name of Christ, that without it,
          their obedience cannot truly be stiled evangelical, or be acceptable
          in the sight of God. "Although, (says the apostle) I bestow all my
          goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burnt, and
          have not charity," (i.e. unless unfeigned love to God, and to mankind
          for his great name's sake, be the principle of such actions, howsoever
          it may benefit others) it profiteth me nothing." This is the constant
          language of the lively oracles of God. And, from them it is equally
          plain, that nothing has a greater tendency to beget and excite such an
          obediential love in us, than a serious and frequent consideration of
          the manifold mercies we receive time after time from the bands of our
          heavenly Father. The royal psalmist, who had the honor of being
          stiled, "the man after God's own heart," had an abundant experience of
          this. Hence it is, that whilst he is musing on the divine goodness,
          the fire of divine love kindles in his soul; and, out of the abundance
          of his heart, his mouth speaketh such grateful and ecstatic language
          as this, "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his mercies? Bless
          the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name."
          And why? "who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy
          diseases, who redeemeth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee
          with loving kindness and tender mercies." And when the same holy man
          of God had a mind to stir up the people of the Jews to set about a
          national reformation, as the most weighty and prevailing argument he
          could make use of for that purpose, he lays before them, as it were,
          in a draught, many national mercies, and distinguishing deliverances,
          which have been conferred upon and wrought out for them, by the most
          high God. The psalm to which the words of our text belong, is a
          pregnant proof of this; it being a kind of epitome or compendium of
          the whole Jewish history: at least it contains an enumeration of man
          signal and extraordinary blessings the Israelites had received from
          God, and also the improvement they were in duty bound to make of them,
          "Observe his statues and keep his laws."
        </p>
        <p>
          To run through all the particulars of the psalm, or draw a parallel
          (which might with great ease and justice be done) between God's
          dealings with us and the Israelites of old; To enumerate all the
          national mercies bestowed upon, and remarkable deliverances wrought
          out for the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, from the infant
          state of William the Norman to their present manhood, and more than
          Augustan, under the auspicious reign of our rightful Sovereign King
          George the second; howsoever pleasing and profitable it might be at
          any other time, would, at this juncture, prove, if not an irksome, yet
          an unreasonable undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occasion of the late solemnity, I mean the suppression of a most
          horrid and unnatural rebellion, will afford more than sufficient
          matter for a discourse of this nature, and furnish us with abundant
          motives to love and obey that glorious Jehovah, who giveth salvation
          unto kings, and delivers his people from the hurtful sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need I make an apology, before this auditory, if, in order to see the
          greatness of our late deliverance, I should remind you of the many
          unspeakable blessings which we have for a course of years enjoyed,
          during the reign of his present Majesty, and the gentle, mile
          administration under which we live? Without justly incurring the
          censure of giving flattering titles, I believe all who have eyes to
          see, and ears to hear, and are but a little acquainted with our public
          affairs, must acknowledge, that we have one of the best of Kings. It
          is now above nineteen years since he began to reign over us. And yet,
          was he seated on a royal throne, and were all his subjects placed
          before him, was he to address them as Samuel once addressed the
          Israelites, "Behold here I am, old and gray-headed, witness against me
          before the Lord, whose ox have I taken? Or whose ass have I taken? Or
          whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed?" They must, if they
          would do him justice, make the same answer as was given to Samuel,
          "Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us." What Tertulius, by way
          of flattery, said to Felix, may with the strictest justice be applied
          to our sovereign, "By thee we enjoy great quietness, and very worthy
          deeds have been done unto our nation by thy providence." He has been
          indeed Peter Patria, a father to our country, and though old and
          gray-headed, has jeopardized his precious life for us in the high
          places of the field. Nor has he less deserved the great and glorious
          title, which the Lord promises, that kings should sustain in the
          latter days, I mean, "a nursing father of the church." For not only
          the Church of England, as by law established, but all denominations of
          Christians whatsoever, have enjoyed their religious as well as civil
          liberties. As there has been no authorized oppression in the state, so
          there has been no publicly allowed persecution in the church. We
          breathe indeed in free air? As free (if not better) both as to
          temporals and spirituals, as any nation under heaven. Nor is the
          prospect likely to terminate in his majesty's death, which I pray God
          to defer. Our princesses are disposed of to Protestant powers. And we
          have great reason to be assured, that the present heir apparent, and
          his consort, are like minded with their royal father. And I cannot
          help thinking, that it is a peculiar blessing vouchsafed us by the
          King of kings, that his present Majesty has been continued so long
          among us. For now, his immediate successor (though his present
          situation obliges him, as it were, to lie dormant) has great and
          glorious opportunities, which we have reason to think he daily
          improves, of observing and weighing the national affairs, considering
          the various steps and turns of government, and consequently of laying
          in a large fund of experience, to make him a wise and great prince, if
          ever God should call him to sway the British scepter. Happy art thou,
          O England! Happy art thou, O America, who on every side art thus
          highly favored!
        </p>
        <p>
          But, alas! How soon would this happy scene have shifted, and a
          melancholy gloomy prospect have succeeded in its room, had the revels
          gained their point, and a popish abjured pretender been forced upon
          the British throne! For, supposing his birth not to be spurious, (as
          we have great reason to think it really was) what could we expect from
          one, descended from a father, who, when Duke of York, put all Scotland
          into confusion; and afterwards, when crowned King of England, for his
          arbitrary and tyrannical government, both in church and state, was
          justly obliged to abdicate the throne, by the assertors of British
          liberty? Or, supposing the horrid plot, first hatched in hell, and
          afterwards nursed at Rome, had taken place? Supposing, I say, the old
          Pretender should have obtained the triple crown, and have transferred
          his pretended title (as it is reported he has done) to his eldest son,
          what was all this for, but that, by being advanced to the popedom, he
          might rule both son and subjects with less control, and by their
          united interest, keep the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and
          Ireland, in greater vassalage to the see of Rome? Ever since this
          unnatural rebellion broke out, I have looked upon the young Pretender
          as the phaeton (vehicle) of the present age. He is ambitiously and
          presumptuously aiming to seat himself in the throne of our rightful
          sovereign King George, which he is no more capable of keeping, than
          Phaetan was to guide the chariot of the sun; and had he succeeded in
          his attempt, like him, would only have set the world on fire. It is
          true, to do him justice, he has deserved well of the Church of Rome,
          and, in all probability, will hereafter be canonized amongst the noble
          order of their fictitious saints. But, with what an iron rod we might
          expect to have been bruised, had his troops been victorious, may
          easily be gathered from these cruel orders said to be found in the
          pockets of some of his officers, "Give no quarters to the Elector's
          troops." Add to this, that there was great reason to suspect, that,
          upon the first news of the success of the rebels, a general massacre
          was intended. So that if the Lord had not been on our side, Great
          Britain, not to say America, would, in a few weeks or months, have
          been an Akeldama, a field of blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, was a Popish pretender to rule over us, instead of being
          represented by a free parliament, and governed by laws made by their
          consent, as we now are; we should shortly have had only the shadow of
          one, and it may be no parliament at all. This is the native product of
          a Popish government, and what the unhappy family, from which this
          young adventurer pretends he descended, has always aimed at. Arbitrary
          principles he has sucked in with his mother's milk, and if he had been
          so honest, instead of that immature motto upon his standard, Tandem
          triumphant, only to have put, Sret pro ratient Vahmitat, he had given
          us a short, but true portrait of the nature of his intended, but
          blessed be God, now defeated reign. And why should I mention, that the
          sinking of the national debt, or rending away the funded property of
          the people, and the dissolution of the present happy union between the
          two kingdoms, would have been the immediate consequences of his
          success, as he himself declares in his second manifesto, dated from
          Holy-read House? These are evils, and great ones too; but then they
          are only evils of a temporary nature. They chiefly concern the body,
          and must necessarily terminate in the grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, alas! What an inundation of spiritual mischiefs, would soon have
          overflowed the Church, and what unspeakable danger should we and our
          posterity have been reduced to in respect to our better parts, our
          precious and immortal souls? How soon would whole swarms of monks,
          dominicans and friars, like so many locusts, have overspread and
          plagued the nation; with what winged speed would foreign titular
          bishops have posted over, in order to take possession of their
          respective fees? How quickly would our universities have been filled
          with youths who have been sent abroad by their Popish parents, in
          order to drink in all the superstitions of the church of Rome? What a
          speedy period would have been put to societies of all kinds, for
          promoting Christian knowledge, and propagating the gospel in foreign
          parts? How soon would have our pulpits have every where been filled
          with these old antichristian doctrines, free-will, meriting by works,
          transubstantiation, purgatory, works of supererogation,
          passive-obedience, non-resistance, and all the other abominations of
          the whore of Babylon? How soon would our Protestant charity schools in
          England, Scotland and Ireland, have been pulled down, our Bibles
          forcibly taken from us, and ignorance every where set up as the mother
          of devotion? How soon should we have been deprived of that invaluable
          blessing, liberty of conscience, and been obliged to commence (what
          they falsely call) catholics, or submit to all the tortures which a
          bigoted zeal, guided by the most cruel principles, could possibly
          invent? How soon would that mother of harlots have made herself once
          more drunk with the blood of the saints? And the whole tribe even of
          free-thinkers themselves, been brought to this dilemma, either to die
          martyrs for (although I never yet heard of one that did so) or,
          contrary to all their most avowed principles, renounce their great
          Diana, unassisted, unenlightened reason? But I must have done, lest
          while I am speaking against antichrist, I should unawares fall myself,
          and lead my hearers into an antichristian spirit. True and undefiled
          religion will regulate our zeal, and teach us to treat even the man of
          sin with no harsher language than that which the angel gave to his
          grand employer Satan, "The Lord rebuke thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Glory be to God's great name! The Lord has rebuked him; and that too
          at a time when we had little reason to expect such a blessing at God's
          hands. My dear hearers, neither the present frame of my heart, nor the
          occasion of your late solemn meeting, lead me to give you a detail of
          our public vices. Though, alas! They are so many, so notorious, and
          withal of such a crimson-dye, that a gospel minister would not be
          altogether inexcusable, was he, even on such a joyful occasion, to
          lift up his voice like a trumpet, to show the British nation their
          transgression, and the people of America their sin. However, though I
          would not cast a dismal shade upon the pleasing picture the cause of
          our late rejoicings set before us; yet thus much may, and ought to be
          said, that as God has not dealt so bountifully with any people as with
          us, so no nation under heaven has dealt more ungratefully with Him. We
          have been like Capernaum, lifted up to heaven in privileges, and for
          the abuse of them, like her, have deserved to be thrust down into
          hell. How well soever it may be with us, in respect to our civil and
          ecclesiastical constitution, yet in regard to our morals, Isaiah's
          description of the Jewish polity is too applicable, "The whole head is
          sick, the whole heart is faint; from the crown of the head to the sole
          of our feet, we are full of wounds and bruises, and putrifying sores."
          We have, Jeshurun-like, waxed fat and kicked. We have played the
          harlot against God, both in regard to principles and practices. "Our
          gold is become dim, and our fine gold changed." We have crucified the
          Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. Nay, Christ has been
          wounded in the house of his friends. And every thing long ago seemed
          to threaten an immediate storm. But, O the long-suffering and goodness
          of God to us-ward! When all things seemed ripe for destruction, and
          matters were come to such a crisis, that God's praying people began to
          think, that though Noah, Daniel and Job, were living, they would only
          deliver their own souls; yet then in the midst of judgment the Most
          High remembered mercy, and when a popish enemy was breaking in upon us
          like a flood, the Lord himself graciously lifted up a standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          This to me does not seem to be one of the most unfavorable
          circumstances which have attended this mighty deliverance; nor do I
          think you will look upon it as a circumstance altogether unworthy your
          observation. Had this cockatrice indeed been crushed in the egg, and
          the young Pretender driven back upon his first arrival, it would
          undoubtedly have been a great blessing. But not so great as that for
          which you lately assembled to give God thanks; for then his Majesty
          would not have had so good an opportunity of knowing his enemies, or
          trying his friends. The British subjects would in a manner have lost
          the fairest occasion that ever offered to express their loyalty and
          gratitude to the rightful sovereign. France would not have been so
          greatly humbled; nor such an effectual stop have been put, as we trust
          there now is, to any such further Popish plot, to rob us of all that
          is near and dear to us. "Out of the eater therefore hath come forth
          meat, and out of the strong hath come forth sweetness." The
          Pretender's eldest son is suffered not only to land in the North-West
          Highlands in Scotland, but in a little while he becomes a great band.
          This for a time is not believed, but treated as a thing altogether
          incredible. The friends of the government in those parts, not for want
          of loyalty, but of sufficient authority to take up arms, could not
          resist him. He is permitted to pass on with his terrible banditti,
          and, like the comet that was lately seen, spreads his baleful
          influences all around him. He is likewise permitted to gain a
          short-lived triumph by a victory over a body of our troops at
          Prestan-Pans, and to take a temporary possession of the metropolis of
          Scotland. Of this he makes his boast, and informs the public, that
          "Providence had hitherto favored him with wonderful success, led him
          in the way to victory, and to the capital of the ancient kingdom,
          though he came without foreign aid." Nay, he is further permitted to
          press into the very heart of England. But now the Almighty interposes.
          Hitherto he was to go, and no further. Here were his malicious designs
          to be staid. His troops of s sudden are driven back. Away they post to
          the Highlands, and there they are suffered not only to increase, but
          also to collect themselves into a large body, that having, as it were,
          what Caligula once wished Rome had, but one neck, they might be cut
          off with one blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, manner, and instruments of this victory, deserves our
          notice. It was on a general fast-day, when the clergy and good people
          of Scotland were lamenting the disloyalty of their persidious
          countrymen, and, like Moses, lifting up their hands, that Amalek might
          not prevail. The victory was total and decisive. Little blood was
          spilt on the side of the Royalists. And, to crown all, Duke William,
          his Majesty's youngest son, has the honor of first driving back, and
          then defeating the rebel-army. A prince, who in his infancy and youth,
          gave early proofs of an uncommon bravery and nobleness of mind; a
          prince, whose courage has increased with his years. Who returned
          wounded from the battle of Dettingen, behaved with surprising bravery
          at Fontenoy, and now, by a conduct and magnanimity becoming the high
          office he sustains, like his glorious predecessor the Prince of
          Orange, has delivered three kingdoms from the dread of popish cruelty,
          and arbitrary power. What renders it still more remarkable is, The day
          on which his Highness gained this victory, was the day after his
          birthday, when he was entering on the 26th year of his age; and when
          Sullivan, one of the Pretender's privy-council, like another
          Abitaphel, advised the rebels to give our soldiers battle, presuming
          they were surfeited and over-charged with their yesterday's
          rejoicings, and consequently unfit to make any great stand against
          them. But, glory be to God, who catches the wise in their own
          craftiness! His counsel, like Ahitaphel's, proves abortive. Both
          General and soldiers were prepared to meet them. "God taught their
          hands to war, and their fingers to fight," and brought the Duke, after
          a deserved slaughter of some thousands of the rebels, with most of his
          brave soldiers, victorious from the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we then take a distinct view of this notable transaction, and trace
          it in all the particular circumstances that have attended it, I
          believe we must with one heart and voice confess, that if it be a
          mercy for a state to be delivered from a worse than a Catiline's
          conspiracy, or a church to be rescued from a hotter than a Dioclestan
          persecution; if it be a mercy to be delivered from a religion that
          turns plough-shares into swords, and pruning-hooks into spears, and
          makes it meritorious to shed Protestant blood; if it be a mercy to
          have all our present invaluable privileges, both in church and state
          secured to us more than ever; if it be a mercy to have these great
          things done for us, at a season, when for our crying sins, both church
          and state justly deserved to be overturned; and if it be a mercy to
          have all this brought about for us, under God, by one of the
          blood-royal, a prince acting with an experience far above his years;
          if any, or all of these are mercies, then have you lately commemorated
          one of the greatest mercies that ever the glorious God vouchsafed to
          the British nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And shall we not rejoice and give thanks? Should we refuse, would not
          the stones cry out against us? Rejoice then we may and ought: but, O
          let our rejoicing be in the Lord, and run in a religious channel.
          This, we find, has been the practice of God's people in all ages. When
          he was pleased, with a mighty hand, and out-stretched arm to lead the
          Israelites through the Red Sea, as on dry ground, "Then sang Moses and
          the children of Israel; and Miriam the prophetess, the sister of
          Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after
          her. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord; for he hath
          triumphed gloriously." When God subdued Jabin, the King of Canaan,
          before the children of Israel, "then sang Deborah and Barak on that
          day, saying, "Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel." When the
          ark was brought back out of the hands of the Philistines, David,
          though a king, danced before it. And, to mention but one instance
          more, which may serve as a general directory to us on this and
          such-like occasions: when the great Head of the church had rescued his
          people from the general massacre intended to be executed upon them by
          a cruel and ambitious Haman, "Mordecai sent letters unto all the Jews
          that were in all the provinces of the King Ahaserus, both nigh and
          far, to establish among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day
          of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same yearly, as the
          days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which
          was turned unto them from sorrow unto joy, and from mourning into a
          good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of
          sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor." And why
          should wee not to and do likewise?
        </p>
        <p>
          And shall we not also, on such an occasion, express our gratitude to,
          and make honorable mention of, those worthies who have signalized
          themselves, and been ready to sacrifice both lives and fortunes at
          this critical juncture?
        </p>
        <p>
          This would be to act the part of those ungrateful Israelites, who are
          branded in the book of God, for not showing kindness to the house of
          "Jerub-Baal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he
          showed unto Israel." Even a Pharaoh could prefer a deserving Joseph,
          Ahasuerus a Mordecai, and Nebuchadnezzar a Daniel, when made
          instruments of signal service to themselves and people. "My heart,
          says Deborah, is towards (i.e. I have a particular veneration and
          regard for) the Governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly.
          And blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be;
          for she put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's
          hammer, and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,
          when she had pierced and stricken through his temples." And shall we
          not say, "Blessed above men let his Royal Highness the Duke of
          Cumberland be; for through his instrumentality, the great and glorious
          Jehovah hath brought might things to pass?" Should not our hearts be
          towards the worthy Archbishop of Tirk, the Royal Hunters, and those
          other English heroes who offered themselves so willingly? Let the
          names of Blakeney, Bland and Rea, and all those who waxed valiant in
          fight on this important occasion, live for ever in the British annals.
          And let the name of that great, that incomparable brave soldier of the
          King, and a good soldier of Jesus Christ, Colonel Gardiner, (excuse me
          if I here drop a tear; he was my intimate friend) let his name, I say,
          be had in everlasting remembrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, after all, is there not an infinitely greater debt of gratitude
          and praise due from us, on this occasion, to Him that is higher than
          the highest, even the King of kings and Lord of Lords, the blessed and
          only Potentate? Is not his arm, his strong and mighty arm, (what
          instruments soever may have been made use of) that hath brought us
          this salvation? And may I not therefore address you, in the exulting
          language of the beginning of this psalm, from which we have taken our
          text? "O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his
          deeds among the people. Sing unto Him; sing psalms unto him; talk ye
          of all his wondrous works; glory ye in his holy name; remember his
          marvelous work which he hath done."
        </p>
        <p>
          But shall we put off our good and gracious benefactor with mere lip-
          service? God forbid. Your worthy Governor has honored God in his late
          excellent proclamation, and God will honor him. But shall our thanks
          terminate with the day? No, in no wise. Our text reminds us of a more
          noble sacrifice, and points out to us the great end the Almighty
          Jehovah proposes, in bestowing such signal favors upon a people, "That
          they should observe his statutes, and keep his laws."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the return we are all taught to pray, that we may make to the
          Most High God, the Father of mercies, in the daily office or our
          church, "That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we may
          show forth his praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by
          giving up ourselves to his service, and by walking before him in
          holiness and righteousness all our days." O that these words were the
          real language of all the use them! O that these were in us such a
          mind! How soon would our enemies then flee before us? And God, even
          our own God, would yet give us more abundant blessings!
        </p>
        <p>
          And why should not we "observe God's statutes, and keep his laws?"
          Dare we say, that any of his commands are grievous? Is not Christ's
          yoke, to a renewed soul, as far as renewed, easy; and his burden
          comparatively light? May I not appeal to the most refined reasoner
          whether the religion of Jesus Christ be not a social religion? Whether
          the Moral Law, as explained by the Lord Jesus in the gospel, has not a
          natural tendency to promote the present good and happiness of a whole
          commonwealth, supposing they were obedient to them, as well as the
          happiness of every individual? From when come wars and fighting
          amongst us? From what fountain do all those evil, which the present
          and past ages have groaned under, flow, but from a neglect of the laws
          and statues of our great and all-wise law-giver Jesus of Nazareth?
          Tell me, ye men of letters, whether Lycurgus or Solon, Pythagoras or
          Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Cicero, or all the ancient lawgivers and
          heathen moralists, put them all together, ever published a system of
          ethics, any way worthy to be compared with the glorious system laid
          down in that much despised book, (to use Sir Richard Steel's
          expression) emphatically called, the Scriptures? Is not the divine
          image and superscription written upon every precept of the gospel? Do
          they not shine with a native intrinsic luster? And, though many things
          in them are above, yet, is there any thing contrary to the strictest
          laws of right reason? Is not Jesus Christ, in scripture, stiled the
          Word, the Logos, the Reason? And is not his service a reasonable
          service? What if there be mysteries in his religion? Are they not
          without all controversy great and glorious? Are they n9ot mysteries of
          godliness, and worthy of that God who reveals them? Nay, is it not the
          greatest mystery, that men, who pretend to reason, and call themselves
          philosophers, who search into the arcana natura, and consequently find
          a mystery in every blade of grass, should yet be so irrational as to
          decry all mysteries in religion? Where is the scribe? Where is the
          wise? Where is the disputer against the Christian revelation? Does not
          every thing without and within us, conspire to prove its divine
          original? And would not self-interest, if there was no other motive,
          excite us to observe God's statutes, and keep his laws?
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, considered as a Protestant people, do we not lie under the
          greatest obligations of any nation under heaven, to pay a cheerful,
          unanimous, universal, persevering obedience to the divine commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wonderful and surprising manner of God's bringing about a
          Reformation, in the reign of King Henry the Eighth; his carrying it on
          in the blessed reign of King Edward the Sixth; his delivering us out
          of the bloody hands of Queen Mary, and destroying the Spanish
          invincible armads, under her immediate Protestant successor Queen
          Elizabeth, his discovery of the popish plot under King James; the
          glorious revolution by King William, and, to come nearer to our own
          times, his driving away four thousand five hundred Spaniards, from a
          weak (though important) frontier colony, when they had, in a manner,
          actually taken possession of it; his giving us Louisbourg, one of the
          strongest fortresses of our enemies, contrary to all human
          probability, but the other day, into our hands: these, I say, with the
          victory which you have lately been commemorating, are such national
          mercies, not to mention any more, as will render us utterly
          inexcusable, if they do not produce a national Reformation, and incite
          us all, with one heart, to keep God's statutes, and observe his laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need I remind you further, in order to excite in you a greater
          diligence to comply with the intent of the text, that though the
          storm, in a great measure, is abated by his Royal Highness's late
          success, yet we dare not say, it is altogether blown over?
        </p>
        <p>
          The clouds may again return after the rain; and the few surviving
          rebels (which I pray God avert) may yet be suffered to make head
          against us. We are still engaged in a bloody, and, in all probability,
          a tedious war, with two of the most inveterate enemies to the
          interests of Great- Britain. And, though I cannot help thinking, that
          their present intentions are so iniquitous, their conduct so
          persidious, and their schemes so directly derogatory to the honor of
          the Most High God, that he will certainly humble them in the end, yet,
          as all things in this life happen alike to all, they may for a time,
          be dreadful instruments of scourging us. If not, God has other arrows
          in his quiver to smite us with, besides the French King, his Catholic
          Majesty, or an abjured Pretender. Not only the sword, but plague,
          pestilence, and famine, are under the divine command. Who knows but he
          may say to them all, "Pass through these lands?" A fatal murrain has
          lately swept away abundance of cattle at home and abroad. A like
          epidemical disease may have a commission to seize our persons as well
          as our beasts. Thus God dealt with the Egyptians: who dare say, he
          will not deal so with us? Has he not already given some symptoms of
          it? What great numbers upon the continent have been lately taken off
          by the bloody-flux, small-pox, and yellow-fever? Who can tell what
          further judgments are yet in store? However, this is certain, the rod
          is yet hanging over us: and I believe it will be granted on all sides,
          that if such various dispensations of mercy and judgment do not teach
          the inhabitants of any land to learn righteousness, they will only
          ripen them for a greater ruin. Give my leave, therefore, to dismiss
          you at this time with that solemn awful warning and exhortation, with
          which the venerable Samuel, on a public occasion, took leave of the
          people of Israel: "Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth, with
          all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
          But if ye shall still do wickedly, [I will not say as the Prophet did,
          You shall be consumed; but] ye know not but you may provoke the Lord
          Almighty to consume both you and your king." Which God of his infinite
          mercy prevent, for the sake of Jesus Christ: to whom, with the Father,
          and the Holy Ghost, three persons, but one God, be all honor and
          glory, now and for evermore. Amen, Amen.
