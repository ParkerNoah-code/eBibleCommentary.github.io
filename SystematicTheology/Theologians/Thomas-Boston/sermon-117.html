<p align="justify">Psalm 147:11, "The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear 
    him, in those that hope in his mercy."</p>
<p align="justify">THERE are times of danger in which the event is very 
    doubtful, but even then the safety and success will always be on the side 
    the Lord casts them. In consequence, it is an important question, How may we 
    engage him on our side? Certain it is, his pleasure lies not in created 
    strength. Horse and foot, courage and strength, may be on the side which God 
    will disown, and which shall be worsted: "By strength," says he, "shall no 
    man prevail," 1 Samuel 2:9. His pleasure is in the strength of grace: "He 
    will keep the feet of his saints;" or, as it is expressed in the text, "The 
    Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his 
    mercy."—In which words we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The character of those whose part the Lord will take 
    in all their trials and troubles, and in all their encounters with their 
    enemies. The first part of their character is, they are fearers of God. They 
    have the awe of his majesty upon their spirits.—The second is that they hope 
    in, or rather for his mercy. They, in a becoming manner, wait and patiently 
    seek for relief from God, and that in the way of mercy through Christ, not 
    for anything in themselves.—Observe next the mixture of these parts of their 
    character: They do not only fear God but hope in him; for fear without hope 
    will sink into raging despair. They not only hope, but fear, for hope 
    without fear will turn into presumption. These two God has joined together, 
    let not us put them asunder.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The privileges of these persons, whoever may be 
    displeased with them, and however much they may be displeased with 
    themselves, God takes pleasure in them. He accepts their persons, and their 
    services, and he will show himself to be on their side. They shall not hope 
    in vain; however hapless their case be in itself, they shall get a merciful 
    relief in due time.</p>
<p align="justify">From these words, observe this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. The Lord takes pleasure in those, who, whatever 
    case they be in, entertain a holy fear of him, with a kindly hope in his 
    mercy.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing which, it is intended,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Shortly to describe this holy fear, that in all cases 
    ought to be entertained, with a hope of the Lord's mercy.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To describe that kindly hope of his mercy, to be 
    entertained in all cases, along with this holy fear.</p>
<p align="justify">III. To show the necessity of keeping up this holy fear 
    and kindly hope in all cases together in the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To show what is that pleasure the Lord takes in such.</p>
<p align="justify">V. To confirm the doctrine of the text.</p>
<p align="justify">VI. To make a practical improvement of the different 
    parts of the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">I am, then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Shortly to describe this holy fear, that in all cases 
    ought to be entertained, with a hope of the Lord's mercy. This fear of God 
    is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. An awe and dread of his majesty and transcendent 
    greatness: Psalm 89:6, 7, "For who in the Heaven can be compared unto the 
    Lord? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord? God is 
    greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be held in 
    reverence of all them that are about him." With this the lightness and 
    vanity of the heart is to be repressed. The soul must entertain high and 
    honorable thoughts of God, as a sovereign of independent being, in whom all 
    perfections do concenter, must look up to the clouds, and behold him on his 
    throne in Heaven, and so bring itself thereby to a profound reverence of his 
    greatness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A reverence of his absolute, his unlimited authority 
    and power: "Fear him," said Jesus, "who, after he has killed, has power to 
    cast into Hell; yes, I say unto you, fear him," Luke 12:5; he can command us 
    whatever he will, and dispose of us as he pleases. Let us have a reverential 
    regard to the uncontrollable scepter he sways over all creatures. Since he 
    does in Heaven and in earth what seems good unto him, and none can stay his 
    hand, or say unto him, What do you? we should silently submit to his 
    disposals.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A fear of offending him in anything: Psalm 4:4, "Stand 
    in awe, and sin not." This is a fear, and caution, and circumspection, which 
    we should always carry about and never lay aside. We walk amidst many 
    snares; Satan and a corrupt heart are ready to entangle us; but God cannot 
    away with sin; it is the only offence we can give him. He is well pleased to 
    see us afraid of offending him, to see the poor sinner affrighted at 
    everything that is provoking to him, and keeping up a holy tenderness this 
    way.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A fear of imputing iniquity to him, or harboring hard 
    and unfitting thoughts of his majesty, Job 1:22," In all this Job sinned 
    not, nor charged God foolishly." The proud heart casting off the fear of 
    God, arraigns and condemns the conduct of holy Providence as rigorous and 
    unrighteous; and so murmers against the Lord. But holy fear silences the 
    mutiny of these unruly passions, and says, "He does all things well, is holy 
    and righteous in all his ways and works."</p>
<p align="justify">5. A dread of going out of his way for help, however hard 
    the case be: Isaiah 8:13, 14, "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself, and let 
    him be your fear, and let him be your dread; and he shall be for a 
    sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both 
    the houses of Israel; for a gin and for a snare, to the inhabitants of 
    Jerusalem; and many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and 
    be taken." Holy fear takes off the wheels of the chariot of impatience and 
    unsanctified haste, which drives furiously to get out of that case in which 
    infinite wisdom has placed us. The soul dare not adventure to shake off the 
    yoke, until the Lord put to his own hand and take it off.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, A dread of his holy hand in his judgments: Amos 
    3:8, "The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord God has spoken, who 
    can but prophecy?" This fear keeps the heart from slight thoughts of them, 
    and furnishes awful thoughts of a smiting God, the weight of whose hand no 
    man is able to bear. And there is here a dread of the hand of the Lord lying 
    on their person for the past: Hebrews 12:5, "My son, despise not you the 
    chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him." The man 
    notices the stroke, and what impressions of anger are engraved on it, and so 
    he puts his mouth in the dust, if so there may be hope, Lamentations 3:29. 
    Whatever he meets with, he takes it as from the Lord, and reverences the 
    hand that smites.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A dread of what the Lord may inflict upon him: Psalm 
    119:120, "My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of your 
    judgments." The fearer of the Lord sees, that whatever be his stroke, it is 
    less than his deserving. They say as Ezra, chapter 9:13, "You, our God, has 
    punished less than our iniquities deserve;" and therefore submit themselves, 
    lest the Lord make the stroke greater, and punish us seven times more.—Let 
    us now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Describe that kindly hope of his mercy, to be 
    entertained in all cases along with this holy fear. It is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A firm persuasion of the good, gracious, and bountiful 
    nature of God, who delights not in the misery of his creatures; Psalm 25:8, 
    "Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach sinners in the way." 
    Ezekiel 18:23, "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says 
    the Lord God; and not that he should return from his ways and live?" God is 
    the fountain of all goodness to be found in man or angel, and so is himself 
    a boundless ocean of goodness. He loves to have poor sinners entertaining 
    these kindly thoughts of him. And well may they do so, even under hard 
    pressures, for God lays not on man more than is meet or right, Job 34:23; 
    and even this he does with a kind of holy reluctance, for "he does not 
    afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men," Lamentations 3:33.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A hope of mercy to all their unrighteousness, through 
    Christ. This is the great hope, called the hope of the gospel, Colossians 
    1:23. For it is the main hope purchased by Christ to lost sons of Adam, and 
    held forth to them in the gospel, Hebrews 8:12, "I will be merciful to their 
    unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no 
    more." To cast away this hope, is at once to throw dishonor on the mercy of 
    the Father, and the blood of the Son, and the efficacy of his Spirit; to 
    cast it away, is to please Satan, and to ruin our own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A hope of good by their afflictions, trials, and 
    troubles: Romans 8:28, "And we know that all things work together for good 
    to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." 
    It is the Lord's ordinary way to bring his people nearer him by afflictions: 
    "Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now have I kept your word," 
    Psalm 119:67; yes, by this way, also, does he bring in those that are 
    strangers to him, Hosea 5:15, "I will go and return to my place, until they 
    acknowledge their offence and seek my face; in their afflictions they will 
    seek me early." When the Lord will not use a rod upon a person, that is a 
    terrible sign; but there is always hope when the Lord is at pains with a 
    rod; and to hope for this good, is the way to advance it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A hope of support and protection under their 
    afflictions: Hebrews 13:5, 6, "He has said, I will never leave you nor 
    forsake you; so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will 
    not fear what man shall do unto me." The Lord can carry persons through deep 
    waters, and yet keep them from sinking, for he is the lifter up of the head. 
    However high the waters swell, they are still under the check of him whom 
    the winds and the seas obey. The everlasting arms underneath, though not 
    seen in the time, secure the sinner from sinking to the ground, and bring 
    him safe ashore. Now, faith and hope is the way to bring in that support.</p>
<p align="justify">5. A hope of seasonable relief, on having such 
    deliverance in due time, as shall be best for God's honor and their good: 
    Psalm 42:5, "Why are you cast down, O my soul! and why are you disquieted in 
    me? Hope you in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his 
    countenance." The Lord has many ways of giving relief from trouble. 
    Sometimes he makes the storm blow off, and restores a calm; sometimes he 
    hides them in the grave, and gives them a blessed exchange, for an afflicted 
    life in this world, a joyful happy life in another world. It becomes us to 
    hope for his mercy, in whatever way he may send it: Hebrews 10:35, "Cast not 
    away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward."</p>
<p align="justify">6. A hope of eternal life in a better world: 1 Peter 
    1:13, "Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the 
    end, (for what?) for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the 
    revelation of Jesus Christ." These hopes will never please God that are 
    confined to the things of this world. He has provided and offers better 
    things to poor sinners; there is a hope laid up for us in Heaven, Colossians 
    1:5. While that hope remains firm and well grounded, happy is the soul, 
    whatever be its case; and since he offers it, and makes it over to whoever 
    will embrace Christ, that hope should never be cast away while we are here.</p>
<p align="justify">7. A waiting for the mercy needed and desired: Psalm 
    27:14, "Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your 
    heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." The hoping soul will wait for God, and 
    bear until his time come, however long it may seem to be. He has the times 
    and seasons in his own hand. He knows what is the fittest time for giving a 
    mercy, and we must leave it in his own hand, and wait on him: "Be patient 
    therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord: behold the gardener waits 
    for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience, until he receive 
    the former and the latter rain; be you also patient, establish your hearts, 
    for the coming of the Lord draws near."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, All this hope is to be grounded only on the free 
    grace of God through Jesus Christ, and the precious promises of the word, 
    held forth to us in him, 1 Peter 1:13, quoted already. Therefore it is 
    called hope for his mercy: "Remember your word unto your servant, upon which 
    you have caused me to hope." Psalm 119:49. If hope be founded on any work or 
    merit in ourselves, or be not bounded by the promise, that is to say, if we 
    hope for what God has not promised, then it cannot be pleasing to him; so 
    that his hope follows faith's embracing Christ in the gospel, and resigning 
    the soul to the Lord; which being done, hope goes and stands upon the 
    watch-tower, to behold and wait for all promised good things coming with 
    Christ from God in due time to the soul.—We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To show the necessity of keeping up this holy fear 
    and kindly hope together in all cases.—They are necessary to keep an even 
    balance in the soul at all times, ready to fall either to the one hand or 
    the other. God's voice to us, is, Isaiah 30:21, "This is the way, walk in 
    it, when you turn to the right hand, and when you tarn to the left." Bat, O! 
    how apt are we to go off the road, especially if we are obliged to traverse 
    the mountains of darkness and affliction, of desertion and temptation. But 
    this fear and hope will hedge as on every hand, that we torn not to the 
    right hand or to the left; whereas, if either be wanting, there is a wide 
    gape, at which we will readily fall into the mire.—But more particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">1. They keep the soul from splitting on rocks on both 
    hands. We are in this world as on a sea, therefore had need to take care. 
    The way we pass is beset with two dangerous rooks; one on the left, despair, 
    where thousands split; another on the right, presumption, where ten 
    thousands have been shipwrecked; some fall on them in a dead calm, they are 
    fearless and careless, and before they are aware they dash on the rook of 
    presumption, and go to the bottom; Job 21:13, "They spend their days in 
    wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave." To others a storm arises, 
    they are tossed, grow hopeless, and then split on the rock of despair. 
    Whereas holy fear would carry us safe by the one, and kindly hope by the 
    other, whatever storms blow: "Which hope," says Paul, "we have as an anchor 
    of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the 
    rail," Hebrews 6:19.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They keep the heart in a due mean between carnal 
    security and torturing anxiety. Holy fear keeps men awake, while fearless 
    souls are sleeping within the sea-mark of wrath, not knowing when a wave may 
    come and sweep them away. They may be saying, like the rich man, Soul, you 
    have much goods laid up for many years, take your rest; eat, drink, and be 
    merry. But God may then say, "You fool, this night your soul shall be 
    required of you," Luke 12:19, 20. Kindly hope composes the heart, and calms 
    the disturbed spirit, while others destitute of it are tormenting 
    themselves. Fear keeps from soaring too high, hope from sinking too low.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They keep notably to the duty of praying, which is 
    necessary in all cases, and is a messenger often to be sent to Heaven, 
    especially in times of trouble: Psalm 50:15, "And call upon me in the day of 
    trouble, I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me." Fear stirs up to the 
    duty, hope draws to it. Fear fills the soul with reverence for God, and 
    makes it to be in deep earnest in its addresses; hope guards it against 
    terror and confusion in its applications to the throne. Fear caries off 
    presumptuous confidence; but hope makes it hang upon mercy and grace.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They help on patience and resignation to the will of 
    God, without which no man is master of himself: Luke 21:19, "In you're your 
    patience possess your souls." Hope looks for better things, a calm after a 
    storm; fear tells us, such a stroke, ill carried, may bring on a worse. Thus 
    the soul is in a holy manner both flattered and frightened into contentment 
    with its lot. Thus it is kept from despising the chastening of the Lord, 
    which many do, with their natural courage, and from fainting under his 
    rebukes, as weak-hearted ones are liable to.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They arm us on every hand against our adversary 
    the devil: James 4:7, "Submit yourselves therefore to God; resist the devil, 
    and he will flee from you." There are two things, one of which the devil 
    drives at continually: Either,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To go forward with all ease in the way of sin; for, 
    says the liar, there is no hazard; and thus whole shoals of sinners go on to 
    the pit. But the fear of God will repel this temptation. Or,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Not to offer to return to God, or go to Christ; for, 
    says the murderer, there is no hope. But the kindly hope repels this. By 
    this last he attacks the awakened sinner, and by the former the secure one. 
    Whatever be your case, then, get your souls possessed of this kindly hope 
    and holy fear. Beware of quitting either hope or fear. Are you at ease, and 
    your hope great? O balance it with fear, lest having too much sail without 
    ballast, you suddenly be overcast and overwhelmed. Are you in trouble, and 
    your fears great? O buoy up your souls with hope, lest you sink altogether. 
    For motives, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The want of any of them makes you a prey to your grand 
    enemy, 1 Peter 5:8, "Be sober, be vigilant, for your adversary the devil, as 
    a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist 
    steadfast in the faith." Whichever of the avenues of the soul stand open, 
    the enemy will enter by it; and once he get in, you know not what havoc he 
    may make there. Are you fearless? he will have his snares fitted for that 
    case. Are you hopeless? be sure he will take his advantage of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The safety of the soul in this sinful and ensnaring 
    world depends on your entertaining both. The mariner may easier sail the 
    ocean without his compass, the blind man go over his heights and depths 
    without his guide, than you go through this world without these; for the 
    worst that can befall them is the death of the body, but your souls will be 
    ruined.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The want of either is highly dishonorable to God. 
    Is there a God in Heaven, and will you not fear him? Has his Son died to 
    purchase hope to sinners? and has he declared in his word, that he would 
    have you hope in and for his mercy, and will you not do it? Malachi 1:6, "A 
    son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, 
    where is mine honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? says the Lord 
    of hosts." By the want of fear, you declare you value greatness; and by the 
    want of hope, that you can put no trust in his word.—I come now,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To show what is that pleasure which the Lord takes in 
    such.</p>
<p align="justify">1. He approves them in so doing. The Lord says, You did 
    well that it was in your heart, though Satan may suggest it to be 
    presumption, Psalm 115:11, "You that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; he is 
    their help and their shield." What God requires to be done, he will surely 
    approve of when it is done, this he requires, and therefore will approve of 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He accepts of them; he is well pleased with the 
    persons that do so. The exercise of these graces is a piece of very 
    acceptable service to God, which he takes off sinners' hands for Christ's 
    sake, though it be attended with many imperfections. That unbelief which 
    remains in the hearts of them that fear God, makes them suspect they will be 
    very unwelcome to hope for good at the Lord's hand; but it is a mistake, for 
    such exercise is very pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Lord delights in them that do so. Their name may 
    be Hephzibah, for the Lord delights in them, as a father does in his child, 
    who both fears him, and hopes for good at his hand.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The Lord delights in their persons. Jeremiah 31:20, 
    "Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against 
    him, I do earnestly remember him still, therefore my affections are troubled 
    for him: I will surely have mercy upon him, says the Lord." They are 
    accepted in the beloved; their fear carrying them to Christ, and their hope 
    fixing them upon him as the storehouse of all blessings. Being covered with 
    imputed righteousness, they are all fair and lovely in the eyes of the Lord, 
    there is no spot in them, Song 4:7.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He delights in their graces. Song 4:16, "Let my 
    beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits." Holy fear and 
    hope are the fruits of his own Spirit in the souls of his people, that grow 
    up there as in a garden, being watered with the dew of Heaven. They are 
    leading graces, which bring along with them a train of others, all tending 
    to promote holiness in heart and life.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In their duties. Proverbs 15:8, "The prayer of the 
    upright is his delight." Where the fear of the Lord has place, the duties of 
    religion will get room; the soul will be afraid of neglecting to pay its due 
    homage unto the Lord; and hope being joined thereto, will bring them to the 
    Lord with expectation of good at his hand; and this is the Lord's delight.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) In their company. Song 5:1, "I have come into my 
    garden, my sister, my spouse." He loves to have them near him, hanging about 
    his hand, conversing with him, receiving his word from his month, and making 
    their requests known to him: Song 2:14, "Let me see (says he) your 
    countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your 
    countenance is lovely." The mighty God, who has his higher house in Heaven, 
    has the contrite spirit for his lower house.—I shall now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">V. To confirm the doctrine of the text, or show, that 
    "the Lord takes pleasure in those, whatever case they be in, who entertain a 
    holy fear of him, with a kindly hope in his mercy,"—For this purpose, 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This is answerable and agreeable to the revelation of 
    God's mind in his word, what he has made known of himself both in the law 
    and in the gospel. The fear of God is the great purpose of the law, hope for 
    his mercy through Christ is the great purpose of the gospel. The law was 
    given in such an awful manner, as might fill sinners with the dread of the 
    great Lawgiver; the gospel brings in the blessed hope to lost sinners, so 
    that this fear and hope, answering the design of both, cannot miss of being 
    very pleasing to God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It glorifies God in his glorious perfections, 
    discovered to us in the face of Jesus Christ. The great end of the gospel 
    contrivance is, to show the glory of God in Christ as in a glass: 2 
    Corinthians 4:6, "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, 
    has shined in our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory 
    of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Now, the entertaining of these two, 
    fear and hope, does at once give him the glory of all these. Holy fear gives 
    him the glory of his awful majesty, inflexible justice, infinite power and 
    holiness; kindly hope gives him the glory of his free grace, mercy, love, 
    and goodness: and the joining of these two together gives him the glory of 
    his infinite wisdom, that has found out the way to give vent to both in the 
    sinners' case.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is agreeable to the Spirit's work of grace on the 
    soul, whereby the sinner is first cast down, and then lifted up. The Spirit 
    of God coming to the elect soul, finds it secure, careless, and 
    presumptuous, thinking itself "rich and increased in goods, and standing in 
    need of nothing," Revelation 3:17. The Spirit then discovers what a God, and 
    what a law, the sinner has to do with, and so works this holy fear in the 
    heart. When the soul is awakened, it is ready to despond; and the Spirit, by 
    the doctrines of the gospel, works this hope. Thus the sinner comes and 
    cleaves to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The Lord is very gracious unto such. They are 
    entertained with some off-fallings while they hang about his hand in the 
    ordinances and duties of religion: Psalm 65:4, "We shall be satisfied with 
    the goodness of your house, even of your holy temple." Yes, they are filled 
    as with marrow and fatness; God makes known his secrets to them, even the 
    secrets of his covenant: Psalm 25:14, "The secret of the Lord is with them 
    that fear him, and he will show them his covenant." He shows them also the 
    secrets of his word: Luke 24:32, "And they said one to another, Did not our 
    hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he 
    opened to us the scriptures?" Also the secrets of his works, and the 
    dispensations of his providence. And at length they shall be admitted to the 
    full fruition of him in a better world; they shall enter into the joy of 
    their Lord, and be forever with him.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED<br/>
 </b></p>
<p align="justify">PSALM 147:11, "The Lord takes pleasure in those that fear 
    him, in those that hope in his mercy."</p>
<p align="justify">HAVING, in the preceding discourse, briefly gone through 
    the doctrinal part, it only remains, that, in the</p>
<p align="justify">VI. And last place, I make a practical improvement of the 
    whole; in doing which, I propose to enlarge at considerable length, by 
    adverting to the different parts of this subject.—I begin,</p>
<p align="justify">I. With an use of information. It informs us,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That God in Christ is full of good-will to poor 
    sinners. Since he will have them thus to depend upon him as children on a 
    father, fearing and hoping in him; he it is who will have all men to be 
    saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, 1 Timothy 2:4. Is not this a 
    plain proof that he has no pleasure in the death of him that dies? 
    Ecclesiastes 18:13, and that their ruin is of themselves, if they should 
    perish; that he does not cast them off that hang by him, nor cast them out 
    that come unto him, John 6:37.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That however prosperous and favorable our case be, we 
    have ground to keep up a holy fear upon our spirits: "Happy is the man that 
    fears always," Proverbs 28:14. Whether it be that our outward state in the 
    world, or our spiritual state, be peaceful, easy, and prosperous, still 
    there is ground to fear, for we are in hazard of offending God in it. There 
    is no way so plain and even, but we may stumble in it. Outward prosperity 
    rains many: "The prosperity of fools shall destroy them," Proverbs 1:31. And 
    even in a prosperous state of the soul, there is no safety in being secure 
    and careless, for in the managing of that we are apt to offend: 2 
    Corinthians 12:7, "Lest I should be exalted above measure, through the 
    abundance of the revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, 
    the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above 
    measure." No paradise on the earth but the serpent may be found there; and 
    if one were enrapt up to the third heavens, like Paul, they will bring back 
    with them a corrupt heart, ready to give them a slip, or lead them astray. 
    We are in danger of a heavy turn and sad change in our condition, we are "to 
    serve God with fear, and rejoice with trembling," Psalm 2:11. See how 
    quickly David's prosperity was changed: Psalm 30:7, "You did hide your face 
    and I was troubled." Job's condition, both temporal and spiritual, how 
    suddenly was it changed? Sovereignty lifts up and casts down, and the anger 
    of a jealous God may soon be stirred, so as to make a mighty overturn in 
    one's condition; therefore we should not be "high-minded, but fear," Romans 
    11:20.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It informs us, that however low one's case be, there 
    is still room for hope while here; therefore we should always entertain a 
    kindly hope: Psalm 43:5, "Why are you cast down, O my soul? why are you 
    disquieted in me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him who is the health 
    of my countenance, and my God." One may yet be at his wits end with his 
    difficulties, knowing of no outgate, but yet he may have ground of faith and 
    hope, because—so great things have been done by our merciful God, as to 
    raise us up. He made a world out of nothing, he has raised the dead, and 
    particularly Christ, while the whole elect's sins lay as a grave-stone on 
    him. What, then, hinders him to do a great work for us, when he has done a 
    greater? In him we may trust that he will yet deliver us, 2 Corinthians 
    1:10—Whatever our case be, we are not the first that have been in it, and 
    delivered too in God's own way. Psalm 22:4, "Our fathers trusted in you, and 
    you did deliver them." People are apt to say, Never one was in such case as 
    theirs. But, "is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it 
    has been already of old time which was before us," Ecclesiastes 1:10; and 
    suppose it were new, yet faith and hope in God are not in vain; for he has a 
    new cure for a new case, Isaiah 43:18, 19. Whatever our case be, can it be 
    worse than a lost case? Luke 19:10, "The Son of man came to seek and save 
    that which is lost." Can it be worse than a self-destroying case? Hob. 13:9, 
    "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself, but in me is your help." Can it be 
    worse than a case in itself quite hopeless, even as dry bones? Ezekiel 
    37:11, 12, but even by the Spirit of the Lord these bones can be made 
    alive.—It is not beyond the reach of the power of God. Genesis 18:14, "Is 
    anything too hard for the Lord?" who can be so low, as that the everlasting 
    arms cannot raise up? with God nothing is impossible. A word from Heaven can 
    make all things take a happy turn, for saying and doing are but one thing 
    with God. God says to the sinner, Believe you that I can do these things? If 
    you do, there is a ground of kindly hope.—In a word, the covenant of promise 
    reaches to, and includes mercy of all kinds, necessary to make us happy; so 
    that we have not only God's power, but his will, to give us mercy in all 
    cases held out to as in the word, if so be we will take his way of faith and 
    hope.—From this subject there is,</p>
<p align="justify">II. An use of exhortation, in several branches.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Fear the Lord; get and entertain a holy fear of God in 
    your spirits. The profane and licentious lives of some, the carnal and loose 
    hearts of others, proclaim a general want of this, Psalm 36:1, "The 
    transgression of the wicked says within my heart, that there is no fear of 
    God before his eyes." but all fear of God is not a holy fear pleasing to 
    God. There is a servile fear, and a filial fear. Not to the former, but to 
    the latter, I exhort you.</p>
<p align="justify">Herewith some various difficulties and inquiries may 
    arise, which we shall endeavor to answer, such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. When is the fear of God only slavish? In answer to 
    this-take the following observations: The fear of God is only slavish,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) When it arises only from the consideration of God's 
    wrath as a just judge. This fear of God is to be found in the unconverted; 
    they have the spirit of bondage again to fear, Romans 8:15; yes, in the 
    devils, they believe and tremble, James 2:19; and if the conscience once be 
    awakened, though the heart be not sanctified, this fear cannot miss to take 
    place. It is a natural passion flowing from self-love and a sight of danger, 
    which is so much the more vehement, in proportion as the danger apprehended 
    is greater or smaller! nearer or more distant. One under this fear, fears 
    God as the slave fears his master, because of the whip, which he is afraid 
    of being lashed; he abstains from sin, not out of hatred of it, but because 
    of the wrath of God annexed to it. An apprehension of God's heavy hand on 
    him here, or of Hell and damnation hereafter, is the predominant motive of 
    his fear of God, whom he fears only as an incensed Judge, and his powerful 
    enemy.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When it checks or kills the love of God. There is a 
    fear opposite to the love of God, which by this very character is discovered 
    to be base and servile: 1 John 4:18, "There is no fear in love, but perfect 
    lore casts out fear, because fear has torment." There is a necessary 
    connection between true fear and love, the one cannot be without the other; 
    they are both links of the same chain of grace, which the Holy Spirit gives 
    those whom he sanctifies; but slavish fear fills the heart with hard 
    thoughts of God, and the more it prevails, the farther is the soul from the 
    love of God.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When it drives the sinner away from God. Under its 
    influence, Adam and Eve hidden themselves from the presence of the Lord God, 
    and Cain went out from his presence. All the graces of the Spirit, as they 
    come from the Lord, so they carry the sinner back to him; so no doubt it is 
    an ungracious fear of God that frights the sinner away from him; for they 
    that seek and return to him, will fear him and his righteousness. This fear 
    has this effect in different degrees, and the higher the worse—It takes 
    heart and hand from persons in their approaches to God, 1 John 4:18, quoted 
    already; it kills them before the Lord, knocks all confidence and hope in 
    God on the head, so that their hearts at duty are like Nabal's—dying within 
    them, and become as a stone; so when they should run for their life, it cuts 
    the sinews of their endeavors; when they would wrestle for the blessing, it 
    makes their knees feeble, and their hands hang down.—It makes them first 
    averse to duty, and then give up with it; they deal with God as one with his 
    avowed enemy, into whose presence he will not come, Genesis 3:8. The people 
    of God have sometimes had a touch of this, 2 Samuel 6:9, "And David was 
    afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come 
    unto me? Though it never prevails with them to extinguish love, yet 
    sometimes a believer is like a faulty child, who, instead of humbling 
    himself before his parents, hides himself in some corner, and is so frighted, 
    that he dare not come in, and look the parent in the face; but this is a 
    most dangerous case, especially if it lasts long.—In a word, it makes them 
    run to physicians of no value. For what is more natural than that men who 
    are frightened from God under apprehended danger, run to some other quarter, 
    and that to their own ruin, Revelation 6:16, "And said to the mountains and 
    to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the 
    throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb."</p>
<p align="justify">2. What is to be thought of this slavish fear of God? To 
    this I answer, there is something good in it, and something evil.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is something good in it, namely, the fear of 
    God's wrath for sin, which lies unpardoned on the guilty sinner or which the 
    sinner may be inclined to commit: James 2:19, "You belie vest that there is 
    one God, you do well." To cast off fear of the wrath of God, and the 
    terrible punishments which he has annexed to sin; is a pitch of wickedness 
    which but the very worst of men arrive at. The fear of God's wrath against 
    sin, and that duly influential too, is recommended to us by Christ himself, 
    Luke 12:5, "Fear him," says he, "which, after he has killed, has power to 
    cast into Hell, yes, I say unto you, Fear him." It is also recommended by 
    the example of the very best of saints, Job 31:23, "For destruction from God 
    was a terror unto me;" and says David, "My flesh trembles for fear of you, 
    and I am afraid of your judgments," Psalm 119:120. And the law of God is not 
    fenced with terrors to be disregarded, but to awe men's spirits. But,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is something evil in it, yes, much evil in it, 
    if we consider,—The scrimpness and narrowness of its spring. Why should the 
    fear of God be confined to spring up from his wrath against sin only or 
    chiefly, since there are so many other perfections of God, which may give 
    rise-to the fear of him, which are disregarded by this means? It casts a 
    veil of disrespect on his holiness, goodness, and hatred of sin, on his 
    relations of Creator, Preserver, Father, Supreme Lord, and Governor of the 
    world.—The horrible effects and tendency thereof, as it rises only from this 
    spring, and overflows all the banks of godly fear. Fear of God, even of his 
    wrath, is good, but the excess of it is very bad. Fire and water are both 
    good and necessary, but very bad when the one burns man, and the other 
    drowns him. Hence, since what is acceptable in the sight of God is perfect 
    in parts, though not in degrees, is good in the manner as well as matter, 
    this fear is not what he takes pleasure in, nay, it is displeasing to him, 
    and is the sin of those who hear the gospel, whose fear ought to be extended 
    according to the revelation made to them. And thus one may be displeasing to 
    himself, to those about him, and to God also; and if they attain to no other 
    fear of God, what they fear will probably come upon them. Nevertheless, this 
    fear, kept within bounds, may, by the Spirit, be made the means to bring the 
    sinner to the Lord in his covenant. For the fear of God's wrath is a good 
    thing in itself, Romans 8:15; it serves to rouse the sinner out of his 
    security, to make him sensible of his danger, and to seek for relief: Psalm 
    9:20," Put them in fear, O Lord, that the nations may know themselves to be 
    but men." And therefore the law and its threatening, as a red flag, are 
    displayed in the sight of secure sinners, that they may be roused to flee 
    from the wrath to come.</p>
<p align="justify">To this there may be offered this objection, The fear of 
    the Lord's wrath can make but an unsound closing with the Lord in his 
    covenant. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. That is very true, if there be nothing more. But 
    fear of God's wrath not only may, but ordinarily, if not always does, begin 
    the work which love crowns. Fear brings men to the gates of the city of 
    refuge, and when they are there, love is kindled, and makes them press 
    forward. Fear brings the poor captive woman to confer with the conqueror 
    about the match; but thereby love is kindled, and faith makes the match. It 
    works, however, very differently at other times; for Satan and oar corrupt 
    hearts are ready to drive forward this fear of God's wrath to exceed all 
    bounds; and no wonder, for when it has got over the boundaries, it makes 
    fearful havoc in the soul's case, like a consuming fire, deadening all good 
    motions towards God, and quickening evil ones, to the dishonor of God, and 
    one's own torment; and no case out of Hell is liker Hell than this, both in 
    respect of sin and misery. But when the Spirit of God has a saving work in 
    view, he can easily make the spirit of bondage subservient to the spirit of 
    adoption.</p>
<p align="justify">3. How should one manage in the case of a slavish fear of 
    God's wrath? Here I answer, We had need to be Well guided, for the losing or 
    winning of the soul depends upon it. For your assistance I offer the 
    following directions—</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Labor to clear the grounds of your fear of God's 
    wrath, by a rational inquiry and discovery. There are, even of these fears, 
    some that do really proceed from a bodily distemper vitiating the 
    Imagination, namely, from melancholy, and the like; and in this case, your 
    trouble rises and falls according to the disposition of your bodies, but not 
    according to the comfort or terror you receive from God's word, as it is in 
    truly spiritual troubles. Thus it often comes on, and goes off, they know 
    not how; showing the first wound to be in their head, not in their 
    conscience. Of this sort was the evil spirit Saul was troubled with, under 
    which he got ease by music, not by his Bible. In this case, as well as 
    others, it would be of use to consider the real grounds of fear from the 
    Lord's word, and the consideration of one's own state or case, and so to 
    turn it as much as may be into solid fears upon plain and evident reasons 
    for it. This would be a step to the salvation of the soul. But, alas! it is 
    sad to think of tormenting fear kept up on we know not what grounds, and 
    which can produce no good; while in the meantime people will not be at pains 
    to inquire into the real evidences of their soul's hazard, the sinfulness of 
    their state, heart, and life. Ask, then, yourselves, what real ground there 
    is from the Lord's word for this fear of yours.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Beware of casting off the fear, dread, and awe of 
    the wrath of God against sin: Job 15:4, "Yes, you cast off fear, and 
    restrain prayer before God." This is the issue of some people's fears, who, 
    one way or other, get their necks from under the yoke, and grow more stupid, 
    fearless, and profane, than even by the just judgment of God. It is true, 
    that fear is not enough; but there is something to be added, and yet not 
    this fear cast away. If you be brought into a state of sonship to God, the 
    dread of God's wrath against sin will come along with you, though it will be 
    no more slavish; as if a slave were made his master's son by adoption, he 
    would still fear his anger, though not slavishly as before. But be one's 
    state what it will, better be God's slave, fearing his wrath only, than the 
    devil's freeman, casting off the fear of God altogether. There is less ill 
    in the former than in the latter. Yes,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Cast not off the fear of that wrath, even its 
    overtaking you, until such time as your soul be brought away freely to Jesus 
    Christ: Hosea 5:8, "I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge 
    their offence; in their affliction they will seek me early." You have no 
    warrant to cast it off sooner, for certainly wrath is pursuing you, until 
    you be within the gates of the city of refuge; and to be without fear of 
    that wrath that is still advancing on a person, is ruining. Indeed, as soon 
    as you have sincerely come to Christ in his covenant, though the fear of 
    wrath against sin is never to be laid by, yet then you may and ought to cast 
    off the fear of vindictive wrath overtaking you: "There is no condemnation 
    to them that are in Christ Jesus," Romans 8:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Look not always on an absolute God, for surely that 
    can produce no fear of God but a slavish one; but look on God in Christ as 
    the trysting-place himself has set, for receiving the addresses of the 
    guilty on a throne of grace: 2 Corinthians 5:19, "God was in Christ, 
    reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto 
    them." This is the way to repress and curb the horrible effects of slavish 
    fear, to make love to God, faith, and hope, spring up in the soul, and so 
    mold that fear of your into filial fear and reverence. In a God out of 
    Christ you can discern nothing but inflexible justice, and the utmost 
    terror; and from his throne of unveiled majesty, hear nothing but terrible 
    voices, thunders, and earthquakes. But in a God in Christ you may behold 
    affections of mercy, and flowing compassions; and from the throne of grace 
    hear the still small voice of mercy and peace, Isaiah 35:3, 4.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) At whatever time you find the fear of God's wrath 
    begin to choke the love of God in your hearts, or to drive you away from him 
    in any way, check and curb that fear resolutely, let it not proceed, though 
    you were in the time under the most atrocious sin: Psalm 65:3, "Iniquities 
    prevail against me: as for our transgressions, you will purge them away." 
    For then you are in the march between God's ground and the devil's; and 
    there is a wind from Hell, blowing up the fire of fear, that will consume 
    you, if it be not quenched; for the separation of the soul from God, and its 
    going away from him, can in no case fail to be of a raining nature: and the 
    more that it increases with a person, his heart will be the more hardened, 
    and he will be set the farther off from repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) Greedily embrace any gleam of hope from the Lord's 
    own word, and hang by it. You should do like Benhadad's servants, and say, 
    We have heard that the king of Israel is a merciful king, and we hope he 
    will save us, 1 Kings 20:31. The apostle calls hope the Christian's 
    head-piece, 1 Thessalonians 5:8, not to be thrown away in a time of danger.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Come away resolutely to the Lord Jesus, lay hold 
    on him in the gospel-offer, and consent to the covenant: Hebrews 7:25, "He 
    is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him." Lay hold on 
    the horns of this our altar, and you shall not die; he will swallow up death 
    in victory, Isaiah 25:8. Flee into this city of refuge; the avenger shall 
    not overtake you. Do as the lepers of Samaria did, reasoned with themselves, 
    and went to the camp, where meat was to be found. You are like to sink in a 
    sea of wrath, Jesus holds out his hand to draw you ashore. You are afraid, 
    perhaps, it is not to you, it is vain to try; but know that it is the hand 
    that must take you out, or you are a gone man; neglecting to take hold, you 
    are ruined; otherwise, you can be but ruined.</p>
<p align="justify">4. When is the fear of the Lord holy, filial, and 
    reverential, such as the Lord takes pleasure in?—For your satisfaction in 
    this inquiry, I would answer,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) When the chief spring of it is not our own harm, but 
    God's infinite excellence and perfection striking an awe upon the soul: 
    Genesis 28:17, "And Jacob was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! 
    this is none other but the house of God, and the gate of Heaven." On this 
    account, God was called the fear of the holy patriarchs, while in the world, 
    Genesis 31:42. Thus sincere children fear their parents, not because of the 
    ill they may do them, but because of that authority and superiority they 
    have over them.—When the soul is awed into a profound reverence for God, by 
    the consideration of his transcendent excellence in all things, this is a 
    becoming or true filial fear.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When the offending of God is feared as the greatest 
    evil. A graceless man may fear the punishment of swearing, but a righteous 
    man fears an oath, Ecclesiastes 9:2; the former may fear the threatening as 
    the greatest evil, but the righteous fears the commandment, and shall be 
    rewarded, Proverbs 13:13. What would the most of the world fear about sin, 
    if they were secured against wrath? Nothing. But the fearer of God, his 
    great fear would remain notwithstanding, namely, the displeasing of his 
    gracious Father.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When fear of his wrath is joined with a kindly 
    affection and love to him, Psalm 90:11–13. No man fears God who has not a 
    dread of his anger, and the more grace, the more of this dread; so that a 
    godly man will fear a frown of his face more than another a stroke of his 
    hand. But withal this does not straiten the heart, but enlarge it in love to 
    him; for these perfections of God that are the most proper objects of fear, 
    are beautiful and lovely in the eyes of a saint; and therefore under the 
    effects of his anger, they condemn themselves and justify God.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, When the fear of God draws the sinner to God, and 
    makes him cling to him, Hosea 3:5, "They shall seek the Lord their God, and 
    David their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter 
    days." As if he had said, They shall fear away to the Lord, like a 
    good-natured child under fear of his parent running away to him, and 
    catching hold of him; the language of which is, Anything but separation from 
    my holy Father. Holy fear also keeps the soul with the Lord, Jeremiah 32:40, 
    "I will put my fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from me," and 
    that upon the same principle.</p>
<p align="justify">5. How does this fear work in the gracious soul? To this 
    question I answer, Holy fear is an influential grace, diffusing its 
    influence through the whole man, and therefore all religion is often 
    comprehended under the name of the fear of God.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It makes God's verdict of things in his holy law the 
    man's complete standard. In matters of faith, it causes him believe that God 
    has said it; in matters of practice, to do or forbear, because God has bid 
    or forbid it, though his own reason and all the world should contradict, 
    Proverbs 3:7, "Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and depart from 
    evil." Holy fear awes the soul into implicit compliance with all that an 
    incomprehensible God makes known in his word. So was Abraham brought to 
    offer his son, and the fear of God carried him over all obstructions, 
    Genesis 22:12.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It awes the soul into abstaining from such sins as 
    there is no other awe-band against. There are some cases of temptation, 
    wherein there is nothing from any creature to marr compliance with it, the 
    way is quite clear on that part. But then the fear of God will be a 
    sufficient restraint. Sometimes you may have a fair occasion to wrong your 
    neighbor, and there is no fear of his knowing you did it; but if you fear 
    God, you dare not for your soul do it, more than if all the world were 
    looking on you, Leviticus 19:14, "You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a 
    stumbling-block before the blind, but shall fear your God, I am the Lord." 
    Sometimes occasions for sin occur, and men will bear you out in the sinful 
    practice; but if you fear God, you dare not do it, more than if all the 
    world should conspire to hinder you, Job 31:21–23. Holy Providence lays such 
    occasions before men for their trial.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) It awes the soul into compliance with duties, even 
    such as one has no other thing to drive him to, Ecclesiastes 12:13, "Fear 
    God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Holy fear 
    reverenceth the authority of God, not only in abstaining from sin, but in 
    complying with duties, Deuteronomy 6:13, "you shall fear the Lord your God, 
    and serve him." Those who have no inward principle to set them on their 
    duty, have no fear of God before their eyes. But that principle will carry a 
    man to duty, over the belly of oposition and contradiction, from Satan, an 
    evil world, and the corrupt reasonings of one's own heart.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) It makes one mainly fear the offence of God in the 
    commission of sin, and omission of duties. The great care of a fearer of God 
    is, lest he depart from God, Jeremiah 32:40; holy fear and love are always 
    joined, and therefore he who truly fears God, hates sin, and loathes it, 
    because God hates it, Proverbs 8:13, "The fear of the Lord is to hate evil." 
    He loves his duty because it is pleasing in the Lord's sight; whereas others 
    hate sin for fear of wrath, and only love duty for the sake of the reward. 
    It suffers not the soul to rest in any degree of holiness already attained, 
    but spurs it on towards perfection: 2 Corinthians 7:1, "Having, therefore, 
    these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness 
    of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." As Noah's 
    fear made him not only begin the ark, but advance the work until it was 
    perfected, so this holy fear still works against sin, until the soul be out 
    of hazard; and that is not until death. Truce with sin, or indulging lusts, 
    say either there is no fear of God in the heart, or that it is asleep; for 
    in whatever measure one fears God, he will stand at a distance from sin, and 
    seek the destruction of his. corruptions.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It carries the man to his duty, over the belly of 
    the fear of man or any other creature, Matthew 10:28, "And fear not them 
    which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul." If one be in hazard 
    of being frightened from his duty, by the fear either of devils or of men, 
    there is no antidote like the fear of God, 1 Peter 3:14, "But and if you 
    suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you; and be not afraid of their 
    terror, neither be you troubled;" for as the light of the sun removes the 
    light of a glow-worm, that shines only in the dark, so the fear of God 
    banishes other fear in the point of duty to the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now add a few motives to influence the study of 
    this filial fear; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Infinite greatness and goodness meet together in him, 
    and in him only, and therefore it is his due, Jeremiah 10:7, "Who would not 
    fear you, O king of nations, for to you does it appertain." His glorious and 
    unspeakable perfections entitle him to it, and it cannot be denied him 
    without the highest sacrilege. Nay, men must needs be strangers to him who 
    do not fear him; for no sooner does the creature know him, but it must fear 
    him; the sight of his greatness without his goodness, will produce a terror; 
    but the sight of both, a holy reverence.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The relations requiring reverence of us meet together 
    in him; and the truth is, we owe no reverence to any, but as they do in some 
    sort, by the eminence they stand in, represent God whom we are to fear above 
    all, and to fear in them. A reverential fear is due to our superiors, but 
    God is the Supreme Being. We owe it to those who are superior to us in 
    office and dignity, Romans 13:7, "Render therefore unto all their due, 
    tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, 
    honor to whom honor." God is the supreme Governor of the world. Is the 
    servant to reverence his master, the child his parents, the wife her 
    husband? surely then God, who is the ancient of days, who stands to his 
    people in such endearing relations, is to be feared by them, Psalm 45:11, 
    "He is your Lord, and worship you him."</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is our wisdom to fear God, Psalm 111:10, "The fear 
    of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." O sinner! would you be wise indeed? 
    then fear God; it is the beginning of wisdom. A man never begins to be wise 
    until the fear of God enters his heart. He goes on in folly and madness 
    until he get this ballast to his soul; he is frisking about the pit's mouth, 
    in hazard every moment of falling down, until the awe of God strikes his 
    soul.—It is the chief point of wisdom; all the wisdom of the world is but 
    folly in comparison of this. Wisdom teaches men to fear dangers, losses, and 
    the like, but what avails it all, if men fear not the offending of God, and 
    the loss of the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is in some sort the whole of religion, Job 4:6, "Is 
    not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your 
    ways?" for it is the sum and substance of religious duties, which therefore 
    are comprehended under that name in many parts of the Bible, and it has a 
    universal influence over the whole of religion, drawing it all after it in 
    the special parts thereof: for when it once gets place, it will bring in 
    every known duty, and set the soul at a distance from all known sin.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It would free you of other fears that are tormenting, 
    in whatever degree it gets place in your hearts. Fear of men and devils is 
    so entertained by many, that it becomes a tormenting passion, frightening 
    them out of the way of duty to God. This is the first expedient to get rid 
    of these. Allow the great God his own room in the heart, and let him be your 
    fear and your dread, and so the creature will prove contemptible in 
    comparison of him.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Consider the precious promises made to, and the 
    benefits bestowed on those that fear the Lord. If you be a fearer of God, go 
    matters as they will, with you it shall be well; Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13, 
    "Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet 
    surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear 
    before him; but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he 
    prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he fears not before God," 
    It prolongs men's days, in so far as it keeps them in the way of holiness, 
    Proverbs 10:27; see a cluster of promises, Psalm 25:12–14; compare Proverbs 
    19:23, and Psalm 34:9, which you may read at your leisure.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The want of the fear of God is an infallible sign 
    of a wicked, graceless heart; it looses the reins to wickedness of heart and 
    life, and so betrays men into ruin, Psalm 36:1–4, "These that fear not God 
    now, will be made to fear him hereafter, when there shall be no escaping out 
    of the hand of their terrible Judge.</p>
<p align="justify">Some may say, O! how shall I attain to this holy fear of 
    God? With a view to promote this attainment, I would offer the following 
    directions—</p>
<p align="justify">1. Labor to know God, who and what he is, 1 Kings 8:43, 
    "That all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your 
    people Israel." It is a benefit of the second covenant, to know the Lord, 
    Hosea 2:20, "I will even betroth you unto me in faithfulness, and you shall 
    know the Lord." God, to the most of the world, is like a prince in disguise 
    among his subjects, they treat him rudely because they do not know him; an 
    unknown God will not be feared. While ignorance of God reigns in the heart, 
    there is no place for holy fear; for that will make men count darts as 
    stubble, and laugh at the shaking of the spear.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Stir up in your hearts a desire to fear him; it is a 
    token for good, when one is willing to entertain the fear of God, Nehemiah 
    1:11, "Your servants who desire to fear you." This desire has the promise, 
    and it will be accompanied with suitable endeavors after it. Many fight 
    against the fear of God, that they may live at ease, and may be able to give 
    themselves loose reins to their sinful practices; no wonder their hearts be 
    hardened from it. And hence, if at any time they be taken with the fear of 
    God, they do what they can to be freed of it, as they would pluck out arrows 
    out of their flesh.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Take God for your God in Christ, and devote yourselves 
    to him. The God we choose for our God, we will fear; Micah 4:5, "For all 
    people will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the 
    name of the Lord our God forever and ever." And so, when men set up their 
    idols of jealousy in the Lord's room, these get the fear that is due to God. 
    So the worldling fears his clay God, his life is in its smiles, and its 
    frowns are his death. But take the Lord for your God, I say, in Christ; for 
    no otherwise he offers himself to us in the covenant, 2 Corinthians 5:19. 
    This is the way to holy fear: For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is a promised benefit of the covenant, Jeremiah 
    32:40, "I will put my fear in their hearts." Whoever comes into God's 
    covenant of grace, the fear of God is, by the holy Spirit, stamped upon 
    their hearts, whereby it may be known that they belong to God as children; 
    and they devote themselves, on the other hand, to his fear, Psalm 119:38. 
    They are his servants, devoted to his fear. They give themselves to it, and 
    make it their great study.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) This covenant is a covenant of peace and friendship 
    between God and the guilty creature, through a Mediator, Hebrews 12:22–24, 
    so that your state is changed, the moment that you come into the covenant, 
    from enmity to peace with God, Ephesians 2:19, they become fellow-citizens 
    with the saints, and are of the household of God. This happily joins love 
    and dread of God together, producing holy fear and reverence of God; whereas 
    while God is apprehended certainly as an enemy to us, fear him we may with 
    slavish fear, but not with holy fear, since we cannot love him.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Be much in the exercise of repentance. Sorrowing after 
    a godly sort for sin, as it dishonors God, is offensive to his majesty, 
    separates the sinner from God, and exposes the soul to his anger, is the 
    ready way to produce holy fear for the time to come, 2 Corinthians 7:11. 
    Yes, what fear, says Paul, namely as the effect of sorrow after a godly 
    sort; they that are burnt dread the fire; and they that feel the bitterness 
    of sin, will fear God, and stand at a distance from it. The looking into our 
    frightful acts of sin, will awe our hearts with a dread of the offended 
    Majesty, and make us fall down, saying, "Forgive us our debts."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Pray for it earnestly as a promised benefit of the 
    covenant, and join thereto a faith of particular confidence: Matthew 21:22, 
    "And all things whatever you shall ask, believing you shall receive them." 
    Beg of God that he would manifest himself to you, so as you may be filled 
    with holy fear of him. You may read and hear much of God, and little 
    impressions be made on your spirits by it at all; but when the Lord 
    discovers himself to the sinner, his own glorious light will so represent 
    him as the soul cannot choose but both love and fear him: Job 42:5, 6, "I 
    have heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye sees you: 
    Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Draw together the scattered affections and 
    faculties of the soul, and set them on the Lord: Psalm 86:11, "Unite my 
    heart to fear your name." As the scattered rays of the sun will not burn, 
    until they be collected by a burning glass; so the heart, walking at random, 
    will not be filled with holy fear. Withdraw your hearts from pursuing 
    vanities, and gadding after idols, and labor to see the Lord in those 
    glasses where we may perceive how he is to be feared.</p>
<p align="justify">I would urge you to look to him particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In the glass of his word. See how he is there 
    represented as one worthy to be feared: Psalm 89:7, "God is greatly to be 
    feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them 
    that are about him." O with what awful solemnity may we hear him there 
    speaking of himself, his saints speaking of him and to him! and the angels 
    also, with their veiled faces, crying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God 
    Almighty. Had we eyes to discern his voice in his word, every page would 
    fill our hearts with profoundest reverence. See him,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In the shining holiness of his commandments, 
    perfectly pure from all earthly dross; and when thus seen, how can the 
    sinful creature not fear him! Exodus 15:11, "Who is like unto you, O Lord, 
    among the gods? who is like unto you, glorious in holiness, fearful in 
    praises, doing wonders?" He appears there to be all light, and that in him 
    there is no darkness at all. The holy, spiritual, and extensive law, may 
    fill our hearts with the dread of the Lawgiver, of whose nature it is a 
    transcript. See him,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In the amazing sovereignty of his threatenings. This 
    filled good Josiah with fear, 2 Kings 22:19; and Habakkuk 3:16. Behold 
    thence flames of wrath flashing out on the faces of impenitent sinners. All 
    the threats of men own death to be their utmost; and, O! how will a threat 
    of death fright mortals! But the Lord's threatenings go beyond death, and 
    carry the matter to an endless eternity. See him,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In the unspeakable riches of his gospel-promises 
    displayed in the word. His terrors are no more severe on the one hand, than 
    his promised encouragements are great on the other. If Hell be in the one 
    scale, Heaven is in the other. Who would not, therefore, fear him?—Look to 
    him,</p>
<p align="justify">2. In Christ, the brightness of his glory, and the 
    express image of his person. See God in Christ, and there see an object of 
    fear and love in one. If you would be stirred up to fear God, look to Mount 
    Calvary, and there behold Christ groaning, and dying on a cross for the sins 
    of an elect world, and you will see three awful sights.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The severity of God's justice against sin, not 
    sparing his own Son, Romans 8:32. Many terrible instances have there been of 
    this, in the deluge, and the like. But what is the tumbling down of sinful 
    angels into the pit, the deluging of a world, the burning of Sodom,—to the 
    Son of God dying on a cross, and bearing his Father's wrath? O! if this was 
    done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The channel of mercy and grace, in which they flow 
    to guilty sinners. It is by the Mediator's stripes we must be healed; the 
    sinner's life comes in the way of Christ's death; no mercy, no grace, but 
    through the wounds of a Redeemer. There was love from eternity in the breast 
    of God towards an elect world, but Justice stood in the way of Mercy's 
    getting through to the criminals; a way was then made by the blood of the 
    Son of God.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The price of pardon, 1 Peter 1:19, the precious 
    blood of Christ; no pardon, but what is the price of blood, and that blood 
    of infinite value; that is the ransom which had to be given for the 
    captives, or they could never have been set free. O! who can see these, and 
    not fear this awful and tremendous majesty thus appearing!—Look at him,</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the glass of his adorable perfections. How small a 
    portion do we know of him! but there is nothing which we have manifested to 
    us concerning him, but may contribute to this holy fear. On the one hand, 
    consider his infinite power, whereby he can do all, and his universal 
    dominion, whereby he may do what he will: Job 37:23, 24, and 25:2; his 
    justice, holiness, omniscience, omnipresence, infinite varacity and truth, 
    whereby all he has said shall be made good to a tittle. Who, then, can but 
    fear him?—Consider, on the other hand, his mercy, his love, grace, and 
    goodness, which are so unbounded and unspeakable! Who, then, can but fear 
    him?—Look at him,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In the glass of his works. Look to his works of 
    creation, Psalm 19:1. Does not the earth and Heaven, with all their glorious 
    furniture, cry aloud to us to fear this God. Look to his works of 
    providence: Jeremiah 5:22, "Fear you not me? says the Lord; will you not 
    tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea 
    by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass?" His managing of the world 
    challenges our fearing of him.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) His mercies with which we are loaded, call us to 
    reverence him as our great benefactor, Jeremiah 5:24.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) His judgments; his judgments, in particular, against 
    ourselves, Luke 23:40; and against others, which we may everywhere discern: 
    Psalm 119:118–120, "My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of 
    your judgments." Every stroke laid on in this world is fitted to create a 
    fear of him in our hearts. His general judgment, that is to come, the 
    serious view of which must needs strike sinners with fear: 1 Peter 1:17, 
    "And if you call on the Father, who, without respect of persons, judges 
    according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in 
    fear." See also Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I would now earnestly exhort you to "hope in the Lord 
    for his mercy." Entertain a holy hope in God in al! cases. For clearing of 
    this, we must know, that hope in general is an inclination to, and 
    expectation of good possible to be had, but not without some difficulty. As 
    hope is conversant about divine things, or the mercy of God, it is of two 
    sorts, holy hope, and presumptuous hope; the one well-grounded, the other 
    ill-grounded. Here, therefore, also, some inquiries may be proposed, which 
    we shall endeavor to answer; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is the true hope for mercy, which the Lord takes 
    pleasure in? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is a certain expectation of attaining the 
    mercy, which faith believes, grounded on God's grace and faithfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) For the kind of it; it is an expectation of mercy to 
    be attained. Hope looks always on its object as future: Romans 8:24, "For we 
    are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope, for what a man sees, 
    why does he yet hope for?" This is a main difference between faith and hope, 
    faith looking always on its object as present in the promise, for "faith is 
    the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen." And 
    hope is a certain expectation of it, not so much in itself, (for true hope 
    may be attended with much doubting, Lamentations 3:18), as in the event, for 
    it will never fail the party that has it, nor put him to shame by 
    disappointment, for it hangs on faith: Romans 5:5, "And hope makes not 
    ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy 
    Spirit given unto us.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) For the object of this hope; it is mercy which is 
    hoped for. Now, there is a threefold mercy hope looks for.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The mercy of eternal life itself: Jude 21, "Keep 
    yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus 
    Christ unto eternal life." This is the chief thing the believer is to hope 
    for, and he may, with the utmost certainty and confidence, expect it, 2 
    Timothy 1:12. This hope, even the hope of salvation, the apostle will have 
    the Christian to put on as an helmet, 1 Thessalonians 5:8, and even to 
    stretch forth his hope over death and the grave.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The mercy necessary to bring us to eternal life; as 
    perseverance therein to the end, notwithstanding all the difficulties that 
    are in the way: Romans 8:38, "And we know, that all things work together for 
    good to them that love God, and are the called according to his purpose." 
    Though the grace of God in him be like a spark of fire in an ocean, he ought 
    firmly to hope, that the same heavenly breath that kindled it will keep it 
    in to the end.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The mercy of all other good things, so far as God 
    shall see the bestowing them on us for his own glory, and our good. There 
    are many particular things good in themselves, which we know not whether 
    they will be so to us or not; for example, deliverance from such a trouble; 
    therefore it is not to be absolutely hoped for, but under this 
    qualification, that God sees it to be good for us.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) For the antecedent of this hope: that is faith, 
    which is the evidence of things hoped for, Hebrews 11:1. There can be no 
    true hope without faith; where faith does not open the door, hope cannot 
    enter. Faith embraces the mercy in the promise of God, and hope waits for 
    the accomplishment of the promise; so that one cannot truly hope for that 
    which God has not promised, neither can one hope for the accomplishment of 
    that promise which faith does not believe.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The ground of this hope is God's free grace in 
    Christ and his faithfulness: 1 Peter 1:13, "Wherefore, gird up the loins of 
    your mind, and hope to the end, for the grace which is to be brought to you 
    at the revelation of Jesus Christ." The mercy promised is quite above the 
    sinner's deserving; but he considers the fullness and freedom of God's 
    grace, and withal how unalterable he is to his word, and therefore hopes 
    upon having that word made good to him.</p>
<p align="justify">A second question is, How may the hope of mercy be known 
    to be presumptuous? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Presumption is the soul-ruining plague, whereby a 
    person assumes to himself what God has, by no testimony of his word, 
    declared to be his, and which alters the beautiful order of mercy 
    established by God, joining together what God has separated, and separated 
    what he has joined.—Upon this I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That hope is presumptuous, which is not founded on 
    the Lord's word. Such hope is brisk in the dark, but loses all its luster by 
    the light of God's word brought in upon it: John 3:20, 21, "For every one 
    that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds 
    should be reproved; but he who does truth comes to the light, that his deeds 
    may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." God's word is a friend 
    unto his grace, but an enemy to delusion; it is the touch-stone that 
    discovers the true metal and also the counterfeit. You hope for salvation, 
    in what Word of God is your hope founded? Does the Lord's word, searchingly 
    applied, strengthen or weaken your hope? Say you, The general invitations 
    are the ground of my hope? These may be grounds of hope that you may get 
    eternal life, if you will take God's way: bat do you not hope that you shall 
    get it, without a due consideration of this? Now, these can never be the 
    grounds of a solid hope, for all that hear the gospel are comprehended in 
    these, as well as you.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That hope is presumptuous, which overlooks and 
    neglects the means appointed by God for the attaining of his mercy onto 
    eternal life: 1 Peter 1:3, "We are begotten by God to a lively hope, by the 
    resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." The way you are to be happy 
    forever is, that you be united to Christ by a true faith, that you be a new 
    creature, that you lead a holy life. Do you neglect these, and yet hope all 
    will be well? Your hope is presumption, and will ruin you, Deuteronomy 
    29:19, 20.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That hope is presumptuous, which is built without 
    erasing the old foundation, Luke 24:48. Many have hopes of Heaven which grow 
    up with themselves, they were never shaken out of themselves, nor had the 
    naughtiness of their hopes discovered, and so never were led to Jesus 
    Christ, to build on him by uniting with him.</p>
<p align="justify">A third inquiry may be, How may the hope of mercy be 
    known to be true hope, which God will take pleasure in? In answer to this, 
    it may be noticed,</p>
<p align="justify">1. True hope is founded on the free grace of God in 
    Christ, 1 Peter 1:13, quoted already. The scriptures are written for our 
    learning that we, through patience and comfort of them, might have hope, 
    Romans 15:4. Hope is not built upon our good dispositions, good works, 
    external and common benefits which we enjoy, for these are but a sandy 
    foundation, unable to bear this weight; but the anchor of hope is cast so as 
    to fix upon the immoveable ground aforesaid, Hebrews 6:19. It is true 
    holiness discerned by us in ourselves, as an evidence, that does help us to 
    a firm hope; but the stress of hope lies not upon it as a ground-work.</p>
<p align="justify">2. True hope is a lively principle of sanctification, 1 
    John 3:3, "And every man that has this hope purifies himself, even as he 
    (God) is pure;" and therefore it is called a lively hope, 1 Peter 1:3. As a 
    spring by degrees does work out the mud that is in a well, so hope of mercy 
    does work out corruption; as the prospect of the marriage-day makes the 
    parties to be taken up in preparing for the marriage, so the true hope of 
    eternal life puts one to be preparing for it, Revelation 19:7. That hope 
    which suffers sin to lie untouched in heart and life, that does not put on a 
    person to mortify sin, is a dead hope; and true hope carries to universal 
    holiness, even as he is pure.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It makes one diligent in the use of means 
    appointed by God, Hebrews 10:23–25; but withal not to rest on the means, but 
    on the Lord. To hope, without using the means appointed and required, is 
    presumption; to rest on the means is a spice of atheism. But that is true 
    hope, which makes the soul delight in all duties and ordinances, to leave no 
    appointed means untried, in order to attaining the blessed end; and then, 
    when all is done, to place all confidence of success on the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">With a view to press this holy, lively hope, I would 
    mention the following motives.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is not only our comfortable attainment, but a duty 
    required of all that believe, 1 Peter 1:13, "Gird up the loins of your mind, 
    be sober, and hope to the end." And therefore the apostle Paul presseth 
    diligence in seeking after it in full measure, Hebrews 6:11, "And we desire 
    that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of 
    hope unto the end;" and he prays for it, Romans 15:13, "Now, the God of hope 
    fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, 
    through the power of the Holy Spirit." It is a duty that is in a special 
    manner comfortable.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is most necessary; hope is as necessary to a 
    Christian, as a head-piece to a soldier in a battle, 1 Thessalonians 5:8; as 
    necessary as an anchor to a ship, Hebrews 6:19; yes, so necessary, that we 
    are said to be saved by it, Romans 8:24.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is a great friend to holiness, and 
    perseverance in the ways of God, 1 Corinthians 15:58.—As it honors God's 
    grace and goodness, so it strengthens the soul, and animates it to all 
    duties, to fight against corruption and temptation, and to pursue holiness.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Let all be exhorted to entertain a holy fear of God, 
    together with a holy hope for his mercy. Mix these, and balance your souls 
    with them, whatever your case be. While you are going through the world, 
    keep your course in the middle between the two rocks of presumption and 
    despair.—For this purpose,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Beware of desponding or despairing of the mercy of God 
    in Christ. There is an allowable despair, which all ought to entertain, in 
    order to their getting their hope fixed on God, namely, a quitting of all 
    hope in our own sufficiency, or ability to make ourselves happy by 
    ourselves, or that ever we shall be well, while we continue in a state of 
    black nature. But what we call despair is a giving over all hope in God, 
    which is a horrible sin. There is a threefold despair you should beware of, 
    as you would not ruin your own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A sensual despair, which arises from an excessive 
    love of the profits and pleasures of this world, with a secure contempt of 
    spiritual and external good in another world, 1 Corinthians 15:32, "Let us," 
    say they, "eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." Alas! how many are there 
    plagued with this? their souls are festered with the desire of present good, 
    which is their all, and, having no hope of better after this life, they give 
    the swing to their lusts after these.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A sluggish despair, Proverbs 22:13, "The slothful 
    man says, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets." Their 
    sloth musters up difficulties to them, forming some that are groundless, 
    imaginary ones, and aggravating real ones, so that they conclude beforehand 
    that they will not be better, their endeavors will not succeed, and 
    therefore they lie still, and will do nothing for their own help; this ruins 
    many.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A sorrowful despair, which arises from strong fears, 
    which raise such a mist in the soul, that grounds of hope in its case, are 
    hidden out of sight, and they are in their soul's case as in Acts 27:20, 
    neither sun nor stars for many days appear, no small tempest lies on them, 
    and all hope that they shall be saved is then taken away. There are 
    different degrees of this; sometimes it is silent and sullen, making little 
    noise, but is smothered in one's breast like a burning fire. In such a case, 
    one would do well to give it a vent before God, his servants, or godly 
    experienced Christians, lest it ruin them. This is the way David took when 
    in such a case, Psalm 39:2–4, "I was dumb with silence, I held my peace even 
    from good, and my sorrow was stirred; my heart was hot within me; while I 
    was musing, the fire burned, then spoke I with my tongue, Lord, make me to 
    know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know how 
    frail I am." Sometimes it is raging as in Judas, who, under horror laid upon 
    his sin, did miserably end his life.</p>
<p align="justify">Beware of all these, and resist the beginnings of 
    despair, and if it has fastened on any soul, let them strive to quench it, 
    as they would do a fire. The former makes way for the latter, and altogether 
    makes way for remediless despair in Hell. I shall only say two things of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is defiling, and makes the soul most loathsome 
    before God; for it conceives most basely and abominably of God and Christ, 
    directly opposing itself to the grand design of the gospel; it blasphemes 
    the power of God, and the efficacy of his Son's blood and Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is ruining, for it makes the sinner flee from 
    God, and cast away the means of recovery, and so ensures their destruction; 
    besides that it often drives the sinner to put an end to his torment here, 
    by leaping into endless torments before the time, as in the case of Judas. 
    And while we see how Satan is ready to take advantage, we had need to take 
    heed.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Beware of presumption. Take heed that you do not flee 
    from the one rock to dash on the other. Indeed, despair is tormenting, while 
    presumption is easy. Nevertheless, though none of them is good, yet a person 
    presuming is ordinarily in greater hazard than one despairing; for the 
    presumptuous sees not his case as the other does: the one is well pleased 
    with his damnable condition, the other is weary of his, and wishes to have 
    it changed; so that many more perish by the one than by the other.</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude: Remember, on the one hand, God is a holy 
    jealous God, who cannot away with sin, or a state of sin, but the fire of 
    his jealousy burns against it. On the other hand, remember that the blood of 
    Christ takes away all guilt, his Spirit overcomes the most hopeless case, 
    and his mercy reaches wide for every condition. Fear him, you that hope in 
    him; hope in his mercy, you that fear him; for "the Lord takes pleasure in 
    them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy." Amen.</p>
