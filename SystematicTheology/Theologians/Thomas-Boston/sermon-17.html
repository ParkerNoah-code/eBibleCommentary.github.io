    2 Corinthians 5:1 "For we know, that, if our earthly house of this 
    tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with 
    hands, eternal in the heavens!"</p>
<p align="justify">THERE are three ways by which we may know a thing, first 
    by sense, thus we know the fire to be hot, and ice to be cold. Secondly, by 
    rational evidence, thus when we see a house, we know that there has been a 
    builder; and a beautiful world, we know that there is a God, because none of 
    them could make themselves. Thirdly, by the testimony of others, by human 
    testimony, as by history we know what was done before we were in the world; 
    and by divine testimony, or revelation, we know the truths of the gospel. 
    The first of these cannot be pretended in the present case, for Heaven and 
    the glory to come fall not now under our bodily senses. As for the inward 
    spiritual sense and feeling of what is heavenly it falls in with rational 
    evidence. As for the third, that of testimony, there can no human testimony 
    make us know this. As for divine testimony in the scripture, it comes not so 
    low as to the case of particular persons by name, saying to such and such a 
    saint Heaven is your. As to extraordinary revelation, Paul speaks here of 
    other believers as well as himself, of whom we have no ground to think they 
    had extraordinary revelation. As to the ordinary testimony of the Spirit, it 
    proceeds upon rational evidence. "The Spirit bears witness with our spirit 
    that we are the sons of God." Therefore I conclude this knowledge in the 
    text, is upon rational evidence, from the marks and signs of a gracious 
    state of which the believer may be conscious, being founded on the Word of 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine. They who look for Heaven when they die, should 
    have rational evidence of their title to it, while they live.</p>
<p align="justify">There is great need of this doctrine, for presumption in 
    the wicked, and slothfulness in the saints, make hopes of Heaven whereof men 
    can give no rational account, very plentiful. Do you hope, do you know that 
    Heaven will be your landing place? Then I would ask you, how do you know 
    this, upon what grounds? You have not been enrapt up to the third heavens, 
    and read your title there. You will not pretend, I hope, extraordinary 
    revelation sent down to you. Beware of that, "we have a more sure word of 
    prophecy, whereunto you do well that you take heed." But whatever you may 
    pretend that way, if your title cannot be made good by the word, it is but a 
    delusion. "To the law, and to the testimony; if they speak not according to 
    this word, it is because there is no light in them." Well then, what 
    rational evidence according to the scripture, have you for it? How can you 
    make good your title by the word, which contains the laws of the kingdom? If 
    you cannot do that, and yet hope and think you know it, it seems you have 
    dreamed it. And take heed, lest it be no more but a dream. Therefore they 
    who look for Heaven when they die, should have rational evidence of their 
    title to it while they live. Here I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show of what we should have rational scriptural 
    evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What it is to have rational evidences for Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I will show that the saints may have such evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I will give the reasons of the doctrine. I am 
    according to this plan,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To show of what we should have rational scriptural 
    evidences. What is it we should know.</p>
<p align="justify">The text tells us, it is that we have a building of God, 
    an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. If we prepare aright 
    for eternity, we will not be content with less than this. Sure I am we will 
    not be content with less in a matter of far inferior importance. The term of 
    Whitsunday is drawing near, and among those of us that have tack, there will 
    be riding and running until they know, that if the term were come, they have 
    a house and land to remain upon, or another place to which they can go. And 
    why less diligence in this affair? The apostle does not say, perhaps we will 
    get a building—no, eternity is too great a matter to venture upon a perhaps, 
    or a may be, if it be within the compass of our power to carry it farther. 
    Nay, what is more, he says not, that we know we will have it, we will get 
    it, but we have it already. Eternity is too great a matter to be uncertain 
    about for the shortest time.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is a mystery, the saints have the house of glory 
    already; though they be still on earth, and have not an inch of ground which 
    they can call their own. I will unriddle this to you in two things. </p>
<p align="justify">1. The saints have Heaven in right and title, as the 
    young heir has the land, into possession of which he is not yet entered.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They have the hold of Heaven already, like a man that 
    has had some precious thing fallen into a well, and searching for it with an 
    instrument, whenever he finds the thing upon it, he cries out with joy, I 
    have it, I have it.</p>
<p align="justify">I. The saints have Heaven in right and title.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God from eternity designed Heaven for them, and them 
    for Heaven, "For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation 
    by our Lord Jesus Christ? The lines have fallen in pleasant places for them, 
    even in the pleasant land. The lot of electing love has given them their 
    inheritance there. Eternal love puts its everlasting arms underneath them, 
    and that lifts them up in time from the pit, "You have in love to my soul 
    delivered it from the pit of corruption: for you have cast all my sins 
    behind your back." This is a sure foundation of right. It cannot be 
    overturned, for it is of God's own laying, "The foundation of God stands 
    sure, having this seal, the Lord knows them that are his." And when they are 
    solemnly admitted into their house, the Judge will recognize this title of 
    theirs, saying, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom 
    prepared for you from the foundation of the world." For God does with the 
    heavenly, as he did with the earthly Canaan. "When the Most High divided to 
    the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set 
    the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ has purchased it for them. "God has appointed 
    us to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, 
    whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. The first Adam 
    forfeited the house of glory for himself and all his posterity, the fallen 
    angels forfeited their part too, and now they have no right to it. But O 
    happy saints, they had a near kinsman, that was mighty, and he redeemed the 
    mortgaged inheritance. Job 19:25–27. The house of Heaven was a mighty 
    purchase indeed! The united stock of men and angels would no more have 
    redeemed it, and fixed our title to it, than a barley corn would have 
    redeemed an estate. But there is infinite value in the precious blood of the 
    Son of God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. God is theirs and Christ is theirs. The saints' maker 
    is their husband. And Heaven of course is their dowry house. A house 
    suitable to the quality of their husband. "God is not ashamed to be called 
    their God; for he has provided for them a city." They are by regeneration 
    and adoption, sons of the house, therefore heirs, heirs of God, and joint 
    heirs with Christ." And now may each of them say, "My beloved is mine, and I 
    am his." And therefore all is theirs. The house and all its belongings. Yes 
    "all things are theirs and they are Christ's." If the Lord of the house be 
    their husband, who can question their right to the house. Is not the body 
    more than meat, and the builder, and purchaser, and owner, more than the 
    house.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Christ has taken possession of Heaven in their name. 
    "Whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus." He is keeping their 
    room for them until they come. I go, said he, to prepare a place for you. 
    Thus their title is fixed, their place is secured for them. At death they 
    will enter into actual possession of what they have already got in Christ 
    their head. Christ was a public person, representing all the heirs of glory. 
    In their name and stead, he obeyed, died, rose again, ascended, and sat down 
    in glory. So that the apostle makes no doubt to tell us, that believers on 
    earth "are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, God has promised it to them. "In hope of eternal 
    life, which God that cannot lie, promised before the world began." This is 
    their charter for Heaven registered in the Bible; to which the King has 
    appended his broad seal, the holy sacraments, a red bloody seal, with this 
    inscription, Remember me. Though he be no debtor to them, he is debtor to 
    his own faithfulness. Though they could never purchase the house, yet our 
    Lord could dispose it to them freely, being his own purchase. "Fear not 
    little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the 
    kingdom." And to make sure work, the promise is made to Christ. "He says 
    not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is 
    Christ." And O the comfort of this dispensation! Unbelief will not stand to 
    blaspheme and say, will God ever make out the promise to you? But will it 
    dare question if God will make good his promise to his own Son, especially 
    when the thing promised was purchased with his own blood.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The saints have the hold of Heaven already.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They have it in the covenant. "He has made with me an 
    everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure; for this is all my 
    salvation and all my desire." Now if all the believers' salvation and desire 
    be in it, surely Heaven is in it; for how low soever the desire of others 
    may be, the desire of the saints is no less. Have you heard and believed, 
    that you had lost Heaven and exposed yourself to Hell by sin, and you were 
    going about mourning without the sun for the loss, and seeking to get it 
    repaired, and you hear of the covenant and laid hold upon it for time and 
    eternity; then know you, that that moment Heaven was found, and you might 
    have cried out, I have it, I have it. The covenant is the chariot in which 
    Christ carries his saints to glory; and as we use to say of people, that 
    they are gone to such a place, when the coach in which they are has set off 
    for it: so we may say the believer is gone to Heaven, for the chariot of the 
    covenant will not stop by the way, so that they who are in it shall arrive 
    there as surely as if they were there already. Then if you would have the 
    house, come into the covenant.—Close with Christ. Deliberately make up the 
    match between him and your souls, in the way of the marriage covenant. "Let 
    him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall 
    make peace with me."</p>
<p align="justify">You must also break your covenant with your lust.—Many 
    pretend to covenant with Christ, but it plainly appears that they are in a 
    chariot which the devil drives. "That they may recover themselves out of the 
    snare of the devil, who are taken captive at his will." No wonder then such 
    persons make haste after another God. We must then part with our lusts, or 
    give up pretenses to the covenant, and as to Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They have it in faith. They have the hold of it by 
    believing. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of 
    things not seen. The possession by faith is a sure possession. When faith 
    lays hold upon and embraces Christ, it enfolds Heaven also in its arms, for 
    he is eternal life. He who believes on the Son has everlasting life. The 
    whole of Heaven and glory is in Christ, virtually, they who have him cannot 
    fail of all that is in Heaven. The best part of Heaven is in Christ 
    formally, for the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him. Christ is the 
    fairest flower in the heavenly country, the most precious jewel of all the 
    treasures of the upper house. If one had the sun to be ever with them, they 
    would have a lasting day, and would need neither moon nor star light. So the 
    saints having Christ, have everlasting light. Their Heaven is begun, and if 
    once there were no more clouds to intercept the light of that sun, which now 
    ever shines above their horizon, then they will have Heaven in its largest 
    extent.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith also embraces the promise, in which Heaven is 
    enrapt up. It is said of the Patriarchs, "These all died in faith, not 
    having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were 
    persuaded of them, and embraced them." Embraced them, that is, the things 
    promised. An allusion to mariners who having been long at sea, joyfully 
    salute the land, and as it were embrace it when they first see it. God's 
    word is as good security as possession. And as men may be possessed of land, 
    which they never saw, by promise, so may the believer be of the land that is 
    afar off by embracing the promise of it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They have it in hope well grounded, even hope on the 
    word. "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul; both sure and steadfast, 
    and which enters into that within the veil." Therefore salvation is 
    attributed to hope. "For we are saved by hope." By faith the Christian 
    fights and overcomes, and by hope he gathers the spoil. Ask those who have 
    been plunged into despair, and they will tell you, that they have been in 
    Hell while on earth. Despair brings up Hell into the soul, and true hope 
    brings down Heaven into it. Hope is enjoyment antedated, and excites the 
    same joy, delight, and delight, that enjoyment does; as you may see in the 
    hope of worldly things. But with this difference, that earthly things are 
    commonly sweeter in expectation than enjoyment, but spiritual things quite 
    otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They have it in the first fruits of it. "We have 
    the first fruits of the Spirit." And these are the earnest of our 
    inheritance." Thus they are entered on possession already. They have got a 
    cluster of the first ripe grapes of the heavenly Canaan. They have "the 
    earnest of the Spirit." Now the earnest is both a part of the price, and a 
    pledge of the whole. What is grace but glory in the bud; or glory but grace 
    come to perfection. "We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory 
    of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as 
    by the Spirit of the Lord." We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what it is to have rational evidence of 
    Heaven. If a man pretend a right to houses or lands, and there be any to 
    question his right, he looks out his evidences, brings forth his papers, and 
    witnesses, to evince that that house or land is his, which will be 
    sustained, so far as they are agreeable to the laws of the land, where the 
    house or land is situated. Now, brethren, we all pretend to the house of 
    Heaven, to Canaan's land. It is unreasonable and absurd to pretend to 
    possession, if we do not pretend to a right of possession, for there can be 
    no violent possessors of Heaven. Now if you pretend a right to Heaven, it is 
    highly reasonable you have something to evidence that right. Now your right 
    is or will be questioned.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Ministers in the name of the Lord question your right. 
    They have reason to do it, because there are so many who deceive themselves 
    in this matter, and because deception in it is an eternal loss. You are told 
    that there is a generation pure in their own eyes, yet not cleansed from 
    their iniquities—we read of foolish virgins who perished by trusting to an 
    empty profession of religion, and therefore we call you to compare in the 
    court of your own conscience to clear up this matter. "Examine yourselves 
    whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves; don't you know your own 
    selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates." 
    "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give all diligence to make your calling and 
    election sure." And upon that occasion, you ought to produce some rational 
    evidence; "and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you 
    a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Does not your own conscience sometimes question your 
    right? Do not doubts and fears sometimes at least arise in your minds, like 
    a pain in the side? If they do not now it is very strange, you must be very 
    fast asleep. But conscience will do it afterwards, when it comes to be 
    enlightened, and it may be when there is no remedy. You should have 
    something provided for such a time.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Satan will question your right when he sees his 
    opportunity. If you be a child of God, Satan, when he has you at an 
    advantage, will assuredly question your right. He questioned Christ's 
    sonship. "If you be the Son of God." And he will do his utmost to raise his 
    black band of doubts and fears to attack you; and how will you fight against 
    them but by the sword of the Spirit, rational scriptural evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">If you be a deceiver of yourself, it is like Satan will 
    not much trouble you that way, until the time come that you can hardly 
    expect to get a right, and then you may come to know to the torment of your 
    soul, that you have none and never had.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Our right to Heaven will be sifted before the 
    tribunal of God, and no pretenses will do there that cannot be made good by 
    the word which contains the laws of the kingdom. Fraudulent pretenders to 
    Heaven there may be now, but no fraudulent possessors will be there. And if 
    your right then be judged null, there is no mending the matter through 
    eternity. Who then would venture such a business on such a final decision, 
    without first canvassing their right in their own minds.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, a right to Heaven is made out to a man that has it 
    by evidences. And evidence for Heaven is the gracious work of the Spirit of 
    God upon a person felt or discerned by him that has it, to be a gracious 
    work. "For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which 
    is in him? For clearing of this,</p>
<p align="justify">1. As the right to Heaven is given to every soul upon the 
    account of Christ's purchase, so soon as they are in Christ by faith; so the 
    Word of God, the laws of the kingdom of Heaven, secure it to such by 
    promise.—"There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Every soul in Christ has a gracious work wrought on it 
    by the Spirit of Christ. Heaven is begun in them by the gracious change by 
    which they are fitted for it. Their faith is not idle, but purifies the 
    heart, and establishes the law. The Spirit dwelling in them, works in them 
    gracious qualifications peculiar to the heirs of glory. "Giving thanks unto 
    the Father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the 
    saints in light."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Though these qualifications be wrought in a man, yet 
    if he do not discern them, they are not evidences, and he has not the 
    comfort of them. He is in the dark, he knows not where he is going; "he 
    walks in darkness, and has no light." And because so many deceive themselves 
    in this weighty matter it is a frightful case.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Evidence for Heaven, then, is the gracious work 
    of the Spirit, to which the promise of Heaven is annexed, and discovered to 
    be in the soul particularly that has it. So that here two things concur to 
    make it up.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Light into the Lord's promise and word in the Bible, 
    so that the soul believes and is persuaded, that such and such have a right 
    to Heaven and shall have it. For example, those that are truly poor in 
    spirit, Matthew 5:3. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the 
    kingdom of Heaven." Those that have a supreme transcendent love to the Lord 
    above all. Proverbs 8:17. "I love them that love me." Those that have a 
    universal love to the law. "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect 
    unto all your commandments." These are some of the laws of the kingdom, by 
    which men's right to it is determined. Now if the word be not believed, 
    there can be no evidence, for in that case there is no foundation for 
    evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Light into the Lord's work on the heart and life, by 
    which a man sees in himself those things to which the promise of Heaven is 
    annexed. For example, that he is poor in spirit, loves the Lord supremely 
    and loves his law universally; and therefore concludes according to the 
    word, that his is the kingdom of Heaven. The Lord loves him and he shall not 
    be ashamed. The man that has this, has evidence; and so can give a rational 
    account of the hope that is in him.</p>
<p align="justify">This evidence is more or less clear according to the 
    light that shines upon the Spirit's work in the heart. Grace has a light 
    with itself, and he who believes, loves the Lord and loves his law, may be 
    conscious of his own actions in these things, as well as in other cases. 
    Thus the saints have the testimony of their own spirits. The Spirit of the 
    Lord also shines upon his own work, and discovers it, sometimes with such a 
    degree of light that the man's spirit is helped to perceive it clearly, yet 
    all doubt is not removed. Sometimes he irradiates the soul with a light so 
    clear, that they can no more doubt of it than of the sun's shining, when it 
    is glaring in their eyes. "Thus the Spirit bears witness with our spirit 
    that we are the children of God." Let us now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Endeavor to show that the saints may have such 
    evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A believer may know that he has relative grace, that 
    he is justified, adopted, etc. Though he cannot go up to Heaven, and at 
    first hand read his name in the book of God's decrees; yet by opening the 
    Book of the word, and the Book of his own soul, and comparing the two 
    together, he may know that he is called and elected. We are "to give all 
    diligence to make our calling and election sure." And we desire that every 
    one of you do show the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope to the 
    end." In this way a believer may know that he is a child of God, and that 
    Christ loved him and died for him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A believer may know that he has inherent grace. He may 
    know that he believes, as sure as that he breathes. "I know," says Paul, 
    "whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I 
    have committed to him against that day." He may know that he has love to 
    Christ, and can appeal to God's omniscience upon the matter. "Lord," said 
    Peter to his Master, "you know all things, you know that I love you." And 
    thus believing that such persons have a right to Heaven, he may know he is 
    the man. And being persuaded of the certainty of the perseverance of the 
    saints, knowing that he has grace, and that so he shall never lose it, he 
    may be persuaded, he shall go to that house, whenever his earthly tabernacle 
    is dissolved.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider the office and work of the Spirit given to 
    all the saints. He is given them for a teacher to lead them into all the 
    truth, and particularly to discover the grace of God in them, by a heavenly 
    light on his own work. "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, 
    but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are 
    freely given to us of God." He is given for a witness, to be a "joint 
    witness with our own spirits that we are the sons of God," Romans 8:16. To 
    be a seal, which properly is to ensure an evidence. "And grieve not the Holy 
    Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption." And as an 
    earnest, which is both a part of the price and a pledge of the whole, "God 
    has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."</p>
<p align="justify">4. The operations and effects of faith in the soul clear 
    this point. Such as boldness and confidence with God, which cannot be 
    without some evidence of a relation to him as our Father. "In whom we have 
    boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him." Rejoicing in hope 
    of the glory of God which necessarily requires rational evidence of that 
    hope, Romans 5:2. This is the more to be regarded, as it is sometimes joy 
    unspeakable, 1 Peter 1:8. To such joy, plain, yes speaking evidences are 
    absolutely necessary. It is a joy which none can take from them, though they 
    should take all that they have in the world. John 16:22. Surely in that 
    case, they see that they have the treasure, of which no man, no devil can 
    rob them. And all this makes them cheerfully endure sufferings, "knowing in 
    themselves, that they have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Many of the saints have had such evidence for 
    Heaven, Job 19:25–27. David also could say, and I "will dwell in the house 
    of the Lord forever." And says Paul, "henceforth there is laid up for me a 
    crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge shall give me 
    that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his 
    appearing." And not only scriptural saints, but others of an inferior rank, 
    who have been capable to give an account of their hope, satisfying to their 
    own tender consciences and also to others. It now remains,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To give the reason of the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the command of God. "Give all diligence to make 
    your calling and election sure." God calls every man to bring his state to 
    the touchstone and to see what it is. "Examine yourselves, whether you are 
    in the faith; prove your own selves." He commands even his enemies to see 
    their state and to lay aside their deluding hopes. And he has not only made 
    Heaven sure to his people, but he would have them to be assured of it, for 
    their greater comfort.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because God has shown us the way, how we may come to a 
    clearness and certainty as to our state. The scripture everywhere abounds 
    with trying evidences, particularly the first epistle of John is written for 
    that very end. "These things have I written unto you that believe on the 
    name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life." How 
    can we then quietly continue in the dark, not knowing how it is, and how it 
    will be with us, when the Lord has compassed us about with so much spiritual 
    light for that purpose. How can we pretend to tenderness, and yet slight a 
    duty for which he has so fully provided?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because salvation is a matter so important, it is 
    unaccountable stupidity not to be concerned for evidences. Who but a fool or 
    a madman would slight the business of removing to another house on earth, as 
    men do that of the house of Heaven? Now, every person, masters and servants, 
    must know what comes of them at the term; only we are not inquiring what 
    comes of us at death, whether we shall go to the house above or the house 
    below.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is necessary for the honor of God, the good and 
    edification of others, and that both in life and death. "But sanctify the 
    Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every one 
    that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear." 
    It is little that we glorify God in our lives, and alas! the most are in 
    hazard of dying as they live. They live in hopes of Heaven, of which they 
    can give no good account and may even come to die in the same way. It is but 
    an obscure death little to the honor of God, or the edification of others; 
    when persons pass away without clear evidences, or struggles to recover 
    brangled evidences.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Use of Exhortation</p>
<p align="justify">To those who have never been at pains to get a right to 
    Heaven. Why should I bid them seek evidence for a thing, which they were 
    never at pains to get. Alas as to many, whatever be their hopes for Heaven, 
    evidences of Hell are written on their foreheads. Such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Hardness of heart and blindness of mind constant and 
    habitual, which create in them a deep security in their soul ruining 
    courses. A stone is fitted to go downward, and so are they for the pit. "If 
    our gospel be hid, it is hidden to them that are lost."</p>
<p align="justify">2. God's giving up with them, saying "Ephraim is joined 
    to his idols, let him alone." Some have had conscience as God's deputy 
    struggling long with them, but at length they have got their consciences 
    seared. There is none now to peep, or mutter within their breast, to disturb 
    their rest in sin. Saul was near being cut off, when he was cast off.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Profanity of life, which cannot fail to have a 
    miserable end, as long as dogs and swine are debarred from Heaven. Those 
    that have nothing but the form of religion may go to Hell, but none that 
    want a form will ever see Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Unfruitfulness under the means of grace. A total 
    unfruitfulness, when neither heart nor life is made better, but the leprosy 
    of sin continues spreading, what can be expected but destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">I would exhort you who have not yet made it your work to 
    get a right to Heaven, now to begin that work in earnest; by your closing 
    with Christ offered in the gospel, taking him in all his offices, marrying 
    the heir that the dowry house may be yours.</p>
<p align="justify">Motives. 1. While you have no right to Heaven, you are 
    heirs of wrath and Hell. "You are children of wrath." And it is a fearful 
    case to live bound over to the wrath of God. Such is your case while without 
    Christ, and without a title to Heaven. You are under the curse, and 
    condemned already. "For he who believes not the Son shall not see life; but 
    the wrath of God abides on him."</p>
<p align="justify">2. This is the great work of time to be securing your 
    happiness for eternity. What should a malefactor do in the time of a 
    reprieve, but be seeking a remission if it may be obtained. He who dwells in 
    an old ruinous house should be looking out for another. Now you are like a 
    man standing on a spot of ground encompassed with the sea, which the tide 
    will soon cover. It is not time to sleep in such a situation; so time before 
    long will be swallowed up in eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We have some hopes of Heaven, because we are yet 
    within the line of mercy. Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but eternal 
    disappointment will kill the heart and pierce the heart with ten thousand 
    sorrows. Hell will be sad to them that know nothing of Heaven, but much 
    worse for them, who, by its flames, are awakened out of their pleasant 
    dreams of Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">4. All of us have Heaven in our offer. The marriage of 
    the King's Son is offered to us and Heaven with him, for our dowry house. 
    "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation." To fall short of an 
    offered Heaven will be a double Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It will not always be so. The day will come that 
    the doors will be shut and once shut will never more be opened. When once 
    time is gone, God will bar them so, that for the ages of eternity, there 
    shall be access no more. Then shall that oath have its full effect, "Unto 
    whom I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest."</p>
<p align="justify">There are several, I hope, who have been careful about 
    securing a right to Heaven; who have been laboring to lay hold on the 
    Covenant and Christ in it. I exhort you to try what has been the issue of 
    all your pains that way, to try your state, and make out your title for 
    Heaven by evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I will urge this upon you with some motives.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I will point out the hindrances of evidences for 
    Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall give you some directions in order to your 
    obtaining evidences for Heaven. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To urge you with some motives; to try what has been 
    the issue of all your pains to obtain a right to Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">1. This is a troublesome world. Every person has his 
    cross for every day. And the design of each of these is to tell you, your 
    rest is not here. It is hope that supports the soul, and this hope must be 
    raised not upon the prospect of ease in this life, of which we may soon be 
    disappointed, but upon evidences of a better life. "For if in this life only 
    we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable." And these hopes 
    of a better life may last, though the clouds return after the rain.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Many deceive themselves in that matter, and will meet 
    with an eternal disappointment, as the foolish virgins did, Matthew 25. 
    There are two things clear as the sun in this matter. First, that there are 
    few comparatively that will be saved. "Strait is the gate and narrow is the 
    way that leads unto life, and few there be that find it." Christ's flock is 
    a little flock. The second thing is, that the far greater part entertain 
    hopes of Heaven. There are very few that do not expect, that they shall be 
    the persons that shall be saved. Hence it follows many will be deceived and 
    disappointed.—There are two sorts of self-deceivers that much abound in the 
    world. First, formal hypocrites unacquainted with regeneration and the life 
    of faith, yet acquainted with the external duties of religion. These build 
    their hopes on some things that look like grace and holiness in heart and 
    life, but they do not examine them narrowly, by the touchstone of God's 
    word, hence they are deceived by counterfeit instead of current coin. This 
    is the more to be regarded, that there is no grace but a hypocrite may have 
    the counterfeit of it. The second class are the ignorant and the profane, 
    who also hope that all will be well in the end. These trouble not themselves 
    to search for satisfaction as evidence of their interest in Christ, but 
    please themselves with the hopes which they rear up upon the general offers 
    of the gospel, the mercy of God, and the death of Christ; without any 
    evidence of their being in the Covenant, or having had the virtue of the 
    blood of Christ applied to them. While thus so many deceive themselves, it 
    is a loud call to us to make out our evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The consideration of the time in which we live should 
    engage us to this. Though the Lord has done wonders for us, yet there are 
    sure symptoms of the Lord's anger against us, as call aloud to us to seek 
    evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a time of divisions, and these appear to be still 
    increasing. Now while there is such reeling and staggering, some saying 
    this, some that the other is the way, let us to take special heed to be 
    right in the main. While some are saying, I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos; 
    let us put it to the trial until we be able, each for himself to say, I am 
    of Christ. Division has a sad influence on practical godliness; for the 
    corrupt heart is apt to lay much weight on what side the man takes in such a 
    time, and a mighty stress is laid upon being found in good company, as each 
    alleges for himself that he is. The controversies and disputes about these 
    things are apt to wear out soul exercise. But let us remember, that into how 
    many parts soever the world and the church be now divided, the time comes 
    when there will be but two parties, those that are in, and those that are 
    out of Christ. The regenerated and the unregenerated.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a time in which, though strokes are delayed, yet 
    there is no such repentance and reformation as may give us ground to think, 
    that the bitterness of death is past. But be it as it will, every one ought 
    to lay his account with sufferings. None are saved but those who have as 
    much faith and love to Christ as will make him cleave to him, come what 
    will. "If any man, says Jesus, come to me, and hate not his father and 
    mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yes, and his own 
    life also, he cannot be my disciple." Now should a time of public calamity 
    come, how comfortless is the condition of men without evidences for Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Death is approaching. We must die, and it is horrible 
    to think of looking the grim messenger in the face, without evidence of 
    eternal life. We must then enter into an unalterable state forever, and must 
    we venture into it as by a leap in the dark, not knowing where we may land? 
    Are Heaven and Hell such light things, that it is a matter indifferent to 
    us, which of them be our portion? O consider that last moment that will 
    forever determine our state, when we shall be lying on a dying bed, either 
    holy angels, or devils waiting on to carry us to our eternal abode.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We know not when this may be our lot, or how we may be 
    brought to death. We may pass away in a moment in a surprising manner when 
    we are not looking for it. We may die in such a case, that we may be 
    incapable of doing anything for eternity. Or the pain and tossing may be 
    such, that it will be difficult to get a composed thought. Do now then in 
    proper time, what you would then wish to have done.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Evidences for Heaven are excellent means for a 
    holy life. Some say that assurance is hurtful to piety, and inclines men to 
    looseness, but the contrary is evident from the word, which enforces 
    holiness from assurance. "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, 
    let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and and spirit, 
    perfecting holiness in the fear of God." The scripture expressly asserts the 
    tendency of assurance to holiness. "And every man that has this hope in him 
    purifies himself, even as he is pure." And experience testifies that those 
    who had the clearest evidences have been the most holy of all the saints, as 
    Abraham, David, Paul. And this distinguishes well grounded evidence of the 
    Lord's love from delusion which can never sanctify the soul. But to come to 
    particulars:</p>
<p align="justify">1. A man's having evidences for Heaven, inflames the soul 
    with love to the Lord. One flame begets another, so the love of God to the 
    soul clearly discerned, will increase the soul's love to the Lord. "We love 
    him because he first loved us." He sits in the warm sunshine who sits under 
    evidences of the Lord's love, and this cannot fail to melt the heart. The 
    soul will be filled with admiration of God's goodness and grace.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It humbles the soul. None are more vile in their own 
    eyes, than those who are most highly lifted up in the manifestations of the 
    Lord's love. Abraham is but dust and ashes, while God is speaking to him as 
    a friend. When David's honors were conferred upon him, he exclaimed, "Who am 
    I, O Lord God? and what is my house, that you have brought me hitherto?" In 
    2 Corinthians 12 you will find Paul as high as he could be raised, verse 4. 
    Caught up into paradise. And yet as low as he could lay himself, though, 
    says he, verse 11. I be nothing. For always the nearer a soul comes to God, 
    God appears the greater, and the creature the less.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It produces tenderness of heart and life, great care 
    to please God in all things, and watchfulness against every sin that may 
    disturb the soul's rest in God. The empty traveler walks at random, fearing 
    nothing, because he has nothing to lose. But he who has full pockets will 
    look well to himself. The solid hope of Heaven, makes the soul study to be 
    heavenly, and the hope of the marriage day makes the spouse of Christ to 
    prepare for it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It gives strength against corruption. "Give all 
    diligence to make your calling and election sure, for if you do these things 
    you shall never fall." The heavenly light within the soul, cleared as to its 
    eternal interest, dispels the darkness that strengthens the work of 
    corruption, and fits a man for every duty of a holy life. Faith is the 
    provider for all our other graces. It brings in oil to the lamp, and the 
    more evidence faith has, it can do its office the better. A doubting 
    Christian will always be a weak Christian, even as the soldier who has 
    little hopes of victory, will be readily faint-hearted.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Assurance is the best support under sufferings and 
    afflictions, as the connection of the text shows. It is a storehouse of 
    patience and contentment under the rod, for it shows them things will have a 
    happy issue; and under the want of all things, it shows them, that they 
    shall inherit all things. It makes a man despise the frowns of the world, 
    and the threats of enemies. Why should they fear the falling of their 
    tabernacle, who know that they have an house not made with hands eternal in 
    the heavens? They need not fear death, when to them it is an inlet to 
    eternal life.</p>
<p align="justify">6. It fills a man with contempt of the world. If one know 
    that his treasure is in Heaven, his heart will be there also. "God forbid," 
    says the apostle, "that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus 
    Christ, by which I am crucified unto the world, and the world unto me." If 
    you gaze on the shining sun for a time, you will scarcely discern the beauty 
    of the earth for some time after. And he who can solace himself, in the 
    contemplation of Heaven as his, this will much sink the value of created 
    things with him. It sets a man above the earth, so that it must needs appear 
    a very little thing.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, To sum up all in one word, it makes a man fit 
    either to live or die. Alas! how often are even good people unfit for 
    either? Unfit to live, because of the weakness of grace, in the midst of 
    temptations and trials. Unfit to die, for want of evidence of grace.—Whereas 
    the man that has solid evidence for Heaven, he has what can bear him through 
    trials, support him under temptations, and even in the hour of death. We now 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To point out the hindrances of evidences for Heaven. 
    There are very few have a right to Heaven, and those that have no right can 
    have no evidence; yet there are far fewer that have evidences of that right, 
    of which they can give any rational account. The causes of this are these,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The great hindrance is a loose and irregular life. For 
    as troubled water will not reflect the image of the sun, as clear standing 
    water will do, so an irregular walk, will not afford that evidence of grace 
    which a strict holy life will do. "He who has my commandments," says Jesus, 
    "and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he who loves me shall be loved 
    of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him." While 
    violent temptations and passions disturb the soul, it is as the troubled 
    sea, dark and muddy. The outbreakings of corruption are as the mists and 
    fogs that darken the air.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Weakness of knowledge in matters of religion.—This has 
    been very evident in some, who when they have once got their judgments 
    informed from the Lord's word, they have then got their troubled consciences 
    eased.</p>
<p align="justify">There are four things have a very bad influence here.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Some weak persons have a notion that assurance of 
    an interest in Christ and clear discerning of grace in the heart, is an 
    extraordinary thing, at least that it is a business of insuperable 
    difficulty, that they never have courage to attempt it. But pray, will you 
    consider that God calls all Christians to it, weak and strong. "Give all 
    diligence to make your calling and election sure." He has appointed ordinary 
    means for it. "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name 
    of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that 
    you may believe on the name of the Son of God. How then can it be looked on 
    as an extraordinary thing? And is it a business of insuperable difficulty to 
    a man that understands the nature of grace, to reflect upon and discern the 
    motions of his own soul within him, and compare them with the word? Is it 
    such a very hard business for a man's own spirit to discern itself and its 
    own actings and motions? "For what man knows the things of a man, save the 
    spirit of man which is in him?</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Mistakes as to the nature of evidences for 
    Heaven. It is surprising to find the weakness of some, in other respects not 
    ignorant, who being asked the grounds of their hope for Heaven and evidences 
    for eternal life, will tell you that they build on such scriptures as these, 
    "Him that comes unto me, I will by no means cast out," "Christ died to save 
    sinners."—These, and such declarations as these, are a foundation for the 
    direct act of faith; but still the question returns, How know you that you 
    have come to Christ? or that Christ died for you? and the only answer to 
    these questions must be brought from some parts of the saving change which 
    the man finds to be wrought in him.</p>
<p align="justify">Ignorance of the nature of true grace in general is a 
    third thing that has bad effects here. If in a time in which much 
    counterfeit money is in circulation, a person receives a purse of good 
    money, who yet does not know money, and cannot discern between real and 
    counterfeit coin, that man cannot be easy. So how is it possible that a man 
    can have solid evidence for Heaven, who knows not how to distinguish between 
    true grace and that which is counterfeit. It is a great defect in many, who 
    in other respects are knowing, that in this matter they are at a loss. 
    Perhaps they can tell you, that love to God, and a real desire after 
    righteousness, are marks of grace, but their loss is they cannot 
    circumstantiate that love and desire, so as to distinguish them from 
    hypocritical love and desire.</p>
<p align="justify">The fourth thing is the razing of foundations still upon 
    every new prevailing of iniquity, so that by this means some are still kept 
    fluctuating and unsettled. For, say they, if it be so, why am I thus? But 
    why do they think that grace will get so soon free of its ill neighbor. This 
    is surely your weakness. Iniquities prevail against you. If you labor to 
    watch, and upon your frequent failures flee anew to the blood of sprinkling, 
    and look to Christ for his Spirit to subdue sin, and be more sensible of 
    your own weakness, and your need of Christ and imputed righteousness, you 
    may even draw evidence from this, "That by two immutable things in which it 
    was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have 
    fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Sloth and laziness are a great hindrance. Under their 
    influence persons cannot be at the trouble to call the soul to an account. 
    Alas! how sad is it that many who dare not knowingly neglect other duties, 
    live nevertheless in the habitual neglect of self-examination, and inquiring 
    by scripture marks into the state of their souls. They do not make it their 
    business to observe the way of God towards them, nor the way of their 
    spirits towards God. They never set themselves to seek evidences for Heaven, 
    until God in his anger lets them be tossed with violent doubts and fears. 
    And it is not to be expected that evidences for Heaven, will just fall down 
    into the bosom of indolent unobserving Christians.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Indistinctness in closing with Christ and accepting of 
    the covenant. If a bargain be huddled up in a haste, no wonder the man be 
    not very clear about it. The not making the work of believing more clear and 
    distinct causes such confusion in the review of it, as also an unclearness 
    and uncertainty in pleading the benefit of it. Therefore labor to be very 
    distinct in the renunciation of idols, particularly that which is the idol 
    of jealousy, in closing with Christ in all his offices, and for all the 
    glorious ends for which the Father has given him to poor sinners, for 
    sanctification particularly as well as justification.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The violence of temptations. God for the trial of 
    his own permits it, and then Satan tosses them so as they can hardly find 
    where to fasten their feet. They stand as it were in a quagmire and find 
    hard work to dispute their sincerity against the tempter. As it is the great 
    work of Satan to blow up graceless persons in their presumptuous hopes, so 
    it is his grand design, to rob the gracious of their peace and the comfort 
    of their grace. For this purpose he raises darkness about them, and then 
    orders the poor soul to read its evidences. And he has carried his point 
    far, when he gets the soul over to his own side to dispute itself out of 
    Christ. "In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my sore ran in the 
    night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted."</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes Satan gives the hopes of the saints a side 
    stroke, inferring their naughtiness from the way of the Lord's dealing with 
    them in afflictions. He gets them first possessed with jealousies of the 
    Lord's love, and unkindly thoughts of an afflicting God, and then carries 
    them forward to conclude that their stroke is not the stroke of the Lord's 
    children, and therefore their spot is not the spot of his people. "Call now, 
    if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you 
    turn?" In this case it is good to use the sword of the Spirit, the Word of 
    God, in which it is very like you will find the like case in which the 
    saints have been. And if you cannot find the parallel of your own case 
    yourselves, you should take advice of others, who may be better acquainted 
    with the Scriptures. But cases are like faces, though for substance the 
    same, yet possibly some circumstances may differ; and it is a needless rack 
    to please Satan, on which persons put themselves when nothing will satisfy 
    them, but the case of a scripture saint, exactly like their own in every 
    circumstance. To dismount the devil's cannon mounted upon this ground, you 
    need no more but to observe these scriptures, Ecclesiastes 11:1, 2. 1 
    Corinth. 4:9. Psalm 71:7. and 77:19.</p>
<p align="justify">But again, Satan sometimes gives their hopes a foundation 
    stroke, overturning to their view the very foundations of their peace, in 
    their first turning to God, and closing with Christ, persuading them all was 
    naught, because the law work was not deep enough, and their repentance was 
    not complete. Often have the saints themselves to blame for this. They lay 
    much of the weight of their peace, upon the depth of their convictions and 
    terrors, and the bitterness of their repentance. Whereas the weight of it is 
    to lie entirely on the blood of Christ, for nothing else can shelter us from 
    the wrath of God. "For other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, 
    which is Jesus Christ. For he is our peace. And his blood alone can purge 
    our consciences from dead works, to serve the living God." And if people 
    will lay on a plaster that cannot cover the sore, they need not wonder, if 
    being once skinned over, it should break out again. I know no need of a 
    farther depth of the law work than to convince a sinner of his absolute need 
    of Christ for justification and sanctification. And there is no depth at all 
    of true repentance less or more but what flows from faith. So that if your 
    peace and hope of Heaven, have been built on the depth of the law work, or 
    repentance, lay them not there again, but upon the blood of Christ entirely, 
    as apprehended by faith. If you have seen the absolute need of Christ for 
    sanctification as well as justification, this was sufficient to reach the 
    end, namely your closing with Christ for all his salvation. And whatever be 
    the defects in your repentance you must not stand off from believing until 
    you have repented more deeply. If you do, you are egregious fools. But 
    believe that you may repent. And the more evidence and confidence your faith 
    in the promise has your repentance will succeed the better. "They shall look 
    upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns 
    for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in 
    bitterness for his first born."</p>
<p align="justify">Satan also sometimes gives their hopes a universal shock, 
    by plying their corruptions hard, and stirring up the muddy pool of the 
    heart, until there is not one drop of clear water to be seen in it; but 
    whatever of Heaven be in the heart, Hell is uppermost. This is the heaviest 
    case of all. I will not advise a person in this case to exert himself in 
    seeking evidences for Heaven. No, it were cruelty indeed to order such a 
    person to read his evidences, before the smoke of Hell be got out of the 
    house and he gets his candle lighted. The man's proper work in such a case 
    is to believe, hope against hope, to close with Christ anew for all his 
    salvation, from the guilt and power of sin; and to hold by the promise of 
    justification and sanctification also, in direct opposition to all the noise 
    that corruption makes: until the power of sin being subdued, by faith, his 
    darkness be removed, so that he may behold his evidences again.</p>
<p align="justify">The cause of this, as of the rest, ordinarily is, the 
    soul's falling secure and grieving the Spirit, for which cause they are left 
    to fall like Samson before the Philistines. And the proper expedient is to 
    renew their faith and repentance before the Lord, because they have sinned, 
    to wrestle by faith through the temptation, until they get their feet fixed 
    upon a rock. It now remains,</p>
<p align="justify">III. That I give you some directions, in order to your 
    obtaining evidences for Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Labor to frame your conversation in such a manner as 
    may be most conducible to this end. "Whoever offers praise glorifies me; and 
    to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of 
    God." A careless way of walking with God, will keep the soul in a state of 
    confusion. Evidences for Heaven are not to be got at random. Solid and 
    lasting evidences are ordinarily the product of a watchful and tender course 
    of life. "The path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and 
    more unto the perfect day. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the 
    Lord." For this end quench not the Spirit; but cherish his motions, and 
    kindly entertain his suggestions. "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, 
    whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption." Those that slight his 
    convictions, cannot expect his sealings. Sins against knowledge waste the 
    conscience, and much darken evidences for Heaven. These grieve the Spirit in 
    a special manner, and when he is grieved he departs at least as to 
    comforting influences. And there ordinarily follows such sins, deadness, and 
    darkness, as bring distress to the soul. A wound to the Spirit of Christ, 
    presages a wound to our spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">You must also endeavor to keep grace in exercise, and 
    labor to be growing Christians. The flaming fire is easily discerned, when a 
    fire not blown cannot be perceived. It is the decay of grace that puts it 
    out of sight, as plants in harvest go back and back until they are out of 
    sight, their roots only remaining in the earth. Were we exercising grace in 
    a way suitable to every condition of our life, and so keeping up communion 
    with God in providence, and ordinances, it would reflect a comfortable light 
    upon our state. 2 Peter 1:5–10.</p>
<p align="justify">You should be strict, holy, and regular in your walk. 
    "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all your 
    commandments." Were that our daily exercise to keep a conscience void of 
    offence towards God and towards men, it would be no great difficulty to 
    gather evidences. He who takes a sinful liberty to himself in either table 
    of the law, does so far darken the evidence of his love to God, and furnish 
    suspicions of hypocrisy against himself. "He who has my commandments and 
    keeps them, he it is that loves me." And the work of righteousness shall be 
    peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever. An 
    uniform walk is the high way to comfort, whereas an inequality of 
    conversation, when people hold a short time right, and a long time wrong, 
    must needs make short lived joys, and long lasting darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Labor to keep up a relish of spiritual things by a 
    heavenly frame. "For our conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look 
    for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ." It is no wonder people want 
    evidences, when their hearts, clogged with a carnal earthly frame, cannot 
    relish the things of God. "I have written unto him the great things of my 
    law, but they were counted as a strange thing." It is observed by some, that 
    dogs cannot hunt well in the spring, because the sweet odors of the flowers 
    and herbs, hinder them much from smelling the have. Surely the less people 
    are dead to the world, the less they are alive to God, and the more carnal 
    and earthly they are in the frame of their spirits, they are the unfitter to 
    gather evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">It is also necessary to acquaint yourselves with the 
    scriptures. "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name 
    of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that 
    you may believe on the name of the Son of God." Want of a proper 
    acquaintance with the scriptures is one great reason of the darkness in 
    which many walk. A Christian that would enjoy clear evidence, should much 
    study two books, the book of God, and the book of his own heart. Look 
    without him into the Bible, and within him to his own heart. The attentive 
    believing study of the Bible, would make him the better understand his own 
    heart, both as to the good and evil of it; and the due observation of his 
    heart, would be an excellent help to understand the Bible. Whom the Bible 
    justifies God will never condemn, and whom it condemns he will not justify; 
    for it is his own word. Read it for your own case.</p>
<p align="justify">You must also be much in prayer. "Hitherto you have asked 
    nothing in my name: ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full." 
    Prayer in faith, is an useful exercise, in which the sails of the soul being 
    spread out, lie fair for a gale of the Spirit. It is a notable mean to 
    gather the heart, and this is the proper place of the rendezvous of the 
    graces of the Spirit.—There sorrow for, and hatred of sin, is stirred up: 
    there love to God exerts itself, and there the spices that gave not their 
    smell before are beaten, which sometimes give the soul a fullness of joy.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, Be daily making application of the blood of 
    Christ. This is to wash your feet, that is to wash off the guilt of daily 
    infirmities. John 13:10. As we contract new defilement, we should be dipping 
    daily, and that keeps the accounts clear, and a good conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">Direction 2.—Make use of the means, by which evidences 
    for Heaven are immediately procured. Here you are called,</p>
<p align="justify">To set yourselves to solemn stated self-examination. 
    Evidences for Heaven often lie hidden until they be searched out by this 
    exercise, 2 Corinthians 13:5. And they that would do this to purpose, for 
    lasting comfort, would not satisfy themselves with those answers of peace, 
    which their consciences give them at a sermon, or a prayer, or some 
    occasional meditation. These comforts are too soon taken up to be permanent. 
    They would even set some time apart for this work. They would do with their 
    hearts, as men do with one with whom they have long accounts. A passing word 
    will not do it. But they will set a time to make up their accounts and go 
    through the particulars. And here I would advise, first of all, to take a 
    back look of your ways, to see your sins in order to humiliation, and then 
    to go and confess your sins to God as particularly as may be; and then to 
    examine yourselves as to your willingness to receive Christ as he offers 
    himself, and that being found, then to renew your closing with Christ by 
    faith, and covenanting with God in him as distinctly and explicitly as you 
    can. After which you may consider of your evidences for Heaven. And there is 
    a threefold evidence may be gained here.</p>
<p align="justify">1. An evidence in the act of faith, or closing with Jesus 
    Christ. This is more or less clear according to the strength of faith. In 
    all faith of adherence there is some evidence. "Though he slay me, yet will 
    I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. He also shall 
    be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. My God, my God, 
    why have you forsaken me." For a sensible soul will never lay its weight on 
    that which it does not believe will bear it, though it may be accompanied 
    with doubts which is the weakness of the evidence. And that there is some 
    evidence in the nature of faith, is plain from the Old Testament names of 
    it, trusting, staying, and the like; and from the New Testament names, 
    Confidence, full assurance of faith, and the like. This evidence is founded 
    on the promise of the gospel, upon which the person is to believe that 
    Christ is ready to give himself to him, and that the soul accepting the 
    offer, Christ is his, without any regard to any qualification distinct from 
    this acceptance. Just as if a man should hold out a loaf of bread to a great 
    company, saying whoever will, shall have it. Were there a starving hungry 
    creature there, what would he do, but presently reach out his hand, and 
    reaching out to it would say, then it is mine, and catch hold of it while he 
    is speaking these words. Wherefore seeing God allows you this evidence, 
    carry it as far as you can, the farther always the better. Only this 
    evidence cannot satisfy others, but only the man himself. Therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is another evidence may be obtained here, and 
    that is an evidence from the act of faith, and this is obtained by 
    reflection upon the direct act of faith or closing with Christ. Such 
    evidence had the Eunuch when he said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the 
    Son of God." And Paul when he said, "for I know whom I have believed, and am 
    persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against 
    that day." Even as by the light of a candle, we see the candle itself as 
    well as other things, so believing we may know that we do believe, and that 
    therefore Christ is ours, and Heaven ours, though we can see no other 
    gracious qualifications in us, but what are included in the act of faith. 
    For this evidence it is necessary that we know well what faith is, and what 
    the scripture makes over to it. So the reasoning runs thus, whoever believes 
    shall be saved, and whoever renouncing their own wisdom and all other 
    guides, give up themselves to Christ, receiving and resting upon him as 
    their teacher, guide, and leader forever; and renouncing their own 
    righteousness, all confidence and worth in themselves, their doing or 
    suffering, and receive and rest on Christ alone for righteousness and the 
    atonement, and heartily giving up with all their idols, resign themselves 
    wholly to Christ's government: They believe and shall be saved. But I; (may 
    a person on the act of believing and closing with Christ say) do renounce 
    all these, and do receive Christ, therefore I believe I shall be saved. Now 
    this is good evidence, not only to satisfy ourselves, but to give a rational 
    ground of our hope to others. But because all true faith is effectual to 
    sanctify the soul, "for God purifies the hearts of his people by faith," and 
    there is no true faith without the fruits of holiness accompanying it, 
    therefore the best and strongest evidence is when to the two former is 
    joined.</p>
<p align="justify">3. An evidence from the fruits of faith. And this 
    evidence is as manifold as there are fruits of faith, or other graces of the 
    Spirit besides faith. These fruits of faith are what we principally mean by 
    evidences for Heaven and these are to be gathered up in self-examination in 
    which three things are to be done.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The word which contains the laws of the kingdom of 
    Heaven, by which our title to it must be decided, is to be produced, and the 
    characters and marks of the state of grace are from that word to be fairly 
    laid out as the touchstone by which we are to examine our state. Isaiah 
    8:20. And here special heed must be taken to fix the mark according to the 
    word, that it neither be too low and wide, to take in those that are still 
    creeping on the earth, and formal hypocrites; nor yet too high and narrow 
    above the reach of babes in Christ and excluding weak believers.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The scripture mark being laid out, the man is 
    impartially as in the sight of God to bring his case to the touchstone, and 
    see whether it be to be found in him.—Let him search and see if there be in 
    him a work of God answering to that Word of God. And here he must beware of 
    either self-love on the one hand, causing him to believe that to be in him, 
    which conscience after an impartial search cannot find, or of weakness in 
    denying that to be in him to which his conscience bears witness, 
    notwithstanding many infirmities.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The mark being found in him, he is thereupon to 
    conclude, that according to the scripture he has a title to Heaven, and 
    assure himself of it upon the evidence of the Word of God in the scriptures, 
    and of the work of God in the heart. And thus evidences for Heaven are 
    gathered in the way of self-examination.</p>
<p align="justify">To make this plain by an example. A person examining 
    himself pitches on the love of God as a mark of one in the state of grace, 
    because the word says, I love them that love me. But seeing a hypocrite may 
    have a sort of love to God, therefore it must be duly circumstantiated; as, 
    1. The true love of God is a love to him, not for his benefits only, but for 
    himself, "My beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand." All 
    that is in God is God, for he is no compound being, therefore he who loves 
    God for himself, loves all his perfections, his holiness, justice, goodness, 
    truth, and omniscience. 2. True love to God is supreme transcendent love; it 
    is a love to him above all other objects, lawful as well as unlawful. "Whom 
    have I in Heaven but you, and there is none in all the earth that I desire 
    besides you." 3. Such persons love the whole image of God expressed in the 
    whole law, even where it crosses their corrupt inclinations, "For I delight 
    in the law of God, after the inward man." No hypocrite can thus love God. 
    Thus the word is produced, and the mark from it is fixed.</p>
<p align="justify">In the next place, the man is to bring his case to this 
    touchstone, and he is as in the sight of God to examine himself by these or 
    the like questions. Do I love God? Do I love him not only for what he is to 
    me, but for what he is in himself? Are his glorious perfections, his exact 
    justice, his spotless holiness, his inviolable truth and all seeing eye, are 
    these hateful to me, are they lovely and amiable perfections in my sight? Do 
    I love him above all persons, and all things? Would I be content to part 
    with what is dearest to me for him, and rather than to part with him, even 
    though without him I were secured from Hell and earth? His holy law, that 
    transcript of his nature, which is so contrary to my corrupt nature, do I 
    love it though it crosses my corrupt nature, is it holy, just and good in my 
    eyes, even that part of it which condemns and forbids those most beloved 
    lusts of mine? If conscience answers yes to these questions as in the sight 
    of God, then the man has an evidence for Heaven, namely, love to God, 
    therefore he is a son and an heir of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, He ought upon that scriptural evidence to 
    conclude, therefore God loves me, because he loves them that love him, and 
    my conscience bears me witness that I truly love him. Thus evidences may be 
    gathered on other marks in the way of self-examination. And those that can 
    write would do well to write them.</p>
<p align="justify">Now the business of evidences being thus begun, in solemn 
    stated self-examination, they may be increased by daily observation. And 
    there are here two things jointly to be observed.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The way of the Lord's dealing with us. This we should 
    carefully notice that we may perceive whether he deals with us as with 
    children or not. "And as for me, you unhold me in mine integrity, and set me 
    before your face forever." But it is to little purpose to notice it, if it 
    be not withal compared with the scripture. For from thence only we can learn 
    the way of the Lord's dealing with his own.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The way of our souls towards God. This we should also 
    carefully observe that we may perceive whether our way be the way of the 
    Lord's children. And this we cannot know, unless we first notice the way, 
    dispositions and motions of our own souls, and then compare them with the 
    scripture. Thus some have gathered evidences in reading some portion of the 
    Lord's word, as particularly a psalm containing the breathings of a gracious 
    soul towards God, while, in the meantime, they have seen and felt the same 
    breathings in their own spirits, though they could not pretend to the same 
    degree of them. For if one reading such a portion of the Lord's word, do 
    withal read his own heart and soul in the words of the inspired penman, he 
    may very well conclude he has the same spirit which he had, though not in 
    the same measure.</p>
<p align="justify">But because the Lord's way of dealing with a man, as with 
    his own children, does produce in that man that disposition and motion of 
    soul that is in his children, they cannot well be separated, but should be 
    jointly considered, for in this lies the soul's communion with God, which is 
    always a mutual fellowship between the Lord and the soul. Now there are four 
    things I would recommend to the daily observation of Christians, that would 
    add to and increase their evidences procured and fixed in the way of solemn 
    stated self-examination, which I do think ought to proceed as a foundation 
    to all that would have lasting comfort by evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Lord Jesus Christ executing his offices in them. 
    As the child is nourished by the mother in whose womb it is conceived; so 
    those that are brought into the state of grace by closing with Christ in all 
    his offices are preserved and nourished in it, by his executing these 
    offices in them. So far then as you can discern in yourself Christ executing 
    these offices in you, so far you have solid evidence of your faith in, and 
    union with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">If then upon your dependence on the Lord Jesus for light 
    and teaching, you find your souls let into a sanctifying view of spiritual 
    things; for example, of your own sinfulness and nothingness which make you 
    vile, and Christ precious in your eyes; of the evil of sin, to hate it more; 
    of God's majesty and greatness, to fear and love him more; of Christ's 
    excellency, fullness and suitableness so as to prize him, rest in him, and 
    trust in him more; the world's vanity so as to draw your heart more from it 
    unto the Lord. If you find an enlivening light into the holy word conveyed 
    into your hearts, or have any difficulty to be cleared in your way at any 
    time, which you have tabled before the Lord, left with him, and depended on 
    him for clearing it, and have got seasonable light into it: these are plain 
    indications of Christ's exercising his prophetic office in you: I call it a 
    sanctifying view, for all such light from the Lord has a tendency to 
    holiness, which is next to the glory of God, the great scope of all Christ's 
    offices. "I am, said Jesus, the light of the world, he who follows me shall 
    not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." "Did not our heart 
    burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to 
    us the scriptures."</p>
<p align="justify">Again, If at any time your consciences are fried by the 
    fiery law touching upon guilt lying on you, and all your righteousness of 
    doing and suffering, confessing, praying, and repenting, gives way like 
    quick-sand under your feet, so that there is no standing before the angry 
    God upon them, or any of them, you then feel your sinking soul fixed as on a 
    rock upon the blood of Christ. If you shelter yourself under the covert of 
    his righteousness alone, and by application of that blood recover your peace 
    and confidence with God; and make use of that blood alone as the only refuge 
    against wrath, and lay it as the only foundation of your peace with God, and 
    the only procuring cause of God's favor to you, and in one word, rest under 
    the covert of that blood: that is Christ exercising his priestly office in 
    you.—"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal 
    Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead 
    works to serve the living God."</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, If you find that Lord to whom you have given up 
    yourself by providences and ordinances, more and more subduing you to 
    himself in a cordial resignation, and more ready and cheerful obedience to 
    his will: if you find the sovereign authority of his holy laws, because they 
    are his laws, swaying your hearts to his ways; and being sensible of your 
    inability to mortify your corruptions, you depend upon him for this 
    strength, in the use of means appointed by him, and so get your feet upon 
    the necks of them or any of them in some measure. This is Christ executing 
    his kingly office in you, "For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our 
    Lawgiver, the Lord is our King; he will save us. Not that we are sufficient 
    of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of 
    God."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Answers of prayer in the fulfilling of promises 
    depended upon before the Lord. Every answer of prayer is not an evidence for 
    Heaven. "And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul." 
    Nor yet every receiving of a thing contained in a promise, as deliverance 
    from trouble; for everything contained in a promise, that comes to a man, 
    does not come by virtue of the promise, it may come by common providence. 
    But when the mercy contained in a promise is desired of God in prayer, and 
    is drawn out by dependence on the promise through Christ, so that the prayer 
    is answered and the promise fulfilled, that is an evidence for Heaven, or of 
    the Lord's love. "Commit your way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and he 
    shall bring it to pass." For there is a real communion between God and the 
    soul, the soul depending on God by faith in his word, and God giving to the 
    soul according to his word. And thus the mercy comes in the channel of the 
    covenant, so it is an evidence of the Lord's love; though in itself it be 
    but an ordinary thing, as it were the reconciling and pacifying of an 
    offended neighbor or brother, of which we have a remarkable instance in 
    Jacob and Esau, Genesis 33:10. And such answers of prayer, as they come in 
    the channel of the holy covenant, so they advance holiness in the heart, and 
    they bind the soul more to holy obedience. Depart from me, all you workers 
    of iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping." They also 
    enlarge the heart with thankfulness to the Lord, and make the receiver 
    rejoice more in the giver, than in the gift. "Hannah prayed and said, my 
    heart rejoices in the Lord; mine horn is exalted in the Lord; my mouth is 
    enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The outlettings of the Lord's Spirit into the heart in 
    religious duties. I do the rather take notice of this, that several do give 
    this for their experience in religion and lay weight on it; namely, That 
    they find that they are not always alike in duties, but sometimes bound up, 
    and sometimes much enlarged. But I fear all that feel this, cannot duly 
    circumstantiate it; but some way deceive themselves. Know then, nature has 
    its own enlargements as well as grace. The stony ground hearers receive the 
    word with joy. Esau is in a flood of tears when he is seeking the lost 
    blessing. A man may at a time get another heart, like Saul, 1 Samuel 10:9. 
    and yet never get a new heart. But to describe these outlettings that you 
    may see whether they be gracious influences and may pass for evidences. 
    Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. If they be gracious influences they will be humbling, 
    "Then said I, woe is me! for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean 
    lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes 
    have seen the King, the Lord of hosts." And the more such influences come 
    upon us, the more they will humble the soul. Witness Paul, 2 Corinthians 
    12:4–11. For the influences of the Spirit are like the waters of the deluge, 
    which the more that they increased, they carried the ark the nearer Heaven, 
    and the nearer that the soul comes to God, who is light and in whom is no 
    darkness at all; the more its sinfulness, weakness, wants, and nothingness 
    must needs appear. But there is a kind of humiliation, which, because it is 
    not deep enough, becomes the foundation of pride of heart. Peter had a touch 
    of it when he said, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." 
    And the humblings which some persons have got, such as they were, have 
    indeed been grounds of lifting them up, like a young beggar that lifts up 
    himself among his neighbors, because he is newly furnished with implements 
    for the trade of begging. Therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Gracious influences gradually work out self, and the 
    more they increase, the more they kill self, that great competitor with 
    Christ. "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to 
    offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of you, and of your 
    own have we given you." They more and more remove the rotten grounds of 
    confidence with God, namely, our imperfect performances of duties, meltings 
    of heart, mournings, humiliations, and the like; that the soul has nothing 
    left it to depend upon, but the blood of Christ; but his obedience to the 
    law of sufferings unto death. Thus they are brought to rejoice in Christ 
    Jesus and to have no confidence in the flesh. So that the more and the 
    better the Christian does his duty, the less he sees of his own to depend 
    upon.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are sanctifying. They promote holiness in the 
    heart. "And I will pour upon the house of David, and the inhabitants of 
    Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look upon 
    me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for 
    his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in 
    bitterness for his first born." They are like John Baptist, a burning as 
    well as a shining light. They excite a man to the performance of moral 
    duties required in the ten commandments, making him more conscientious in 
    his duty to God and in his duty to his neighbor also. If a man has been in 
    duties taken into the temple of God, the air of it will appear about him in 
    the substantial duties of morality, when he comes abroad into the world. And 
    whatever is without this, is but counterfeit or delusion. For the moral law 
    of love to God and our neighbor, with all the moral duties belonging to it, 
    (as they have been explained to you on the commandments) are the eternal 
    indispensable rules of righteousness, to reduce men to the obedience of 
    which Christ died, and the Spirit is given, and instituted worship is 
    required.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The way of providence towards them in common things. 
    "Who is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the 
    loving kindness of the Lord." It is in the world as in a family, where the 
    father of the family provides both for children and servants; but there is 
    something in his way peculiar for the children. I believe there is a 
    speciality in God's way of dispensing common things to his people, which it 
    were worth inquiring into, though perhaps not so easy to find out. But I 
    judge, if a person can observe it to be the ordinary way of providence with 
    him, not to let him come too easily by common mercies, but to put 
    impediments in the way of them, so as to oblige him to carry the matter 
    before God in prayer, and to withhold it from him even then, until he see 
    himself absolutely unworthy of it, and be brought to an entire resignation 
    to the will of God in it, to give it or withhold it; and even to drive it to 
    the very point of hopelessness, in respect of second causes, that he may 
    have nothing but God himself to trust for it; and then, even then, 
    seasonably to bring it to his hand; that man may think that God takes the 
    way with him that he takes with his own, and it may be a good additional 
    evidence. See the rule, Psalm 10:17. "Lord, you have heard the desire of the 
    humble: you will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to hear." And 
    the example in the case of Jacob, Genesis 32. See also 2 Corinthians 1:8, 9.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Use and improve the sacrament of the Lord's supper for 
    this end, because it is appointed, that the Lord's people may be assured 
    that Christ is theirs and with him all things. "The cup of blessing which we 
    bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we 
    break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" In it Jesus Christ 
    condescends to preach his love and good-will to the very eyes of poor 
    doubting Christians, who, sensible of their own vileness and unworthiness, 
    though they desire Christ above all, yet cannot think his desire is towards 
    them. Therefore, that they may not wrong his love any more, by thinking that 
    it can never pitch upon the despicable object, that has nothing with which 
    to hire it, he goes farther with them in the sacrament, than in the word 
    preached. The word brings the report of his love to their ears, the 
    sacrament brings it to their eyes, and what we see affects us more than what 
    we hear. The word speaks only in the general, the sacrament points at every 
    communicant whose soul opens to receive Christ and his love, and says to 
    every one, broken for you. It is the profanity among those of the common 
    rabble, and the want of soul exercise among professors, that makes so few 
    communicants while there are so many spectators. A deep sense of personal 
    vileness, and an ardent desire of evidence of the Lord's love, would lay 
    their jay-feathers, that for the faults of others, real or pretended, keep 
    them from the communion table, where the institution of Christ is observed 
    and the sacrament dispensed by ministers sent in his own way.</p>
<p align="justify">Question. How may I improve the sacrament for evidence? 
    Answer, I have already directed you to self-examination, forget not that in 
    the first place. That being done, Then,</p>
<p align="justify">Before you come to the Lord's table, renew your covenant 
    with God and closing with Christ as solemnly, particularly, and diligently, 
    as you are capable; and take the stones of the place (if you please) where 
    you do it, witnesses to the transaction. And when you are at the table, 
    remember that you receive and close with Christ anew, that you may be the 
    more capable to perceive the real bargain which the sacrament is to seal.</p>
<p align="justify">Having thus closed with Christ, look on the bread and 
    wine as seals of the covenant; and do Christ the honor, when he speaks by 
    his sacramental word, This is my body broken for you, to believe him.—That 
    is, believe Christ is indeed yours, and that his body was really broken for 
    you; and look on that bread and wine as God's seal to it, which he will not 
    deny his own institution, and administered in his name by his messengers 
    called for that effect. If you have no mind to believe it, why will you sit 
    down at that table? If you have, then see you do it. This will honor Christ, 
    and advance your evidence and sanctification. And keep up the belief of it 
    afterwards, and recall to mind the sealed bargain when doubts arise.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Pray for the testimony of the Spirit. "The Spirit 
    itself bears witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God." 
    This is that which may quite raze all doubts and fears. He attests the truth 
    of the scriptures and the truth of grace in the heart. Of the one he says, 
    this is my word; of the other, this is my work. And so lets the soul see 
    without hesitation its title to Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude, This is the way to prepare you for the 
    sacrament, to help you to a holy life, to a safe and comfortable death, and 
    to glorify God and edify others in your death, being capable to give a 
    reason of the hope that is in you. Remember you are warned, stirred up, and 
    directed to this so much neglected, though most necessary duty. Cast not the 
    counsels of God behind your back in your life, lest you hear of it bitterly 
    in your death. "But if you know these things, happy are you if you do them." 
    Amen.</p>
