    THE day of expiation was the only anniversary stated fast and humiliation 
    that God gave to the church of the Jews: it was a sorrowful day, for 
    afflicting their souls; so that he who ate anything that day, was liable to 
    cutting off. The "feast of tabernacles" was the most joyful feast they had; 
    so that the Jews say, that he who never saw the rejoicing at the drawing of 
    water (used at this feast), never saw rejoicing all his life. The ceremonial 
    law was the Jews' gospel; and the gospel to them and us is glory let down in 
    words and syllables, the map of Immanuel's land, a looking-glass wherein we 
    see Heaven, a scheme and draught of the house with many mansions. The day of 
    expiation represents to me the time of this life, the state of the saints in 
    this world; the feast of tabernacles, Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">The day of expiation went before the feast of 
    tabernacles. Why should not our day of afflicting our souls go before our 
    days of rejoicing? The Babylonians began their natural day at the 
    sun-rising, and so their night came last. The Jews began theirs at 
    sun-setting, and so they had their night first. "Woe to you that laugh now, 
    you shall weep." "Blessed are they that mourn now, they shall be comforted." 
    Let the evening and the morning make our day. If we have our morning first, 
    the fears of the approaching night will make our sun go down at noon. If we 
    will take the evening first, when in the darkest hour we cry, "Watchman, 
    what of the night?" we will get the answer, "The morning comes." It was the 
    Psalmist's choice, Psalm 17:14, 15.</p>
<p align="justify">The day of expiation was but one day: the feast of 
    tabernacles lasted seven days; which number of seven has gained the 
    reputation of perfection. If the saint's life here be sorrowful, it is 
    short. Our life here is but a day, with a morning, noon, and evening. And 
    that sun in the heavens which runs such a rapid course, never standing 
    still, either ascending or descending, seems to be set in the heavens, to 
    "teach us so to count our days, as to apply our hearts to wisdom." 
    Ecclesiastes 1:5. "hastens to his place where he arose;" (Hebrews) pants, as 
    a man running with full speed, until almost out of breath. How quickly is 
    the vain show in which we walk at an end? Solomon, (Ecclesiastes 3) will 
    allow only "a time to be born, and a time to die," as if life were nothing 
    but a skip out of the womb into the grave; the womb of mother earth (Job 
    1:21.) being ready to keep us, when falling out of the womb of the mother 
    that conceived us. No wonder our weeping and crying, with which we come into 
    the world out of our mother's womb, continue until we return thither; there 
    being scarce time between the two to dry our cheeks. But, as these flies 
    bred by the river Hypanis in Scythia, we are bred in the morning, winged at 
    noon, and dead at night. Much need to fly while our wings last. If our 
    affliction be grievous, it will not last. Nay, but the apostle, comparing 
    our affliction with the weight of glory, will not allow it any weight, 2 
    Corinthians 4:17. where he calls it (Gr.) That light thing of our 
    affliction; light, not only in respect of weight, but swiftness; that 
    haste-like thing of our affliction, which in a moment skips away. This 
    should correct the petty time-eternities that we make to ourselves in our 
    affliction, Psalm 13:1. Nay, our "weeping endures but a night," Psalm 30:5. 
    The feast comes in the morning, Psalm 17. O but the feast lasts long? what 
    shall or can we say of eternity, that everlasting "Sabbatism that remains to 
    the people of God;" that morning that knows no night; that ocean that knows 
    no shore?</p>
<p align="justify">There were but four free days intervening between the day 
    of expiation and the feast of tabernacles; the former being on the 10th, the 
    latter on the 15th day of the seventh month, Leviticus 23:27. 34. By what 
    time the greatest affliction sits down with us, the greatest joy knocks at 
    the door. O quick harvest of glory! O hot seed of tears that so quickly 
    spring up, and so suddenly bow their heads with I that weight of glory on 
    them! to see bottles of tears turned, and that so quickly, into rivers of 
    pleasures, wonderful! Surely there is need of faith in our religion, to 
    believe super-rational mysteries. It is a bundle of wonders. How unlike were 
    the Jews rejoicing and dancing at the feast of tabernacles, to what they 
    were but four days before, when bowing down their heads and afflicting their 
    souls, at that solemn yearly remembrance of sin. If it were not that the 
    light of glory infallibly removes all mistakes, the saints there would 
    mistake themselves, and be apt to think it a dream. It would at least be a 
    while before they came to themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">At the feast of tabernacles they were to "dwell in booths 
    made of the branches of the trees," not in houses, Leviticus 23:42; and the 
    reason is given verse 43. "Because they dwelt in booths in the wilderness, 
    when the Lord brought them out of Egypt." So their places of mourning are 
    turned to places of rejoicing. Joy arising from past dangers, feelingly 
    touches men's hearts. The more they remember their wilderness-booths, the 
    more they rejoice. This seems to me to point out an ingredient in the Heaven 
    of the saints, that would have had no place in the Heaven of innocent Adam 
    and his sinless offspring. Had not the Jews dwelt in booths in the 
    wilderness, they had not rejoiced in them seven days in the land of Canaan. 
    It was their going so low that raised them so high. Surely the saints are 
    more than conquerors. God's people in Heaven will not forget their 
    wilderness-entertainment. It will be for the glory of God to mind, and it 
    will screw up their joy, Revelation 5:9. It is storied of Agathocles, who, 
    being a potter's son, became king of Sicily, that he used to be served at 
    his table with earthen vessels; alleging the reason thereof from his 
    extract. He was wise to give that additional sweetness to his enjoyments, 
    which he could not have had if he had been born heir to the crown. Certainly 
    meat can never be so sweet as to a hungry man; nor can one so much esteem 
    wealth as he who has been pinched with poverty. The best view of the stars 
    is from the bottom of a deep narrow pit. Surely the remembrance of the cross 
    will sweeten the crown; and the memory of the wilderness will put an 
    additional verdure on the fields of glory, when the saints shall be walking 
    through them in their white robes, remembering the mournful blacks in which 
    they were accustomed to appear. Let us not cast at our blessings, nor grudge 
    to sow the seeds of glory. The heathens, it seems, allowed prosperity not to 
    be first, but allotted it the second place. God himself has confirmed the 
    order. Take your firsts then pleasantly, though grievous.</p>
<p align="justify">It is worthy of our consideration, to take notice what 
    these booths were to be made of: Leviticus 23:40. "And you shall take unto 
    you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and 
    the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook. Compare Nehemiah 8:15. 
    "Fetch olive-branches, and pine-branches, and myrtle-branches, and 
    palm-branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths." </p>
<p align="justify">As to the olive-tree, it is a beautiful tree, that 
    retains its greenness all the winter, Hosea 14:6. The pine likewise is an 
    evergreen, continues green all the year. This puts me in mind of that 
    perpetual spring with which Immanuel's land is blessed forever. No winter 
    there, no casting of leaves. The crown fades not away, as the flowery 
    garlands given of old to victors did in a little time, 1 Peter 1:4. We have 
    long winters here; wherein life, leaf, and fruit, are all many times almost 
    gone. Our springs are short. Our greenness soon decays. That will make 
    amends for all.</p>
<p align="justify">They were to take the boughs, (Hebrews) the fruit of 
    goodly trees, that is, of fruit-bearing trees, or boughs with the fruit on 
    them, Leviticus 23:40. The pine bears fruit, called pine-apples; of which I 
    can give no account. But concerning the fruit of the olive, see Judg. 9:9; 
    Psalm 104:15. "Oil which makes man's face to shine," used ordinarily at 
    feasts. This may present to our view that passage in Christ's 
    transfiguration, Matthew 17:2. "His face did shine as the sun." With which 
    we may compare what the apostle says, Philippians 3.. that "he shall change 
    our vile bodies, and make them like his glorious body." Compare also Daniel 
    12:3. What though our faces are now clothed with shame? what though they 
    gather blackness? "His visage was marred more than any man's;" yet there is 
    now no vestige thereof in that face which surpasses the sun in brightness, 
    and would with its splendor darken that globe of light. Neither shall any 
    spot be seen in the faces of those who dwell in these booths in the promised 
    land.</p>
<p align="justify">The pine was also remarkable for its durableness, not 
    being subject to worms or rottenness! for which cause ships were made 
    thereof. The saints have their anchor, and therefore their ship too, Hebrews 
    6:19. O who would think that ever the ship were so durable! What a wondrous 
    sight will it be to see them all brought safe and sound, after such tossing 
    in the sea of this world, to the shore of Immanuel's land! There they will 
    never rot.</p>
<p align="justify">As for the palm-tree, the best of which grew in 
    Palestine, it was a sign of victory; the reason whereof seems to be that 
    which is said of it, that when oppressed with heavy weights, it yields not, 
    but rather shoots upward the more. The myrtle also was a sign of victory, 
    being worn garland-wise in triumphs. Hence (Zechariah 1:8.) Christ is seen 
    "among the myrtle-trees in the valley;" showing, that the church of Christ, 
    however low she was brought by the enemies, should come off victorious. It 
    seems then, all that will come up to the feast of tabernacles, must be 
    soldiers, and conquerors too. Indeed the Jews behooved to fight their room 
    in and their way to Canaan, and they won it at length. And what is Heaven 
    but an eternal triumph? Revelation 7:9. Let this animate us to the spiritual 
    warfare. The people in Egypt, the more they were oppressed, the more they 
    grew. How sweet will all the heavy wrestlings with flesh and blood, 
    principalities and powers, be to us when we get the palms in our hands!</p>
<p align="justify">I find the palm was accustomed to be given to those that 
    overcame in bloody battles, and particularly to those that were victors in 
    the bloody spectacles of the gladiators; the myrtle, when they had got a 
    victory without slaughter of men. All the saints go not to glory through a 
    sea of their own blood. Every one gets not the honor of a fiery chariot. And 
    we have reason to believe, that as all are not alike in the battle, so there 
    will be degrees of glory, and the triumph of some greater than that of 
    others. But, if we look somewhat higher to the main thing that stood between 
    Heaven and us, the victory to all the saints is a bloody, unbloody victory; 
    bloody in respect of Christ, unbloody in respect of them. Some of them have 
    slept, never one of them died, in the cause: Romans 8:34. "It is Christ that 
    died." The proto-martyr, Acts 7, "fell asleep." Therein, as in a glass, the 
    Lord would represent to all those that were after to strive against sin 
    resisting to blood, what that sort of passage to Heaven would be to them. 
    Sure, death's nature is changed; it is not what it was to Christ; it is not 
    that which was threatened, Genesis 2:17. Why may not the name be changed 
    too? The Holy Ghost's connection, Revelation 12:11, is worthy to be 
    remarked, "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word 
    of their testimony; and they loved not their lives even unto death." In the 
    victory, Christ's blood and their blood are not joined together; but 
    Christ's blood and their word of testimony. Christ fought, they but gave the 
    shout, to the obtaining of the victory. Surely "he trod the wine-press 
    alone, and of all the people there was none to help him."</p>
<p align="justify">As for the willows, it is known the place thereof is by 
    the watersides. Hence that text Leviticus 23:40. calls it "the willow of the 
    brook." God's people sometimes hanged their harps on the willows that grew 
    by the rivers of Babylon, Psalm 137:1, 2; because then their joy was turned 
    to mourning, and they had no use for them. In Immanuel's land there "is a 
    river, on either side of which grows the tree of life," Revelation 22:1. 2: 
    but no harps hang thereon. They behooved to go to the brook, and fetch their 
    willows. I cannot find one place where the willow is spoken of, but it is 
    still with some addition of its growing by the waters, Job 40:22. Psalm 
    137:1. 2. Isaiah 15:7. Ezekiel 17:5. Isaiah 44:4. They cannot then want 
    nourishment in the greatest drought. This presents to my view, that 
    Immanuel's land is no land of drought; the trees of the Lord's planting are 
    set by the rivers, so that they can never want moisture, but shall have an 
    eternal supply of the Spirit, by Christ, from the Father, whereby they shall 
    spring as willows by the water-courses, even those floods of the Spirit's 
    influences, Isaiah 44:3, 4. This promise will tell out through all the ages 
    of eternity, and will never be at an end until the last drop of that river 
    run by, which will never be.</p>
<p align="justify">It is also said of the willow, that it is a great friend 
    to chastity; for which cause forsaken lovers are allowed to wear a 
    willow-garland: which offers to our consideration that character the 
    Scripture so often gives to those that are to be the inhabitants of the 
    upper house, who are to be presented as a chaste virgin to Christ, when the 
    marriage is to be solemnized in Heaven, 2 Corinthians 11:2. and "without 
    spot," Ephesians 5:27. They that stand on Mount Zion with the Lamb, are 
    virgins Revelation 14:4. True it is, it is not to the state of the saints in 
    Heaven that these words have the nearest reference; but it is implied 
    therein; the state of the church in the world being held out in terms 
    borrowed from the state of the church triumphant.</p>
<p align="justify">When I compare that Nehemiah 8:15. "Go forth unto the 
    mount, and fetch olive-branches," etc. with that Leviticus 23:40. "and 
    willows of the brook," not brooks; I cannot but incline to think these 
    willows grew about the brook Kidron, which ran between Jerusalem and the 
    Mount of Olives; which, no doubt, was the mount they were directed to. Which 
    may lead us to the consideration of the spring and source of all the joys in 
    Heaven, even the sorrows of Christ. When David was obliged to leave 
    Jerusalem upon the account of the rebellion raised by his own son, he passed 
    over this brook Kidron in great distress, and went up by the ascent of Mount 
    Olivet, weeping as he went, 2 Samuel 15:23, 30. In this there was a type of 
    Christ's sufferings for the sins of sons and daughters. And so we find him, 
    after he had been at the last feast with his disciples, preached his 
    farewell sermon to them, and prayed that prayer, John 17, the hour being 
    come, verse 1; passing over this brook Kidron, John 18:1. to grapple with 
    the wrath of God, in the garden that was on the other side of it. Who can 
    imagine in what case he went over it? for who can conceive that weight of 
    wrath he was to bear? A far-off prospect of it had a terrible effect on him, 
    John 12:27, 28. Behold the wells of salvation whence we draw our joy; those 
    bitter waters of wrath that he was plunged into; that terrible cup which his 
    sinless human nature shivered at; the brook that he drank of in the way, 
    Psalm 110.</p>
<p align="justify">Lightfoot says, that the Jews so understood that 
    rejoicing commanded at that feast, as that there was in the court of the 
    temple trumpets sounding, dancing, etc; that their greatest joy began 
    towards night, continued far on in the night, and some of the most zealous 
    would stay out the whole night. Compare that Revelation 4:8. "They rest not 
    day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and 
    is, and is to come."</p>
<p align="justify">He adds, that every day once they went about the altar, 
    with their myrtle, palm, and willow in their hand, singing Hosanna, Psalm 
    118:28. In the meantime, they set their boughs, bending towards the altar. 
    Truly the imagination of this pierces; we will never see them do that again: 
    but we will see the saints in glory compassing the altar always, and singing 
    their Hosanna about it, bending their palms towards the altar; acknowledging 
    they owe all to him, even to the "Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed them 
    to God by his blood." I conclude with that Revelation 7:9.â€”"A great 
    multitudeâ€”stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white 
    robes, and palms in their hands;" verse 10. "And cried with a loud voice, 
    Salvation unto our God that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb." A 
    plain allusion to what is said. O that we may be helped so to manage our day 
    of expiation, (for it is but a day and no expiation beyond it), as that we 
    may be accounted worthy to partake of the joy of the feast of tabernacles!</p>
