          Luke 1:74, 75 "That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered
          out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear, in
          holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE covenant of grace is the great contrivance for salvation to lost
          sinners; it is the chariot in which Christ carries home his bride to
          his Father's house in Heaven, Song 3:9, 10. The gospel is the
          proclamation, and free offer of this covenant to all. Faith is the
          taking hold of this covenant, the embracing it, the sinner's personal
          entering into it, the coming up into the chariot. The sacraments are
          the seals of this covenant. Our text is the import and substance of
          this covenant, showing what is offered to you all in the gospel; to be
          believed and applied by you all, to yourselves, through faith; and
          what shall be sealed to you all, who believe, in the sacrament. "Even
          that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This covenant is a sworn covenant, verses 72, 73, that poor sinners,
          who have a mind for it, may have strong consolation, to balance their
          strong doubts and fears. But to whom? To Abraham, verse 73, as a type
          of Christ; that is really to Jesus Christ, the true Abraham, the true
          father of the multitude of the faithful, who at God's call left
          Heaven, his native country, and came and sojourned among the cursed
          race of mankind, and there offered up his own flesh and blood, a
          sacrifice unto God. And so became the true heir of the world, and
          received the promises for his spiritual seed, whereof this is the sum,
          "That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered," etc. Compare
          Genesis 22:16–18. Of which passage, our text is an inspired
          paraphrase. There are two things in the text to which we shall at
          present attend, and afterwards take a particular view of the other
          parts of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The conveyance made in this covenant, "That he would grant unto
          us," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The benefits secured to us in this conveyance. Let us then attend:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To the conveyance made in this covenant. In this, two things may be
          observed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The parties in whose favor this conveyance is made. Us, the seed of
          Abraham. The Father has solemnly engaged to the Son, that these shall
          be delivered and serve him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. What comfort is this to us sinners of the Gentiles? <br />
          ANSWER. "If you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs
          according to the promise." Therefore believe on Christ this day;
          believe the promises, and so be his, and you are secured for time and
          eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. But I fear I am none of the spiritual seed, the elect in
          whose favor that covenant conveyance is made. How then can I believe,
          and apply the promises to myself? <br />
          ANSWER. The original copyof the covenant of promises was filled up
          from all eternity, and signed by the Father, and the Son as the second
          Adam, and remains locked up in the cabinet of Heaven. And in this
          question, whether you shall believe or not; none would order you to
          call for a sight of the original copy, to see if your name be there,
          but the enemy of your salvation; nor would even he order you, if he
          did not know very well that a sight of it you cannot have, until you
          have believed. His designs, then, is to keep you from believing. But
          there is a double of it in the gospel, subscribed also by the Father,
          and the Son as second Adam, in which all the promises are indefinitely
          proposed to all that hear it, and as it were a blank left in the body
          of it, in which every one that will, may fill up his own name. So in
          this gospel, the covenant is held out to you all, as heaven's blank
          bond for grace and glory, that whoever will, may fill his own name in
          it, by applying the same to himself in the way of believing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The manner of the conveyance. It is by way of grant or gift, for so
          the word is. But observe the gift is to us, and so it is to be
          understood in respect of us, to be a free gift. In respect of the Lord
          Jesus, it is not so. All the benefits of the covenant, to be bestowed
          on his spiritual seed, are made over to him on a valuable
          consideration. The covenant to him is a covenant of sale, in which he
          obtains such and such things, for his, because he has paid the price
          of them. "We were not redeemed with corruptible things, such as silver
          and gold, from our vain conversation, received by tradition from our
          fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
          blemish, and without spot." To the Lord Jesus it is a covenant of
          service, in which the benefits of it are made over to him, because he
          worked for them, Genesis 22:16. God gives us to serve our Redeemer,
          because Christ served him perfectly in our room and stead. The
          covenant is to him a disposition of these things for us, upon a most
          onerous cause, namely, "because he has poured out his soul unto death;
          and he was numbered with transgressors; and he bare the sin of many,
          and made intercession for the transgressors."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But in respect of us, these things stand quite otherwise. The grant to
          us is of mere free gift, absolutely of free grace. All the blessings
          of grace are so, and glory is so likewise. From the foundation stone
          of our salvation, to the copestone of it, we must cry grace, grace,
          unto it. For the whole building, and every stone of the building, is
          of grace. And the putting the crown of glory on the heads of the
          saints, after all their wrestling and fighting against their spiritual
          enemies, after all their holy obedience, and life spent in the
          practice of good works, is as purely of free grace, as the giving them
          the first grace, as the quickening of them when dead in sins is. "For
          I have said, mercy shall be built up forever." "By grace are you
          saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of
          God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What then should hinder any poor soul that has a mind for God's
          covenant of free grace, to embrace it this day? Should it hinder you
          to embrace it, because you cannot get any tolerable management of the
          corruptions of your base heart, because you cannot work, nor do
          anything right in the service of God? No, no. We may tell you with
          confidence, here you are to work nothing, to do nothing; but only by
          believing, to receive the full treasure of the covenant, held out to
          you in the gospel, to be received freely. And more than that, that day
          shall never dawn on you, in which you shall be able to work, or do the
          least work to purpose, until you have embraced the covenant for grace,
          with which to work and do. It would be a promising token among our
          communicants and others, if they were all coming to Christ and his
          covenant, to get their broken arms set, and strengthened for work, by
          the grace of the covenant. "But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of
          God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
          redemption." Let us now attend,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To the benefits secured to us in this conveyance, even the sum of
          the benefits of the covenant of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These are of two sorts: First, the principal benefit, serving the
          Lord. Second, The subordinate benefit, deliverance from our enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, The principal benefit, which stands here under the notion of
          the end, namely, serving the Lord. "That he would grant unto us, that
          we being delivered out of the hand, of our enemies, might serve him."
          This is the great thing promised in the covenant of grace, even as it
          was the great thing required in the covenant of works, as the
          condition of it. This is it that was purchased by Christ, and is
          promised to poor sinners who believe in him, for his sake, namely,
          that God will give them to serve him. And thus our serving God is the
          great benefit of the covenant, bestowed on believers, for Christ's
          sake.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O that men would learn this lesson, that any service we do to God, if
          right service, it is a benefit of the covenant, bestowed on us, for
          Christ's sake. Then would they learn that God is not debtor unto them
          for it, but they are debtors to free grace on that very account. And
          the more they do for God, and the better that they do it, they are
          always the deeper in debt to free grace. Ephesians 2:8, 9, 10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Then would they also learn, that the only way for a sinner to be
          brought to serve the Lord, is to embrace the covenant for that very
          end; and that they are not to embrace it because they have served the
          Lord, as ignorant and unhumbled sinners are apt to do: but to embrace
          the covenant, that they may be made to serve the Lord. "Surely, shall
          one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength; even to him
          shall men come."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This benefit of the covenant, that we might serve him, imports three
          things:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The privilege of God's service. God is a master of infinite glory
          and power, so that to be admitted into his service is the greatest
          privilege. How do men value themselves, in that they are of an earthly
          king's household, servants to one who wears a crown? But what a small
          thing is that, in comparison of this, to be the fellows of angels, in
          being taken into the service of Jehovah the Lord of Heaven and earth.
          It is a great part of heaven's happiness. "For there his servants
          shall serve him." Man lost this service by his fall, but God, for
          Christ's sake, has granted to sinners to be taken into it again, and
          that in a more honorable station than innocent Adam had, that is, no
          more as hired, but as honorary servants.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Strength and ability for his service. And I will strengthen them in
          the Lord, and they shall walk up and down in his name, says the Lord."
          Man, by his breach of the first covenant, lost his strength for
          serving the Lord, so that whoever of you are without the covenant, you
          cannot serve the Lord. "And Joshua said unto the people, you cannot
          serve the Lord; for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God: he will
          not forgive your transgressions nor your sins." "He who abides in me,
          and I in him," says Jesus, "the same brings forth much fruit; for
          without me you can do nothing." Thus in the new covenant, there is a
          promise of strength for this service, which is bestowed on all that
          believe, of mere free grace for the sake of Christ. "For his grace is
          sufficient for us, and his strength is made perfect in weakness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Acceptance of the service. "Also the sons of the stranger that join
          themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the
          Lord, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from
          polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant; even them will I bring to
          my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their
          burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine
          altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all
          people." Whatever they do in God's service, who are without the
          covenant, it is, in point of acceptance, as if it were not done at
          all. God rejects them and their services too. For they can do nothing
          right nor pleasing in the sight of God. For without faith it is
          impossible to please God. But the new covenant is the ministration of
          the spirit, fitting the soul for service, and has a promise of
          acceptance of our service, though it be imperfect, for Christ's sake.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Well then, would you be admitted into God's service, have strength for
          it, and acceptance of your services, look, to the covenant of grace in
          Christ Jesus, for these things. Embrace and rely on the promise of the
          covenant for all these things by faith, which promise is held forth to
          you in the gospel. And they shall be sealed to you in the sacrament,
          and made forthcoming to you, in virtue of the faithfulness of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Concerning this covenant service, two things are further to be
          remarked. First, the kind. Secondly, the qualities of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The kind of service to God, in which sinners are instated by the
          covenant of grace; for there is a great difference of services. Now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This is not bond service, the service of slaves, who work their
          work for fear of their master's whip. The Spirit of God has purposely
          abstained here from using the very word that signifies that kind of
          service. It is not serving God for fear of Hell and revenging wrath.
          That is the first covenant service, indeed, being broken; but not the
          second covenant service, which is to serve God without fear, namely
          slavish fear. The covenant of grace finds all men in the state of bond
          service, and was contrived to bring us out of it, through Christ's
          being a bondman in our stead. "He made himself of no reputation, and
          took upon him the form of a servant, in our stead. Wherefore we have
          not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we have received
          the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is not hired service, so much work for so much wages. The text
          tells us, that the service is so far from being hired, that it is a
          free grace gift made to sinners for Christ's sake. "That he would
          grant unto us, that we might serve him." It is true there is an ample
          reward follows the service of the saints. But both the service and
          reward are of grace; and the reward, properly and strictly speaking,
          is rather the reward of the service of their head Christ, than of the
          service of their hands. But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is an honorary service. So the word used by the Holy Spirit, in
          the text, signifies to minister, which is an honorary kind of service,
          such as kings and priests had when put into their office. Thus Christ
          has made his people kings and priests unto God. They are a holy
          priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God, by
          Jesus Christ. So that this service, bestowed on sinners through Jesus
          Christ, according to the covenant, is their unspeakable advancement,
          their real happiness, to which they could never have been preferred,
          but by means of the blood of the covenant. It is a post of the
          greatest honor of which the sinner is capable. And this also is
          imported in the phrase, before him, which is an Old Testament phrase
          used of those in the courts of kings who waited on the king's person;
          Revelation 22:3, 4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This may direct you in your approach to the Lord's table, to lay hold
          on the covenant; not to go about to turn that solemn action into the
          making of a bargain with God, that if he will save you, and give you
          Heaven, you will serve him all your life. Alas! poor creature, what
          have you to serve him with, that you will pretend to make such a
          bargain with him? But here is a covenant of honorary service to God,
          bearing a promise also of strength for the service, freely offered and
          exhibited to you in the word of the gospel, under the great seal of
          Heaven. Believe it cordially; accept of it; lay the weight of your
          desired and designed service to God upon it; and it is a bargain, and
          shall be sealed by the sacrament. Let us now attend,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, To the qualities of the service. They are these:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is universal, which the service of these remaining under the
          first covenant never is. "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have
          respect unto all your commandments." We are to serve him in holiness
          and righteousness. These answer to the whole holy law as a rule of
          life. In holiness, serving him in first table duties; in
          righteousness, serving him in second table duties. Both of them
          relating to the inward, as well as the outward man, bearing a holy and
          righteous frame of heart, as well as holy and righteous actions, as
          serving before him, that is, as under his eye, sincerely and
          uprightly. Here then is the true way to get heart and life purified;
          to get an irregular life, in a profession of religion, made uniform.
          That grace is held forth in the covenant, which you are to embrace for
          sanctification, as well as justification. And it is a full covenant
          for that purpose, as for all other purposes of salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a perpetual and lasting service. The first covenant required
          a lasting service, but secured not man from breaking the service. But
          the second covenant secures the perpetuity of the service, that
          however fickle the believer is, yet he shall serve the Lord all the
          days of his life. This imports two things: 1. That he shall serve the
          Lord as long as he lives in this world, and shall never be either put
          away, nor break away from the blessed service. The covenant shall keep
          him, if he cannot keep it. "I will," says God, "make an everlasting
          covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them
          good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not
          depart from me." By this covenant, God takes home sinners to his
          service, never to part for the term of life. Oh! is not this a blessed
          bargain, for one who is groaning under the weight of a vain, fickle,
          inconstant heart. Come into it then, joyfully and confidently. Here is
          heaven's security for the keeping of it. Then look to the Lord in his
          covenant this day, and say, Lord, into your hands, stretched out in
          this covenant, I commit my spirit. 2. It imports that he shall serve
          the Lord forever and ever, in Heaven, after death. To confine the
          great benefit of the covenant to this short life here, is unsuitable
          to the everlasting covenant. Nay, this benefit contains heaven's
          happiness. For in Heaven his servants shall serve him; and they shall
          see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. There it is
          that it has its full accomplishment. The covenant finds the designed
          servants dead in sin, and therefore it must give them life before they
          can serve; and that life is eternal life, never to expire, from the
          moment it is given. "He who believes on the Son has everlasting life;"
          and they shall serve him all the days of that life, given them on
          purpose for the service, that is, through the ages of eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Comfort yourselves, O believers, with this, you that are depressed
          with a sense of your unfitness for the service of God here, and your
          mismanagement in it. Behold, the day of your redemption approaches, in
          which you shall be able to serve God, according to your desire, in the
          mount of glory. We are now to consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, The subordinate benefit, namely, deliverance from our
          enemies, which stands here as a mean in order to the end, namely,
          God's service. "That we being delivered out of the hand of our
          enemies, might serve him." It is evident from the structure of the
          words, both in our version, and in the original especially, that the
          service is the end of the deliverance, and the deliverance the means
          of the service. As God said of Israel in Egypt, so does he say of all
          his people; "Let my son go, that he may serve me." To this event our
          text alludes. They cannot serve the Lord until once they be delivered.
          How should they do it, while they are lying among the feet of their
          enemies. The service, the enemies, and the deliverance, are all
          spiritual; therefore they must have a spiritual deliverance, before
          they can perform the spiritual service. And if it is the design of the
          covenant, that they shall work and serve the Lord, it must secure and
          convey to them salvation or deliverance, in the first place; so this
          is a benefit of the covenant, as well as the others are.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This may also direct you in your management of this solemn occasion of
          grace and salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. If ever you would be capable to serve the Lord, seek that you may
          be delivered from your spiritual enemies, taken out of their hands who
          keep you in bondage. While you are in bondage to them, in respect of
          your state, it is not possible you can serve the Lord. "No man can
          serve two masters."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If ever you would obtain that deliverance from your spiritual
          enemies, seek it in the covenant, in a way of believing. There it is
          offered and exhibited to you; and whoever does by faith lay hold on
          this covenant shall have it. So the Son makes them free, who believe
          on him, as their deliverer, from all their enemies. "And if the Son
          make you free, you shall be free indeed."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Seek that deliverance, that you may serve the Lord. Many seek
          deliverance by Christ, that they may live at ease in the embraces of
          their lusts, free from the fear of Hell. But none shall ever find it
          so, for they seek it not in the right way, and for the right end.

          DOCTRINE—That the covenant deliverance is freely bestowed on God's
          covenant people, that they may serve him, after the manner of the
          covenant, namely the new covenant. Here I shall take notice,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. Of the covenant deliverance bestowed.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Of the covenant service, which is the design of this deliverance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Of the necessary connection between the covenant deliverance, and
          covenant service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The covenant deliverance bestowed. We being delivered out of the
          hands of our enemies. I shall reduce these to four.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They are delivered from the law. Not from the law as a rule of life
          in the hand of a Mediator, standing in the covenant of grace; but from
          the law as a covenant, under which all men are, in their natural
          state. The scripture is most express on this. Romans 6:14, 15. They
          are delivered from the curse of it. It cannot reach them. "Christ has
          redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us."
          From the commanding power of it. For how can it have a commanding
          power over them who are not under it? It was the fault of the
          Galatians, that some of them desired to be under it. Did they desire,
          think you, to be under the curse of it? No, surely, but under the
          commanding power of it. Not observing, that if once they were under
          the commanding power of it, they should be under the cursing power of
          it also; since whom the law cannot command, it can, and certainly will
          curse, in case of transgression, Galatians 3:10, compared with Romans
          3:19. But they are as completely freed from it, as death can make a
          wife free from her husband. "They are become dead to the law by the
          body of Christ, that they should be married to another, even to him
          who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto
          God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. From sin. Though they are not free from the indwelling of it in
          this life, and molestation by it, yet they are freed from its guilt of
          eternal wrath, by which it binds over the sinner to the revenging
          wrath of God. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are
          in Christ Jesus." The covenant secures believers as much against that
          recurring on them, as God's oath secures the world from a second
          deluge. "For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have
          sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so
          have I sworn that I should not be wroth with you, nor rebuke you."
          They are freed also from the dominion of sin. "Sin shall not have
          dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace."
          The bond by which it held the sinner, was strong as death; but it is
          broken so as never to be joined again. "For the law of the spirit of
          life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. From death. Though they are not free from that shadow of death,
          that nominal death, which serves to separate the believer's soul from
          his body for a while, therefore called the death of the body; yet they
          are delivered from the real death of the man, even that terrible thing
          enrapt up in the threatening of the covenant of works, which was the
          penalty of it. "In the day you eat thereof, you shall surely die."
          Even stinged death, universal death, which alone is death, properly so
          called; as appears in the case of the body, in which though a leg or
          arm, a member or members, be mortified as dead as if they were in the
          grave; yet none will reckon the body a dead corpse, but still a living
          body, until such time as death has gone over the whole of it. Now as
          soon as man sinned by breaking the covenant of works, death's sting
          pierced him to the very soul; cold death went over the whole man, and
          left him speechless, motionless, and lifeless, as to anything truly
          good. And the whole creation could not raise the dead man to life
          again. Now from this death God's covenant people are delivered. "Even
          when we were dead in sins, he has quickened us together with Christ."
          This is in virtue of their union with Christ. They may now sing, "O
          death where is your sting? O grave where is your victory? The sting of
          death is sin: and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to
          God, who gives us the victory, through our Lord Christ." And it shall
          never, never from the moment of their entering into the covenant, come
          back upon them again. Our Lord's words are, Truly, truly, I say unto
          you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, From Satan, though not from molestation by him in this life;
          yet from under his power and dominion. God sends the gospel "to open
          their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
          power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins,
          and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in
          Christ Jesus." When man sinned, and death seized him, he was Satan's
          lawful captive; Isaiah 49:24. Satan having the power of death as
          executioner, Jesus our Savior, took our nature, "that through death he
          might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil."
          But now believers are delivered from him, "for God has delivered them
          from the power of darkness, and translated them into the kingdom of
          his dear Son." Satan shall never recover his power over them, "for the
          God of peace shall bruise him under their feet shortly." And so shall
          all the other parts of the delivery not yet bestowed on them, be
          shortly given them, and so the deliverance be completed. Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Take notice of the covenant service, which is the design of this
          deliverance; and not only the design of the deliverance, but also of
          the deliverer; which, therefore, shall certainly take effect in the
          delivered. I take it up in three things, according to the text. They
          shall serve the Lord,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As sons serving their Father. "And they shall be mine, says the
          Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare
          them, as a man spares his own son who serves him." Possibly they made
          a fashion of serving the Lord, before they came into a covenant of
          grace. But then their service was after the manner of the covenant
          which they were under. They served him as bond servants. Slavish fear
          of Hell, and servile hope of Heaven, being the great springs of their
          obedience. But now they will serve him, in a new manner, even in
          "newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter." Love to
          their Father will set them to work. The whole with them is "a work and
          labor of love." Gratitude to their God and Redeemer, will bind them to
          it. They ever cry, "what shall we render to the Lord for all his
          benefits towards us. They are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
          a holy nation, a peculiar people, that they should show forth the
          praises of him who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous
          light." Meanwhile, they depend entirely on Christ's work and service,
          not on their own, for the whole of their salvation. "For we," say
          they, "are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
          rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They shall serve him universally. "Then shall I not be ashamed,
          when I have respect to all your commandments." The old covenant
          servants are ever partial in the law. There is not one of them but
          discovers what spirit they are of, by baulking some of its
          commandments. Wherefore, if our obedience be not more extensive than
          theirs, we will never see Heaven. "For except our righteousness shall
          exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no
          case enter into the kingdom of Heaven." But the new covenant servants
          "esteem all God's precepts concerning all things to be right." Their
          religion will neither lack piety nor charity. They will be holy
          towards God, righteous toward their neighbor, and sober with respect
          to themselves. They will serve the Lord internally and externally.
          They desire to know, and to comply with all God's will, that, like
          David the son of Jesse, they may fulfill all his will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They will serve him constantly. "I have inclined mine heart to
          perform your statutes always, even unto the end." They shall never
          totally nor finally fall away from their service. The old covenant
          servants are still breaking away from their service, for the spirit of
          old Adam, a spirit of apostasy, reigns in them, and "leads them to
          draw back to perdition." But new covenant servants are not of this
          kind. (Greek,) we are not of defection, but of faith, even "of them
          that believe to the saving of the soul," Hebrews 10:39.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The new covenant servants once entered home to their service, never
          change masters again, but will hold by their new master while they
          live. And the reason of the difference is, the former are bond
          servants, the latter filial servants. "Now the servant abides not in
          the house forever; but the son abides ever." Now remember he who shall
          endure to the end, the same shall be saved. Let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show the necessary connection between the covenant deliverance?
          and covenant service.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. None can serve the Lord in this right manner, until once in the
          first place, they are delivered as said is, no more than a dead corpse
          can rise and serve you. Ephesians 2:1–10. You will not, I think,
          question the truth of this, with respect to the dominion of sin,
          death, and the devil; but will readily grant there can be no true
          serving of God, until once a soul is delivered from these. But as to
          the soul's deliverance from the law and sin's guilt of eternal wrath,
          perhaps you observe not the necessity of being delivered from them,
          before we can thus serve the Lord. But truly, according to the
          scriptures, these four things, are four links of one chain, each
          holding fast another, and all together, holding fast the poor sinner,
          that he cannot serve the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wherein lies the power of the devil over a man? It lies in death. He
          has the power of death, Hebrews 2:14, and by it he holds the man fast.
          So there is no getting out of the devil's hold without loosing the
          bands of death, and delivering from its power.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In what lies the sting and strength of death? It lies in sin. "The
          sting of death is sin." In the guilt of sin primarily, by which the
          soul is bound over to death. So there is no getting out of death's
          chains, without loosing the band of sin, namely its guilt of eternal
          wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now in what lies the strength of sin? It lies in the law. "The sting
          of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law." By this the
          guilt of eternal wrath is fixed on the sinner, that moment he
          transgresses its commandments. So there is no getting out of the
          chains of sin, without loosing the band of the law from off the
          sinner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          So that while a poor sinner is under the law, namely as a covenant he
          is under sin; while under sin, he is under death; while under death,
          he is under the power of the devil: So he cannot serve the Lord, while
          under the law as a covenant, Romans 7:5, 6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The soul being once thus delivered, will certainly serve the Lord,
          "in holiness and righteousness before him." The deliverance will
          infallibly produce the service; and that both from the design of God,
          which cannot misgive; he delivering them for that very end; as also
          from the nature of the thing, whereby the bands of death are removed,
          and a new life given, which must exert itself in actions agreeable to
          the nature of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. The sanctification of sinners is the chief subordinate end of
          the covenant of grace, or of the gospel, standing next to the glory of
          God. And faith, justification, deliverance from the law, sin, death,
          and the devil, are subordinated to sanctification, as means for
          reaching that end. Therefore the covenant has its full perfection, or
          accomplishment in Heaven, when the man is so sanctified as to serve
          God perfectly, and work perfectly good works. Wherefore, invert not
          the order of God's covenant, in seeking deliverance by your works. But
          make use of God's covenant, and the covenant daily, for the
          deliverance, that you may be holy, and may perform good works.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. They in whom the spirit of legalism, hypocrisy, and apostasy
          reigns, have no part nor lot in this matter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, As ever you would evidence yourselves God's covenant people,
          partakers of this deliverance, serve no more the devil, and your own
          lusts. But serve the Lord as his children, universally, and
          constantly, "without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him,
          all the days of your life." Amen.
