    of the Thief on the Cross, No Argument for Delaying Repentance</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">Ettrick, in June, 1717.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Luke 23:42, "And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into 
    your kingdom!"</p>
<p align="justify">THE love that sinners bear to their lusts, and the 
    conviction men generally have of the necessity of repentance, each of them 
    putting in for a share, do natively produce a delay. And Satan and the 
    corrupt heart join to support the delaying temper, both by pretended 
    reasons, and abused examples: among which last none is more so than this of 
    the thief who repented on the cross.</p>
<p align="justify">My great design being to convince you, that this instance 
    can be no encouragement to delay repentance, I need not here lay for a 
    foundation the proof of this man's sincerity, which the text and context put 
    beyond all doubt; nor insist on explaining this his prayer, full of faith 
    and repentance, which had a most gracious answer.</p>
<p align="justify">Every body knows the story; and they that know very 
    little of the Bible, will be found acquainted with this instance of the 
    penitent thief on the cross; and they abuse it to their own ruin, drawing 
    encouragement from it to put off repentance until they come to a death-bed.</p>
<p align="justify">We need not much wonder, that this becomes a 
    stumbling-stone to many, on which they are ruined. Hearing the thief was 
    converted near the last gasp, and having led a sinful life, the thread was 
    suddenly broken, and he died happily; his day was a dark day all over, until 
    in the evening, the sun broke out with a bright though short glimpse, and 
    then set; That this, I say, is abused and turned to a stumbling-stone by 
    impenitent sinners, is no great wonder, if you consider the following 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. As a vicious stomach corrupts the best of meat; so 
    impenitent sinners abuse the best things to their own ruin: so that what 
    raises up others taught of God, is an occasion of falling to them. The altar 
    of God, and the whole law was so to the unbelieving Jews, Romans 11:9. Is 
    not the very gospel, and the preachers thereof, a savor of death to some? 2 
    Corinthians 2:16. Nay, Christ himself is a stumbling-block to them. 1 Peter 
    2:8.</p>
<p align="justify">2 There is a particular disposition in the hearts of 
    impenitent sinners to abuse and wrest the Scriptures. Hence Peter, speaking 
    of Paul's epistles, says, "In them are some things hard to be understood, 
    which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other 
    scriptures, unto their own destruction," 2 Peter 3:16. The Scripture is a 
    light, and a rule of divine authority; and it may well be expected, that if 
    sinners can persuade themselves of a shelter there for their sins, it will 
    be the most effectual one. This is the most feasible means for stilling the 
    clamors of an ill conscience, and cheating men into their own ruin.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Abused Scripture is one of the chief pieces of Satan's 
    armor, with which he maintains and promotes his kingdom among those that 
    have the Scriptures. Thus Satan said to Christ, Matt 4:6. "If you be the Son 
    of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels 
    charge concerning you, and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at 
    any time you dash your foot against a stone." Hence unclean persons still 
    their consciences with the example of David, swearers with that of Joseph by 
    the life of Pharaoh, or Peter's, etc. Men that are mere moralists screen 
    themselves with that, Micah 6:8, "He has showed you, O man, what is good; 
    and what does the Lord require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, 
    and to walk humbly with your God?" And others satisfy themselves with good 
    meanings and desires, because of that, Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are they which 
    do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." Others 
    think, they may repent at any time, from that Scripture, Ezekiel 18:27, 
    "When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, 
    and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." And 
    thus it becomes harder to convince men that have some notional knowledge of 
    the Bible, than those that never knew it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Reigning love to sin makes people very dexterous to 
    find out shifts to preserve their lusts; as in Saul's speech to Samuel, 1 
    Samuel 15:15, "They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people 
    spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord 
    your God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed." What people would gladly 
    have to be true, it is easy to persuade them of: and what they are loathe to 
    part with, it is not hard to invent shifts to hold it still. Were men 
    willing to be the Lord's, they would be so presently; and they would be 
    loathe to delay one moment, lest they should never see another.</p>
<p align="justify">To come to this particular instance in the text, I must 
    tell you, That though here is ground of hope for poor trembling sinners, 
    that they may be brought to repentance, and be accepted of God; yet there is 
    no ground here for crafty delaying sinners to put off repentance, in hopes 
    to go through with it afterwards, especially in a dying hour.</p>
<p align="justify">I. There is ground of hope for trembling sinners. And we 
    may learn from this instance these following lessons.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They may go long on, and far on in the way to Hell, 
    whom yet God may bring home to himself. Here is a man, a thief, whoever 
    course brought him to an ill end, to a violent death, and yet grace reaches 
    him. See the following remarkable passage, 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, 11, "Know 
    you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not 
    deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor 
    effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor 
    covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the 
    kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are 
    sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the 
    Spirit of our God." From this it appears, that some of the Corinthian 
    converts had been formerly the vilest of wretches, and guilty of the most 
    enormous lewdness and impiety; and yet became famous monuments of the 
    triumphs of sovereign efficacious grace. What a length did Manasseh and Paul 
    go; and yet what illustrious penitents did they afterwards become? The 
    latter justly acquired the character of the greatest of saints, and the most 
    eminent of all the apostles.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Grace sometimes catches them that in appearance, and 
    to the eyes of the world, are farthest from it. It passes by the most 
    likely, and pitches on the most unlikely objects. While chief priests, 
    scribes, and elders mock Christ, the thief on the cross is converted. The 
    Lord loves to set up the trophies of his victory in the midst of the devil's 
    kingdom. Hence is that promise, Isaiah 55:5, "Behold, you shall call a 
    nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you, shall run unto you, 
    because of the Lord your God; and for the holy One of Israel; for he has 
    glorified you."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Grace makes a vast difference between those between 
    whom it finds none. Here are two thieves, both on the cross: grace touches 
    the heart of the one, but passes by the other; and makes the one a convert, 
    while the other dies hardened. So true is Paul's observation, Romans 9:16, 
    "So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that 
    shows mercy."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, While there is life there is hope. Here is one 
    converted when near the last gasp; while his last sand was running, grace 
    overtakes him, opens the eyes that before were closed, wins the heart that 
    had been all along hardened. But I stay not on these things. Only the use 
    that is to be made of this, is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let those that seek God early be encouraged from this, 
    that they shall find him: Proverbs 8:17, "I love them that love me, and 
    those that seek me early shall find me." Was he so ready to receive a 
    penitent soul coming in at the last hour, then surely he will be very ready 
    to receive you that comes in before that time. He rejected him not because 
    he was long a-coming; but received him because he came. Come then forward 
    with assured hope of your acceptance upon your early return.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let not those whose day is almost gone, before they 
    have begun their work, despair. Who knows but that may be done in the 
    evening, that was neglected the whole day before? A gale for Heaven may 
    blow, that may put life in an old sinner, and make his flesh fresher than 
    that of a child. The door of the vineyard stands open for laborers to come 
    in even at the eleventh hour. Sovereignty is not pent up to times and ways, 
    but takes a latitude in both.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, Let us sow beside all waters, in the morning 
    and in the evening. It depends on the working of free grace, which shall 
    prosper. We are ready to be hopeless of success, where persons have long 
    stood out against the Lord. But God's heavy hand on a man, and a view of 
    eternity, may afford a season wherein the wild donkey may be caught.</p>
<p align="justify">II. But there is no ground here for the crafty delaying 
    sinner to put off repentance, especially until a dying hour. To set this 
    matter in a true light, consider these following things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a most rare example. There is not an instance 
    like it in all the book of God, unless it be that of Achan, Joshua 7:20, 21. 
    Yet the Lord has left that case of Achan's much under a cloud; so that it is 
    not positively determined as this is, though we may charitably hope the best 
    in his case too. Now, here I would have you to consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, What less could there have been to have cleared a 
    possibility of acceptance with God, for a sinner at the last, after he has 
    spent all his days in sin? If we had not had this instance, what could have 
    been said to show such wretched wasters of time, that ever any that was so 
    long a setting off in their journey to Heaven did get in? And because this 
    says, that none should despair; must it therefore import, that they may 
    safely delay? The sun once stood still in the days of Joshua; which says it 
    is possible such a thing may be: but will any man delay his work in hope of 
    such an extraordinary cast again? And why will you?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, As one swallow makes not spring, so neither can 
    this one event make a general rule that you or I may trust to. The ordinary 
    rule is, that as men live, so they die; a holy life, a happy end; a 
    graceless, careless life, an unhappy and miserable end. Because Providence 
    may go off the ordinary road, and do that in a few minutes with some, that 
    ordinarily costs many years to others; can you venture eternity on that, 
    that he will do so with you? Moses fasted forty days and nights, Exodus 
    34:28: yet who will venture on that in hopes of having his life preserved 
    without food?</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Are there not eminent instances to the contrary, 
    wherein men living in their sin have been struck down in a moment, getting 
    no time to repent of them, but fiery wrath has put an end to their days? 
    Consider the case of Nadab and Abihu, Leviticus 10:1, 2, of whom it is 
    thought they had erred through drink, verse 9; Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, 
    Numbers 16:31, etc; Ananias and Sapphira, Acts 5, who died instantly with a 
    lie in their mouth. But why do I instance in particular persons? Did not 
    millions die together in their sins, by the deluge that swept away the old 
    world, the fire and brimstone that burned up Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and 
    Zeboim? What multitudes were there there, who, being warned, put off to the 
    day they never saw? And shall this one instance encourage you to delay, over 
    the belly of the dreadful example of millions on the other hand?</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, The most that this so rare an example can amount 
    to, is a possibility. It is not to so much as a probability or likelihood. 
    That is a probable event, which though it does not always fall out, yet for 
    the most part it does so; as that the gardener shall get more than his seed 
    again. But from what is said it appears, that for the most part it falls out 
    otherwise, namely, that people even die as they live. So that it is 
    probable, that if you do not repent before, God will deny you grace to 
    repent at the last. How then can a man that has any belief of a God, a 
    Heaven, and a Hell, venture his salvation on a mere possibility, while the 
    probability lies the other way?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Though there were two thieves on the cross at that 
    time, yet it was but one of them that got grace to repent. The one indeed 
    was a true penitent; but the other died as he lived, hardened in his sin; 
    nay, perhaps worse; for he died blaspheming the Son of God, before whose 
    tribunal he was to appear, verse 39. Now, upon this I would make these 
    rational reflections.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Is it not possible that you may die blaspheming, if 
    you do not repent now in time? You can not deny the possibility of it, when 
    there is such a plain instance of it in the case of one of these thieves. 
    You think it may be you may die a penitent with the good thief; and I say, 
    it may be you may die blaspheming with the other. The one is even as 
    certain, as to us, as the other. You live impenitent all your days; when you 
    come to a death-bed, God may withhold his grace from you which you have all 
    along refused; he may let you see your case hopeless for ever, and you may 
    be filled with despair; and in that case it is more than possible that both 
    tongue and heart may rise against God.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It is at least an equal venture, that you may die 
    impenitent, as that you may die a penitent. You hope to repent at the last; 
    why? because the thief on the cross repented. And I must say, that delaying 
    repentance until then, you run the risk of dying impenitent; for the other 
    thief died so. And who has told you, whether your lot shall be with the one 
    or with the other? Now, to repent presently, makes your salvation certain; 
    to delay it, does at best leave it to a venture. And consider with yourself 
    seriously, if salvation and damnation be such trifling things, as to be left 
    to an uncertainty, you do not know how it may fall.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, It is inconsistent with common sense, to leave that 
    thing to a venture, which may be made sure, where a hit or a miss is of the 
    utmost concern. Suppose a rebel might certainly have his life by a willing 
    submission to his prince, should he choose to stay until he were apprehended 
    by the officers, he would act most unreasonably, sonably, and put his life 
    in hazard where there is no need; as in the case of Shimei, 1 Kings 2:42. A 
    thousand times more unreasonable are you in such delays of repentance, for 
    now you may make Heaven sure: but if you delay, your soul is left to a 
    dreadful venture; and if you miss when it comes to the point, you are ruined 
    forever.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, Nay but the venture is very unequal; for it is far 
    more likely that delaying you may die impenitent, than that you may die 
    penitent. Few took part with the good thief among all the crowd of 
    spectators; the multitude went the other thief's way, mocking, verse 35. And 
    what casts the balance here in case of likelihood, is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Common observation, that tells us, that most people 
    even die as they live. Repentance is a flower rarely seen springing up from 
    a death-bed. A melting of heart for sin, because of the dishonor done to God 
    by it, is seldom seen in such as have lived a graceless, careless, 
    presumptuous life; but that disposition even hangs about them to the end.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is certain that few are saved, in comparison of 
    them that are left: Matthew 7:14, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the 
    way, which leads unto life, and few there be that find it." As to what some 
    say of the infants of all mankind; all that are saved must go by the strait 
    gate, and still these are few. It is evident, that most men live impenitent; 
    yet all must die; and therefore it follows, that few get grace to repent at 
    their last, but most of those that live impenitent even die so too.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The sad threatenings denounced against sinners going 
    on in their sin, with respect to their latter end: Proverbs 1:24–27, 
    "Because I have called, and you refused, I have stretched out my hand, and 
    no man regarded; but you have set at nothing all my counsel, and would none 
    of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your 
    fear comes; when your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes 
    as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes upon you." Ezekiel 24:13, 
    "In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not 
    purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, until I have 
    caused my fury to rest upon you." Now, show me one promise in all the Bible, 
    promising the grace of repentance to those that delay, for to balance this. 
    It is true, the gospel-offer is general, and excludes none while in this 
    world: but O what a hazard is there, that these threatenings be accomplished 
    to the denying the grace to lay hold on them then.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Corrupt nature sticks fast in you; and it will 
    harden you in the face of death as well as it does now, unless you get grace 
    from above. Now, that corruption has possession long continued already, you 
    are sure of it; but you have no certainty for the grace of God to break it 
    in you, and work repentance in your so long impenitent heart. And therefore 
    I must conclude the venture to be very unequal.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Repentance is not to be wrought by the sinner's 
    being brought to an extremity, as you may possibly imagine. Here was a man 
    that was hanging on a cross, bleeding to death in great torment, having a 
    present prospect of eternity before him, who could have no more pleasure in 
    the world. But did that humble him? No, no. His heart remains hardened to 
    the last gasp. He is going into eternity; yet he is adding sin to sin, and 
    going out of the world as he lived in it, if not worse. We find from Matthew 
    27:44, that after the chief priests, scribes, and elders had mocked and 
    railed on Christ, it is added, that "the thieves also which were crucified 
    with him" joined in the railing. Whence some think, that even the other too 
    joined in this railing on Christ, until grace broke in upon him and overcame 
    his nature.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) The most powerful and likely means of grace will not 
    prevail, unless accompanied with a special operation of the Spirit. This 
    blaspheming thief was near Christ himself, and might hear his words and 
    groans. He had the example of his companion moving him to repent. Grace was 
    at work working wonders upon his neighbor. He had a dying preacher to call 
    him to repent. The sun's light was eclipsed, the earth quaked, the rocks 
    rent, the graves opened: yet for all these he died impenitent, and 
    hard-hearted. Think on this, you that deem it so easy to repent, if you were 
    come to your last.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) They that delay repentance until a dying hour, 
    readily find they have another thing to do then, than to repent; as is 
    evident from the case of the other thief on the cross, verse 39. "And one of 
    the malefactors which were hanged, railed on him, saying, if you be Christ 
    save yourself and us." Death is the destruction of nature, and therefore 
    nature wrestles against it, though there be no hope. This man was more 
    concerned to get his body saved than to get his soul saved. And, alas! is 
    not this the case of the most part at that time? They have so much ado with 
    the disease, that they can hardly get a due concern for their souls, or a 
    composed thought.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is no evidence that this thief had before such 
    means of grace as you have. Who can say, that ever he heard the gospel 
    preached by Christ or any of his disciples? It is most likely he was a rake; 
    that if he heard anything of God, it was from the Scribes and Pharisees at 
    times; and may be, when he might have heard either them, or Christ and hit 
    disciples, he was about his thievish trade. Now,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It is unreasonable to think, that it should fare at 
    the last with those who have had means of grace all their days, and despised 
    them, as it may do with those who never have such means until they come to 
    die. One would think it no wonder at all, to see a man converted at his 
    last, who gets the first notice of Christ and the way of salvation when on 
    his death-bed. But what is that to you, who have all along been invited to 
    repent, and come to Christ, but would not? The former is no wonder in 
    comparison of the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, This conversion of the thief doubtless was a 
    perfect surprise to him, a thing he was not looking for. But you are setting 
    tryst with repentance at your last hours. Can you believe, that ever this 
    thief delayed repentance in hopes of what he met with, namely, to die on a 
    cross with Christ, and then to feel the power of his grace? Nobody can 
    believe it. What is his example then to you? Is it rational for you to 
    expect that favor which one has sometimes been surprised with, and got when 
    he was not looking for it?</p>
<p align="justify">4. This thief was converted, when by the hand of public 
    justice he was to die. When he was made a public example to the world, and 
    as a malefactor brought to an untimely end for his crime, he got repentance 
    at the gallows, not on a death-bed. He was cut off perhaps in the midst of 
    his days; at least he died not by the course of nature, nor by any sickness, 
    but was executed for his evil deeds. And it is observable, that the one 
    other case which looks most like to this in the Bible, was of the same sort, 
    namely Achan's. Now,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It is evident, that wicked men who are running on in 
    such courses as will bring them to an untimely death, by the laws of the 
    land, such as thieves, robbers, murderers, etc. have a fairer ground from 
    this to delay repentance until they come to the scaffold, than you have, who 
    are looking for a death-bed, and delay repentance until you come there. For 
    their case is nearer akin to this than yours. But are not they most foolish 
    if they so do, even in your eyes? No doubt they are. And so are you in the 
    eyes of others, whose eyes God has opened.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, If we compare the case of this thief put to death 
    for his crimes, and of other malefactors so dying, with the case of men that 
    have lived impenitently dying in their beds; though grace is alike free to 
    both, yet, humanly speaking, there is more hope of the repentance of the 
    former than of the latter. And this I say on these three grounds.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is more easy to convince a malefactor upon the 
    scaffold, of his crime, and the evil of it, and of those other sins that 
    have been the inlets to it, than to convince another of his sin upon a 
    deathbed, as common observation shows. Hence our Lord says, "that the 
    publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before the self-righteous 
    Pharisees," Matthew 21:31. Many a time is sabbath-breaking, disobedience to 
    parents, drunkenness, neglect of the means of grace, confessed and regretted 
    on a scaffold, while there is not one word of them from a death-bed, in 
    cases where there is perhaps as good ground for it. When the corruption of 
    nature breaks out in some atrocious crime that brings a person to an 
    untimely end, there is more access to convince them of it, than others who 
    have the same plague in them, but it has not so appeared.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The view that the thief had of eternity upon the 
    cross, and that other malefactors have in such a case, is more certain than 
    what impenitent sinners generally have on a death-bed. The one see they must 
    die without perhaps, the other have some hopes of life generally while they 
    have breath. And so the terror of death must needs be more operative in the 
    one than the other; forasmuch as there is such a difference in the certainty 
    of the view of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) If we except the time wherein both are actually 
    grappling with death, the one with a violent death, the other with a natural 
    one; the former have less hindrances from the body to prepare for death than 
    the latter; forasmuch as the one is tossed with bodily sickness and 
    indisposition, the other commonly is not.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The conversion of the thief on the cross was an 
    extraordinary manifestation of our Lord's power, made for special reasons. 
    And therefore though it shows what the Lord can do; it does not show what 
    ordinarily he will do. Consider here, to evince this, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It was done in such a juncture of time, as the like 
    never was, and the like never will be again; namely, when the Lord of glory, 
    the Savior of the world, was actually hanging upon the cross, paying the 
    ransom for the lost elect world; Romans 6:9, "Christ being raised from the 
    dead, dies no more; death has no more dominion over him."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It was a wonder wrought in a time allotted in a 
    particular manner beyond all times, for God's working wonders. The time of 
    the Lord's giving the law on Mount Sinai, was a time of wonders; but not 
    comparable to this. The leading wonder there was God's making his voice to 
    be heard, and speaking forth a holy law; and it was attended with other 
    wonders, namely, thunders, lightnings, a thick cloud upon the mount, smoke, 
    and fire, and the sound of a terrible trumpet waxing louder and louder, 
    Exodus 19:16, etc. But the leading wonder on Mount Calvary was yet greater, 
    namely, the Son of God, and Savior of the world, hanging, groaning, dying on 
    a cross: and therefore the attending wonders were proportionably greater. 
    For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The sun was under a dreadful eclipse, for the space 
    of not a few minutes, but three hours, Matthew 27:45. The eye of the visible 
    world was struck blind at the sight.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The veil of the temple was, without hands, rent from 
    the top to the bottom, Matthew 27:51; to show that by this death an end was 
    put to the ceremonial law, and the way unto the holiest of all made open.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The earth quaked at the dreadful fact of crucifying 
    the Lord of glory, Matthew 27:51.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The hard rocks rent, upbraiding the spectators and 
    guilty multitude with the hardness of their hearts, Matthew 27:51.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) The graves were opened, and many of the dead saints 
    arose, to show that Christ by his death had overcome the power of death over 
    his people, Matthew 27:52.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) The spectators of those strange things smote their 
    breasts, being struck to the heart, Luke 23:48.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) Lastly, The centurion and his soldiers were 
    convinced, that he whom they had crucified was the Son of God, Matthew 
    27:54.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, upon all these I would make these reflections.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Is it reasonable, because the thief was converted at 
    the last hour, in a time that the like never was, nor will be, for you to 
    expect that it shall fare so with you? You may as well throw yourself into a 
    burning fiery furnace, and hope to come forth safe, because Daniel and his 
    fellows were once so delivered. Were Christ to come again, and to be 
    crucified a second time between two malefactors, and you were one of them to 
    be crucified with him, it might be that you might be converted at your last 
    hour. And yet you could not be sure; for it might be your lot to be the 
    hardened one, as it was the other thief's. But since it is not so, how dare 
    you trust to such a late repentance?</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Is it any wise strange, that among all these wonders 
    of justice, power, and faithfulness, there was one wonder of mercy upon the 
    thief on the cross? that the same power that was rending the rocks, did 
    mercifully open the heart of one of those thieves to receive Christ and his 
    grace? But how can you think, that the time of your departure will be a time 
    of such wonders? And if not, how can you deceive yourself into a delay of 
    repentance, in expectation of receiving such a signal display of divine 
    grace and mercy?</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Was it not very becoming the divine wisdom, that 
    when the divine glory of the Son of God was veiled upon the cross, a ray of 
    it should break forth in the conversion of one of two that were hanging 
    there with him? that when his judges, and the rulers and people had got him 
    on the cross as a malefactor, he should have his glory owned by one of those 
    crucified with him: but what is that to you in a day wherein it is long 
    since Christ was set down at his Father's right hand, and his glory 
    published through the world by the gospel?</p>
<p align="justify">[4.] Is it anything strange, that when our Lord was 
    triumphing over principalities and powers, he set up one trophy, one sign of 
    his victory, in the field of battle? Colossians 2:15. Was it not very 
    natural, that he who when he should be lifted up, was to draw all men after 
    him, should actually at the time draw one after him? But what encouragement 
    can that be to you to delay to the last, when that nick of time is over long 
    ago? And now there are thousands of visible monuments of Christ's conquest 
    by his death set up, so that you will never be missed, though you die as you 
    live, impenitent.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, The penitent thief on the cross was not only 
    sincere, but he glorified Christ more in his late repentance, than you are 
    capable to do by your, nay more than if you had lived a penitent all your 
    days. For consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, When our Lord was in his lowest step of humiliation, 
    he professed his faith of his divine nature, and his being King of the other 
    world: "Lord," says he, "remember me when you come into your kingdom." What 
    wonderful faith was this, that while Christ was so low as hanging on a 
    cross, he owns him King of Heaven; that dying, he was going to receive a 
    kingdom; that he has all power there; that he is full of mercy, compassion, 
    and faithfulness; so that the very remembrance of him would be sufficient to 
    secure his eternal welfare! you may believe and profess all this, but never 
    at such a time. He is now the exalted Redeemer, who has ascended far above 
    all heavens, and sits on the right hand of God. But what is that to the 
    glorifying of him in his lowest humiliation?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, When others had crucified him as a malefactor, and 
    were mocking him, and railing on him, as one that deserved not common 
    compassion, he was praying to him, as Lord of the other world. If you should 
    now do so too; yet remember how small a thing is that in comparison of what 
    the good thief did in these circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, All this he did, and more, publicly before a 
    multitude of spectators, which you are not likely to have when you come to a 
    death-bed. He justifies God before them all; he condemns himself; he does 
    what he can to convince and convert his poor graceless companion, who 
    possibly sinned with him as he did suffer; he condemns those that crucified 
    Christ, and gives his public testimony against them, as men that feared not 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude this matter: Repent now, and trust not to a 
    late repentance. Let not this example of the thief on the cross, or anything 
    else, make you to delay. Many a call you have had to return to the Lord; 
    but, alas! to the most part they have been ineffectual. God is giving us a 
    providential call to repentance, at this time: he is saying to us, as he did 
    to the church of Ephesus, Revelation 2:5, "Remember therefore from whence 
    you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto 
    you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of its place, except you 
    repent." God knows what our present trial may end in. But in that dark 
    dispensation we may clearly see that God is a jealous God, and makes 
    people's sins to find them out. Repentance would be the most feasible means 
    to extricate us out of our difficulties. If there were a spirit of prayer 
    and mourning for the causes of the Lord's controversy with us, it would be a 
    token for good. But, alas! the work of repentance for the most part is put 
    off from time to time, until it be put off to a death-bed; and who can 
    secure the tryst to be kept there?</p>
<p align="justify">There are three things I would say of death-bed 
    repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">1. If it be got, it is the most unuseful repentance for 
    God, and the most uncomfortable for one's self. Unuseful; for then men begin 
    their work for God, when their time is ending; and so though they may be 
    saved, yet God gets little honor from them. And uncomfortable to persons 
    themselves; for being saved, they are saved so as by fire; they must go to 
    Heaven by the brink of Hell; while they see their last sand running, and get 
    their consciences awakened, eternity must be to them a dreadful spectacle.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Death-bed-repentance is seldom sincere. The king of 
    terrors may make a Pharaoh say, I have sinned. But what sincerity is in the 
    most part of those things that begin on death-beds, may be learned from the 
    case of many, who being past hopes of recovery from their sickness, either 
    as to themselves or others, do yet recover, and turn just the old men and 
    women they were before. When the best appearances of death-bed repentance 
    are, it is hard to make sure conclusions.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, Many trust to deathbed repentance that never 
    see it. Some are surprised into eternity; some are tossed so with sickness 
    that they cannot have a composed thought; some quickly lose the use of their 
    senses and reason; and most part die as they live: Therefore repent you in 
    time, and delay no more, lest you bring the ruin on your souls that will 
    never be recovered.</p>
