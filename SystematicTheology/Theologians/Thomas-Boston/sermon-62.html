<p align="justify">2 Corinthians 12:10, "For when I am weak, then am I 
    strong."</p>
<p align="justify">THE text is a gospel-paradox, best understood by 
    experience. The Christian is a mystery, a mystery to the world; the saints 
    are hidden ones, yes, in a great measure they are a mystery to themselves; 
    so is the Christian life. The apostle in the text, tells us one of the great 
    mysteries of the Christian life, and that is meat out of the eater: "I take 
    pleasure," says he, "in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in 
    persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake." Christianity teaches not a 
    Stoical apathy, no man is more sensible of the weight of his burden than a 
    Christian; yet he can not only bear a heavy burden patiently, (which I 
    believe is a mystery to many of us), but he even finds a pleasure in a 
    burden he is not able to stand under. After sense has considered a trial, 
    gone out and in through it, and found nothing but bitterness, faith can 
    discover a great deal of sweetness in it. The Christian well exercised, may 
    get some glorious sights in his trials and temptations, that afford a 
    refined pleasure.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a sweet sight for a Christian to see himself 
    standing a candidate for glory, and on his trials for Heaven, 1 Peter 1:6, 
    7, "Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you 
    are in heaviness, through manifold temptations, that the trial of your 
    faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be 
    tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, at the 
    appearing of Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is sweet to see Christ dragging the corrupt will to 
    the cross, and driving the nails through it, for its mortification: James 
    1:3, "Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience."</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is sweet to see Christ, in order to the starving of 
    lusts blocking up the passes by which provisions might be brought to them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. To see the soul out of weakness made strong, and the 
    devil outshot with his own bow. This account of it the text gives, "For when 
    I am weak," that is, when I am weak in myself, "then am I strong" in Christ; 
    verse 9, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in 
    weakness." The Lord allowed the temptation to continue with him until he was 
    driven out of himself, and was brought to confess he was not man enough for 
    it, and then the Lord gives him strength against it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the text there is something supposed, namely, that 
    the Christian is not always weak in the sense of the text; he has not always 
    the due sense of his weakness; sometimes his looks are out, and yet he will 
    go out as at former times. It is no small piece of Christian labor to keep a 
    due sense of our weakness and insufficiency. When the Christian is strong in 
    himself, then he is dead weak. If the devil can but get the man blown up 
    with conceit of his own ability to stand his ground against him, then he has 
    him fair before the wind, as Peter. Hence it is that some will stand before 
    great temptations, and fall before less ones.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the text, there is something expressed. When the 
    Christian is weak in his own sight, then he is really strong; he baffles the 
    temptation, he stands the trial, when he sees he is not man enough for it. 
    Sometimes the devil rages, drives furiously by temptations, persecutions, 
    and the like; but unless he raise the dust, so as to blind the Christian's 
    eyes, that he see not his own weakness, nor the strength of the grace 
    without him in Christ, instead of driving him off his way, he will drive him 
    to Christ, in whom he is enabled to stand, so as to come off a conqueror. I 
    take up the sense of the verse in this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That when the Christian is weak, then he is 
    strong; weak in his own eyes, strong in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing upon this subject, I shall consider the 
    following points.</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is that weakness, which paves the way to 
    spiritual strength?</p>
<p align="justify">II. Offer some remarks for confirming this point.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give some reasons of the doctrine. And,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. The illustration of these will make way for a large 
    practical improvement, in various uses of the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is that weakness which paves the way for 
    spiritual strength.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is in it a holy bent of the heart to that work, 
    to which strength is required, with an honest desire and resolution to go 
    through with the work. If a man has no mind for the work, it is all one in 
    that respect, whether he be weak or strong: Matthew 26:41, "Watch and pray, 
    that you enter not into temptation; the Spirit indeed is willing, but the 
    flesh is weak. But the Christian, however weak,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Aims honestly at the performance of every duty. Like 
    David he has respect unto all God's commandments, Psalm 119:6: he dares not 
    baulk any of the laws of Christ; the whole law is written in his heart by 
    divine grace, and he labors to write it over in his practice; he has no 
    objection to any duty he knows to be enjoined of the Lord, but says, "I 
    esteem all your precepts concerning all things to be right," Psalm 119:128.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He is honestly resolved to resist temptation, and 
    mortify lusts. This is what mast be done, though he knows not well how; he 
    concludes, that though there be a lion in the way, he must be forward: "I 
    have chosen," says he, "the way of truth," Psalm 119:30; his feet are shod 
    with the preparation of the gospel of peace; he dares not think to fail with 
    every wind, nor to go back and lie down in the embraces of his lusts, for it 
    is to be supposed God has set fire to his rest there.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He has laid his account with the cross, and resolves 
    to continue his weak shoulders under it, at Christ's call: Matthew 16:24, 
    "If any man," said Jesus, "will come after me, let him deny himself, take up 
    the cross and follow me."</p>
<p align="justify">He is resolved to follow the Lamb, though he should lie 
    at the end of it, and never to leave the way of the Lord, for all the storms 
    that Satan may raise in it; he prefers Christ's cross to the world's crown; 
    and what he cannot keep with a good conscience, he will reckon himself 
    better without than with it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A sense of utter inability, and insufficiency, to go 
    through with that work, or any part of it: 2 Corinthians 3:5, "Not that we 
    are sufficient of ourselves, to think anything as of ourselves, but our 
    sufficiency is of God." Though his designs are noble and generous, he knows 
    he has nothing in himself to accomplish them; for you must know, that the 
    Christian's confession of weakness is no compliment, they are children that 
    will not lie; it is no preposterous modesty or diffidence, that blinds a man 
    to his own ability. But he sees things as they really are, and believes 
    himself no more weak than he is. When he looks over all his inventory, of 
    what he is, and what he has in himself, he sees nothing to depend upon, 
    either in point of doing or suffering.</p>
<p align="justify">The Christian lies fairest for spiritual strength, when 
    he is so low and weak in his own eyes, as that he dare not trust to anything 
    for his through-bearing, that is not Christ's or in Christ: "They are the 
    circumcision which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, 
    and have no confidence in the flesh," Philippians 3:3. A man is no more weak 
    in his own eyes than he has reason.—The Christian considers himself as weak,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) When he dare not trust to his own stock of natural 
    or acquired abilities for suffering for Christ. These things may sometimes 
    carry a man through what is duty for the matter, but oftentimes they leave a 
    man in the lurch, and can never help a man to do any good thing that God 
    will accept; and no wonder; for says Jeremiah, chapter 17:5, 6, "Thus says 
    the Lord God, Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, 
    and whose heart departs from the Lord. For he shall be like the heath, and 
    shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the 
    wilderness, in a salt land not inhabited." See also Isaiah 40:29–31.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When he dares not trust to the principles and 
    resolutions of his heart. Nature is mighty venturous in religion, when it is 
    flushed with vigorous resolutions. The Scribe said unto Jesus, "I will 
    follow you wherever you go," Matthew 8:19. But when the temptation or trial 
    comes, they fall down like the walls of Jericho; the fire-edge soon wears 
    off the spirit that is not stayed on the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When he dares not trust to vows and engagements. 
    Every gracious soul will give itself away to the Lord, but they will not 
    trust to these bands, but to him to whom they are bound: Isaiah 45:24, 
    "Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength." If 
    men trust to their own vows, they will find them a sorry fence, that will go 
    like Samson's withs when he heard the Philistines were upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) When he dares not trust to his own endeavors: Psalm 
    127:1, "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it." 
    A Christian must be as diligent and vigorous in his way of duty, as if he 
    were to do all alone; but if he would see the success of these endeavors, he 
    must look for it from another quarter, as if he had done nothing. If the 
    saint will not learn this lesson otherwise, God will let him work on, until 
    he work himself out of breath, and so lie down at the Lord's feet, as the 
    church did: Isaiah 26:8, "We have been with child, we have been in pain, we 
    have, as it were, brought forth wind, we have not wrought any deliverance in 
    the earth."</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) He dare not trust to the good frame he sometimes 
    finds his spirit in. A good frame is a precious ointment to refresh the 
    weary traveler, but is not a staff to lean upon, 1 Chronicles 29:17, 18; it 
    may be quickly lost, Psalm 106:13, "They soon forgot his works;" it is a 
    tender bud of Heaven that is easily nipped, as Peter at the voice of a maid. 
    It is a heavenly fire that needs continual supply, or else it will go out; 
    if the Spirit of God cease to pour in oil, that lamp will soon be 
    extinguished.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) He dare not trust to habitual grace. Paul had a good 
    stock of it, but he dared not venture to live on it: Galatians 2:20, "I am 
    crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in 
    me, and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the 
    Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." The grace within the 
    saints is a well, the streams of which are often dry, but to the grace 
    without them in Christ; they can never come wrong, for it is an overflowing 
    fountain. How quickly would the branch wither, if it were left to the sap 
    within itself, but the sap in the stock keeps the branch green: "He who eats 
    me," says Jesus, "even he shall live by me," John 6:7.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is the weak soul turning to a strong God for 
    strength, in the way of believing, 2 Chronicles 20:12, "O our God! will you 
    not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes 
    against us, neither know we what to do; but our eyes are towards you." When 
    the strong man goes into himself, and musters up all the forces and powers 
    of his soul, for the duty, or against the temptation, the weak man, that 
    lies fair for strength, goes out of himself to muster up the forces of 
    Heaven by faith.—I may take up this in three things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The weak man that becomes strong, truly believes 
    that God has treasured up in Christ the strength and furniture of all the 
    heirs of glory, for their work, 1 Corinthians 1:30, "But of him are you in 
    Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and 
    sanctification, and redemption." "And of his fullness have all we received, 
    and grace for grace," John 1:16. Since Adam fell, he never trusted any of 
    the saints with their own stock, but has made the Mediator the great Trustee 
    of divine grace, that if they would be supplied, they must go to him for it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Jesus Christ with all his salvation, being offered 
    in the way of the everlasting covenant, the weak soul by faith lays hold on 
    that covenant, and Christ therein, for sanctification, as well as 
    justification. Thus the weak creature is joined to a strong God, the empty 
    soul is joined to him in whom all fullness dwells; so that in this sense, 
    though he have nothing, yet he possesses all things, namely, in Christ his 
    head; they are complete in him, Colossians 2:10.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He believes the promises of the covenant, and, on 
    the credit of them, ventures on duty against sin, and takes up the cross: 2 
    Chronicles 14:11, "Help us, Lord, our God, for we rest on you, and in your 
    name we go against this multitude." Though resolutions, engagements, and 
    vows, be not to be trusted, yet a man may safely trust the promise; it is 
    the blessed contrivance of the second covenant, that all our duties are 
    there enrapt up in promises; and whenever we are called to do or suffer, the 
    covenant has a promise of strength for it, and the Christian, sensible of 
    his weakness, trusts it.—I am,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To confirm this point.—For this purpose, I offer 
    these remarks.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Christian, when he closes his own eyes, sees best; 
    when he trusts least to his own understanding, he is best directed, 
    according to the promise: Proverbs 3:5, 6, "Trust in the Lord with all your 
    heart, and lean not to your understanding: in all your ways acknowledge him, 
    and he shall direct your paths." Carnal wisdom is an ill judge between sin 
    and duty; and if men renounce it not, and singly give themselves up to the 
    divine conduct, they will be ready to stumble at noon-day: 1 Corinthians 
    3:20, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain." Lot 
    lifted up his eyes, Abraham closed his, and left his choice to the Lord, 
    Genesis 13:9, 10. This is the reason why godly simplicity oftentimes carries 
    men well through, while carnal policy leads men into the ditch; and weak 
    shrubs stand, while lofty cedars are blown over, that God may stain the 
    pride of all glory.</p>
<p align="justify">2. When he ventures on the difficulties in the way of 
    duty, not knowing how to remove them, he gets best through. This was the 
    case with Abraham, when called to offer up his son, Genesis 22; but when he 
    went down to Egypt, there was a difficulty in the way, which he would not 
    leave to the Lord to remove, but fell on ways and means of his own, and came 
    off shamefully, Genesis 22; over-fast, overloose in this respect, 1 
    Corinthians 3:16, "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for 
    it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness." A little faith is 
    more valuable than much carnal foresight. Leave difficulties in the way of 
    duty on the Lord, if ever you would get safe through them: Psalm 37:5, 
    "Commit your way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to 
    pass."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Christian soldier fights best when the violence of 
    the enemy sets him to his knees. Paul experienced this, when he besought the 
    Lord thrice, and got a gracious answer; and so he recommends it to others, 2 
    Corinthians 12:8, "Praying always (says he) with all prayer," Ephesians 
    6:18. It was in this last posture that Jacob got the notable victory, 
    Genesis 32:24. Hence it is said of him, Hosea 12:4, "Yes, he had power over 
    the angel and prevailed; he wept and made supplication unto him: he found 
    him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us." Did temptations and troubles set 
    us to our knees, the devil would be outshot. Did the threats of the enemies 
    at this time, but cast professors out of their beds of sloth down to their 
    knees, the Lord's work would quickly triumph over the enemies of it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The lower the soul lies, it is the nearer the throne 
    above: Isaiah 57:15, "For thus says the high and lofty One, that inhabits 
    eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him 
    also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the 
    humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones." A man will get a 
    better view of the stars from the bottom of a deep pit than from the top of 
    a mountain. The soul is never nearer the divine communications, than when 
    shame and blushing make him stand affar off with the publican, smiting on 
    his breast. The soul in that case will get the kindly invitation, "Come up 
    hither;" when the self-conceited presumptuous sinner will hear, "Go down 
    yonder."</p>
<p align="justify">5. The duty a Christian is called to, and sees himself 
    most unable for, he performs best. Peter, when he thought himself well 
    buckled for a confession for Christ, denied him at the voice of a silly 
    maid; but when he had better learned the duty of self-denial, he boldly 
    stood upon defense, Acts 4:13. A man had better be in the dark, than walk in 
    the light of his own sparks. A Christian never goes so actively through a 
    duty, as when he leaves his own furniture for it behind him, throws it down 
    in point of confidence, and takes up the promise.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The temptation that to a man is most contemptible, is 
    most dangerous: Proverbs 28:14, "Happy is the man that fears always; but he 
    who hardens his heart, shall fall into mischief." Many times the devil's 
    wounded men do more execution than his formidable army set in battle array. 
    Lot kept his ground in Sodom, when among a company of incarnate devils, but 
    fell foully when he thought himself in no hazard in the cave. If you would 
    stand, you must never despise the meanest, nor think the greatest temptation 
    insuperable. The meanest is too hard for you, the strongest too weak for the 
    strength that you may have in your God.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The Christian that stands before the Lord with 
    trembling legs, is the meet to take up Christ's cross, and will bear it 
    best. He who dare say least, is the man that will do most: Isaiah 40:30, 31, 
    "Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly 
    fall; but they that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength; they 
    shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary, and 
    they shall walk and not faint." He who ventures on the hour of trial, merely 
    with a Roman courage or natural briskness of spirit, has but a weak reed to 
    lean to. There is none more likely to be a disgrace to religion, than the 
    presumptuous self-confident professor, that wants nothing to support the 
    cause of God, in the time of trial, but only other professors' hearts like 
    his heart. The best and surest backing Christ will have, will be from those 
    that tremble when he shall roar like a lion, Hosea 11:10, see also Isaiah 
    35:4–6.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The Lord's people thrive best, when they have nothing 
    but from hand to mouth. The most enriching time they have, is when felt 
    needs are always driving them to God's door, and making them hang on about 
    his hand: Romans 5:3, 4, "Knowing that tribulation works patience, and 
    patience experience, and experience hope." The Christian that has most 
    trials, has most experiences. Many battles afford variety of spoil to the 
    Christian soldier; and a tract of smoothness in a man's lot, is ordinarily a 
    dead time with the Christian, as to trading with Heaven; he has not much 
    outgiving, and has as little income. When David going against Goliath, got 
    on Saul's armor and dress, 1 Samuel 17:38, he could not go with them; but 
    when he had nothing but the staff, and the bag of stones out of the brook, 
    he went freely, and succeeded.</p>
<p align="justify">As the fire burns most vigorously in a keen frost, so 
    faith acts most vigorously when it has nothing to animate it but the naked 
    word of promise. But when all is laid to a person's hand as they would wish, 
    faith is so clogged that it cannot readily go with them.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">WE now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To give some reasons of the doctrine, or show, That 
    when the Christian is weak, then he is strong; weak in his own eyes, strong 
    in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Among other reasons which might be assigned, we shall 
    mention the following.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Because he who is thus weak will not enter on 
    difficulty but when he is called to it; and God's call to his people for any 
    piece of work implies a promise of strength: Psalm 91:11, "For he shall give 
    his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways." Self-confidence 
    is venturous, thinks nothing too high for the man. Hence, he does not stay 
    until he be led, but runs into temptation; no wonder than he comes foul off, 
    like Peter in the devil's ground, the high-priest's hall. But the first 
    thing the weak man does, is to be sure of his call, knowing there can be no 
    ground for confidence without it. And he will not be over soon satisfied 
    with it, but ponders the path of his feet, Proverbs 4:26.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He is driven out of himself to the Lord Christ, the 
    fountain of strength: "Blessed is the man whose strength is in the Lord," 
    says the Psalmist, Psalm 84:5, "I will go in the strength of the Lord God," 
    Psalm 71:16. He leaves the rotten ground of self-confidence, and trusts in 
    him that raises the dead, and calls things that are not as though they were, 
    and out of the mouths of babes perfects praise. The power of Heaven is 
    engaged in his favor; he believes, therefore is not left to be ashamed. This 
    is a sure way for strength: for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It lies on the honor of God, to strengthen the soul 
    that depends upon him alone, according to his word, and that in point of his 
    veracity; God's word of honor is good security; also in point of his 
    goodness and gracious nature. Trust reposed in a generous man is a strong 
    tie upon him in favor of the party trusting him. And I think there is much 
    in that word, Jeremiah 39:18, "For I will surely deliver you, because you 
    have put your trust in me, says the Lord." Lot would rather that any evil 
    that was to come should have fallen on himself and family, than on his 
    guests; the reason is in these words: "For therefore came they under my 
    roof," Genesis 19:8. Humanity teaches people to preserve the life of a 
    little bird, that flies into their bosom to be preserved from a ravenous 
    bird. And they that take Ruth's way may be sure of the blessing she got: 
    Ruth 2:12, "The Lord recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of 
    the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because it sweetly answers to the grand device of 
    God touching the sanctification of sinners. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The treasures of sanctifying grace are all laid up 
    in Christ, "who of God is made unto us sanctification," 1 Corinthians 1:30, 
    and from him all gracious influences are to be derived: "Out of his fullness 
    we are to receive, and grace for grace," John 1:16. Accordingly the sinner 
    comes to him, as the famished Egyptians to Joseph.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are to be derived from him by faith according 
    to our needs; this is the appointed mean for conveyance of grace and 
    strength from Christ, Galatians 2:20. Accordingly the soul believes, that 
    is, trusts in him for supply. Now, when the soul takes God's own way for 
    strength, how can it miss it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Because the glory of God's grace appears best in 
    such a case. Thus it was with Paul, to whom God said, "My grace is 
    sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness." When 
    Christ cured the blind man, he anointed his eyes with clay. The grace of God 
    works best alone; and therefore the Lord, to stain pride, and prevent men 
    from sacrificing to their own net, brings them very low before he appears to 
    work for them, that his work may be wonderful, Deuteronomy 32:36.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Because in that case the grand stop of divine 
    communications is removed; the vessel is empty, and so the oil runs. 
    Self-confidence is diametrically opposite to the grand device of 
    sanctification revealed in the gospel. That a man should trust himself, was 
    the fundamental maxim of the Pagan morality, but revealed religion plainly 
    overturns it: Proverbs 28:26, "He that trusts in his own heart is a fool." 
    It is practically set up in the hearts of all men by nature, but grace 
    overturns it: Matthew 16:14, "If any man, (says Jesus) will come after me, 
    let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I am now to make some practical improvement of this 
    subject,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In an use of information.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Learn, that they who were never carried off their own 
    bottom for sanctification, have their religion yet to begin. It is a 
    fundamental error in practice, for men to think, that though they need the 
    righteousness of Christ for justification, yet they need but activity and 
    diligence with their natural powers for holiness. This is as absurd, 
    according to the scriptures, as to say the cripple needs but to ply his 
    limbs, and so shall be cured. It is an evidence,—(1.) That you have never 
    got a view of the corruption of nature, the plague of your own heart; your 
    plague is in your head—(2.) That you have never felt the need of Christ for 
    all his salvation, yes, for the principal part of it, that is, 
    sanctification, which is the great design of the whole mystery of the gospel 
    of Christ. And,—(3.) That therefore self has yet Christ's room in your 
    heart. You actest from yourself, and consequently to yourself, and so are 
    rejected of God in all that you do.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We are taught, that they make foul work, at communions 
    who,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Bind themselves to the Lord for work, but lay not 
    hold on the everlasting covenant for strength. I will not deny but the 
    sacrament is a seal of our engagement to the Lord; but, according to the 
    scripture, it is mainly a seal of God's full covenant to believers, as 
    appears from the words of institution; and therefore I think the main work 
    of a communion-occasion is that Christians receive a full Christ, lay hold 
    of a full covenant, suited to all their needs, and be no more faithless, but 
    believing. They mistake also,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Who come to that ordinance without a deep sense of 
    their wants, weakness, and imperfections. They who would have anything at 
    Christ's door, should be very sensible of their rank poverty at home: Luke 
    1:53, "He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent 
    empty away." They should be capable to lay their fingers on their sores, and 
    tell what ails them—Those mistake also,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Who are at no pains to prepare for that ordinance, 
    and to bring strength from Heaven for the management of it: "Without me 
    (says Jesus) you can do nothing," John 15:5; if nothing, how will they of 
    themselves manage such a great and solemn work? therefore they have much 
    need of fellowship with Heaven by faith and prayer.—Those err,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Who depend upon their own preparation. It is hard 
    work to prepare the heart for a communion; but it is harder to be denied to 
    it, and trust nothing to it when we have prepared. It is hard to be 
    wrestling with an ill heart, until it be brought to some tolerable frame; 
    but harder to trust all to free grace.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We may learn that none are so ready to be a prey to 
    the devil as the presumptuous, self-confident sinner. This is a train which, 
    when laid for a man, will quickly blow him up. The poor trembling saint will 
    keep his feet, when such an one's bent bow will quickly break,—In a word, we 
    may conclude,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That the best way to stand is to be much in the work 
    of undermining our self-confidence, and razing the grounds of it, shoveling 
    away the mire in which that flag grows; we would thus be brought into firm 
    ground, and would grow up into Christ.—I now proceed to,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, An use of comfort. This is comfortable to humble 
    souls,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In the case of the church of God. This church is 
    very weak at this day; she is weakened by mischiefs established by laws, by 
    divisions, but above all, by the provocations of her members against the 
    Lord; she is cast into a decay of true tenderness, and practical godliness; 
    she is far gone on in it: she has many enemies powerful and subtle, and 
    there are few to stand against them, a weak company, weak heads, hearts, and 
    hands; never fewer, perhaps, of the nobles and gentry of Scotland to take 
    her by the hand, than at this day. But it is very like she will be weaker 
    yet, before she recover strength, and many she trusts to now will leave her, 
    that her army, like Gideon's, may be brought to a small remnant, before the 
    tents of Midian fall. But the farther the arm of flesh goes from the church 
    of God, the nearer is the arm of God drawing to her.—There is comfort,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In your own case. It is no doubt the perplexing 
    question of serious souls, How will I go cleanly through? Religion is no 
    easy work at any time, but it is like to be harder than ordinary in our 
    time. How will we get the Lord's way kept? Christ's cross borne? If we faint 
    at little trials, what shall we do under greater ones? But remember, when 
    you are weak, then are you strong.—I shall only add,</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, An use of exhortation. I exhort you to keep up a 
    due sense of your own weakness, and trust for your through-bearing in the 
    Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Keep up a sense of the weakness of your heads, and 
    lean not to your own understanding in the point of sin and duty; but be much 
    hanging about the Lord's hand for light to clear your mind as to the way in 
    which you are to walk.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Keep up a sense of the weakness of your hearts, and 
    depend not upon your own strength for carrying you on in the way of duty 
    when known, but go to the Lord for strength. In order to prevail with you, I 
    mention the following motives—</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] This is necessary, to evidence your sincerity in 
    what you have been doing. You have been taking a guide, professing 
    yourselves incapable to guide yourselves, and a supporter, because you are 
    unable to support yourselves. Honor him, follow him, and depend upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] You will have need of strength; be sure you will be 
    tried; public trials seem to be abiding us, private trials you may lay your 
    account with particularly; Satan is most busy at such a time.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] You will never get through in your own strength; you 
    have no reason to trust to yourselves, whatever the present frame and 
    purposes of your hearts be. For, 1st, Many sad instances have been of those 
    who have got the slip of their own hearts, that thought they had as good 
    reason to be confident as you, that they would never go back; witness Noah, 
    Lot, David, Solomon, and Peter. 2dly, Many that pretend fair are real 
    nothings. We have need the Lord would hold the glass before our eyes, that 
    we may see ourselves, our state and frame. 3dly, The best have very 
    deceitful hearts: Jeremiah 17:21, "The heart is deceitful above all things, 
    and desperately wicked, who can know it?" And it is a general maxim, "He who 
    trusts in his own heart is a fool," Proverbs 28:26. We are very much 
    unacquainted with ourselves, with our own hearts, we know not what manner of 
    spirits we are of, Luke 9:55. The root of wickedness lies within us.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Keep up the sense of your weakness, and trust to 
    the Lord alone, and you will be strengthened with all might, so that you can 
    do all things through Christ that strengthens you, Philippians 4:13.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall offer some considerations to impress this on your 
    spirits.</p>
<p align="justify">I. You will have need of strength, if you intend to reach 
    Heaven. Indeed, if you have taken your last sight of Immanuel's land, and 
    have no mind for the Lord's work, but to turn your back on his way, and go 
    with the stream, you may sit at your own ease, Satan will see to your swift 
    progress, and will not leave you until he have you cast into the oven of 
    God's wrath. But otherwise you must go against the stream, and you must have 
    strength.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Strength for the duties of religion, and these are 
    as large as the law, which is the rule of duty, and it is exceeding broad. 
    You must now set yourself to internal and external obedience, your duty to 
    God and man; give the obedience of heart, lip, and life; you must be 
    universal in obedience, otherwise you are hypocritical in it, and so 
    rejected; you must have a holy conversation; your eye must ever be on the 
    Lord, and his holy law; holiness must go through all your actions, your 
    civil and natural actions. "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do 
    all to the glory of God;" and surely for all this you need strength.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Strength for temptations. You must now resolve to 
    enter the lists with a subtle devil, that has now more than five thousand 
    years' experience in the art of tempting. How will you stand? With his 
    agents in the world, he will fight against you with tongue, feet, and hands, 
    and that too may be before long; and your most dangerous enemy is within; 
    you have innumerable tempters within you: James 1:14, "Every man is tempted, 
    when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed." There are many snares 
    in the world, but none so dangerous as the corruption that is within each of 
    our own hearts; this will ever be ready to break out, and embrace its 
    friends whenever they come near.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Strength for the cross. Have you engaged with a 
    crucified Christ? You must take up your cross, and bear it; and this will 
    require strength,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To bear your every day's cross. Go times as they 
    will, you will find every day will have the evil thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Your holiday's cross, in the church's troubles: "You 
    have (says Jeremiah) called, as in a solemn day, my terrors round about," 
    Lamentations 2:22, and how heavy that may be, we know not; but if the 
    devil's time be short, he will be sure to have great wrath. We have had a 
    cheap religion of it for many years, and therefore it has got many 
    customers: but if the after-reckoning were come, which seems to be making 
    haste, it is to be feared that many of us will throw it down again, and say, 
    We never intended to have it at that rate.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You have no strength in yourselves answerable to that 
    work; and therefore, without doubt, you will never be able of yourselves for 
    the least of it: 2 Corinthians 3:5, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves 
    to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God." Two 
    things evidence this.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Our stock of strength was spent before ever it came 
    to our hands. The first Adam got it, Ecclesiastes 7:29. God has made man 
    upright, and he by falling left us without strength, Romans 5:6. And thus 
    the unregenerate world lies in wickedness, unable to recover themselves, but 
    are held captive by Satan in chains of lusts, not to be broken by the power 
    of nature.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Though, since Adam fell, God has given strength to 
    his people, yet since that time God never trusted any mere man with his own 
    stock of strength; but he has put a common stock of it into the hand of the 
    Mediator, to be distributed by him according as the duties of his people 
    require, and as they make application to him for it; and no man can come, 
    saying with the younger brother, Luke 15:12, "Give me the portion of goods 
    that falls to me," intending to set up and stand by himself. But he must 
    come to stay at home, and receive his daily provision at his Father's table, 
    and out of his hand, according to his necessities. The believer, being first 
    by faith united to Christ as the head of influences, wherein all fullness 
    dwells, must depend on him as the members on the head, the branches on the 
    stock, and by faith derive strength from him continually, which cannot be, 
    but under this sense of weakness which we press upon you, John 1:51; 1 
    Corinthians 1:30; John 6:57. Therefore, I say confidently, that, be you 
    saints or sinners, you have nothing in you to trust for the work of 
    religion, if it be not Christ in you; and, be your stock always what it 
    will, it is a very weak one, and you must not trust to it.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, You will get enough of strength in Christ, if you 
    take this way to it, living and going out of yourselves, under a sense of 
    utter weakness, to the Lord Christ, as the head of strengthening influences. 
    If you ask, What is that? I answer, It is the soul's discerning an utter 
    inability in itself for any spiritually good action, but withal believing 
    that God has treasured up sufficient strength in the Mediator, to be 
    communicated to those that are his, and therefore embracing a full Christ 
    for all, as held forth in the everlasting covenant; and then venturing on 
    duties, watching against temptations, and taking up the cross, upon the 
    faith and credit of the promises of the covenant, trusting that they shall 
    be made out to him; which trust may be weaker or stronger, but according to 
    the strength of it, so is the income of strength to the soul. In this way 
    the weak go from strength to strength. Thus shall you be helped to go 
    through the most difficult duties acceptably, though not perfectly, to stand 
    against the strongest temptations, to mortify the most powerful lusts, and 
    to bear the heaviest crosses. This has made Christians attain to an eminent 
    pitch of holiness, joyfully to embrace a prison, banishment, a gibbet, a 
    fire, and the most cruel torments enemies could invent. The more you are 
    emptied of yourselves, placing confidence in the Lord, the more will you be 
    strengthened with might in the inner man; and when you shall be perfectly 
    un-selfed, if we may so express ourselves, so that there shall be no more of 
    it to mar the communication between Christ and you, then you shall be 
    perfectly holy, and set above the reach of all evil; but because we are not 
    properly divested of self-confidence in this world, therefore we do not 
    arrive here at perfect strength. But all the saints, however, will give 
    their testimony, that "when they are weak, then they are strong."—Amen.</p>
