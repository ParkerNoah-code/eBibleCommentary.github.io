    Isaiah 61:1, "To bind up the broken-hearted."</p>
<p align="justify">IN these words, we have another piece of work which the 
    Father has put in Christ's hand. He has sent him "to bind up the 
    broken-hearted." In the words there is, 1. The work itself, to bind up; Luke 
    has it to heal, chapter 4:18. He is employed by the Father as the great 
    Physician to bind up sinners, as a surgeon does a broken bone or any other 
    wound, and to heal them. This belongs to his priestly office. We have, 2, 
    The objects of it; "the broken-hearted," such as are sick of sin, who have 
    their hearts broken and cast down within them, on account of sin, and its 
    consequences. This is a sickness which Christ is sent to cure.</p>
<p align="justify">From this subject, you may observe the following</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, Our Lord Jesus is appointed of his Father, to 
    be the Physician of broken-hearted sinners, to bind them up, and heal them.</p>
<p align="justify">For illustrating this doctrine, we shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is that brokenness of heart, which is here meant.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What is it in and about sin which breaks the man's 
    heart, who is thus evangelically broken-hearted.</p>
<p align="justify">III. What sort of a heart a broken heart is.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. How the Lord Christ binds up, and heals the 
    broken-hearted.</p>
<p align="justify">V. Make some improvement.—We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To inquire what is that brokenness of heart which is 
    here meant, and of which the Lord takes so much notice. The broken-hearted 
    is of two kinds.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a natural one, arising from natural and 
    carnal causes merely, which works death, 2. Corinthians 7:10. Thus many who 
    are very whole-hearted in respect of sin, complain that their hearts and 
    spirits are broken by their crosses, afflictions, and ill usage which they 
    meet with in the world. Thus Ahab, Haman, and Nabal, their hearts were 
    broken with their respective crosses. This is nothing but the crack which a 
    proud heart gets by God's providence, when it will not bow, and is very 
    displeasing in God's sight. This Christ will not heal, until it is broken at 
    another rate. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A religious broken heart, which arises from religious 
    causes, namely, sin and its consequences. Sin has sunk into the souls of all 
    Adam's posterity, like a deadly poison. But most men are whole-hearted, 
    though they carry their death about with them, because the poison has not 
    yet begun to work. The thorn of guilt is sticking in their conscience, but 
    they are easy, for it has not yet begun to fester. But when the poison 
    begins to work, the heart is broken with it. Every such breaking of heart is 
    not the sickness unto life which Christ is sent to heal. There is a twofold 
    religious breaking of heart.—First, A mere legal one; Jeremiah 23:29, "Is 
    not my word like as a fire? says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the 
    rock in pieces?" When the heart is broken by the mere force of the law, it 
    is broken as a rock in pieces by a hammer, each part remaining hard and 
    rocky still. As it breaks the heart of a malefactor, to hear his doom 
    pronounced that he must be hanged for his crime; so does the law break the 
    heart of a sinner. This breaks the heart for sin, but not from it. Thus the 
    hearts of Cain and Judas were broken, and thus the hearts of the damned 
    shall be broken forever. Men may die of these wounds, and never be healed. 
    But there is,—Secondly, An evangelical one. When not only the law does its 
    part, but the gospel also breaks the sinner's heart; Zechariah 12:10, "And I 
    will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
    the spirit of grace and supplication; and they shall look upon me whom they 
    have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for his only son, 
    and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his 
    first-born." This is that kindly heart-breaking for sin, which is an effect 
    of gospel-grace, a sickness of which never one shall die, it is the very 
    malady which in the text Christ is sent to cure. Sin in an ungracious soul, 
    is like poison in a serpent, it is agreeable to their nature, it does not 
    make them sick at all. Though it be indeed with them as a kind of serpent, 
    from whose killing looks men defend themselves, by holding a glass between 
    them and the serpent, which reflects the poison on the serpent himself, and 
    so kills him. Thus, Psalm 7:16, "The wicked man's mischief shall return upon 
    his own head, and his violent dealings shall return upon his own pate." But 
    in those in whom God has a gracious work, sin is like poison in a man, 
    contrary to his nature, and so makes him heartsick. Thus the true 
    broken-hearted sinner is as sick of sin as ever a man was of poison, which 
    he had unwarily swallowed down, and would by all means be quit of it. We now 
    come,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To inquire what it is in and about sin which breaks 
    the man's heart, who is thus evangelically broken-hearted. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The guilt of sin, by which he is bound over to the 
    wrath of God. This, which cannot be taken away but by a free pardon, sickens 
    the poor creature at the heart; Isaiah 33:24, "And the inhabitant shall not 
    say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their 
    iniquity." This guilt is their burden, a burden on their backs, on their 
    heads, on their spirits, which makes them to cry out, as in Hosea 14:2, 
    "Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously." They find the load, and 
    their spirits are broken under it, as a burden which they are not able to 
    bear. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The domineering power of sin, or its tyranny, by which 
    they are led captives to it. This is breaking to them that lusts are so 
    strong, and they so weak, that they cannot get the mastery over them as they 
    would; Romans 7:23, 24, "But I see another law in my members, warring 
    against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of 
    sin, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me 
    from the body of this death?" For some time the yoke of sin sat soft on 
    their necks, they walked willingly after its commandments; but now they are 
    weary of its dominion, averse to submit to its rule, and their hearts are 
    broken under the weight of those iron fetters from which they would now 
    gladly be delivered. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The contrariety which is in sin to the holy nature and 
    law of God. The commandment is come into the heart, which it is inclined to 
    obey, and so that contrariety is breaking; Romans 7:13, "Was then that which 
    is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, 
    working death in me, by that which is good; that sin by the commandment 
    might become exceeding sinful." The love of God has so touched the heart, as 
    to produce in him a considering sin to be bitter as death. The soul is 
    wounded and cast down to think of its grieving the Spirit, trampling on the 
    holy law, sinning against mercies, against checks and reproofs; and accounts 
    itself very miserable in thus requiting the Lord. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The indwelling of sin, and its cleaving so close to a 
    person that he cannot shake it off; Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am! 
    who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" He sees sin to be in his 
    heart and life, and not only so, but that it is interwoven into his very 
    nature, and not to be totally extirpated until death. He has now a sincere 
    love to holiness, an ardent desire of perfection, Philippians 3:13, 14; an 
    hearty hatred against sin, and an irreconcilable enmity to it; so that it 
    cannot but be breaking to him, while he sees the unwelcome guest still 
    within his habitation. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">5. Sin's mixing itself with all he does, even with his 
    best duties: Romans 7:21, "I find then a law, that when I would do good, 
    evil is present with me." In the fairest line which he writes, sin leaves a 
    blot; and on the purest and most sacred of God's holy things to which he 
    puts hand, sin drops its defilement. This is breaking to a holy heart. When 
    he reviews his duties, and sees what deadness, what want of faith and love 
    is in his prayers, hearing, communicating, and the like, what 
    unwatchfulness, untenderness, and ungodliness, in his daily walk, he is 
    loathsome in his own eyes, and sick, heart-sick of his sinful self.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Frequent backslidings into sin are very breaking in 
    this case. The Lord complains of breaking by these; Ezekiel 6:9, "I am 
    broken," says he, "with their whorish heart, which has departed from me, and 
    with their eyes which go a-whoring after their idols." And, on the other 
    hand, they are most breaking to the sensible sinner himself; Jeremiah 31:18, 
    "I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, 
    and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; turn you me, and 
    I shall be turned, for you are the Lord my God." O how heavy is it to a 
    gracious heart, to be so often falling back into evils mourned over and 
    resolved against! How near the heart of a sick man must it go, to be so 
    often relapsing, after he has been in a fair way of cure. Nothing is more 
    powerful to make one say of life, I loathe it. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">7. Desertions, hidings of the Lord's face, and 
    interruptions of the soul's communion with God. See how breaking these are, 
    Isaiah 54:6, "For the Lord has called you, as a woman forsaken and grieved 
    in spirit, and a wife of youth, when you were refused, says your God." 
    Sometimes the soul is brought very low by desertions, and ready to give up 
    all for lost: Lamentations 3:18, "And I said, My strength and my hope is 
    perished from the Lord." This is a bitter root, springing up from sin, and 
    branches forth divers ways, all of them breaking to a sensible soul. There 
    is spiritual deadness, Song 5:2. Influences from Heaven are restrained, and 
    so the heart is bound up as with bands of iron and brass. They cannot either 
    believe, love, or mourn acceptably. All that remains is a secret 
    dissatisfaction with their own case, only a sigh or a groan, because they 
    cannot believe, love, or practice, as they know to be required of them, 
    saying, Isaiah 63:17, "O Lord, why have you made us to err from your ways, 
    and harden our hearts from your fear?" This is breaking. Next there is, 
    prayers shut out, Lamentations 3:8. "Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out 
    my prayer." While a Christian has access to God by prayer, and can pour his 
    complaints into his bosom, whatever be his case, he has not so much to 
    complain of. Thus Hannah, after she had done so, went her way and did eat, 
    and her countenance was no more sad. This also encourages them to wait upon 
    the Lord, Micah 7:7. But when the door of access seems to be shut, and a 
    thick cloud is drawn about the throne, this is breaking: Lamentations 3:44, 
    "You have covered yourself with a cloud, that our prayers should not pass 
    through." This made Zion say, Isaiah 49:14, "The Lord has forsaken me, and 
    my Lord has forgotten me." And Psalm 20:2, "My God, my God, why have you 
    forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my 
    roaring?"—Again, there is wrath apprehended, the terrors of God seizing on 
    the soul. "The arrows of the Almighty," said Job, "are within me, the poison 
    whereof drinks up my spirit, the terrors of God do set themselves against 
    me," chapter 6:4. This is of all terrors the most terrible, and what heart 
    can remain whole under it? Proverbs 18:14, "The spirit of a man will sustain 
    his infirmities, but a wounded spirit who can bear?" See how Heman was 
    broken under this. Psalm 88:15, "I am afflicted and ready to die from my 
    youth up; while I suffer your terrors, I am distracted." It made Job, a 
    grave solid man, of extraordinary piety, cry out in the congregation, as 
    unable to contain himself, chapter 30:29, 30, 31, "I am a brother to 
    dragons, and a companion to owls; my skin is black upon me, and my bones are 
    burned with heat. My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the 
    voice of them that weep."—Finally, there are temptations dogging the soul, 
    the more vile and horrid these are, the more dreadful. Sometimes the Lord 
    looses Satan's chains, and he is let almost loose on a Christian, 1 
    Corinthians 12:7. Hence there are fiery darts shot into the heart, 
    extraordinary temptations as to faith or practice, Ephesians 6:16; and 
    these, though repelled, yet coming back as if a siege were laid to the soul, 
    by an army resolved to master the town. And when, withal, one is left often 
    to fall under these, this is most breaking to a gracious soul. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, To sum up all in a word, a Christian's 
    sinfulness, with the bitter fruits springing from his sin; these are what 
    are breaking to his heart. He is not what God would, nor what he would have 
    himself to be. He is dissatisfied with himself, yet cannot right his case; 
    Romans 7:19, "For that which I do, I allow not; for what I would, that I do 
    not; but what I hate, that do I." He brings miseries on himself by his sin, 
    and therefore is sadly broken under the thought of his case.—We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To show what sort of a heart a broken heart is. As 
    to this we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is a contrite or bruised heart; Psalm 51:17, 
    "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O 
    God, you will not despise." Not only broken in pieces like a rock, but 
    broken to powder, and so fit to receive any impression; so the word 
    signifies. The heart, though before sometimes like an adamant, which mercies 
    could not melt, nor judgments terrify, is now kindly broken and bruised 
    between the upper and nether mill-stone;—the upper mill-stone of the law, a 
    sense of God's wrath against sin; and—the nether mill-stone of the gospel, 
    of divine lore, mercy, and favor, manifested in word and providences. If one 
    going to break a hard stone, would lay it firm upon another hard stone, 
    which will not yield underneath it, then, when you strike, it will either 
    not break at all, or if it do, it will not break in shivers; but either lay 
    it hollow, or on a soft bed, and it will break all in shivers. Thus, lay the 
    hard heart upon the hard law, and strike it with the most dreadful 
    threatenings of Hell and damnation, it either will not break at all, or at 
    least it will not break small. But lay the hard heart on the bed of the 
    gospel of mercy and love, and then let the hammer of the law strike, the 
    heart will go asunder. Legal preaching, which casts a veil over 
    gospel-grace, is not the way to make good Christians. Joel lays the hearts 
    of his hearers on mercy, then fetches his stroke with the hammer of the law, 
    and cries, chapter 2:13, "Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn 
    unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and 
    of great kindness, and repents him of the evil." But it is the Spirit of the 
    Lord that carries home the stroke, else it will not do. A broken heart is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A pained heart, an aching heart; Acts 2:37, "When they 
    heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest 
    of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Bruising or breaking a 
    living member is not without pain. God wounds the guilty conscience, that 
    the sinner may see and find what an evil and bitter thing sin is; Jeremiah 
    2:19, "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall 
    reprove you; know therefore, and see, that it is an evil thing and a bitter, 
    that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and my fear is not in you, says 
    the Lord God of hosts." The deeper that the wound is, the sorer the heart is 
    broken. It is pained with sorrow; Proverbs 15:13, "By sorrow of the heart 
    the spirit is broken." A broken heart is a sorrowful heart for sin, for the 
    offence given to God, the dishonor put on him by it, and the evil brought on 
    one's self. Thus the broken-hearted sinner is a mourning sinner, Zechariah 
    12:10. The spirit of heaviness sits down on the man, until Christ bind up 
    his wound; his joy is turned into lamentation. The heart is pained also with 
    remorse for sin, Acts 2:37. Every remembrance of his folly gives him a 
    twitch by the scourge of conscience. He calls himself fool and beast for so 
    requiting the Lord. He is heartily displeased with himself on that account; 
    Job 42:6, "Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." He 
    smites on his breast, as worthy to be pierced, Luke 18:13; and smites on his 
    thigh, as worthy to be broken for what he has done. Again, it is pained with 
    anxiety and care how to be saved from sin; Acts 16:30, "What shall I do to 
    be saved?" It brings a burden of care upon his head, how to get the guilt 
    removed, the power of it broken, and to get it expelled at length. Never was 
    a man more anxious about the cure of a broken leg or arm, than the 
    broken-hearted sinner is to get his soul-wounds healed, and to be free of 
    sin, which is his greatest cross. The heart is pained with longing desires 
    after grace; Psalm 119:20, "My soul breaks for the longing that it has unto 
    your judgments at all times." The broken-hearted sinner, sensible of his 
    spiritual wants, longs for the supply of them, pants for it as a thirsty man 
    for water; and the delay of answering these desires makes a sick heart; 
    Proverbs 13:12, "Hope deferred makes the heart sick." A broken heart is,</p>
<p align="justify">3. A shameful heart. The whole heart in sin is impudent; 
    but the broken heart is filled with shame. Ezra said, chapter 9:6, "O my 
    God, I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our 
    iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto 
    the heavens." The man hangs down his head before the Lord, as not able to 
    look up, Psalm 40:12. He sees himself stripped of his beautiful garments, 
    and is ashamed of his spiritual nakedness, and, with the publican, he cannot 
    lift up his eyes. He is fallen into the mire, and is ashamed to come before 
    God in his defilement, Isaiah 64:6. His vain expectations from the way of 
    sin are baulked, and so he turns back ashamed. His reproach is discovered, 
    he is convicted of the basest ingratitude, and so is filled with shame. As 
    the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed, 
    Jeremiah 2:26.—A broken heart is,</p>
<p align="justify">4. A soft and tender heart, for a broken and a hard heart 
    are opposed to each other; Ezekiel 36:26, "I will take away the stony heart 
    out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh." When the spirit 
    of the Lord breaks the heart with gospel-grace, he melts it down, and 
    softens it, takes away that stonyness, stiffness, hardness, that cleaves to 
    the heart in its natural state. The brokenhearted sinner, however, will very 
    probably say, Alas! I find my heart a hard heart. To this I answer, to find 
    the hardness of heart, and to be weighted and grieved with it, is a sign of 
    tenderness, even as groaning is a sign of life: 2 Corinthians 8:12, "For if 
    there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man has, 
    and not according to what he has not." There is no heart in this world but 
    there is some hardness in it. There may be tears where there is no broken 
    heart, as in Esau, and there may be a broken and tender heart where tears 
    are not. Try, therefore, the tenderness of your hearts by the following 
    marks.—</p>
<p align="justify">Are your hearts kindly affected with providences? You 
    meet with a mercy, and it is a wonder to you that the Lord should be so kind 
    to such an unworthy wretch. You say as Jacob, "I am not worthy of the least 
    of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you has showed unto your 
    servant," Genesis 32:10. It melts your heart into an earnest desire of 
    holiness, knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance. Again, 
    you meet with rebuke of providence, showing you that you are out of the way, 
    and you dare not venture farther that way. This is a good sign; Proverbs 
    17:10, "A reproof enters more into a wise man, than a hundred stripes into a 
    fool." Again, do the threatenings of the Lord's word awe your heart, not 
    only in respect of gross outbreakings, but in the course of your daily walk? 
    Isaiah 62:2, "But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of 
    a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word." Are you afraid of the Lord's 
    displeasure more than of anything else, and must you stand at a distance 
    from these things which the world makes light of on that account? This is a 
    sign of a tender heart. This reflection was comfortable to Job, chapter 
    31:23, "For destruction from God was a terror unto me; and by reason of his 
    highness I could not endure." Now this had a tendency to keep him free from 
    all sin.—Finally, have the Lord's commandments an awful authority on your 
    conscience, so that you are tender of offending him, and trampling on them? 
    A hard heart can easily digest an offence against God, but a tender heart 
    respects all his commandments, Psalm 119:6. A burnt child dreads the fire; 
    and the sinner whose heart has been broken for sin dreads sin as the 
    greatest evil. There are some who will be very tender at their prayers, it 
    may be that they weep and pray; but then fearful untenderness appears in 
    their ordinary walk. But show me the person who is in the fear of the Lord 
    all the day long, who is afraid to say or do an ill thing; I say, this is 
    the tender person, though his prayers should be filled from beginning to end 
    with complaints of hardness of heart; not the other; 1 John 5:3, "For this 
    is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are 
    not grievous."—A broken heart is,</p>
<p align="justify">5. A rent heart: Joel 2:13, "And rend your hearts, and 
    not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God." The plough of 
    humiliation and repentance is drawn through the heart, which tears up the 
    fallow-ground, and pierces to the very soul. Many a man's heart is rent with 
    remorse, or rather mangled, which is never thoroughly rent; and so their 
    wound foes together again after some time, and they are as before. But the 
    truly broken heart is rent to no purpose, until the plough reach to the root 
    of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Here there may be proposed this question, What is the 
    difference of these rendings? To this I answer, an unrenewed man's heart may 
    be rent for sin, but it is not rent from it. The heart truly broken is not 
    only rent for, but from sin; not only affrighted at, but framed into a 
    hatred of it, Ezekiel 36:31, "Then shall you remember your own evil ways, 
    and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own 
    sight for your iniquities, and for your abominations." The heart is so 
    broken that the reigning love of sin runs out of it, as water out of a 
    cracked vessel, or as filthy matter out of a wound which is laid open. He 
    digs deep, as the wise builder; the other, like Balaam, who professed a 
    regard to the authority of God, but still loved the wages of iniquity. 
    Again, the rent of the former either closes too soon, as those who quickly 
    fall secure again, getting ease by bribing their consciences; or it never 
    was closed at all, falling under absolute despair, like Judas. But the other 
    is at length healed, yet not until the great Physician takes the core in 
    hand. The wound is kept open, and the soul refuses healing, until the Lord 
    looks down and beholds from Heaven, as in Lamentations 3:50. The wound is 
    too deep to be cured, but by his blood and Spirit, yet not so deep, but that 
    some ray of hope is always left; there is a "who knows but the Lord will yet 
    return?"—The broken heart is,</p>
<p align="justify">6. A pliable heart. The hard heart is a heart of stone, 
    unpliable. When the spirit breaks the heart for sin, he makes it a heart of 
    flesh, Ezekiel 36:26. Hearts which the grace of God has not touched, are 
    like young horses not used to the saddle, young bullocks unaccustomed to the 
    yoke; they are unpliable and unmanageable, because they are not yet broken, 
    Jeremiah 31:18. But if ever any good may be made of that heart of your, the 
    spirit of God will break it; however wild and intractable it be, the Spirit 
    will make it pliable. He will make it pliable to the will of his 
    commandments, saying, "Lord, what would you have me to do? and what shall we 
    do?" Acts 2:37. They had often heard before what they should do, but they 
    would not comply, but now, since their hard heart is broken, they are very 
    pliable. Many a time the sinner's heart gets such a piercing thrust in his 
    sinful course, that one would think, surely he will comply now. Yes, but the 
    heart is not broken yet, therefore the man will not comply, according as 
    Solomon represents it in the case of the drunkard, Proverbs 23:29, 32, and 
    34, "They have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not sick; they have 
    beaten me, and I felt it not; when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again." 
    But if God have any thoughts of love to him, the Spirit of God will take the 
    ease in his own hand; and were he as stiff as the devil and his hard heart 
    can make him, he will break him to that rate, that he shall ply as wax 
    before he have done with him. Witness Saul the persecutor, who was so 
    softened, that he cried, Lord, what would you have me to do? Acts 9:6. The 
    heart becomes pliable also to the will of his providence: Psalm 51:4. "That 
    you might be justified when you speak, and be cleared when you judge." An 
    unrenewed heart is a murmuring one under the hand of God, and will readily 
    choose to sin rather than suffer. But the broken heart will say, give me 
    your favor, and take from me what you will: Luke 14:26, "If any man come to 
    me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and 
    brethren, and sisters, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." 
    Sometimes one meets with an affliction, and they cry out they are broken, 
    they are not able to bear it. God sends them a heavier one, they are 
    stricken until they leave off weeping, and withal opens the heart-vein to 
    bleed for sin, and so in some sort they are made to forget their affliction. 
    And it is their great concern to get their soul's disease healed, let God do 
    with them otherwise as he will.—A broken heart is,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, A humble heart; Isaiah 57:15, quoted above. The 
    hard heart is a gathered boil; when it is broken, it is discussed. As soon 
    as the heart is broken, under a sense of sin, pride and self-conceit vanish 
    away, and the more broken-hearted that a person is, the less proud. Paul was 
    a proud persecutor, but the Lord laid the pride of his heart, when he broke 
    it, Acts 9:4, 5. Hezekiah, in his brokenness of heart is very humble: "I 
    shall go softly," said he, "all my years in the bitterness of my soul," 
    Isaiah 38:16. O! if the proud and empty professors of this day had a taste 
    of this broken heart, it would soon lay their mirthful feathers, let out the 
    ulcers of pride, self-conceit, which are swollen so big in many a poor soul. 
    It would turn the saying, "Stand by, for I am holier than you," unto "Depart 
    from me, for I am a sinful man." It would make them think little of what 
    they have been, of what they are, and of what they have done or suffered; 
    little of what all their attainments, gifts, yes, and graces also, if they 
    have any, are.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING considered that brokenness of heart which is here 
    meant,—what about sin the heart is broken for,—and described the nature of a 
    broken heart, we go on, as was proposed,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To show how the Lord Christ binds up and heals the 
    brokenhearted.—The great Physician uses two sorts of bands for a broken 
    heart, he binds them up with inner and with outward bands.</p>
<p align="justify">1. With inner bands, which go nearest the sore, the 
    pained broken heart. And these are two.—The first inner band is,</p>
<p align="justify">Christ's own Spirit, the Spirit of adoption. The hearts 
    of the disciples were sore broken at the news of Jesus leaving them, and it 
    behooved them to bleed a while. But he tells them, he would send a healing 
    band for their broken hearts; John 14:16, "And I will pray the Father," said 
    he, "and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you 
    forever." Our Lord breaks his people's hearts by his Spirit, and yet by the 
    same Spirit binds them up again. In the first work he is the Spirit of 
    bondage, and some may be long under his hand this way. Hence we read of some 
    "who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage," 
    Hebrews 2:15. The Old Testament church had much of this spirit, "I am 
    afflicted," says the psalmist, Psalm 88:15, "and ready to die, from my youth 
    up; while I suffer your terrors, I am distracted."—In the next work, he is 
    the Spirit of adoption; Romans 8:15, "For you have not received the spirit 
    of bondage again to fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, 
    whereby we cry, Abba, Father." He comes quickening, sanctifying, reviving, 
    and comforting the soul. Therefore pray with David, Psalm 51:11, 12, "Take 
    not your Holy Spirit from me; restore unto me the joy of your salvation, and 
    uphold me with your free Spirit."—The second inner band is,</p>
<p align="justify">Faith in Christ, (the band of the covenant), which he 
    works in the heart by his Spirit. Faith is a healing band, for it knits the 
    soul, Ephesians 3:17, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." The 
    woman with the bloody issue, when she got a touch of the hem of Christ's 
    garments, was presently made whole. Thus the brokenhearted sinner, when he 
    gets hold of Christ by faith, is bound up with him in one mystical body, 
    virtue comes from him for the soul's healing. The virtue of his blood takes 
    away guilt; the virtue of his Spirit breaks the power of sin. The apostle 
    prescribes this healing band to the broken-hearted jailor; Acts 16:31, 
    "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house;" 
    and the more faith that there is, the band will be the stronger, and the 
    soul the sooner healed. Much unbelief, and little faith, keep the wounds of 
    the soul long open; Psalm 27:13," I had fainted unless I had believed to see 
    the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living." A broken-hearted sinner 
    staving off and disputing against his believing, is like a child who has a 
    broken leg, doing what he can to tear off the bands with which it must be 
    bound up; but he must admit them, or his leg will never heal: John 11:40, 
    "Jesus says unto her, Said I not unto you, that if you would believe, you 
    should see the glory of God?" Peter walking on the water, was like to break 
    and sink quite, Matthew 14:30; the cause was his unbelief, verse 31, "Jesus 
    said unto him, O you of little faith, wherefore did you doubt?"—There are 
    also,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Outward bands for a broken heart.—These also are two.</p>
<p align="justify">The first outward band is his own word, especially the 
    promises of the gospel. This band Peter held out to the broken-hearted 
    company; Acts 2:38, 39, "Repent," said he, "and be baptized every one of 
    you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and you shall 
    receive the gift of the Holy Spirit; for the promise is unto you, and to 
    your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our 
    God shall call." This word has a sovereign virtue for healing; Psalm 107:20, 
    "He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their 
    destructions." Our Lord wraps up a promise, in a soft band of love; and he 
    makes them lay it to with their own hands; and the more closely they tie it 
    about their broken hearts with the hand of faith, they will be the sooner 
    whole. Say not, What can a word do? An encouraging word from men will 
    wonderfully raise a carnally-dejected mind; and if so, certainly the Lord's 
    word will heal a broken heart. A promise will be, in this case, like the 
    opening of a box of perfumes to one ready to faint away; Song 1:3, "Because 
    of the savor of your good ointment, your name is like ointment poured forth, 
    therefore do the virgins love you."</p>
<p align="justify">The second outward band is his own seals of the covenant; 
    Acts 2:38, quoted above. These seals are for our ingrafting into, and having 
    communion with Jesus Christ, and so are most fit means to bind up hearts 
    broken under a sense of sin, when they are partakers of these in faith. 
    Hence many have been healed at such occasions; though indeed the water is 
    not moved at all times, or at least the broken-hearted sinner does not 
    always step into it. It was an ancient custom, though that will not justify 
    it, to put a white garment on persons when they were baptized. But surely 
    our Lord has taken off the spirit of heaviness, and given the garment of 
    praise to many at sealing ordinances. The eunuch, after he was baptized, 
    went on his way rejoicing. The sorrowful disciples were also made glad, 
    when, after his resurrection, Jesus made himself known to them in the 
    breaking of bread, Luke 24:35. All these bands are the Physician's absolute 
    property. The poor patient has nothing of his own to be a band to his 
    wounds. The Spirit is the Spirit of Christ; faith is his work; the word and 
    sacraments are his ordinances, and their efficacy is all from him; and thus 
    he heals them. His kindness in this instance, we may take up in these three 
    things—</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are justified and pardoned: Job 33:23, 24," If 
    there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show 
    unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto him, and says, Deliver 
    him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom." The sting of guilt 
    is taken away, the poison is carried off, by a full and free pardon. Thus 
    the seek man is whole; Isa, 33:24, "And the inhabitant shall not say, I am 
    sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity." The 
    blood of Christ, with which by faith the soul is bound up, cleanses the 
    wound, and heals it; 1 John 1:7, "But if we walk in the light, as he is in 
    the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus 
    Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are sanctified; 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such 
    were some of you; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are 
    justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." The 
    Spirit is a sanctifying spirit: faith a sanctifying grace: Acts 15:9, "And 
    put no difference between us and them, sanctifying their hearts by faith." 
    The sacraments are sanctifying ordinances: 1 Corinthians 12:13, "For by one 
    Spirit, we are all baptized into one body,—and have been all made, to drink 
    into one Spirit." By these the power of corruption, as to its reign, is 
    broken; lusts are gradually killed, and grace is made to grow.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They are comforted; Job 33:25, 26, "His flesh 
    shall be fresher than a child's; he shall return to the days of his youth; 
    he shall pray unto God, and he shall be favorable unto him: and he shall see 
    his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness." All these 
    bands have a comforting and also a refreshing virtue. They bring the oil of 
    joy sooner or later to the soul. The way of the Physician in this is, 
    "According to your faith, so be it unto you." And thus the broken-hearted 
    eat of the hidden manna, they get the white stone, and in the stone a new 
    name written: Rev 2:17.</p>
<p align="justify">V. It now remains that we make some improvement of this 
    subject—It may be improved in uses of information, reproof, consolation, and 
    exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">First, In a use of information.</p>
<p align="justify">1. This shows us the lore and good-will of God to help 
    poor sinners, especially broken-hearted ones. He has provided a glorious 
    Physician for them, having remembered us in our low estate. O the love of 
    the Father in investing his Son with this office! O the lore of the Son in 
    undertaking it! Especially considering what it behooved him to undergo, in 
    order to provide the medicines: his own heart had to be broken, that sinners 
    might be healed. We may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The preciousness of our souls, and with all the 
    desperateness of the diseases of sin. Surely it behaved to be a desperate 
    disease, and the patient at the same time very precious in the Lord's sight, 
    for which he employed such a Physician. A physician of less value than an 
    incarnate God, would have been a physician of no value for a broken-hearted 
    sinner. No medicine less than his blood could have been effectual, else the 
    Savior's heart had never been broken for blood to cure it.—We may see,</p>
<p align="justify">3. To whom we must go with our hard hearts. O the 
    reigning plague of hardness of heart this day among all ranks! Ordinances, 
    providences, mercies, judgments, cannot break them. Alas! there is little 
    occasion to speak to broken-hearted sinners this day; it is the least part 
    of our work, to get their hearts healed. We cannot go with whole hearts, as 
    broken. What can we do with them? Carry them to Christ. He who can heal 
    broken hearts, can surely break whole hearts. He is exalted a Prince and a 
    Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins, Acts 5:30. A 
    look of him would do what nothing else can do. When the Lord Jesus looked on 
    Peter, then Peter remembered his sins, and went out, and wept bitterly; Luke 
    22:62. We shall improve this subject,</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, In a use of reproof.—This doctrine reproves and 
    condemns,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those who, when their hearts are any way broken for 
    sin, go not to Christ, but to physicians of no value; Hosea 5:13, "When 
    Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the 
    Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of 
    your wound." The Spirit of the Lord is at work with the hearts of many to 
    break them for sin, who mar all by their haste to be healed, which carries 
    them to other physicians than Christ, who may palliate the disease, but 
    never can effectually cure it. These are, the law, which is now weak through 
    the flesh; Romans 8:3. The law may wound the soul, but can never heal it; 
    Romans 3:20, "By the deeds of the law shall no flesh living be justified in 
    his sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Yet many go to it for 
    healing, namely, when they go about to pacify their consciences, not by a 
    believing application and sprinkling of Christ's blood, but by their own 
    prayers, vows, repentance, amendment of their ways, and the like. The law 
    indeed may give them a palliative; by these things their consciences may be 
    blinded and bribed, but the disease is still rooted in them, and will break 
    forth again at last, when there is no remedy, if not sooner by the mercy of 
    God, to prevent their final ruin.—Throng of worldly business. When Cain's 
    heart was wounded, and he could not get out the sting which galled his 
    conscience, he went to this physician, he went from the presence of the 
    Lord, and built a city; Genesis 4:16, 17. To this many ran at this day, who, 
    when their consciences begin to stir within them, fill their heads and hands 
    with business, until they get conscience quiet. This palliates the disease 
    by way of diversion, while it will make it only like a gathered dam, which 
    will at length break down the wall, and overwhelm the soul with aggravated 
    sorrows; Isaiah 30:13, "Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach 
    ready to fall, swelling out on a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly at 
    an instant."—Jovial company. So Saul, in his distress of mind, instead of 
    calling for his Bible to read on, calls for musicians to play to him. And it 
    is not to be doubted, that many a man's convictions are drowned in the 
    ale-house, hushed to silence at reveling-meetings, these supports of the 
    devil's kingdom people are so fond of; and many good motions are spoiled and 
    laughed away. This palliates the disease by searing the conscience, and 
    making it senseless. But it will awaken again on them like a lion roused up, 
    and rend the caul of those hearts which have been so healed; Hosea 13:6, 8. 
    This doctrine reproves,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those who offer themselves physicians to the broken in 
    heart, in opposition to Christ and his method of cure. There are such agents 
    for the devil, who, like the Pharisees, will neither enter in themselves, 
    nor suffer those who would to enter. Like Elymas the sorcerer, they seek to 
    turn away men from the faith; Acts 13:8. They no sooner discern any 
    beginning of seriousness in others, but they set themselves to crush it in 
    the bud by their wicked advices, mockings, taunts, and licentious ensnaring 
    examples. To these I may say, as in Acts 13:10, "O fall of all subtlety and 
    all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will 
    you not cease to pervert the right way of the Lord?" The blood of the souls 
    of such as perish by these means will lie at the door of such persons, and 
    be required of them.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Those are reproved, who, as their duty is, dare 
    not go to these physicians of no value, yet do not come to Christ, which is 
    their sin; Psalm 77:2, "My soul, refused to be comforted." It is unbelief 
    which makes it so, and Satan will do what he can to carry it on, to deter 
    the sinner from the great Physician. But has the Father accepted Christ a 
    physician for broken-hearted sinners? Surely, then, they may come, and 
    welcome; nay, they must come, or else they will never be healed. We shall 
    now improve the subject,</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, In a use of comfort to those who are truly 
    brokenhearted for sin in a gospel-sense. You have an able Physician, who 
    both can and will cure you, even though Satan may be ready to tell you that 
    your case is past cure. There is great ground of comfort for such.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Your name is in Christ's commission.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) You know your disease, and this is a comfortable 
    step to the cure.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Never any died of your disease: Psalm 147:3, "He 
    heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds."—Here, however, may be 
    proposed this</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION, My heart has been long broken for sin, and yet 
    there is no appearance of being healed; Jeremiah 14:19, "Have you utterly 
    rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you smitten us, and 
    there is no healing for us? we have looked for peace, and there is no good, 
    and for the time of healing, and behold trouble." To this I</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER, Your soul may be healed of the disease of sin, 
    and your guilt removed, even the power of sin may be broken, though your 
    trouble does remain. David's sin was put away; 2 Samuel 12:13. yet he cries 
    out of broken bones; Psalm 51:8. I would advise you to wait patiently on the 
    great Physician, and in due time he will bind you up. Limit him not to times 
    and seasons, which are in his own hand; he best knows how to manage his 
    patients. Some he keeps long in trouble, to prevent pride and security, into 
    which they are apt to fall: others he soon cures, to prevent despair or 
    utter despondency, to which they are most liable. It only remains that this 
    subject be improved,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In a use of exhortation. This shall be addressed 
    to three sorts of persons.</p>
<p align="justify">I would exhort whole and hard-hearted sinners to labor to 
    get broken hearts, hearts kindly broken for sin. To prevail with you in 
    complying with this exhortation, I offer the following MOTIVES—</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 1. Consider the evil that there is in hardness of 
    heart. It is very displeasing in the sight of God. Jesus was grieved with 
    the hardness of men's hearts; Mark 3:5. It grieves his Spirit, and highly 
    provokes him, so that God is ever angry with the hardhearted sinner. Suppose 
    a man to be under never so great guilt, but his heart is broken on account 
    of it, God is not so displeased with him as with those who, whatever their 
    guilt be, are hard-hearted under it. It fences the heart against receiving 
    any benefit by the means of salvation. Until the hardness be removed, it 
    makes the heart proof against ordinances and providences; Psalm 95:8, 
    "Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of 
    temptation in the wilderness." Consider, as it is with the dead tree, even 
    in the spring, all labor is lost upon it; so is it with the hard-hearted 
    sinner. God speaks by his word and Spirit, by mercies and judgments; but 
    nothing makes impression on the hard heart, yes, the most softening means 
    leave it as they found it, or most probably in a worse state. It binds up 
    the heart from all gracious motions; Romans 2:4, 5, "Or Despise you the 
    riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing 
    that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? But, after your hardness 
    and impenitent heart, treasures up unto yourself wrath against the day of 
    wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." This hardness is an 
    iron band on the will, a stonyness in the heart, a hard freeze on the 
    affections, so that the sinner cannot repent, mourn, or turn from his evil 
    courses. It so nails him down in his wicked way, that he cannot move 
    God-ward, cannot relent of his folly, though his danger be clearly before 
    his eyes. In a word, it is the highway to be given up of God. Natural and 
    acquired hardness lead the way to judicial hardness: Romans 11:7, "The 
    election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded." When men harden their 
    hearts against reproofs and warnings, God many a time visits them with a 
    curse, so that they shall never after have power to relent and yield; Hosea 
    4:17, "Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone."</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 2. Consider the excellence of a broken heart. It is 
    very pleasing in the sight of God, and precious; Psalm 51:17, "The 
    sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, 
    you will not despise." He looks to such, while he overlooks others; Isaiah 
    66:2. He is near to them, while far from others; Psalm 34:18. It is the way 
    to get good of all the means of salvation; and it is the root of gracious 
    motions in the soul. However low they lie, God will take them up, and take 
    them in; Psalm 147:3, "He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their 
    wounds."</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 3. The hardest heart will break at length, if not in 
    a way of mercy, yet in a way of judgment; Proverbs 29:1, "He who, being 
    often reproved, hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that 
    without remedy." (Hebrews broken, and no healing.) Your sins are breaking to 
    the Spirit of God; Ezekiel 6:9. Assure yourself that the stone will roll 
    back on yourself sooner or later; if it do not kindly break you in a way of 
    repentance, it will grind you to powder in the way of wrath. To such we 
    would give the following directions briefly—</p>
<p align="justify">Believe the threatenings against sin, and apply them; 
    Jonah 3:5, "So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, 
    and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them." 
    This belief works fear, and fear works sorrow. And though this be but legal 
    humiliation, yet this is ordinarily a mean sanctified of God to bring 
    forward the elect sinner to Christ, as it was when Noah built the ark; 
    Hebrews 11:7. Ponder your manifold sins, on the one hand, and the rich 
    mercies with which you have been visited on the other. This is a proper mean 
    to bring the heart into a broken disposition; Romans 2:4," The goodness of 
    God leads to repentance." Believe and meditate on the sufferings of Christ 
    for sin. Look how he was broken for it in a way of suffering, until your 
    heart be broken for it in a way of repentance; Zechariah 12:10, (quoted 
    above).</p>
<p align="justify">We address ourselves, in the next place, to 
    broken-hearted sinners. To such we say, Come to Christ as a Physician for 
    binding up and healing your broken hearts. You have sufficient encouragement 
    to put your cases in his hand. It is a part of the work expressly put upon 
    him by the Father, to bind up your wounds.—He has a most tender sympathy for 
    such broken-hearted ones; Isaiah 63:9, "In all their affliction, he was 
    afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his 
    pity he redeemed them, and he bare them and carried them all the days of 
    old." Therefore let us improve this sympathy; Hebrews 4:15, 16, "For we have 
    not an high priest, who cannot be touched with the feeling of our 
    infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. 
    Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain 
    mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." He is very near to such, 
    even as dwelling under one roof with them for their welfare; Isaiah 57:15, 
    "For thus says the high and lofty One, that inhabits eternity, whose name is 
    holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a 
    contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to 
    revive the heart of the contrite ones."—There is a particular relation 
    between him as the Physician, and the broken-hearted as his proper patients; 
    and therefore he has a peculiar care of them; Ezekiel 34:15, 16," I will 
    feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord God; I will 
    seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and 
    will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; 
    but I will destroy the fat and the strong, I will feed them with judgment." 
    You see that he will handle the broken-hearted very tenderly; Isaiah 40:11, 
    "He shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather the lambs with his 
    arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with 
    young; chapter 42:3, "A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking 
    flax shall he not quench; he shall bring forth judgment unto truth."</p>
<p align="justify">In the last place, we would exhort those whose broken 
    hearts Christ has healed, to take heed to the preserving your restored 
    health. Indeed every one who seems to be healed, is not healed by the hand 
    of the true Physician; but if your hearts are now eased, and your wounds 
    bound up by the great Physician, you will know it by these three things. 1. 
    You will have an appetite for spiritual food; 1 Peter 2:2, 3, "As new-born 
    babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby; if so 
    be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious." When one begins to recover in 
    earnest, he recovers his appetite. But such a one, say we, is not well yet, 
    for he has no appetite; so you are not well if you do want the spiritual 
    hunger.—2. Your food will relish with you; Proverbs 27:7, "The full soul 
    loathes the honey-comb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet." 
    Many have their qualms of conscience which they get over, but still they 
    have no relish for spiritual things, but for the world and their lusts. Bat 
    if Christ has healed you, he has corrected your taste. Lastly, You will be 
    beginning to walk in the way of God. "I will run," says David, "in the way 
    of your commandments, when you shall enlarge my heart," Psalm 119:32. They 
    who return with the dog to the vomit, show that their disease is yet in its 
    strength, though they are not sensible of pain.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, if Christ has healed you, to perceive the health of 
    your souls, it is necessary for you to keep a good and regular diet. Beware 
    of these things which formerly cast you into soul-sickness. Peter went no 
    more back to the high priest's hall, nor Judah to Tamar; Genesis 38:26. Feed 
    there, and on these things which may tend to the soul's health. "Behold," 
    said Jesus to the impotent man he had healed," behold you are made whole; 
    sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you." And for this cause observe 
    your Physician's rules in all. things.—Walk circumspectly, take notice of 
    every step you make, as one who has had a broken limb healed; Isaiah 38:15, 
    "I shall go softly," said Hezekiah, "all my years, in the bitterness of my 
    soul." And beware of walking in the dark, of going forward there where you 
    cannot discern your way by the light of the Lord's word. Study to increase 
    in love to Christ, zeal for his glory, and hatred of Bin. Always keep 
    correspondence with your Physician. Be often at the throne of grace by 
    prayer, and keep up communion with him in the exercise of faith. "They who 
    wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with 
    wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and 
    not faint." Amen.</p>
