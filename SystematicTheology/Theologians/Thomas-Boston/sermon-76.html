    Isaiah 55:4, "Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader 
    and commander to the people."</p>
<p align="justify">IN the first verse of the chapter, there is a large offer 
    of grace, and a cordial invitation to all to improve the blessings of 
    salvation. In the second and third verses, the Lord expostulates with 
    sinners for their slighting this offer, and pursuing after other things. 
    Then the invitation itself is renewed, and backed with weighty motives. In 
    all this the Lord has a special respect to the Gentiles, who at that time 
    were strangers to the covenant of promise. In the text, there is a notable 
    ground of encouragement for sinners to come to Christ; the very scope of it 
    is to encourage them to come to him; it is as if God had said, Why are you 
    afraid to come? behold I have given him for that very end, to be a witness, 
    a leader, and a commander to the people. Therefore you may conclude, that he 
    must have a people to believe in him as a witness, follow him as a leader, 
    and obey him as a commander. Did ever any prince give any captain's 
    commission, but when he designed also he should have some under him as 
    soldiers?</p>
<p align="justify">In the text, we have a declaration of what God the Father 
    has done for poor sinners: and because it is an unequaled deed, it is 
    ushered in with a note of attention and admiration, "Behold I have given." 
    He has made a gift to sinners, a gift such as may supply all their wants.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider the giver; "I," that is, the Father, the 
    contriver and source of the sinner's salvation. None else could give such a 
    great gift, none else had power to make this gift. In regard of the giver, 
    then, it ought to be received with all due respect and gratitude.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider the gift, "him;" that is Christ, of whom 
    David was a type; John 3:16, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only 
    begotten Son." This is a gift suitable to the greatness of the giver. He 
    gives like a king, yes, like the King of kings: for his gift is unspeakably 
    and infinitely great.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Mark the conveyance of this noble gift: "I have given 
    him;" I have freely bestowed him. This was according to the covenant of 
    grace; he was not given against his will. No; his Father's will and his are 
    one, he gave himself also. The Father freely designed him for the work, and 
    he cheerfully accepted, saying, "Lo! I come."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Consider the end of this gift. For what purpose did 
    the Father give Christ? Why, it was to supply the needs of the people, both 
    the Jews and the Gentiles. But here the Gentiles seem to be especially aimed 
    at, verse 5, "Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not; and nations 
    that know not you shall run unto you." What sort of people these were, may 
    be learned in part from the ends for which Christ is given. He is given,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) For a witness, to testify the truth and to reveal 
    the mind and will of God to the people: John 18:37, "To this end," said 
    Jesus, "was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should 
    bear witness to the truth; every one that is of the truth he hears my 
    voice." Hence it follows, that they are an ignorant people that know not 
    God, nor the mysteries of salvation; the very people, that have lost their 
    eyes in Adam; an unbelieving people, who will not believe God, unless he 
    proves what he says by his witness.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) For a leader, to go before them as a prince and a 
    captain, as the word signifies, and so they are a people that have 
    difficulties to go through, and know not their way, and so stand in need of 
    a leader. He is given,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) For a commander, to give them laws and rules for 
    their obedience. This implies that they are an unruly people, who must have 
    one to keep them in order.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a "behold" prefixed to the text. This serves to 
    stir up attention and admiration. Let us consider and wonder, how graciously 
    and suitably the Lord has provided for us.—In this verse there is this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That the Father's giving of Christ to be a 
    witness, leader, and commander to sinners, is a matter worthy of deepest 
    consideration, and greatest admiration.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing on this subject, it is intended, by divine 
    aid,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show you some special steps of God's giving this 
    noble gift, Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To inquire for what this gift is so remarkable.</p>
<p align="justify">III. What we may behold in the Father's giving this gift. 
    And,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To conclude with a practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show you some special steps of God's giving this 
    noble gift, Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God made this gift before time, even from all 
    eternity, in respect of designation; the Lord designed him to be a witness, 
    leader, and commander to the people; from all eternity did God design to 
    bring many sons to glory; and therefore at that period also did he design 
    their captain for them. What is done in time is but the execution of eternal 
    decrees; eternal life was promised us in Christ Jesus before the world 
    began, Titus 1:2.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God gave him in the morning of time, in the first 
    promise: "The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent." When 
    Adam fell, and involved all his posterity in a lost condition, when he had 
    carried all of them out of the way of life, so that none of them could ever 
    know it again without a witness, nor walk in it without a guide, then God 
    promised this noble gift, to make up what Adam had lost, and to restore to 
    us what he had taken away.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the fullness of time, when be actually exhibited 
    this gift; when the word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us, "When the 
    fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made 
    under the law," Galatians 4:4.</p>
<p align="justify">Then was seen that great gift foretold by Moses and the 
    prophets, shadowed forth by the law, and looked for with earnest expectation 
    by the people of God. A time it was when he thus came, wherein the world lay 
    in deep spiritual darkness; the knowledge of the true God was almost totally 
    abolished among the Gentiles; they knew not God, and the true religion was 
    dreadfully corrupted among the Jews. The few that remained were wearied with 
    the burdensome ceremonies, that could not make the comers thereunto perfect, 
    and therefore looked for the mercy promised unto the fathers.</p>
<p align="justify">4. God gave this gift in the last time, when the gospel 
    was freely preached to all nations. Then it was, and ever since, that Christ 
    set up his standard in the world, to receive all, without distinction that 
    would fight under his banner. Thus God gave him in respect of the free 
    offer: "He is the gift of God," John 4:10.</p>
<p align="justify">5. He gives him, in particular, to every elect soul in 
    the time of love, the day of espousals. This is that blessed spot of the 
    believer's time, wherein they match with the Son of God, believe his word, 
    and give themselves up to his conduct. They thus receive the unspeakable 
    gift of God; and this is a crowning mercy indeed! Whoever thus by faith 
    receives this precious gift, shall receive him over again in the 
    marriage-day, that is, when time is over and gone. Then it shall be said, 
    "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him, for the marriage of the 
    Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready."—Let us,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Inquire for what this gift is so remarkable?</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is remarkable, for the hand from whence it came. It 
    was the Father that gave Christ; even he spared not his own Son, but 
    delivered him up for us all, Romans 8:32. If a gift be valuable for the sake 
    of the giver, then Christ is the most valuable gift, as given by the Father; 
    and therefore he who slights Christ, slights the Father also. The town-clerk 
    of Ephesus supposed that none could but know, that the Ephesians would be 
    zealous for the image of Diana, because it was supposed to have fallen down 
    from Jupiter, Acts 19:35; ten thousand times better reason have we most 
    highly to esteem our Lord Jesus, because we have the most infallible 
    assurance, that he came down from God, the Father of mercies," My Father 
    (said Jesus), gives you the true bread from Heaven," John 6:32.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is remarkable for the persons to whom it is given. 
    Who are they? they are men, and not angels, sinners and not saints: "God 
    commends his love towards us, in that while we were sinners, Christ died for 
    us," Romans 5:8, "Yes, in due time he died for the ungodly." Men that give 
    gifts, usually give them to their friends, but God gave even his unspeakable 
    gift to his enemies; men gave to the rich, but God gave to the poor; he gave 
    this gift to them that had misspent the gifts bestowed upon them at their 
    creation. O let us set a mark here, and say, "Behold what manner of love the 
    Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God!" 1 
    John 3:1.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is remarkable for the seasonableness of it. God not 
    only gave his Son, but he gave him in proper season; as it was with Abraham, 
    for whom God provided a ram to be offered in the stead of his only son 
    Isaac, who was already bound on the altar; so, when the sinner's neck was on 
    the block, when divine justice had a sure hold of him, and was about to 
    strike the fatal blow, then did God provide, and give Jesus to be a 
    sacrifice in our stead. O what a surprise, as well as a comfort, was the 
    promise of him to poor Adam! and O how welcome to us should be this faithful 
    saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that God sent even his own Son, "to 
    seek and to save that which was lost."</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is remarkable for the suitableness of it. 
    Unsuitable gifts are not much esteemed. What though a man would give a purse 
    fall of gold to one starving for want of bread, or present plenty of food to 
    a person just dying of an incurable disease? Such unsuitable gifts could be 
    of no use to these persons; but Christ is every way suitable to the sinner's 
    case: "Wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God 
    through him; because he ever lives to make intercession for us." For such an 
    High-priest became us, who was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from 
    sinners, and made higher than the heavens." The balsam of his blood exactly 
    answers our wounds in breadth and length; it cleanses from all sin, and 
    purges the conscience from dead works. It was contrived by infinite wisdom 
    for this purpose, and every sinner whose eyes are opened at once sees his 
    suitableness; for Christ is "the power of God, and the wisdom of God," 1 
    Corinthians 1:24.</p>
<p align="justify">5. This gift is remarkable, for the necessity of it: Acts 
    4:12, "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name 
    under Heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved." What would the 
    world have been without Christ but a dungeon of darkness, a pit of horror, a 
    prison of misery and despair? Had we only heard God thundering on Mount 
    Sinai, and not God groaning on Calvary, then we had made the rocks rent, and 
    the hills resound with our desperate outcries. No man, no angel, was able to 
    help; nothing but the blood of God could expiate our guilt.</p>
<p align="justify">6. It is remarkable for the greatness of it. It is a gift 
    without a parallel in Heaven or in earth: "God so loved the world, that he 
    gave his only-begotten Son," John 3:16. A greater gift than this Heaven 
    could not give, and earth could not receive. The salvation is great, but the 
    Savior, the person who wrought out this salvation, must be greater. Many 
    rich and blessed gifts God gives his people, but they are all little when 
    compared with this great gift, for along with it he freely gives us all 
    things. When God resolved to display and communicate his goodness, his 
    wisdom, power and bounty, he made a world out of nothing; but when he 
    resolved to manifest his love, and discover all his glory, he gives us to 
    view it in the face and person of Jesus. The Sabbath was appointed for 
    celebrating the praises of God for the work of creation; but in addition to 
    this, eternity is destined to celebrate the praises of the riches of his 
    grace and glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">7. This gift is remarkable, for the freedom of it.—Christ 
    is a gift every way free. There is a cluster of wonders in the freedom of 
    it.—These we shall in part take notice. This gift is given,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To the undeserving. We deserve no good at the hand 
    of the Lord, much less the greatest good; we cannot challenge a drop of 
    water by merit, much less Christ and his grace; so that God cannot wrong us, 
    whatever he deny us. It is given,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To the ill-deserving; to them who deserved death and 
    damnation; who were justly lying under the curse of the first covenant, and 
    whose demerit would have sunk them to Hell. Yes, this gift is given,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) To them that were not seeking it: "I am sought (says 
    God) of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I 
    said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that were not called by my name." 
    Christ can say of all his people, "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen 
    you." The Father presses the gift of his Son upon poor sinners, even when 
    they are feeding on husks, and not seeking after him, saying, "Wherefore do 
    you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which 
    satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that which is good, 
    and let your soul delight itself in fatness," Isaiah 55:2. It is given,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) To them that were not expecting it, or looking for 
    any such gift at his hand. How was Zacchaeus surprised when Jesus said unto 
    him, "This day is salvation come to your house," Luke 19:9.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Yes, it is still offered to them who have often 
    refused it, who have been frequently bidden to the marriage-supper, and have 
    as often refused to come: "You will not come to me, (says Jesus), that you 
    might have life;" but yet still does he say, "Why will you die, O house of 
    Israel?"</p>
<p align="justify">8. This gift is remarkable for the unchangeableness of 
    it. All the spiritual gifts and callings of God are without repentance; but 
    above all it is so with Jesus, his great and unspeakable gift. Where he once 
    comes, he never afterwards goes away. There is a strict bond of union 
    between Christ and the soul, which death itself cannot dissolve; yes, "there 
    is nothing that can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ 
    Jesus." If the soul cannot keep fast hold of Christ, Christ will keep fast 
    hold of it: "I know my sheep (says Jesus), and they follow me; and I give 
    unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall any man 
    pluck them out of my hand," John 10:27, 28. If the hand of faith be weak, he 
    can strengthen it; and the Spirit of God does not faint or grow weary. The 
    term of the union between Christ and believers is during life eternal.—Let 
    us,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Inquire what we may behold in the Father's giving 
    this gift. Much, much indeed, may we here behold, that merits our attention, 
    admiration, gratitude and love. But at present, time only permits me simply 
    to mention a particular or two.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In this gift we may see our own needs. If our 
    necessity had not been very great and urgent indeed, God would not have 
    given his own Son, to be a witness, leader, and commander to us; had not our 
    misery been great, and also beyond the power of men and angels to deliver 
    from it, God would not have provided and given such a ransom for us. This at 
    once shows our misery to have been so great, that none but Jesus could 
    deliver us from going down to the pit. The divine excellence and infinite 
    value of the remedy, clearly demonstrate the absolute necessity on our part 
    of such a cure.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In this gift we may see infinite love. What but love, 
    love eternal, and boundless grace, could have induced God the Father to have 
    given his own well-beloved Son, even to die in the room of such creatures as 
    we are? Instead of merit, we had the very greatest demerit; and God was 
    under no obligations to give us such a gift; his own love, then, was the 
    source. In the gift itself, we have the greatest display of love ever made 
    to any of the creatures of God; the greatness of it the heart cannot 
    conceive, nor the tongue express; the greatness of it will through eternity 
    excite the admiration, gratitude, and love of angels and men.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In this gift, we have to contemplate a glorious design 
    of doing good to sinners. All the gifts of God are intended for our good; 
    but as this is the greatest of them all, yes, infinitely greater than them 
    all taken together, so the good evidently intended by it is also exceeding 
    great; yes, it bears a proportion to the infinite value of the gift itself. 
    When we consider the divine dignity of the person sent, and his near 
    relation to the Father, when we consider the greatness of the work his 
    Father gave him to do, and the tremendously dreadful sufferings which he 
    appointed him to endure, we may at once conclude, that the good thereby 
    intended for sinners was so great, as to be worthy of the wisdom and 
    goodness of the person who sent him, and worthy also of the Son of God to 
    accomplish. This was nothing else than eternal life: Jesus, "the Captain of 
    our salvation, was made perfect through sufferings, that he might bring many 
    sons to glory."</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Let us now conclude with a practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">My friends, when God makes offer of this gift to you, 
    slight it not, but receive it gratefully; accept of Christ as he is offered 
    in the gospel. When Christ on the cross saw his mother standing by the 
    disciple whom he loved, he said unto her, "Woman, behold your Son!" then to 
    the disciple, "Behold your mother!" and from that hour that disciple took 
    her unto his own home. So does God address you, saying to each of us, Behold 
    my Son Christ, and take him home into your hearts.—For motives to this 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That Christ is a leading gift. Wherever he comes, be 
    never comes alone, he brings a train of blessings along with him, even all 
    the blessings of the everlasting covenant; for in him all the promises are 
    yes and amen. Receive him, and you shall have a complete and everlasting 
    righteousness with him, reconciliation and peace with God, pardon of sin, 
    sonship to God, an inheritance among them that are sanctified, and, finally, 
    a right to all things. If you receive him all things are yours: "Whether 
    Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things 
    present, or things to come; all are yours: and you are Christ's, and Christ 
    is God's," 1 Corinthians 3:21–23.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He is a soul-satisfying gift, in the enjoyment of 
    which your souls may rest. Are you not seeking satisfaction, and pursuing 
    after happiness? but "why do you seek the living among the dead?" Why do you 
    suck the dry breasts of the world, and the impure fountains of your own 
    lusts, that cannot satisfy? Isaiah 55:2. Nothing but an infinite good can 
    satisfy the desires of the human soul, and here it is. Here in Christ, like 
    Habakkuk, you may find a source of joy and strength, when all other comforts 
    fail. As nothing but the mother's breast can satisfy the hungry infant, so 
    nothing but Christ can satisfy your souls aright: "Whoever drinks of the 
    water (says Jesus) that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water 
    that I shall give him shall be in him a well of living water, springing up 
    into everlasting life," John 4:14.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He gave himself to the death, that he might be a gift 
    suitable to your necessities. He is that bread that the Father gave from 
    Heaven; bread that was ground between the mill-stones, and baked in the oven 
    of God's wrath, that be might be bread to you.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Do you not need, positively need him? Can you be happy 
    without a pardon, peace with God, a righteousness, and an everlasting 
    inheritance? Now, there is no possible way of obtaining these, but by him. 
    O! my fellow-sinners, how can you live or die without him? Sure your own 
    necessities have a loud cry to you not to slight him; your souls, pining 
    away in sin, cry, O slight not a Savior! your souls, truly sick, cry, O 
    slight not the physician!</p>
<p align="justify">5. Consider, he is in your offer; you may have him if you 
    will. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that hears, say Come; 
    and let him that is athirst come; and whoever will, let him take the water 
    of life freely." You see there is nothing to hinder your receiving him: for 
    the Father is willing to give his Son to you, and the Son is willing to give 
    himself, the Spirit is willing: "All things are ready, come you to the 
    marriage." Nay, it is not merely a simple offer, but a command: "This is the 
    command of God, that you believe on his Son." Therefore under the pain of 
    God's eternal displeasure, accept of him: "He who believes shall be saved, 
    he who believes not shall be damned.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Consider, he will not always be in your offer. When 
    once the Master has risen up, and shut the doors, you may knock in vain, 
    there will be no more entrance. Thus you may be taken from the offer, or it 
    from you; now, then, is the accepted time, and now is the day of salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider if you receive him not, you are lost 
    forever; and then it will be more tolerable for them that never heard of 
    him, than for you:</p>
<p align="justify">"If he who despised Moses' law died without mercy, under 
    two or three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he 
    be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has 
    counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy 
    thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of God?" For we know him that 
    has said, "Vengeance belongs unto me, and I will repay, says the Lord," 
    Hebrews 10:28–30.</p>
<p align="justify">My fellow-sinners, will you now take this gift from 
    Heaven? I am sure there would not need to be so much work to make you 
    receive a gift that is not worthy once to be named with this: if you will 
    not take it, what have you to say for yourselves? Perhaps the reasons why 
    some will not receive this gift may be easily found out; as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Some will not, because they need it not; like Esau, in 
    another case, they may be ready to say, "I have enough, my brother, keep 
    that you have unto yourself," Genesis 33:9. Alas! many are full, are rich, 
    and reign as kings without Christ; but, O! would to God they were rich, and 
    did reign. Such persons only reign like Saul, when God departed from him. 
    Sure am I, that if there be a soul under Heaven needs Christ, it is such a 
    person. They who, like the Laodiceans, are rich and increased with goods, 
    and have need of nothing, and know not that they are wretched, and 
    miserable, and poor, blind, and naked, O how much need had they to listen to 
    the counsel of Jesus, and buy of him gold tried in the fire, that they may 
    be rich; for what have you without Christ, but has God's curse in it? all 
    your gifts are cursed to you, Malachi 2:2, "I will even," says God, "send a 
    curse upon you, and will curse your blessings, yes, I have cursed them 
    already," because you do not lay it to heart.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Others will not, because they have not room for it; 
    many have no room for Christ; their hearts and affections are otherwise 
    taken up. But, O! what takes up that room? what guests do you lodge in your 
    hearts, that the Son of God cannot have access? If you have not room, will 
    you make room? Tell him you are content to take him, and invite him to make 
    room for himself, and he will do it. He is able to cast out your idols, and 
    to pull down the strong-holds of sin and Satan that are in your hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Some will not, because they like not the onerous cause 
    of the gift. There are many that cannot digest what is required of them who 
    belong to Christ: "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, 
    take up his cross, and follow me." They could take the crown, but they 
    cannot away with the cross, or the hard service. Such are to be pitied, for 
    they are led aside by mistakes; if Christ was in your hearts, his service 
    would be your choice, and you would glory in his cross.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Many will not, because they have no will to come under 
    the obligation of a gift. Thus it was with the Jews; going about to 
    establish their own righteousness, they submitted not themselves to the 
    righteousness of God. This pride of heart lies often veiled under the show 
    of humility, when all the while the soul refuses to come to Christ, because 
    of unwillingness. Well, you must either be obliged to Christ for your 
    salvation, or perish; for do what you will, or suffer what you will, if 
    Christ be not yours, you perish.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Not a few will not, because they think, though it 
    may do good to others, yet it can do none to them. Who knows but this may be 
    the temptation of some! this is the poisonous breath of monstrous unbelief, 
    that at once flies in the face of God's truth, making him a liar, 1 John 
    5:10; and in the face of his wisdom, as if he had provided an unsuitable 
    remedy. Sinner, who ever perished in the hands of Jesus? and O what 
    desperate cases has he cured! But do you object there was never the like of 
    yours? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Then you will glorify Christ the more, if you 
    will venture yourself in his hand. Many wonderful precedents have you as 
    proofs of his ability. Venture yourselves then in his hand, "for he is able 
    to save to the uttermost all that come to God through him, seeing he ever 
    lives to make intercession for us." Amen.</p>
