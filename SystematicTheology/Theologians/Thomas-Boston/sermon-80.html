          LUKE 14:22 "And yet there is room."<br />
          <br />
          IN the first part of this verse, the servant reports that he had
          obeyed his master's second order, and that many had complied with the
          invitation. But though these had come in, he adds, and yet there is
          room. In Christ's house, there is much empty room for more guests.
          This is a comfortable word for those who have not yet complied with
          the invitations of the gospel; the doors are not yet shut, and such
          sinners may yet have access to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord has often covered a table for us in the gospel, and no doubt
          some have answered the gospel call, and by faith sit down at the
          gospel feast. But while some have risen up at God's call, have not
          many sat still? While some have gone to the marriage, have not many
          stayed in the tents of sin; when some have been pursuing the interest
          of their souls, others have been minding nothing, but the world and
          their lusts. We come yet to you, O slighters of Christ, with the glad
          news that yet there is room. We are allowed doctrinally to open the
          doors of Christ's house to you, and invite you all to come in; being
          not without apprehensions that the peaceable and ordinary dispensation
          of the gospel among us, may be drawing near an end. Sinners out of
          Christ are out of God's favor, covenant, and family. Slighters of
          Christ have refused the privilege, but yet there is room or place for
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine. For those who have not yet embraced and closed with Christ
          in the offer of the gospel, yet there is room.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are three very different voices sounding this day, in the ears
          of rational creatures out of Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The fallen angels hear a dreadful voice, that there never was, is,
          nor shall be, room for them. They sinned, but no Mediator was ever
          provided for them. They were the first who ventured to break over the
          hedge of the law, and God made them dreadful instances of his justice
          and severity. "The angels which kept not their first estate, but left
          their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains, under
          darkness, unto the judgment of the great day." Their chains you see
          are everlasting, their prison darkness; and nothing awaits them but
          judgment. They left their habitation, and there is no room for them
          any more. They see a feast is provided, but they know they shall never
          taste of it, but stand gnashing their teeth at distinguishing grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Damned sinners hear another voice, namely, That there was once room
          for them, but there shall be room no more forever. "The master of the
          house has risen up, and has shut to the door." They had their day, but
          in their day, they knew not the things which belonged to their peace,
          and now they are hidden from their eyes. Those with whom they sat in
          the same church, and heard the same gospel, are now in Heaven: but now
          all they can hear is, There was room. And while there was room for
          them, they only sought after the world, and their lusts: but now the
          door is shut upon them, and that there was room, gnaws, and will gnaw,
          their conscience forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You hear this day a blessed joyful voice, Yet there is room.
          Sinners! you are standing without, you have hitherto slighted Christ.
          But the door is not yet shut on you. What is wrong may be rectified.
          Yet there is room.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing upon this subject. I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Inquire for what there is yet room.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. Where there is yet room.</p>
        <p align="justify">III. Confirm the doctrine. We are then,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To inquire for what there is yet room. Sinners, yet there is room.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. For your retracting your refusal of Christ, and his salvation, for
          your taking your word again. Christ has been offered to you, but many
          of you have said in effect, We will not have this man to reign over
          us. You would have none of him. Now if he should take you at your
          word, you are ruined without remedy. Should he pass that sentence "I
          say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of
          my supper." Then there is no more hope forever. He might have dealt
          thus with you, yes, he might have dealt with you as with Ananias and
          Sapphira. But yet there is room. Take your word again; and if yet you
          will consent to take Christ, you shall have him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is yet room for your subscribing the covenant. God in Christ
          has sent down an open copy of the covenant of grace among us, and sent
          his ministers to gather subscriptions to it, by which souls may be
          entered into the covenant. Many have set their names to it. "O my
          soul, says David, you have said unto the Lord, you are my Lord. And
          gather, says God, my saints together unto me; those that have made a
          covenant with me by sacrifice." But after all, yet there is room. "One
          shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by the name
          of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand, unto the Lord,
          and surname himself by the name of Israel." God is yet saying to you,
          "I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies
          of David." Believe this word with application to yourselves. Embrace
          the covenant, for yet there is room.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is room for repentance. You have been fools and madmen,
          working out your own ruin without fear or trembling. You have done
          what will destroy yourselves, if it be not undone again. Yet there is
          room for repentance. There was room for it in the first covenant, it
          was a piece of work, which once marred would never put right again.
          There is no room for it in Hell. But here there is room. Esau despised
          the birth-right, and there was room for repentance to him. But yet the
          voice of the Lord to you is, after all that you have done, "Repent and
          turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be
          your ruin." Though it be the eleventh hour with some of you, yet there
          is room.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, There is room for you, the worst of you, may yet come in,
          "Whoever will let him take of the water of life freely." And again,
          "Behold, says Jesus, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my
          voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup with him,
          and he with me." Despisers and rejectors of Christ, he yet calls you.
          He has no need of you nor me, but his house is not yet filled, and it
          must be filled, and yet there is room. "All that the Father gives me,
          says he, shall come to me; and him that comes to me, I will in nowise
          cast out." Many has he taken in, who were among the worst, and he has
          room for more even of that kind. "Go, says he to his servants, into
          the highways, and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house
          may be filled." We proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. To show where there is room. There is room,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In the door for you, that you may enter in by it. Jesus Christ
          himself is the door. "I am, says he, the door, by me if any man enter
          in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture." He
          is willing to receive you. The door is opened in the offer of the
          gospel. It is wide opened, so as the worst of sinners are declared
          capable of access to the Father, coming by him. "And such, says Paul
          to the Corinthians, were some of you," even the worst of sinners, "But
          you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the
          name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." But without
          Jesus Christ there is no access. "I am, says he, the way, the truth,
          and the life, no man comes unto the Father but by me." It is true in
          these days in which the doctrine of the gospel is sinking, the door is
          opened by some, only so far as to let in those that are so and so
          qualified, as if men behooved to be half cured before they may come to
          the physician. But God's word sets it wide open. "God so loved the
          world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him
          should not perish but have everlasting life. And the Spirit and the
          bride say come. And let him that hears say, come. And let him that is
          athirst come. And whoever will, let him take of the water of life
          freely." Thus you see the Word of God sets the door wide open to let
          in all who will enter, be their case what it will. Enter then, O
          sinner, no angel with a flaming sword stands here to guard the tree of
          life. The partition wall is broken down, strangers are welcome to come
          within the holy ground. Christ is the door. Let not the brightness of
          his face so terrify you, nor the divine glory so affright you, as to
          make you stand back from him, for the divinity is veiled with
          humanity, that sinners may see God and not die. "Having therefore
          boldness, brethren, to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
          By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us through the
          veil, that is to say, his flesh."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is room in the house for you. Christ's house is not yet
          filled. If it were so, the door would be shut. Sinners you are
          without, wandering up and down on the mountains of vanity, a ready
          prey to the devouring lion. Why will you not come in, where you may be
          safe? There is room enough for you in our Father's house, and all who
          are in it, have bread enough and to spare, why then will you perish?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is room for you in the lower house. There are two great families
          on earth. Christ's family, and the devil's family. We are born members
          of the devil's family, but Christ is willing to take you into his,
          yes, he invites you into it. "Wherefore, come out from among them, and
          be you separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I
          will receive you. And I will be a Father unto you, and you shall be my
          sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. Hearken, O daughter, and
          consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, and your
          father's house." You that are standing at the foot of mount Sinai,
          within the dominion of the law, as a covenant of works, you are
          welcome to mount Zion, the city of the living God, to an innumerable
          company of angels, the general assembly of the church of the
          first-born; where, though you be under the discipline of the family,
          you shall be beyond the reach of the curse. There is room for you here
          in the quality of servants. He is saying unto you, "Why stand you here
          all the day idle? Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is
          right, that shall you receive." Our Lord is saying to you once more,
          "Choose you this day whom you will serve?" Christ or your lusts? He
          has no need of you, nor your service. He has thousands of angels to
          minister unto him, yet he has left room for you to be taken in among
          the number of his servants. And can you choose such a glorious, yes,
          such a gracious Master? He binds his service on believers with the
          cords of love, first gives them a title to the eternal reward, and
          then bids them work, and even the rods laid on them, remove not his
          free love, Psalm 89:23. and downwards.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is room for you as friends, which is yet more. "Henceforth, says
          he, I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his Lord
          does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard
          of my Father, I have made known unto you." It is no small matter to be
          a friend of the house. But yet there is room for you to be Christ's
          bosom friends, though before enemies. Friends to whom he will
          communicate his secrets. "The secret of the Lord is with them that
          fear him; and he will show them his covenant." He is a friend that can
          do you good, when all other friends are helpless to you, even at a
          dying hour; your friends in the world may then close your eyes,
          prepare the cold winding sheet, get the grave ready, but he can carry
          your soul to God the Judge, and present you blameless before him in
          the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is room for you, as sons and daughters, to be children of the
          house. "I will be a Father unto you, and you shall be my sons and
          daughters, says the Lord Almighty." He has many children, a numerous,
          a powerful seed, a mighty offspring, the fruit of the travail of his
          soul; and has made a glorious appearance with them already before his
          Father, saying, Behold, I and the children which you have given me.
          Yet there is room for more. Adopting grace is not yet exhausted. The
          inheritance is large, there is enough for all that will come to him.
          He will not quarrel your extraction, though base, nor the wretched
          condition in which he finds you, if you will but now come in, Ezekiel
          16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You may be received in the quality of the spouse of Christ. He says to
          you, "All things are ready, come you to the marriage." The everlasting
          marriage covenant is proposed to you. If you be willing to match with
          him, he is willing to match with you. Believe the promise of the
          gospel with particular application to yourselves. Say amen to the
          covenant, and he is yours and you are his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is room for you in the upper house. The veil is rent in twain,
          and there is access for you into the holiest of all. Christ has opened
          Heaven to us, which Adam's sin bolted against us; and good news, In
          Christ's Father's house there are many mansions, and he is there
          employed in preparing a place for you. If you will come to Christ, You
          shall be pillars in the temple of God, and go no more out. It is a
          holy place where no unclean thing can enter, but he will make you meet
          for it by the sanctification of his Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is room for you at the table. Christ's table is well
          furnished, even the table of gospel ordinances in this lower world.
          "And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people, a
          feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees; of fat things, full
          of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined." There are many
          excellent dishes on it. Peace, pardon, joy in the Holy Spirit, even
          all the benefits of the everlasting covenant. Whatever is suitable to
          your case. Gold tried in the fire, to enrich you, white clothing to
          clothe and adorn you, and eye salve, to anoint your eyes that you may
          see. And at this table there is abundance of room. "Ho every one that
          thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has no money: come you,
          and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk, without money, and without
          price."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. There is room for you in the heart of the Master of the feast. Why
          does he call you, if it were not so. "In the last day, that great day
          of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, if any man thirst, let him come
          unto me and drink." Set but your face homeward, and the Father's
          affections will yearn towards the returning prodigal, he will meet you
          by the way. Why were Christ's arms stretched out on the cross but to
          embrace you, and his side pierced; but to show that there was room in
          his heart for you. We are now to proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. To confirm the doctrine. Consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The mercy of God lying open to sinners through Christ. "God is in
          Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
          trespasses unto them." I say then through Christ, for God out of
          Christ is a consuming fire to sinners, as so much dry stubble, Hebrews
          12 last. This is seen in devils and reprobates that reject Christ. But
          coming to God through him, you will find a fountain of mercy
          overflowing. Mercy is one of the great letters of God's name. "He is
          the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and
          abundant in goodness and truth. Keeping mercy for thousands." If
          misery be with you, mercy is with him. "Let Israel hope in the Lord;
          for with the Lord there is mercy." Are your sins many, well he is "not
          only merciful and gracious, but he is plenteous in mercy." There is a
          multitude of mercies with him. He delights in mercy. It is a pleasure
          to him to show mercy to the miserable. If a little mercy will not
          serve your purpose, then one mercy shall be added to another. For God
          has said, mercy shall be built up forever. Have your sins in effect
          carried you down to the lowest Hell, mercy will bring you up again.
          "For great is your mercy toward me, says David, and you have delivered
          my soul from the lowest Hell." Do your sins reach the clouds, God's
          mercy is above them, for it is in the heavens.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider the sufferings of Christ to procure room for sinners,
          Hebrews 10:19–22. The first Adam forfeited our room in God's favor,
          but the second Adam by his death has made room again for those who
          were thrust out. And here cast your eyes upon the following things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The quality of the person that suffered. The divine nature in the
          person of the Son, was united to the human nature, and so the blood
          shed for the redemption of sinners was the blood of God. "To feed,
          says the apostle, the church of God, which he has purchased with his
          own blood." In these our unhappy days, in which there appears a
          conspiracy against our glorious Redeemer, and the doctrine of the
          gospel is a going and entering into a cloud of darkness, not only is
          the purchase of Christ for his people much dishonored, but the
          foundation of Christianity is struck at, in denying the supreme
          Godhead of the Son and his equality with the Father, which has been at
          length followed with monstrous blasphemies, and blasphemous practices
          against the ever blessed Trinity. But Woe, Woe, to mankind sinners, if
          Christ be not supreme God. The saints are yet in their sins, their
          faith and hope and all is vain, razed from the foundation. For then
          his sufferings not being of infinite value, cannot equal the offence
          done to an infinite God. But know assuredly, sinners, that yet there
          is room, upon the account of Christ's sufferings, for he is the
          Father's fellow, Zechariah 13:7. the Father's equal, Philip. 2:6. "He
          is Jehovah, as for our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the
          holy one of Israel. And this is his name, whereby he shall be called
          the Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The nature of his sufferings. They were of various kinds. He
          suffered in his good name, in all his offices, in his body and in his
          soul. He bare the curse. "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the
          law, being made a curse for us." He endured the wrath of his Father in
          our stead. Under this, "He was poured out like water, and all his
          bones were out of joint; his heart was like wax, it was melted in the
          midst of his affections." He met with no indulgence. God spared not
          his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. He answered all the
          demands of justice, and the law, in favor of elect sinners. Now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The end of his sufferings, was to make room for sinners in God's
          favor. To redeem a forfeited Heaven, and to bring back to God those
          who were expelled his house in the loins of Adam their father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now finally, For these great purposes, his sufferings were fully
          efficacious. "The blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses from all
          sin. And this blood purges our conscience from dead works to serve the
          living God." However deep the guilt and stain of our sins be, the
          blood of Christ is able to take it away, as an ocean poured upon a
          house on fire would quench it instantly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Consider that the holy scriptures plainly hold forth Christ to be
          an able and willing Savior. "His name is Jesus, because he saves his
          people from their sins. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
          uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make
          intercession for them. For such an high priest became us; who is holy,
          harmless, and undefiled, and separate from sinners, and made higher
          than the heavens." He complains that sinners will not come to him,
          that he might save them. "You will not come to me that you might have
          life." He is lifted up on the pole of the gospel, that sinners may
          look to him and be saved: And the command is, "look unto me, and be
          saved, all you ends of the earth." Jesus is the rose of Sharon, the
          rose of the field to which every one may have access. There are in him
          waters for washing the most polluted, and every one that thirsts is
          invited to come to these waters. There are in him streams of water to
          refresh and fructify the desert and the wilderness. If the streams may
          be thought capable of drying up, there is in him a fountain, open and
          free, A fountain for sin and impurity. If that be too little there are
          rivers; for the man Jesus, Shall be as rivers of water in a dry place.
          And if these are not enough, there are depths of the sea. You Lord
          will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Consider all things are ready for your reception and entertainment.
          "All things are ready, come you to the marriage." If all be ready,
          surely yet there is room for you. The Father is ready, and well
          pleased that sinners be matched with his Son and become heirs of
          glory. Of Jesus, he says, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
          pleased, hear you him. The glorious Bridegroom is ready to receive you
          into the marriage covenant, "I will, says he, betroth you unto me
          forever, yes, I will betroth you unto me in righteousness, and in
          judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies." The Holy Spirit is
          ready, and says unto you, come. The marriage contract is ready, the
          covenant drawn up, no more to do but to set your name to it; the
          marriage feast is ready: there is nothing wanting but your consent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Consider that you are invited to come in, yes, we are authorized
          expressly, "To compel you to come in, that his house may be filled."
          Now would that be the case, if there were not yet room? And in the
          invitations consider that they are very large and extensive. "Ho every
          one that thirsts, come you to the waters. And whoever will may take of
          the water of life freely." If you had these invitations of your own
          framing, could you make them more comprehensive? Say not sinners, you
          are not fit to come to Christ: sure I am, you are not fit to stay away
          from him. Come to him for all you need, and embrace a full Christ, for
          wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Besides the
          invitations are made with an express provision, that your sinfulness
          and unworthiness shall not prevent your welcome to Christ, if you will
          come. "He who has no money, come you buy and eat, yes, come buy wine
          and milk, without money and without price." Yes, these invitations are
          commands which you are peremptorily enjoined to obey upon your peril.
          And this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his
          Son Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Consider that all who have gone before you to Christ, have found
          there was room, and why will you not venture forward. They are made to
          sing that blessed song, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from
          our sins in his own blood; and has made us kings and priests unto God
          and his Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever, Amen."
          Turn over the Bible, look at the history of past times, who did ever
          perish that came to him. Was not Paul welcome, and that for an example
          to others. "Yes, for this cause he obtained mercy, that in him first,
          Jesus Christ might show forth all long suffering, for a pattern to
          them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
          Manasseh, Mary Magdalene, the thief on the cross, the very murderers
          of the Savior, the Corinthians, all have found room in his house, and
          a welcome reception. Go then thither, where others have succeeded so
          well before you. And if you die there, and make your grave at his
          door, I assure you, if it be so, you will be the first, there is yet
          no broken ground there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Consider, that if unworthiness, vileness and misery, would have
          turned away the eyes of Jesus from the children of men, he had never
          taken in one of them. His door would have been shut forever upon them.
          Did not he find all the fair ones now in glory, at one time lying in
          their blood with no eye to pity them, nor hand to help them! All the
          company of the redeemed must cast down their crowns at his feet, and
          give glory to them that washed them in his own blood. If you stand
          back until you be worthy, you will never come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider that the great end of the plan of man's salvation
          through Jesus Christ, is to exalt the riches of free grace. It is of
          faith that it might be by grace. The more desperate your disease is,
          the more glorious will the cure be. Your sinfulness will serve to
          exalt free grace in Christ Jesus. Will you then give him the glory of
          your salvation or not? "Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold
          king Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the
          day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use. 1. Come in then, O sinners, come off from your natural state,
          from your sins, from the mountains of vanity; come into Christ, into
          the covenant, into the state of favor with God, through him. Yet there
          is room for you. And that every one of you may either be obliged to
          come into Christ, or be left without, inexcusable this day, I shall
          lay before you, what may solve all your objections.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Though there be many in already, yet there is room for you. Many
          have come from the east, and from the west, from the south, and from
          the north, and have sat down with Abraham in the kingdom of God. But
          the house is not yet full. The Master is still expecting more guests.
          Days have been in which souls have flocked to Christ like doves to
          their windows. And yet there is room. If it were not so the doors
          would be shut and the servants called in from inviting any more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Though there be many attendants at the feast, yet there is room for
          you. Christ and believers feast together even in the lower house, at
          the feast of fat things, which he makes unto all people. And the
          angels are his attendants, yes, they are ministering spirits unto them
          that shall be heirs of salvation. But the hallelujahs of angels will
          not make the King forget the cries of a poor sinner on earth coming to
          God through him. He will look through the crowd about the throne, and
          give you a healing look, and make room for you. Look then again
          towards his holy temple, his heart will be instantly with you, if you
          can but turn your eyes towards him. His love will make its way through
          cherubim and seraphim, and lift you up from the lowest gulf of misery.
          You will be made to say, "You Lord have in love to my soul delivered
          it from the pit of corruption; for you have cast all my sins behind
          your back."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Though you have been very long a coming, yet there is room. Many
          have come into the world after you, and gone out of it before you to
          Jesus Christ. You have sat still, while others have been fleeing from
          the wrath to come. Yet there is room. It is an honorable thing to be
          among the first to embrace Christ. Paul speaks in this sense of some
          that were in Christ before him; but our Lord will not shut his door
          upon the last. As long as there is one wandering sheep looking toward
          the fold, the door shall not be closed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Though you have sat many calls and given Christ many refusals, yet
          there is room. He allows you to take your word again. He still says,
          "Will you not be made clean? When shall it once be?" How peremptory
          were the people in their refusal, Jeremiah 2:25. "I have loved
          strangers, and after them will I go. Yet, chapter 3:1. Yet return
          again to me says the Lord." Christ stands at the door and knocks,
          gives you one offer after another. Why so, but because he would have
          you yet to be wise and open to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Though you have been at the door more than once, and yet turned
          back again, and put an affront on him, by your backsliding, yet there
          is room. "Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your
          backsliding." Has not the Lord given you convictions of sin and duty,
          now and then, and have not you thereupon resolved that you would go to
          Christ and embrace the covenant; yet your goodness has been like the
          morning cloud and early dew that passes away. Have not some blossomed
          fair, whose blossom has afterward gone up like dust? Christ has drawn
          some half way to Heaven, and they have slipped the cord of love and
          run away from him. Yet he says, I will heal their backsliding; I will
          love them freely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Though you have slighted Christ in your prosperity, yet there is
          room for you, be your condition as low as it will. "The wind shall eat
          up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity; surely
          then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness." It
          may be you have had days of outward prosperity and neglected Christ in
          them, and now the case is changed and the world for which you cared so
          much, cares little for you. Yet there is room for you. He is content
          to take you when cast off at all hands. He gathers together the
          outcasts of Israel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Perhaps you have grown old in sin, and your grey hairs are found in
          the way of wickedness, yet there is room for you. He calls even at the
          eleventh hour. Aged sinners, is your time for repentance and
          reformation not yet come? When you were young you delayed until you
          should come to old age. An unhappy resolution! But will you come now,
          then delay no longer. There is room for old sinners in the house of
          our everlasting Father. In a day of power a man may be born again even
          when he is old, and sovereign grace can pluck up by the roots the sin
          fixed with bands of iron and brass.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Though there be less hope of your case than ever there was, yet
          there is room. The same grace that reached Paul in his way to
          Damascus, breathing out rage and fury against Christ and his
          followers, can reach you in your career, and pluck the prey out of the
          lion's mouth. In a word, whatever your case be, yet there is room.
          "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Come then
          sinners while yet there is room.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider, It is dear bought room, to be thought so light of. Had not
          Christ died, and by his precious blood opened the way to the favor of
          God, which Adam's sin had closed, there had been no more room for
          fallen men, than for fallen angels. How then shall we escape if we
          neglect so great salvation. I beseech you by the love of Christ, in
          dying for sinners, to yield up yourselves to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Consider, that there will not always be room. The door will be
          shut before long, and then you will call in vain for admission;
          therefore seek the Lord while he is to be found. God has waited long
          on these sinful nations, his patience with the generation will wear to
          an end, if we reform not; and there is no appearance of that, but the
          contrary. He has waited long on sinful us, but he will not wait
          always. Finally, you cannot tell how soon it may come to that, there
          will be no more room. Few communions, but they are the last to someone
          in the congregation. Your life is uncertain, and your enjoyment of
          gospel ordinances is uncertain, They who will not come into Christ
          while there is room, must soon take their room in the pit of
          destruction, Revelation 21:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. Make room then for Christ with you. Room in your hearts, room
          in your houses. I would call unto all, "Prepare you the way of the
          Lord, make his path straight." Christ is coming once more among us in
          a solemn and awful manner, in the holy ordinance of the supper. O
          Christians, communicants, make room for his triumphant entry. "Lift up
          your heads, O you gates; and be you lift up, you everlasting doors;
          and the king of glory shall come in. Make room for him and all his
          salvation; As made of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
          sanctification, and redemption. Be persuaded of your own utter
          emptiness, your need of all things, that you may take him for your
          all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Make room for him, in all his offices, as a prophet, priest,
          and king. Search out the rebels, lay all your sins before him, that he
          may remove the guilt of them by his blood, and break the power of them
          by his Spirit; and thus redeem you from all iniquity, and purify you
          unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, Make room for him and his cross. Consider what you do, lay
          your account with all the hardships you may meet with in following him
          wherever he goes. Amen.
