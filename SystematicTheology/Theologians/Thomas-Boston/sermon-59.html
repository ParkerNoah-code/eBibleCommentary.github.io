Condemnation Against Ungodly Men, Often Miserably Abused by Them</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">Several Sermons Preached at Ettrick, in Summer, 1728.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>Ecclesiastes 8:11 "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed 
speedily; therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do 
evil."</p>
<p align="justify">THIS book of Ecclesiastes is in a particular manner a book of providence, 
wherein Solomon gives his observations upon it. It is a subject that has puzzled 
the best of men, how to reconcile it with the being and attributes of God: but 
there is no inconsistency; all odds will be made even at length.</p>
<p align="justify">He had observed some set on high to their ruin, made rulers of others to 
their own destruction, to the feeding of their own lusts, and so aggravating 
their own condemnation, verse 9. He had observed them live prosperously in their 
wickedness, die in honor, and buried magnificently, verse 10. He opens the 
secret of this dispensation in the text, namely, That a reprieve is no pardon. 
In the words we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. God's patience with, and forbearance exercised towards ungodly sinners: 
"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is supposed that sentence is passed in their case. There is a 
righteous sentence standing against an evil work, and the evil worker for what 
he has done: it is not overlooked, nor forgotten. Doing of the evil; 
by which is meant an ungodly course. This is plain from 1 John 3:8, 9, "He who 
commits sin, is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this 
purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the 
devil. Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: 
and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. See the sentence, Rom 2:9, 
"Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that does evil."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The execution is oft-times delayed; it is not speedily execute. Though 
the word is gone out of the mouth of the Judge, he does not presently bring on 
the blow; he spares the criminal a while for holy ends.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) It supposes, that though the execution be slow, yet it is sure, if the 
sentence be not got reversed, and a pardon obtained. Saying, that it is not 
speedily executed, he intimates that it will be executed at length.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The wretched abuse sinners make of this patience of God with them. 
"Therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." 
Because sentence is not executed speedily, they think it will never be executed; 
and so they give themselves the loose. "Their heart is fully set in them to do 
evil." They find providence gives them head, does not check and strike them down 
in their course: and so they even run away with themselves. Their impunity fills 
their heart for their sinful courses, that they drive on like a ship with a full 
sail before a brisk gale.</p>
<p align="justify">Three doctrines may be deduced from the words thus explained.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. There is a sentence passed in the court of Heaven, and standing, 
against ungodly men, evil-workers, however easy they be under it for a time.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. The Lord oftentimes does not soon come to the execution of the 
sentence against ungodly men, evil-workers; but delays it for a time.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. God's delay of execution is often miserably abused by sinners, 
to the filling of their hearts to do evil, and sinning more and more.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall handle each of these doctrines in order.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. There is a sentence passed in the court of Heaven, and standing, 
against ungodly men, evil-workers, however easy they be under it for a time.</p>
<p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show, that there is a sentence passed in the court of Heaven, and 
standing, against ungodly men, evil-workers.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Explain the nature of this sentence.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make some practical improvement of the subject</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall show, that there is a sentence passed in the court of Heaven, and 
standing, against ungodly men, evil-workers.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are already judged and condemned of God: John 3:18, "He who believes 
not, is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only 
begotten Son of God." Ungodly men, evil-workers, are unbelievers; and being 
unbelievers, they have not the benefit of absolution by Christ: so they are 
under condemnation of the law for their evil works. For whom the gospel does not 
absolve, the law does condemn.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Only those that are in Christ, are not under condemnation; and their 
freedom from it is of no older date than their believing: Romans 8:1, "There is 
no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." But evil-workers are not in 
Christ, 1 John 3:8, 9, fore-cited. If they were in Christ, they would be new 
creatures; 2 Corinthians 5:17, "For if any man be in Christ, he is a new 
creature." Therefore they are still under condemnation.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are in a state of death, dead in sin, Ephesians 2:1. They who are 
morally dead in sin, being without a principle of spiritual life, Ephesians 
4:18, are legally dead too; they are dead men in law, under a sentence of death, 
John 5:24. Hence they are called children of wrath, of Hell, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The power that Satan has over them, proves this. They are close prisoners, 
bound hand and foot, Isaiah 61:1. Satan is the keeper of the prison, Hebrews 
2:14; and they are under his power, Acts 26:18. What gives him the power over 
them, but that they are condemned in law? Let the sentence be reversed, and he 
has them no more under his power, 1 Corinthians 15:56.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The spirit of bondage witnesses the truth of this, convincing the 
sinner that he is a dead man, Romans 7:9, and that he stands in need of a 
remission, chapter 3:19. This testimony is true; for it is the testimony of the 
Spirit of God, whereby he brings sinners to see their need of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To explain the nature of this sentence, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Every evil work is a breach of God's law; and every sinful thought, word, 
or action is an evil work: 1 John 3:4. "Whoever commits sin, transgresses also 
the law: for sin is the transgression of the law." No man is lord of himself but 
is answerable to God for every action of his life: and being guilty, if out of 
Christ, he is liable to vengeance, under the curse; if in Christ, he is liable 
to temporal strokes. So all ungodly ones, evil-workers, are liable to the curse 
for their sins.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The law is the accuser, that accuses the sinner of rebellion against God, 
and demands vengeance on him, John 5:45. Every command broken by the sinner 
accuses him before God; and as many breaches as he has made of it, as many 
articles there are of the libel against him. And though these be innumerable to 
men, and many of them unknown to them; they are not so unto an omniscient God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. God is the judge that judges and passes the sentence against the guilty, 
Psalm 50:6. And he is a judge whom no artful concealment can beguile. He cannot 
be blinded, bribed, or biased, 1 Peter 1:17. His sentence, hower severe, is 
always righteous, Revelation 16:7. And there lies no appeal from his tribunal; 
for there is none above him who is the Most High. Only, while the sinner is, in 
this world, there is access to a remission in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The sentence is a sentence of death, Genesis 2:17; death in its full 
latitude, comprehending all miseries of soul and body; eternal death, in which 
the gnawing worm never dies, nor is the fire quenched. The sentences of men are 
at most the death of the body: but his sentence adjudges the soul to die 
eternally. The reason is, the infinite dignity of the divine Majesty offended by 
sin.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The grounds of this heavy sentence, are the transgressions of God's holy 
law: Galatians 3:10. "Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which 
are written in the book of the law to do them." The holy law is a transcript of 
the purity of the divine nature; in it he has set forth his own image. That 
image the sinner does what he can to deface, by violating the law: but God will 
magnify the law, and make it honorable, though in the destruction of the sinner.</p>
<p align="justify">The grounds of it more particularly are,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The sin of nature, original sin imputed, Romans 5:12; and original sin 
inherent, that corrupt frame of soul that is natural to us, whereby we are prone 
to evil and averse to good, Genesis 6:5. By reason of this we come into the 
world under the sentence of death. And as serpents and vipers are objects whose 
destruction men seek on the first sight of them, because of their poisonous 
nature; so it fares with men, the very first sight of whom, in respect of their 
original sin, is loathsome unto a holy God, and thereby they become objects fit 
only for destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The sins of the heart, Psalm 24:4; Matthew 5:28, 29. Heart-sins are not 
liable to man's judgment: but how can they escape the judgment of God, to whose 
all seeing eye our hearts are just as open as our lives? He sees the rottenness 
that is within the whited sepulchers, and passes his sentence against lusts of 
covetousness, impurity, malice, revenge, etc. burning within the heart, as well 
as against the same defiling the conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly The sins of the tongue, Matthew 12:37. It is a channel by which the 
heart veuts much of its inbred corruption, contempt of God, etc. Jude 15, in his 
mocking, maligning, and running down seriousness, and agenting the cause of 
irreligion; and contempt of our neighbor, in railing, reproaching, obscenity, 
lying, etc; which may show why the rich man in Hell is represented as seeking 
water to cool his tongue.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, The sins of the life, wicked actions, whether of impiety against God, 
unrighteousness against men, or intemperance against ourselves, Jude 15. None of 
all these will escape the judgment of God, however craftily they be managed, 
whatever fair colors be drawn over them: Ecclesiastes 12, "For God shall bring 
every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or 
whether it be evil." Sinners may forget them, and let them slip out of mind: but 
"the Lord has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any 
of their works," Amos 8:7.</p>
<p align="justify">5thly, Omissions of duty, Matthew 25:41, etc. Men will find sentence passed 
on them by a just God, not only for the ill they have done, but for the good 
they were obliged to have done, but did it not. The man that hidden his talent, 
and improved it not for his Lord, is doomed to outer darkness, Matthew 25:24, 
30.</p>
<p align="justify">6. This sentence against the ungodly is openly pronounced in the word: Romans 
2:8, 9, "But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey 
unrighteousness: indignation, and wrath; tribulation and anguish upon every soul 
of man that does evil." God speaks from Heaven to men, Hebrews 12:25; not by a 
voice coming through the clouds, but by his voice in the written word, 2 Kings 
22:19, compared with verse 11. The Bible is God's word to us, whereby he is 
speaking to us, and will speak to men unto the end of the world, either 
absolution or condemnation according to their state.</p>
<p align="justify">7. It is registered there too; Genesis 2:17, "In the day that you eat 
thereof, you shall surely die." Ezekiel 18:4, "The soul that sins, it shall 
die." The Scripture is the records of the court of Heaven, where the ungodly may 
read their doom, and see the sentence standing against them. And that certainly 
is one of the causes of the neglect of the Scriptures in our day; for in it "the 
wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness, and 
unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness," Romans 1:18. 
Ahab hated Micaiah, because he never spoke good of him. The Scripture never 
speaks good of a man that is wedded to his lusts, and has no will to part with 
his beloved liberty in the way of sin; and therefore he hates or neglects it.</p>
<p align="justify">8. It is secretly intimated by the conscience sometimes, 1 John 3:20. 
Conscience is God's deputy within the man; and when his corruption drives him 
full to do an ill work, and when he has done it, to defend it; conscience will 
be condemning it, and him too, from the holy law, Romans 2:15. And when it is 
thoroughly awakened, it will so pronounce the sentence against the man as will 
fill him with the greatest terror.</p>
<p align="justify">9. It will he openly pronounced before all the world at the last day: Matthew 
25:41, "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, you 
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Where it 
is observable, that they are declared cursed and condemned ones, before that 
solemn publishing of the sentence against them. For none will be condemned then, 
but such as are in this world before that in this life condemned already.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Lastly, Howbeit, the time of the execution of the sentence, in 
particular, is not now intimated to the sinner. The Lord keeps that a secret, 
that sinners may not adventure to live a moment in the state of condemnation; 
but not knowing but it may be executed next moment, they may not put off a 
moment the suing for a remission.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information. Hence learn,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The state of every ungodly person, worker of iniquity, and all 
unbelievers, is a miserable state, a state of condemnation. They are as really 
under a sentence of death, as ever any malefactor was: John 3:18, "He who 
believes not, is condemned already; because he has not believed in the name of 
the only begotten Son of God." Think on this, you young and old ungodly ones: 
though the sentence is not executed against you, it is passed on you; look into 
your Bible, and see it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. As silent as God sits on Heaven, while sinners on earth are neglecting and 
affronting him, he is no idle spectator of their way and manner of life: Psalm 
50:21, "These things have you done, and I kept silence: you thought that I was 
altogether such a one as yourself: but I will reprove you, and set them in order 
before your eyes." He has sentenced them, and "sees their day is coming," Psalm 
37:13. They have their sinning day, and God sees their day of count and 
reckoning is coming on, wherein every item shall be distinctly charged on them: 
Ecclesiastes 11:9, "Know you, that for all these things God will bring you into 
judgment." They laugh at the evil day, because they do not see it come; God 
laughs at them, because he sees it coming; and his will be when theirs is done, 
Proverbs 1:26, when he will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear 
comes.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is not strange, that the world is filled with the noise of men's lusts 
and ungodly lives. If you were gone into a prison filled with condemned men, you 
would think it melancholy indeed, but not strange to hear the iron chains 
rattling in every part of the room. This world is such a place, crowded with 
condemned people; un-mortified lusts are the chains on them: and that is the 
reason of the grating noise which the serious godly hear from every corner. And 
the jailor, the devil, is going among them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, No wonder that most men love this life, so as to loath exchanging 
it for another; Psalm 55:23, "But God shall bring them down into the pit of 
destruction." The prison is a heavy place to the condemned man; but to go out of 
it is more so, for that is to go to execution, Jeremiah 17:11. Death brings the 
execution of the sentence.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of trial. Try whether that sentence is standing against you, or 
whether it is reversed, and you justified.</p>
<p align="justify">To move you to put this to the question, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. One thing is sure, that once it was passed and standing against you: 
Ephesians 2:3, "And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 
Galatians 3:10, "Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are 
written in the book of the law to do them." Compared with Romans 3:19, "Now we 
know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the 
law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before 
God." Now, what course have you taken to get this sentence taken off? and if you 
have been aiming at it, have you carried it?</p>
<p align="justify">2. As your state is in this life, condemned or justified, so it will be 
determined at death and judgment: Ecclesiastes 9:10, "Whatever your hand finds 
to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, 
nor wisdom in the grave where you go. Now, there is access for a remission; but 
when death comes, there will be no more forever.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Men are apt to mistake in this point. Many draw forgiveness from the 
sentence for themselves, which God will never set his seal to: Luke 16:15, 
"Christ said unto them, You are they which justify yourselves before men; but 
God knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is 
abomination in the sight of God." Isaiah 44:20, "He feeds of ashes: a deceived 
heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there 
not a lie in my right hand? The foolish virgins called themselves the 
Bridegroom's friends; but he shut the door on them as his enemies.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, A mistake here is very fatal. By it men let the time of obtaining 
a remission slip. The oil might have been got for the lamps, if they had missed 
it timely. It brings a ruining surprise: dreaming of peace, they are awaked with 
the noise of war forever.</p>
<p align="justify">MARK 1. They that never saw themselves in a state of condemnation, are under 
it to this day. For they are strangers to the very first work of the Spirit, 
conviction, John 16:8, "The law is our schoolmaster, to bring us unto Christ, 
that we might be justified by faith, Galatians 3:24. They that have never been 
at the law's school, to learn that they are cursed and condemned sinners by 
nature, are not Christ's disciples.</p>
<p align="justify">MARK 2. They only are absolved, who laying hold on Christ in the covenant of 
grace have applied to the law's sentence of condemnation against them, the 
righteousness of Christ wrought by him, and offered to and accepted by them. 
Hence says the apostle, Philippians 3:7, 8, "But what things were gain to me, 
those I counted loss for Christ. Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but 
loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord—and do count 
them but dung that I may win Christ." They continue not in mere suspense, but 
renouncing self-confidence, law-confidence, and creature confidence, have 
betaken themselves to him as their only refuge, casting anchor on the promise of 
the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">MARK 3. If the condemning power of sin is removed, the reigning power of sin 
is removed too, and contrariwise: Romans 6:14, "For sin shall not have dominion 
over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace." If the condemned man 
has got his remission, he is taken out of his irons, and his prison, and the 
power of the jailor. The chains of reigning lusts rattling about you, declare 
you a condemned man still; but it is otherwise with the pardoned, Romans 8:1, 2, 
"There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after 
the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life, in Christ 
Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death." If you are justified, 
you are washed, 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, 11.</p>
<p align="justify">MARK 4. If the sentence be reversed, you will be habitually tender in your 
conscience with respect to temptations, sin and duty, and appearances of evil. 
Hence Paul could say, Acts 24:16, "Herein do I exercise myself, to have always a 
conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men." The man who under the 
sentence of death, has obtained a remission, will readily fear falling into the 
snare again. Hence we find this was Hezekiah's exercise, Isaiah 38:17, "Behold, 
for peace I had great bitterness; but you have in love to my soul delivered it 
from the pit of corruption; for you have cast all my sins behind your back." 
Verse 15, "What shall I say? he has both spoken unto me, and himself has done 
it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul." Absolved 
persons may be guilty of acts of untenderness; but habitual untenderness is a 
black mark of condemnation.</p>
<p align="justify">MARK 5. The fruits of faith in a holy life follow the reversing of the 
sentence. We are justified by faith without works; but the faith that justifies, 
produces good works. Hence we read, Acts 15:2, of purifying the heart by faith. 
If the curse is removed, the fruits of the Spirit will spring up in the soul, 
Galatians 5:22, 23, "love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, 
faith, meekness, temperance." The apostle James shows that faith not to be true, 
that is not attended with the fruits of holiness."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, if the sentence once standing against you is reversed, then,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Love the Lord, who freely gave you your remission, instead of leading yon 
forth to execution; as did the woman of whom our Lord says, Luke 7:47, "Her 
sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much." Remember the day when 
you stood self-condemned and law-condemned before the Lord, and he said, Job 
33:24, "Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Pity and be concerned for those that are as yet under the condemnation 
which you are freed from, Titus 3:2, 3. Where people's contempt and disdain have 
the heels of their pity, compassion, and concern for the welfare and recovery of 
sinners, it is a sad sign; speaking forth more of pride and presumption, than of 
themselves being in a state of remission.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Walk humbly and tenderly. The remembrance of the sentence of death 
sometime lying on you, may humble you while you live. It sets us ill to be proud 
and conceity, who owe our life to a remission. Stand aloof from the deadly 
snare; a pardoning God has said, "Go, and sin no more," John 8:11.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Bear your troubles and trials in a world patiently. Your life was 
forfeited, and that is safe by grace. Why does a living man complain? This is a 
day wherein the Lord seems to be rising up to plead against the generation, 
bringing on common calamity. Take thankfully what falls to your share of it, in 
consideration that the sentence against your soul is reversed. If the seed 
should rot under the clod, and the beasts of the field perish under the stroke; 
kiss the rod, and be thankful, that the execution is not upon yourselves.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Be of a forgiving disposition: Ephesians 4:32, "Be you kind one to 
another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake 
has forgiven you." The Savior that brought in remission of sins, binds us to 
love our enemies; and the bitter revengeful spirit against others speaks as 
unforgiven, Matthew 6:15, "If you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will 
your Father forgive your trespasses."</p>
<p align="justify">But if you are of those against whom the sentence still stands in the court 
of Heaven, lay the matter to heart, and consider it as a most heavy case, as it 
is indeed, deserving tears of Wood. And so I proceed to</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Of Lamentation. We may here lament over the case of every ungodly one, 
and natural man. The state of one under sentence of death, is a lamentable case. 
O ungodly sinner, however easy you are, God's law has condemned you, and you are 
under the sentence of eternal death, John 3:36, "He who believes not the Son, 
shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him." See your heavy case in 
this glass.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You are forfeited of your covenant-right to the creatures, as a condemned 
person. Whether you have little or much in the world, it is a sorry right you 
have to it; a mere providential right, such as a condemned man to his meat, 
until the day of execution come. Therefore "a little that a righteous man has, 
is better than the riches of many wicked," Psalm 34:16. There is little 
satisfaction in that.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God is your enemy, befriend you who will, John 3:36. fore-cited. He bears 
a legal enmity against you, as a just judge against a condemned man. You can 
have no communion with him: Amos 3:3, "Can two walk together, except they be 
agreed?" All comfortable fellowship between God and your soul, is drowned in the 
gulf of your state of condemnation. There can be no peace between God and you. 
To allude to the conference between Joram and Jehu, 2 Kings 9:22, "And it came 
to pass when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, 
What peace, so long as the whoredoms of your mother Jezebel, and her witchcrafts 
are so many?" How can they have peace with God, whom his law condemns? What 
peace you have in your consciences, God allows not, Isaiah 57:21.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Nothing you do can be acceptable to God; there is a lasting cloud over 
your heads that never clears: Psalm 7:11, "God is angry with the wicked every 
day." While the condemning curse of the law lies on a man, it blasts all the 
good he does: Titus 1:15, "Unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving, is 
nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled." Hag. 2:12, 14, "If 
one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch 
bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the 
priests answered and said, No. Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this 
people, and so is this nation before me, says the Lord; and so is every work of 
their hands, and that which they offer there is unclean." It mars sanctifying 
influences, without which there can be no fruit, John 15:5, "for without me you 
can do nothing." Hence all you do is turned to sin.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The sentence against you is confirmed daily. The truth of God confirms it: 
Numbers 23:19, "God is not a man, that he should lie, neither the son of man, 
that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, 
and shall he not make it good? And the cords of your guilt are growing stronger 
and stronger; for the grounds of condemnation against you are multiplying; while 
none of the old debt is removed, but new is still contracted. And though one may 
think, that it is but dying for all; yet the punishment will be increased, as 
evil works are; for men will be rewarded according to their deeds.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Justice craves execution against you. There was a cry to Heaven against 
Cain, and against Sodom: and so there is against every ungodly sinner, Jeremiah 
9:9, "Shall I not visit them for these things? says the Lord: shall not my soul 
be avenged on such a nation as this?" Mercy may suspend execution a while 
against the ungodly; but if they continue in that state, it cannot reverse it; 
since God cannot cease to be just.</p>
<p align="justify">6. All is ready for the execution. The bow is bent to let fly the arrows of 
wrath against you, the arrows of death, Psalm 7:12, 13. The pile of fire is set 
on, Isaiah 30:33, "For Tophet is ordained of old: yes, for the king it is 
prepared; he has made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood, 
the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, does kindle it." When you 
lie down, you have no security, that it shall not be executed before you arise, 
etc.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, Your life depends, as to you, only on God's long-tried patience 
and long-suffering, procuring your reprieve from day to day, if so you will sue 
out your pardon. As secure as you are, the sword of justice hangs over your 
head, by the worn hair of long-tired patience; which if once broken, you are 
gone forever.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Of Exhortation. Wherefore bestir yourselves to get out of the state of 
condemnation, to get the sentence reversed.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. It is a sad and miserable life to live in the state of 
condemnation. For in effect such a life is a continued death.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is a dishonorable life. Condemnation fixes a blot and stain on man, 
speaks him guilty of crimes for which he is not worthy to live. And surely the 
judgment of God is according to truth.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is an uncomfortable life: Isaiah 57:21, "There is no peace, says my 
God, to the wicked." There is enough in it to squeeze the sap out of all created 
comforts; and for the consolations of God, they can have none of them, Amos 3:3, 
"Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" The joy and comfort of a natural 
man is but like that of a madman; and so when he comes to himself, all is 
swallowed up in that, he is a condemned man. This the prodigal found, Luke 
15:17, "And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my 
father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) It is an unsafe life; John 3:36, "He who believes not the Son, shall not 
see life; but the wrath of God abides on him." Amidst all your mirth and 
jollity, the sword of justice is hanging over your head by a hair, and every 
moment, for all that you know, it may fall, and cleave you asunder. This our 
Lord threatens in the parable of the wicked servant, Matthew 24:50, 51, "The 
Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an 
hour that he is not aware of; and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his 
portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. The reversing of the sentence by a remission, is not so easily 
obtained as men are apt to imagine. Many think there is no more ado, but after a 
careless graceless life, when they come to die, to commend their souls to God, 
with a "God have mercy on me;" and all will be safe. But they that get out a 
remission, get it so as they are taught other thoughts of it. Hence is that 
exclamation of the church, Micah 7:18, "Who is a God like unto you, that pardons 
iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he 
retains not his anger forever, because he delights in mercy." Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Sin is the greatest of evils, the deepest of all stains to wash out. 
Fair words, nay tears, nay not the blood of bulls and goats, not the blood of 
one's own body will wash it out; only the blood of the Son of God: Hebrews 
11:22, "Without shedding of blood is no remission." Compared with 1 John 1:7, 
"The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin." Sin is the most 
contrary to God's nature: Habakkuk 1:13, "You are of purer eyes than to behold 
evil, and can not look on iniquity." And therefore it is the object of his 
greatest loathing. Going on in sin, you are engaged against all the attributes 
of God. Sin has marred the whole frame of God's workmanship, provoking him to 
break it in pieces. Can it be easy to get all this buried in forgetfulness with 
a jealous God?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, God's giving remissions, is one of his greatest works. Hence is that 
prayer of Moses, Numbers 14:17, 19, "And now, I beseech you, let the power of my 
Lord be great, according as you have spoken. Pardon, I beseech you, the iniquity 
of this people, according unto the greatness of your mercy, and as you have 
forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now." This is a work greater than 
the making of a world. That was done by a word spoken But in this case, justice 
stands up for satisfaction, truth for the honor of a broken law, and wisdom 
finds a way for mercy only by the blood of Christ: John 3:16, "God so loved the 
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should 
not perish, bat have everlasting life."</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Sad breakings of heart do sinners ordinarily endure, before they being 
once touched with sense of sin, get the pardon of it. This was the case of 
Peter's hearers, Acts 2:37, "They were pricked in their heart, and said unto 
Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?" 
Paul can tell you from his experience of the terror of the Lord; David of broken 
bones. However lightly you think now of the way of coming at it; a medicine 
given you for sweating out the poison of sin, will readily make you sick at 
heart, and perhaps bring you to the last gasp, Isaiah 33:24.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. Howbeit, God is now on a throne of grace to grant remissions: 2 
Corinthians 5:19, "God is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not 
imputing their trespasses unto them." You may get a pardon now in the Lord's own 
way: Isaiah 55:7, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his 
thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and 
to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." Heaven's white flag of peace yet 
hangs out, the market of free grace stands open, an indemnity is proclaimed in 
the gospel: Acts 13:38, "Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through 
this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins."</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. Lastly, Access to remissions will not last: Isaiah 55:6, "Seek you 
the Lord while he may be found, call you upon him while he is near." Abused 
patience will break out into fury: Luke 13:24, 25. "Strive to enter in at the 
strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be 
able. When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, 
and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, 
open unto us; and he shall answer, and say unto you, I know you not whence you 
are." Beware you sit not your day of grace, and delay not until you will find no 
place for repentance: Luke 14:24, "For I say unto you, that none of those men 
which were bidden, shall taste of my supper."</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. My sins are great. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Neither the greatness multitude, nor backsliding into them will 
hinder: Isaiah 1:18. "Come now and let us reason together, says the Lord: though 
your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as now; though they be red like 
crimson, they shall be as wool." Isaiah 55:7. "Let the wicked forsake his way, 
and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he 
will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." 
Jeremiah 3:22. "Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your 
backslidings." The Lord has set up instances of pardoning mercy, that none may 
despair; as Adam, Manasseh, Paul, and the Jews, crucifiers of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTION 1. Be sensible of your sin; of the evil of it; of the mischief done 
to yourselves, and the injury and dishonor done to God. Look to the law, the 
justice of God, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTION 2. Go to God, and confess your sins fully and freely: and condemn 
yourselves, acknowledging yourselves justly condemned by the law, and God to be 
righteous if he should execute the sentence.</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTION. Look to Jesus Christ the atoning sacrifice held forth to you in 
the gospel, his unspotted righteousness offered to you, and the covert of his 
blood, the retiring place for safety to guilty creatures. Believe the gospel, 
that these are made over to you therein, and take possession thereof, by 
trusting wholly thereon to your remission, and the sanctification of your 
nature; John 3:16. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, 
that whoever believes in him, should not perish but have everlasting life." So 
shall you be united to Christ by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Take that advice, which the servants of Benhadad offered to their master, 1 
Kings 20:31. Put on the sackcloth of deep humiliation, ropes about your necks, 
acknowledging you are worthy of death, and go forth to Christ by faith; for the 
King of Zion is a merciful king, and will save your life.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. The Lord oftentimes does not soon come to the execution of the 
sentence against ungodly men, evil-workers; but delays it for a time.</p>
<p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine, we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Take a view of the method of Providence in this matter.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Account for this slow method of Providence.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make application of the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall take a view of the method of Providence in this matter. There is 
a twofold method of Providence with the ungodly, evil-workers, in respect of 
execution against them; namely, a swift and a slow method.</p>
<p align="justify">First, There is a swift method the Lord sometimes takes with sinners: Malachi 
3:5. "I will come near to you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against 
the sorcerers," etc. Sinners adventure on evil works; and God sentences them for 
them presently, and pursues them hard with execution, without delay.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Sometimes the sinner has an ill work in design, and the Lord counts his 
will for the deed, and prevents by a speedy execution; as in Haman's case. He 
hatched the mischief, but he did not see it come forth.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Sometimes the sinner is in actual motion to the ill work, and execution 
is done on him before he get it performed. So it fared with the rebellious 
Israelites, in their attempting to go into the promised land, Numbers 14:44, 45. 
And so it fared with Jeroboam, putting forth his hand to lay hold on the 
prophet, 1 Kings 13:4; and with Uzziah having the censer in his hand, 2 
Chronicles 26:19.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Sometimes the execution trysts with the very doing of the ill work, so 
that the sinner is taken away with the stroke in his sin. Thus fared it with 
Nadab and Abihu offering strange fire, Leviticus 10:1, 2; with Zimri and Cozbi 
cut off in the act of impurity, Numbers 25:8; and with Herod, who was eaten up 
of worms for his Atheism and blasphemy, Acts 12:23.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Sometimes as the ill work is done out and ended, the execution begins. 
So it fared with Sennacherib's blasphemous letter. He had writ it, and it was 
read; so his sin was completed; and that very night the Lord smote his army, and 
soon after himself, 2 Kings 19:14, 35. etc.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Sometimes the execution keeps pace with the ill work, and the one goes 
on as the other does; judgment in the several degrees following hard at the 
heels of the sin. So it fared with Hiel, in his building of Jericho, 1 Kings 
16..</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) Sometimes execution begins with the sinner's beginning to reap the fruit 
of his sin when he leans upon his wall, a serpent bites him. So it fared with 
Ahab taking possession of Naboth's vineyard, 1 Kings 21:18, 19. And so it fared 
with the lusters in the wilderness, Psalm 78:30, 31.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) Lastly, Sometimes when one's sin begins to work, in its bitter fruits 
and effects on others, it recoils on the sinner himself. So it fared with Judas 
the traitor, Matthew 27:3, 4, 5. It is a sport to some to do mischief to others; 
but before all be done, it may, in the just judgment of God, come as heavy on 
themselves as on their neighbor.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, There is a slow method the Lord takes oftentimes with sinners, 
Nehemiah 9:17. They commit their evil works; the sentence is presently passed 
for them: but then the execution is delayed, Psalm 50:21. And that is what is 
particularly noticed in our text. Concerning this method I offer these observes.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The sinner may get his evil work contrived and accomplished, without any 
let in this way from Heaven, by any execution against him. There is a God in 
Heaven who has his eye upon him all along; but that God keeps silence, and lets 
the sinner take his swing, Psalm 50:21. He could cut him off from the purposes 
of his heart, and break his arm, that he should not accomplish his work: but he 
does it not.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The ill work being done without let, the sinner may also for a time pass 
unpunished, and as little notice may seem to be taken of it, as if there were 
not a God to judge upon the earth, Ezekiel 9:9. There are times wherein holy 
Providence, as it were, winks at ungodly sinners, Acts 17:30. Hence God is said 
to awake to judgment, when that time is over, Psalm 7:6.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Yes, ill works may not only for a time escape unpunished, but undiscovered 
too, Hosea 12:7, 8; Proverbs 30:20. There are many abominations that appear with 
open face in the world; but there are perhaps more that are not discovered, 
being reserved to the judgment of the great day, 1 Timothy 5:21; Romans 2:16. An 
omniscient God could pull the veil off them, but in the slow method it is long 
a-doing.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Sinners finding it go thus, encourage themselves in evil, repeat their 
evils works, add sin to sin, and give themselves the loose in their sinful 
courses. This is observed in our text. None go to the highest pitch of 
wickedness all of a sudden, but by degrees. Ill works at first have a terror 
about them, and the sinner trembles under some fearful expectation at first: but 
a long-suffering God strikes not, thence the sinner gathers courage, Psalm 64:5. 
and ventures again, and the terror wears off by degrees.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Nay sinners may prosper in an ill course. So far may they be from 
execution done against them, that they may thrive in the world in it: Psalm 
37:35, "I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a 
green bay-tree." The sun of worldly prosperity may shine light and warm on men 
in a course of sin, gone away from God, and God from them. Yes, objects of God's 
indignation may in that respect be treated as if they were the darlings of 
Heaven; and the objects of God's special love, as if they were the buts of his 
wrath: Ecclesiastes 8:14, "There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that 
there be just men unto whom it happen according to the work of the wicked: 
again, there be wicked men to whom it happen according to the work of the 
righteous." This has been sometimes puzzling to the saints, as to Jeremiah, See 
chapter 12:1, 2.</p>
<p align="justify">6. More than that, they may prosper by their ill works, they may enjoy the 
fruits of their sin, and thrive by their ill courses; as Ephraim did, Hosea 
12:7, 8. Riches are called the mammon of unrighteousness, because often they are 
got together by unrighteousness. Many a fair estate, and great worldly wealth 
has been got together by oppression; yes the foundation of some has been laid in 
blood, Habakkuk 2:12. A plain evidence, that men may not only prosper in, but by 
sin.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Sinners may get a long time of it, wherein they sin, and God spares still. 
The old world got a long day of 120 years. Job observes, that the wicked may 
live, and become old, and continue prosperous too, Job 21:7, and Isaiah 65:20. 
Sometimes God quickly cuts off men in a course of sin: but it is not always so; 
but men may grow gray-headed in the way of wickedness.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The Lord may seem to be in his way to execute the sentence sometimes, and 
yet may give another delay; his hand stretched out, he may withdraw again, Psalm 
78:38. Criminals may be set on the brow of the hill, and yet be returned safe, 
and make a very ill use of the deliverance, turning worse on the back of it. The 
120 years being out, the old world got seven days more respite, and they gave 
themselves the loose. See Matthew 24:38.</p>
<p align="justify">9. When execution is at length begun, it may be carried on very leisurely for 
a time: the drops may come very few and soft before the shower, Isaiah 9:1. God 
may deal very gently with impenitent sinners, even when he is risen up against 
them, before he come to the full execution. God's judgments coming with iron 
hands, may yet proceed with leaden feet in slow pace.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Lastly, More than all that, the execution may be entirely put off during 
this life. Men may live wickedly and prosperously, die peaceably, and be buried 
honorably; and so would wholly escape with their ill works, were it not that 
there is another world and an after-reckoning, and that there is no delay of 
execution there. This is plain from Ecclesiastes 8:10, "I saw the wicked buried, 
who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the 
city where they had so done." Luke 16:19, 22, "There was a certain rich man, 
which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day. The 
rich man also died, and was buried." Psalm 73:4, "There are no bands in death: 
but their strength is firm." Sometimes God makes the world witness to the 
execution of the sentence against an ill work: but oft-times men get out of the 
world without it, in this slow method of providence.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall account for this slow method of providence. And there is much 
need to do it, because there is a mystery of providence in it that is not easy 
to unriddle, and among men there are sad blunders about it. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is wrested by many a sinner in his own case, to his own ruin, Proverbs 
1:32. We naturally have such high thoughts of the world's smiles, that we are 
apt to imagine God thinks highly of them too, and that he expresses his special 
love and kindness by them. But quite the contrary: Revelation 3:19, "As many as 
I love, I rebuke and chasten." Hence a prosperous sinner can hardly imagine 
himself not to be a favorite of Heaven, at least cannot think God is so angry 
with his way as some would give out; and so he continues secure in his course, 
Psalm 50:21.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Being misunderstood, it is ruining to many spectators, and is in hazard of 
turning them atheistic, and despisers of religion: Malachi 3:14, 15, "You have 
said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it, that we have kept his 
ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? And now 
we call the proud happy: yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, they 
that tempt God are even delivered." There are many who have no inward principle 
of religion. Now, when these see that there is worldly advantage to be got by 
it, they embrace it, like the mixed multitude from Egypt: but when they see the 
way of wickedness prosperous, and sinners to keep the road for all the 
threatenings against them, and the godly afflicted and bowed down for all the 
promises to them; they are ready to think, that the threatenings and promises of 
the word are both but empty sounds, and that they see so.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a difficulty in it, that has puzzled many a great saint, and made 
him to stagger. So ready are we to walk by sense, not by faith. This was a 
knotty piece of the book of providence to Jeremiah, though he resolved to 
believe over the belly of sense, Jeremiah 12:1, 2; and to Habakkuk, chapter 1:2, 
3, 4. It had almost carried Asaph quite off his feet, Psalm 73:2–13, 14.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There being a darkness on the minds of all men with respect to the methods 
of divine procedure, they are apt to imagine an inconsistency of this method of 
providence with the perfections attributed to God. And there are four divine 
perfections, that are apt to run a risk with poor sinners blind and rash in 
judging.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, His omniscience, whereby he sees and notices all things done in the 
world, Proverbs 15:3, "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the 
evil and the good." But when men themselves are conscious of their own 
wickedness, and yet see that God does not proceed against them for it, they are 
apt to say, as Ezekiel 9:9, "The Lord has forsaken the earth, and the Lord sees 
not." So the Psalmist represents men going on in their wickedness, secure as to 
any notice to be taken of it from Heaven, Psalm 94:5, 6, 7, "They break in 
pieces your people, O Lord, and afflict your heritage. They slay the widow and 
the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see: 
neither shall the God of Jacob regard it." Therefore Job asserts it on that 
occasion, chapter 24:1, "Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do 
they that know him, not see his days?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, His holiness, whereby he is pure in himself, and cannot but hate all 
impurity and sin in his creatures. It is certain that it is so. The angels 
proclaim it, Isaiah 6:3, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts." The Psalmist 
pointedly declares it, Psalm 5:4, 5, "You are not a God that has pleasure in 
wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you. The foolish shall not stand in 
your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity." But when men see this method of 
providence with ungodly sinners, they can hardly believe it, Psalm 50:21, "These 
things have you done, and I kept silence: you thought that I was altogether such 
a one as yourself: but I will reprove you, and set them in order before your 
eyes." For, think they, if it were so, how could he bear with such unholiness in 
sinners affronting him, and trampling on his laws? Therefore the Prophet asserts 
it on that very occasion, but withal owns a difficulty of reconciling this 
method of providence with it, Habakkuk 1:13. "You are of purer eyes than to 
behold evil, and can not look on iniquity: wherefore look you upon them that 
deal treacherously, and hold your tongue when the wicked devours the man that is 
more righteous than he?"</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, His justice or righteousness, whereby he so hates sin that he cannot 
but punish it. It is certain it is so, Genesis 18:25. "Shall not the judge of 
all the earth do right?" He has demonstrated it in the death of his own Son. But 
when men see ungodly sinners going on in their sin unpunished, they are apt to 
think, that God is not so very just in that matter, as some give him out to be; 
for they cannot see sin get a just recompense. Therefore Jeremiah asserts it on 
that occasion, Jeremiah 12:1. "Righteous are you, O Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, His goodness to his own people, whereby being good in himself, he does 
good to them that are good. It is certain it is so, Psalm 34:8, 9, 10. "O taste 
and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusts in him. O fear the 
Lord, you his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young 
lions do lack and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any 
good thing." The prophet got it in commission, Isaiah 3:10. "Say you to the 
righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their 
doings." But when men see this method of providence dangling ungodly sinners, 
and smiting the godly, they are apt to think it is not so. And therefore Asaph 
asserts it on that occasion, Psalm 73:1. "Truly God is good to Israel, even to 
such as are of a clean heart."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, to remove these misconstructions, and account for the slow method of 
providence, I offer these considerations.</p>
<p align="justify">First, This method is taken to bring sinners to repentance, and prevent their 
ruin, 2 Peter 3:9; and it is becoming the perfections of a merciful God, 
therefore to use it. By this means sinners,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Have time and space to repent given them, Revelation 2:21. Were they 
always taken away just in the heat of their unmortified lusts, we would be ready 
to cry out of severity, Numbers 17:12. But God gives them leave to cool 
ordinarily, if so they will bethink themselves, and turn to the Lord, and so 
prevent their own ruin.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are invited to repentance, and drawn towards it with the softest 
methods. Romans 2:2. Every sparing preventing, bounteous mercy the impenitent 
meets with, calls aloud to him to repent. It says to him, "Do yourself no harm:" 
it upbraids him with willfulness for his own ruin, why will you die? with 
ingratitude, Is this your kindness to your friend? And so hereby,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, God has the glory of some perfections, which otherwise would not shine 
forth so illustriously.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He has the glory of his long-suffering and patience: 2 Peter 3:9. "The 
Lord is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that 
all should come to repentance." Grave observers of the method of providence must 
cry out, O wonderful long-suffering of a God! The patience of the meekest man on 
earth, would be quite worn out with less than the half of what a God bears with.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He has the glory of his universal good-will to poor sinners of mankind, 
2 Peter 3:9. forfeited. 1 Timothy 2:4. "Who will have all men to be saved, and 
to come unto the knowledge of the truth." Justice is his act, his strange act; 
but mercy is what he has a peculiar delight in. He is slow to anger, but ready 
to forgive. This is written in very legible characters in this method.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He has the glory of his overcoming goodness. To do evil for good, is 
devilish; to do good for good, is human: but to do good for ill is divine. Here 
shines forth the glory of the divine goodness, overcoming evil with good, Luke 
6:35. This is goodness becoming a God!</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, As to the sinner, it issues always in one of two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) His recovery, to the saving of his soul from sin, and perishing 
eternally. And God, who has a due value for immortal souls, sees that a great 
thing; and treats it as worth the waiting on, Luke 15:7. The Scripture holds out 
this as a noble attainment, James 5:20. "Let him know, that he which converts 
the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and hide a 
multitude of sins." How many are there singing Hallelujahs in Heaven this day, 
by means of the slow method, that by the swift method had been roaring with the 
damned? "Had I died before threescore and sixteen, I had perished, for I knew 
not Christ." Turk. hist. pag. 96.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Or else his being left inexcusable, Romans 1:20. The longer God has 
borne with, and the more kind he has been to impenitent sinners, the more 
inexcusable they will be; and the more will God's severity against them be 
justified. And so this method tends to the clearing of God's justice.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, In the slow method God takes with sinners, be often has an eye to 
posterity; and that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To posterity in general. And it is of use to them, whether the sinner so 
spared repent or not. If he repent, it is of noble use to encourage them that 
come after, to turn to God. How useful to many one has been the slow method 
which God took with Manasseh and Paul! 1 Timothy 1:16. If he repent not, and 
vengeance seize him at length in sight of the world, he becomes a warning piece 
to others that come after, Psalm 37:35–37. Though it do not, his memory rots; 
and the conscience of every one that notices his wickedness silent and at an end 
in the grave, judges him to have spent his life foolishly, Job 24:19, 20. Thus 
many who are of no use in the world to others but for mischief, God in his 
providence makes good use of them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the sinners' own posterity; and that,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, To their posterity yet unborn. There may be vessels of mercy in the 
loins of vessels of wrath. Many graceless parents have been fathers and mothers 
of gracious children. It is for the elect's sake that the world is kept up; and 
if the last elect were born and brought in, the world will quickly be at an end. 
The law spares a condemned woman, if she is with child, until she has brought it 
forth: and God often spares long, condemned sinners, for the elect that may be 
in their loins, Matthew 24:22. There was a sentence passed against the 
generation which came out of Egypt, which for this very reason was about 
thirty-eight years before it was executed on some.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, To their posterity already born; and that two ways.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As Satan gives some a surfeit of religion and sobriety in their parents; 
so God makes reprisals on him, by giving others a horror of sin and wickedness 
in theirs, Ezekiel 8:14. And God spares them, that they may be a glass wherein 
their posterity may have a view of the hatefulness of sin. A wretched office, 
but it justifies the slow method of a holy God.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) men are often punished in their posterity. Many a poor child has smarted 
upon the occasion of the parent, and many a fair and flourishing family has 
wickedness raised. A holy just God sometimes pursues quarrels against some 
evil-workers through several generations, as is threatened in the second 
command. The third and fourth generation are mentioned, because men may live to 
see themselves punished in their children, grandchildren, and 
great-grandchildren. And they may be spared in this slow method for that very 
end. Witness Zedekiah.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, In the slow method God takes with sinners, he has an eye to his own 
people: 2 Corinthians 4:15, "For all things are for your sakes, that the 
abundant grace might, through the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of 
God." As the world is kept up for the sake of God's people, so it is guided as 
it is by providence for their sakes. And it is their good that is designed by 
it: Romans 8:28, "And we know that all things work together for good, to to them 
that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." The way 
that it comes to be for their good, is by means of the sharp trial they have by 
it. So God takes the slow method with ungodly sinners for the trial of his own 
children. And it is a sharp trial to them two ways.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They smart sore under their wickedness. Ungodly men are God's rod, as the 
Assyrians was God's hand against his people, Psalm 17:14. Oft-times they feel as 
much at their hand, as makes them smart by the rod: Habakkuk 1:12, "O Lord, you 
have ordained them for judgment, and O mighty God, you have established them for 
correction." They always see as much of them, as occasions to them many a heavy 
heart, verse 3, "Why do you show me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? 
for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and 
contention." Wherefore since God's people need the rod, it is preserved, and not 
flung into the fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Meanwhile this tends to their good. The ungodly oblige them to pray, watch, 
live in the exercise of faith, more than otherwise they would do. Hence many 
times the most tender Christians are found among the most notoriously profane 
neighbors, like Lot in Sodom, who carried not so well in the cave. For as the 
godly are eyesores to the wicked, so the wicked are often as whetstones and 
files to the godly.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They smart the sorer under their own afflictions: Psalm 73:10, "Therefore 
his people return hither: and waters of a fall cup wrung out to them." The 
prosperity of the wicked carries the afflictions of the godly to a pitch; and 
sometimes to a dangerous pitch, through the sleight of Satan improving it 
against them. This was the case of Asaph, Psalm 73:12–14, "Behold, these are the 
ungodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in riches. Truly, I have 
cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence. For all the day 
long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning." Job's friend's acted 
Satan's part on that bottom, endeavoring to prove him an unsound man, because he 
was a man so afflicted.</p>
<p align="justify">But this also tends to their good. It makes them look more concernedly into 
their Bible, and find sweet and relief where otherwise they would find no more 
than others do; as we see in Asaph's case, Psalm 73:16, 17, "When I thought to 
know this, it was too painful for me: until I went into the sanctuary of God; 
then understood I their end." And it makes them to look more narrowly into their 
own hearts, and to their sincerity, Job 10:7. It obliges them to live more by 
faith, and not by sight; to the exercise of hope, patience, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, In this slow method, God often carries on his awful yet holy work 
of hardening sinners. There is such a work: Romans 9:18, "Therefore has he mercy 
on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will, he hardens." And it is a most 
dreadful plague and judgment, whereby God ceasing to punish men for their sins 
one way, punishes them another way in a dreadful manner. This appears, if you 
consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a spiritual stroke, lighting on the soul, and therefore, more 
terrible than external strokes on people's bodies or substance, Romans 1:28. 
Hereby the mind is blinded, the will doubly enslaved to lust, and the conscience 
seared: a kind of stroke rife this day.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a stroke, whereby the disease of sin is increased, and the 
gospel-remedy is rendered ineffectual. The heart being hardened, the loose is 
given to lusts that before were under some restraint, Ephesians 4:19; and the 
means of grace become useless, if not noxious: the hardened heart turning the 
food of the soul, as it were, to poison in effect, Isaiah 6:10; 2 Corinthians 
2:16.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a fearful preparative to utter destruction, Romans 9:22. A nasty 
earthen vessel, that gets leave to contract more and more nastiness, and is not 
purged and cleansed, is designed to be broken in pieces, and thrown away: 
Ezekiel 24:13, "In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and 
you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, 
until I have caused my fury to rest upon you." So it is awful.</p>
<p align="justify">Yet it is a holy work in the hand of the Lord. God is holy in his hardening, 
as well as in his softening-work, Isaiah 6:3, compared with verse 10. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. God hardens no soft hearts, hardens none but those who first harden 
themselves, Romans 1:28. Men first shut their own eyes to the light, and then a 
just God blinds their eyes: they are willful in their sin, and God gives them 
their will, Hosea 4:17. For who can say he is obliged to strive on with them 
still?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Sin is a meet punishment of sin, Romans 1:27. And therefore it is just 
with God to punish sin by sin, to take off the restraint from those who cannot 
endure it; to let them fall into the mire, and lie in it, that will needs be in 
it.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, God in this slow method often carries on this hardening work; and that 
both on the sinner himself and others.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In this method oft-times the sinner himself is hardened judicially. God is 
at much pains with sinners to bring them back from their sinful courses; he 
trysts them with rebukes from his word, convictions, terrors, and anxieties, and 
adds to these sharp crosses and afflictions. But they struggle against all 
these, and over the belly of them pursue their sins: so God judicially hardens 
them, and carries on that fearful work in the slow method.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Denying or withdrawing his grace, and giving them up to their own lusts, 
Psalm 81:12. There is restraining grace given to many, who never get sanctifying 
grace; good motions, thoughts, and convictions are put into their hearts: these 
the Lord withdraws, and leaves men to the swing of their corruptions; as he did 
Ephraim, Hosea 4:17, "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone." They rebel 
against the light, and the Lord lets it die out. They are impatient of 
restraint, and the Lord takes it off. They like the government of their lusts, 
and the Lord gives them up to them.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Giving them up to Satan to be hardened by him, as the executioner of 
God's just vengeance, 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4. Men resisting, grieving, and vexing 
the Holy Spirit of God, provoke him to depart, and to leave them in the hand of 
the evil spirit, who then finds easy work with them; as in Saul's case. Hereby 
Satan's power over them is confirmed, the opposition to his interest in them is 
much removed, and so his influence over them is increased.</p>
<p align="justify">God proceeding in the slow method with the sinner in this case, does awfully 
carry on the hardening work upon him. In which we may observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Their impunity hardens them. They venture on sin, God in anger lets them 
go on unpunished, Hosea 4:14. And Satan and their own corrupt hearts improve 
that to the encouraging and strengthening them in their sins. Thence a wind from 
Hell rises that fills their sails. Hence in the text, Because sentence against 
an evil work is not executed speedily; therefore the heart of the sons of men is 
fully set in them to do evil.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Their prosperity in the world hardens them: Psalm 73:5, 6, "They are not 
in trouble as other men: neither are they plagued like other men. Therefore 
pride compasses them about as a chain: violence covers them as a garment." The 
hotter the sun shines, the clay becomes the harder: and the warmer the sun of 
worldly prosperity shines on the sinner given up to his own lusts and the power 
of Satan, he, like a dunghill, becomes the harder, and sends forth the more rank 
savor.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In the soft dealings of Providence with them, objects, occasions, and 
means to do their ill works, are justly laid before them: they are tempted, 
flattered, and encouraged by others. And thus the warm influence of providence 
on them in external things, which should lead them to repentance, is, by means 
of their own lusts to which they are left, turned hardening and ruining to them: 
Proverbs 1:32, "For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the 
prosperity of fools shall destroy them." These are to them like a full wind to a 
ship without ballast, in a storm.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Proper means for checking them are in the just judgment of God rendered 
ineffectual, and that hardens them. Thus it was with Pharaoh: the miracle of the 
rod turned into a serpent, waters into blood, bringing in the frogs, seemed to 
Pharaoh's eye-sight done by the magicians too. And thus were they rendered 
ineffectual to him.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Lastly, The adversity and frowns of Providence on the serious godly, 
harden them, Job 12:4, 5, 6. These are improved, by the sleight of Satan, to the 
contempt of both the religious and religion.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In this method God carries on a hardening work upon ungodly spectators of 
it. Hence there is a woe to the world, because of offences, Matthew 18:7. The 
generality of men have so little sense of religion, and insight into the 
mysteries of Providence, that they are apt to think that that is the best way 
which is the most prosperous, Proverbs 19:4. Hence there was a generation that 
would needs make that the standard of religion; Jeremiah 44:17, 18, "But we will 
certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense 
unto the queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have 
done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and 
in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, 
and saw no evil. But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of Heaven, 
and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have 
been consumed by the sword, and by the famine." And so the Lord does in his holy 
providence lay that method of it before worldly and carnal men, at which they, 
by reason of their own willful blindness, do stumble, to their own ruin, Malachi 
3:14, 15, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">Fifthly, The general method of Providence in managing the world, is soft to 
his adversaries, and sharp to his own children in this life: 1 Corinthians 
15:19, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most 
miserable." Revelation 3:19, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten." This is 
the general rule, thought it admits of exceptions, both in the case of the one 
and the other. God's adversaries sometimes meet with sharp things, his children 
with soft. But the general and ordinary course of providence is soft to the 
former, and sharp to the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">This appears particularly in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God's children are held shorter by the head, in point of particular 
rebukes of Providence, than his adversaries are.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, God sharply notices many things in his own, that he will pass in 
others, and greater too. Hence said Job, "If I sin, then you mark me, and you 
will not acquit me from mine iniquity," chapter 10:14. The common proverb holds 
here, One man had better steal a horse, than another look over the hedge. A 
child of God many times pays dearer for a vain thought, than others for a vile 
action; for a rash word, than others for blasphemy and contrived wickedness. How 
did Moses smart for an unadvised word? Psalm 106:32, 33, "They angered him also 
at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: because 
they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips." Compare 
Numbers 20:10, 12, "And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together 
before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, you rebels; must we fetch you 
water out of this rock? And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron, Because you 
believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel; therefore 
you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them." 
But see Psalm 73:9, 10. "They set their mouth against the heavens; and their 
tongue walks through the earth. Therefore his people return hither; and waters 
of a full cup are wrung out to them."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, When both meet with rebukes for an ill thing, his own oft-times get the 
sharpest. Hence the lamenting church says, Lamentations 1:12. "Is it nothing to 
you, all you that pass by? behold and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my 
sorrow, which is done unto me, with which the Lord has afflicted me, in the day 
of his fierce anger." The controversy for unworthy communicating was pleaded 
with some godly Corinthians, to the sickening of their bodies, yes even to 
death, 1 Cor.11:30. "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many 
sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A lot of adversity is in a peculiar manner the lot of God's people in this 
life, and the world smiles most on its own friends: John 16:33. "These things 
have I spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall 
have tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." Psalm 73:10. 
"Therefore his people return hither; and waters of a full cup are wrung out to 
them." In the case of the church and people of God in this life, adversity seems 
to be the rule and ordinary course, prosperity the exception: but in the case of 
the men of the world, prosperity the rule, and adversity the exception. This 
appears,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, From the Scripture, wherein we find the rod of adversity the beaten path 
in which the saints under the Old and New Testament have walked: the godly often 
groaning under the weight of their own afflictions, and the weight of prosperous 
wickedness in their enemies. The Cainites build cities, and have the harp and 
organ among them; while the church dwell still in tents: Abraham a stranger in 
the land of promise, while the cursed Canaanites enjoy it: Jacob's posterity in 
slavery in Egypt, while the Edomites were settled in their own land, having a 
king of their own. Perhaps among the Jews in Canaan worldly prosperity was more 
annexed to piety, agreeable to the dispensation they were under, wherein 
temporal promises bear great bulk. But consider that people in comparison with 
other nations, and you will find their prosperity very short, in comparison of 
their neighbors, and their adversity very long: Zechariah 1:11, 12. "And they 
answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We 
have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sits still, 
and is at rest. Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of hosts, 
how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah, 
against which you have had indignation these threescore and ten years?" But 
under the New Testament the thing is most clear. Our Savior points out this as 
the stated method of Providence; Luke 6:20–26. "And Jesus lifted up his eyes on 
his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. 
Blessed are you that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are you that 
weep now: for you shall laugh. Blessed are you that when men shall hate you, and 
when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and 
cast out your name as evil, for the son of man's sake. Rejoice you in that day, 
and leap for joy: for behold your reward is great in Heaven: for in the like 
manner did their fathers unto the prophets. But woe unto you that are rich: for 
you have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full: for you shall 
hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now: for you shall mourn and weep. Woe unto you 
when all men shall speak well of you: for so did their fathers to the false 
prophets." Chapter 16:25. "But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your 
lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he 
is comforted, and you are tormented."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, From experience and observation. One needs but to open his eyes, and 
look about through the world, and he cannot miss to see the world's greatest 
favors bestowed on them who have least sense of God and religion; wickedness 
triumphant, while serious godliness is pressed down; sinners often laughing 
while saints weep.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, this method becomes the divine wisdom. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) At this rate the evil have a taste of good, and the good a taste of 
evil, Luke 16:25. forfeited. The former, who will at length drink deep of 
endless sorrow, are patiently borne with, to bring them to repentance: the 
latter, who shall rejoice for evermore, have now the trial of a weeping time.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As a father is more concerned for, and exact in the correcting of the 
faults of his own children, than of his servants; so is our Father in Heaven 
with respect to his family. The more he loves, the more he corrects with his 
rod: Amos 3:2, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: 
therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." There are some who are to 
dwell with him forever: there are others who are to depart from him forever. 
What wonder, that he is at more pains to purify the former than the latter!</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) This is most agreeable to the way he took with his own Son and his 
enemies. While Christ was in the world, he was a man of sorrows, and acquainted 
with grief; the wind blew in his face continually, until he was cruelly put to 
death on the cross. The axe lay at the root of the Jewish church and state, his 
enemies; yet was it not wielded against them all the time he was among them, nor 
until about forty years after. This was the pattern that is copied after in this 
method: Romans 8:29, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine to be 
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many 
brethren."</p>
<p align="justify">Sixthly, Though the slow method seems strange to us short-sighted creatures, 
it is not at all strange being viewed, in the looking-glass of the infinite perfections 
of the divine nature. A thing will appear in a shallow river, that being cast 
into the sea will appear no more. We wonder at the slow method of providence, 
while we look to men; but we will cease to wonder if we look to God, and 
observe, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. God is eternal, from everlasting to everlasting, Psalm 90:2. If men do not 
soon pursue their quarrels, death may snatch them away, and they can have no 
access more to do it: but however long the Lord delays pleading his quarrel, he 
can lose no time, for he is eternal.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In God's eternal duration there are no differences of time; all is present 
to him. Time is for measuring created beings, but not the infinite being. So a 
thousand years and one day are alike unto him, whatever odds there is between 
them to us: Psalm 90:4, "For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday 
when it is past, and as a watch in the night." This consideration the apostle 
suggests, 2 Peter 3:8, "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a 
thousand years as one day."</p>
<p align="justify">3. He sees exactly the time appointed for execution against every impenitent 
sinner, and will not let it pass beyond that, one moment: Habakkuk 2:3, "For the 
vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: 
though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry." 
We see the beginning and middle of things, but cannot foresee the end. God sees 
all at once. Well can he bear with ungodly sinners, for he sees their day coming 
with speed, Psalm 37:13. What needs haste in respect of God? for he sees the 
sinful creature is fading, and will drop down into a grave before long, Psalm 
78:38, 39.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He knows what be intends to do, and none can hinder: Daniel 4:37, "All the 
King of heaven's works are truth, and his ways judgment, and those that walk in 
pride he is able to abase. The prince that is afraid of the rebels, will strive 
to crush them before they gather to a head; but he who knows he can crush them 
when he will, may let them gather all their strength together. God can carry on 
the designs of his glory, by bearing long with impenitent sinners: Romans 9:17, 
"For the scripture says unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised 
you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared 
throughout all the earth." Thus also he can laugh at the trial of the innocent: 
Job 9:23, "If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the 
innocent." Like a father holding his child in his hands over I a deep pool; the 
child cries, and the father smiles.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, He is infinitely blessed in himself; and nothing the creature can 
do against him can hurt him; nor in the least disturb his repose in himself: Job 
35:6, 8, "If you sin, what do you against him? or if your transgressions be 
multiplied, what do you unto him? Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and 
your righteousness may profit the son of man." If the whole creation should 
conspire against him, opening their mouths against the heavens, and doing to the 
utmost of their power against him; he might despise their impotent malice, they 
would be but like men running their heads against a rock. The longest interval 
of time cannot make him weary: Isaiah 40:28, "Have you not known? have you not 
heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, 
faints not, neither is weary?</p>
<p align="justify">Seventhly, There is a necessity for both the swift and slow methods being 
used by Providence in the government of the world; it is so corrupt and 
atheistic. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The swift method is necessary to show, that there is a God to judge upon 
the earth: Psalm 58:10, 11, "The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the 
vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. So that a man 
shall say, Truly there is a reward for the righteous: truly he is a God that 
judges in the earth." For as ordinary as the slow method is, there are never 
wanting instances now and then of swift process against ungodly sinners: which 
is necessary to bear testimony to the being of a God, and of a providence 
concerned in human affairs. And there are as many of these, as may give 
sufficient warning to all.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The slow method is necessary, to show there is a judgment to come: 2 
Thessalonians 1:4–7, "We ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your 
patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure. 
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be 
counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer: seeing it is a 
righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and 
to you who are troubled, rest with us: when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed 
from Heaven, with his mighty angels," etc. What the carnal world improves in 
behalf of Atheism, is necessary to prevent Sadduceism: for if all men's 
wickedness were punished in this life, it would thence be concluded, that there 
were no after-reckoning: but there is never a sentence passed against an evil 
work, that is missed to be executed now, but is a pledge of the judgment to 
come.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The slowest vengeance against impenitent sinners will be sure 
vengeance; and the slower it is in coming, it will be the sorer when it comes: 
Deuteronomy 32:35, "To me belongs vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall 
slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that 
shall come upon them make haste." The old world was spared a hundred and twenty 
years, but was swept away at length.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let sinners be spared never so long, not one of all their ill works will, 
or can be forgotten. They may have forgot them themselves, but God never will. 
There is a book of remembrance of their ill, as well as of the saint's good 
words and works: Amos 8:7, "The Lord has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, 
Surely I will never forget any of their works." Psalm 50:21, "These things have 
you done, and I kept silence: you though test that I was altogether such a one 
as yourself: but I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The longer sinners are spared, their counts will be the greater, and all 
will come on at once, Luke 11:50, 51; 1 Samuel 3:12. It is people's mercy, that 
God ceases not to be a reprover to them; as it is the mercy of weak people to 
pay their debt by littles, whereas they are broken if it get leave to run on.</p>
<p align="justify">3. When it comes on the impenitent sinner, God will charge both the interest 
and the principal sum together. They shall not only pay for their ill works, but 
for their mercies, and the sparing they have gotten: Romans 2:4, 5, "Or Despise 
you the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing 
that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? But after your hardness and 
impenitent heart, treasures up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath, and 
revelation of the righteous judgment of God." What aggravated their sin, will 
aggravate their condemnation and punishment.</p>
<p align="justify">And how long soever the execution of the sentence against ungodly sinners, 
evil-workers, may be delayed, and how many external favors of providence be 
heaped on them; all will appear but small and short, when one considers,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The severity of the execution when it comes. They will at length be cut 
asunder, Matthew 24:51. In flaming fire he will take vengeance on them, 2 
Thessalonians 1:8. They will fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The eternity of it. That is a killing aggravation in the sentence, 
Depart into everlasting fire. If the worm were once awakened, and set on them, 
it dies not; the fire once kindled, will not be quenched.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. 1. Of Information. What is said may inform us,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That present ease and prosperity in the world is not a sure sign of God's 
special favor, Ecclesiastes 9:1, 2. Indeed men are apt to construe it so; and 
Satan and the deceitful heart help them to draw such a conclusion. But so far is 
it from being such a sign, that it may very well consist with their being in a 
state of wrath, under a sentence of condemnation; and is so with many.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That present ease, impunity, and prosperity, is no security against the 
time to come. Men are ready to be secure upon it, and to dream that tomorrow 
will be as this day: Psalm 10:6, "He has said in his heart, I shall not be 
moved: for I shall never be in adversity." But the mountain may be standing sure 
now, that before long may be overturned. The sun shined fair on Sodom, the 
morning of that day in which God rained fire and brimstone on it. The rich man 
was full of thoughts of ease in that day, in the night whereof he was struck, 
Luke 12:18, 19, 20.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There cannot be such worth in outward prosperity, nor such evil in 
affliction, as we generally imagine. For a holy, wise God would never heap what 
is really best on the objects of his wrath, and what is really worst on the 
objects of his love. Were there as much real value in the world's wealth, ease, 
and honor, health, strength, silver, gold, etc. as we imagine; or were there as 
much evil in trouble, adversity, etc. as we think, would they be so dealt, as 
that the greatest share of the former should be given to the condemned, and of 
the latter to the justified? It is owing to the weakness of human sight, that so 
much beauty appears in some human faces, and in some victuals we feed on. If 
they were looked to with a microscope, the beauty would disappear. Faith is the 
microscope here, Ecclesiastes 1:2; 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.</p>
<p align="justify">4. God is a patient and long-suffering God, not subject to passions as we 
are, 2 Peter 3:9. If he were liable to the transports of passion as we are, the 
world would have been many times burnt to ashes before now; considering the 
provocations given to the eyes of his glory. But the infinite mind enjoys the 
profoundest serenity and calm, beholding all the confusions of evil-workers in 
the world.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Sad and heavy strokes may be abiding a land and generation, though 
long warded off. Long has the Lord borne with this apostatizing generation in 
principle and practice; and long have Woe been threatened: and through the 
delay, we have been brought to say, "The days are prolonged, and every vision 
fails," Ezekiel 12:22. But a reprieve is no pardon; the cloud is still hanging 
over our heads, and it is to be feared, that some will live to see a fearful 
breaking of it.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Exhortation. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let ungodly sinners be exhorted to repent of their evil works, and beware 
of abusing the divine patience with them. You have heard the slow method 
rationally accounted for: If hereafter you will deceive yourselves, and turn the 
grace of God into wantonness, encouraging yourselves in sin from your impunity 
and prosperity; know, that you are willfully blind, that you shall be 
inexcusable, and your blood will be on your heads. But,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Let the sense of gratitude move you to repentance, Romans 2:4. Think 
with yourselves, what case you had been in, if God had struck you down, as he 
could, in the very act of your evil work; how you might have been beyond all 
hope and possibility of recovery. You owe your life to the slow method of 
providence; his patience exercised towards you has kept your soul back from the 
pit. Therefore repent, and go no farther on.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Let the account you have heard of the slow method, frighten you from 
abusing it. I am sure, you cannot but see now, that there is no ground to take 
encouragement to sin from it. Consider what has been said, and show yourselves 
men. If you go on to abuse it so, you make a jest of a most serious and wise 
dispensation of providence. You turn your food into poison, and stumble at 
noon-day. And it will be a sure presage of everlasting ruin to you: Hosea 14:9, 
"Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know 
them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but 
the transgressors shall fall therein."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let all beware of censuring the slow method of providence with ungodly 
sinners, evil workers. Take heed how you speak on that head; beware of risings 
of the corrupt heart upon it. For however rationally you think you pronounce 
upon the matter, sooner or later you shall be made to recant that sentence, 
either in mercy, as Job did, chapter 42:3, and as Asaph did, Psalm 73:22, or in 
wrath, Malachi 3:14, 15, with 18. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, There may be a mystery in the dispensations of providence; but there can 
be no iniquity, error, or mistake: Deuteronomy 32:4, "He is the rock, his work 
is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, 
just and right is he." Silently adore that wisdom and the deep design of 
providence which you cannot see through, that certainly are in the slow method 
God uses with some ungodly sinners, evil-workers. Though you cannot see how 
God's glory can miss to suffer by it, believe that God will doubtless get glory 
by it.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The mystery of that dispensation in the case of every ungodly sinner, 
will be opened out before the world at length, to the satisfaction of all humble 
waiters; and the confusion of the impenitent evil-workers, scoffers, and 
murmurers: 1 Corinthians 4:5, "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord 
come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make 
manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of 
God. Be not rash, wait the end, and then you shall be allowed to judge: Proverbs 
18:13, "He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame unto 
him." But why should you judge of the web of providence before it be wrought 
out?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Fret not at, neither envy prosperous wickedness: Proverbs 23:17, "Let not 
your heart envy sinners: but be you in the fear of the Lord all the day long," 
Psalm 37:1, "Fret not yourself because of evil-doers, neither be you envious 
against the workers of iniquity." Who would envy the state of a condemned man, 
though he have a long reprieve, and enjoy many comforts in the iron house? Such 
is the case of the ungodly, whatever world's ease they have. And therefore they 
are just objects of pity and compassion, but not of envy. One had better be a 
pardoned one in the depth of worldly misery, than in a state of wrath and 
condemnation in the top of worldly felicity, "For what is a man profited, if he 
shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in 
exchange for his soul? Matthew 16:26. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Such fretting and envy proceeds from a distempered 
    heart: Psalm 73:22, "So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before 
    you." See Malachi 3:15. It is the produce of a mixture of ignorance, 
    rashness and inconsideration, unbelief and worldly-mindedness. And there needs only to cure it, to have our 
eyes opened, to see things in their true state; the laying aside of unruly 
passions; faith and due weanedness from the world: Psalm 37:1. 2, "Fret not 
yourself because of evil-doers, neither be you envious against the workers of 
iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the 
green herb."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Every one's state is to be rated, according as it is before God. If God 
be one's friend, he is a happy man, though the world should never give him its 
word nor kind look. If God is one's enemy, he is a miserable man, though all the 
men and things of the world should favor him to his wish. For as is one's state 
with God, so is his present safety; and so will be his well or woe through 
eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Let all learn to regulate their conduct by the example of God in this his 
government of the world, so far as it is proposed for our imitation: Ephesians 
5:1. "Be you therefore followers of God as dear children." And we may learn from 
it,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, To be patient and slow to anger. How ill does it become us to be so 
ready to fire at every provocation, against our fellow-creatures; when the 
highest One uses so much patience towards us? Matthew 18:23, etc. The more 
meekly and patiently one carries himself, he is the more like unto God, who has 
set us an example.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, To learn to bear with sinners, in order to the seeking of their 
recovery: Galatians 6:1. "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which 
are spiritual, restore such an one in the Spirit of meekness; considering 
yourself, lest you also be tempted." Not that we are to suffer sin upon him, so 
far as it is in our power to remove it. God can bring good out of evil, but we 
cannot do that: therefore that part of the conduct of Providence towards the 
ungodly, we are not called to imitate. But let us be followers of God, in 
dealing still with the worst of sinners to recover them, and not give them over 
for hopeless.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, To do good to the worthless, unthankful, and evil: Luke 6:35. "Love you 
your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again: and your reward 
shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind 
unto the unthankful, and to the evil." It is a naughty world, that people had 
need of such a principle to prompt them to do good to others. If we confine our 
good to those that do good to us, what do we more than others? If we confine it 
to those worthy of it, we do it only for the creature's sake. But if we propose 
to follow the example of God, we will do good to all as we have access, and act 
from a Christian principle in it.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Let us not be secure with respect to the case of the land and 
generation we live in. Let us not think that God has forgotten the iniquity of 
our fathers in their perfidy and cruelty against the godly for his cause; or 
that he approves of the course of apostasy from the truth and holiness of the 
gospel this day, whereby the present generation has entered itself heir to the 
apostatizing, persecuting generation that went before. The sentence is not 
executed, yet it is but delayed; therefore we may look for it, if repentance 
prevent it not.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. God's delay of execution is often miserably abused by sinners, 
to the filling of their hearts to do evil, and sinning more and more.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Point out the abuse of God's patience in the delay of execution, that 
ungodly sinners make, to the filling of their hearts to do evil.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show how it comes to pass, that sinners so abuse God's patience with 
them.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make application of the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall point out the abuse of God's patience in the delay of execution, 
that ungodly sinners make, to the filling of their hearts to do evil.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They abuse it to carnal security: Psalm 10:6, "He has said in his heart, I 
shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity." Finding that God does 
not execute his threatenings against them, they conclude they are in no hazard: 
and they begin to look on them as mere scarecrows, verse 5, "His ways are always 
grievous; your judgments are far above out of his sight." And so they go on 
securely in their ungodly courses. Hence it is that the execution overtakes them 
quite unexpectedly: 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3, "The day of the Lord so comes as a 
thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden 
destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall 
not escape."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They abuse it to a sensual life, wherein their aim is not to keep a clean 
conscience, but to gratify their senses, as their circumstances in the world 
will permit; as the rich man did, Luke 12:19, "I will say to my soul, Soul, you 
have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink and be 
merry." So the more that Providence favors them in external things, the more 
sensual they are, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind: Hosea 
13:6, "According to their pasture, so were they filled: they were filled, and 
their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me." Hence the lives of 
many are trifled away, and wholly spent in making provision for the flesh, "the 
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." And that is 
endless business: Ecclesiastes 1:8, "All things are full of labor, man cannot 
utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with 
hearing."</p>
<p align="justify">3. They abuse it to impudence in sin, Jeremiah 6:14, 15. When God strikes men 
in a sinful course, they are ashamed readily as pointed at by the hand of 
Heaven, as transgressors: but when men prosper in a sinful course, they put on a 
brow of brass, they gather a stock of impudence in sin, as if Providence had 
given them a patent for wickedness: Psalm 73:5, 6, "They are not in trouble as 
other men: neither are they plagued like other men. Therefore pride compasses 
them about as a chain: violence covers them as a garment."</p>
<p align="justify">4. They abuse it to contempt of God, and all that is sacred: Psalm 73:9, 
"They set their mouth against the heavens; and their tongue walks through the 
earth." Agur saw the danger of this snare, and therefore prayed thus, Proverbs 
30:8, 9, "Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty, nor 
riches, feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full, and deny you, and 
say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God 
in vain." Israel fell into it: Deuteronomy 32:15, "Jeshurun waxed fat, and 
kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; 
then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his 
salvation." The ungodly have not love to God: if they have anything that way of 
such affections, it is fear of him, a slavish fear of his wrath, springing from 
the love of themselves: this fear they lose also, when God delays to strike. And 
so it issues in contempt, as is natural in the case of one we neither love nor 
fear. And then all that is sacred is despised.</p>
<p align="justify">5. They abuse it to sinning more diffusely, giving loose reins to their 
several lusts, Jeremiah 7:9, 10. One sin makes way for another, and prosperity 
in a sinful course gives many occasions of sin: and as the vicious stomach, the 
more it receives, breeds the more ill humours; so the more one prospers in a 
sinful course, the more vile does he grow.</p>
<p align="justify">6. They abuse it to sinning more eagerly; Ephesians 4:19, "Being past 
feeling, they have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all 
impurity with greediness." The more that lusts are fed, the more strong they 
grow, and carry out the man more violently to satisfy them. So that the heart in 
that case is like a ship having a full gale of wind, and is eagerly set to do 
evil.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, They abuse it to incorrigibleness and obstinacy in sin, Jeremiah 
22:21. A prosperous sinner quickly gets above reproofs, Hosea 4:4. As affliction 
tends to humble, prosperity puffs up an ungracious heart: and the heart swelled 
with pride scorns to stoop, until God by his grace or judgments do lay it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How comes it to pass that sinners so abuse God's patience with them?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Sin reigning in the ungodly, fear of wrath is their highest motive to 
good, and most forcible restraint from evil: and so when that restraint is taken 
off by the delay of execution again and again; the heart naturally goes to its 
own bias, and is like the wild ass's colt snuffing up the wind at her pleasure. 
The love of holiness for itself, and likeness to God, would prevent it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They mistake the design of providence. They misinterpret the slow method 
of procedure with them, Psalm 50:21. The design of it is to lead them to 
repentance; but that they notice not. But they construe it, as if God approved 
of their ways, or had such a regard for them, that he will not be so angry with 
them, as one would make them believe: they cannot think that he is so very angry 
at their sin, while they prosper in it by his providence.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a root of Atheism in the hearts of all men naturally, and it 
reigns in the ungodly: Psalm 14:1, "The fool has said in his heart, There is no 
God." Unless God be every now and then proving his being, providence, and 
justice to them, by his works of judgment on themselves; they are apt to forget 
him, and deny him. It is the interest of men wedded to their lusts, that there 
were not a God; or, if there be, that he were not such as the scripture 
represents him. So they are ready to entertain everything that may favor it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, The Lord often in that way carries on a holy hardening work. In 
which case, Satan and the evil heart conspire to this abuse.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information. This lets us see,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That we need not be surprised to see sinners escaping with one evil work 
fall into another, and so on; growing still more vile, the more outward favors 
are heaped on them. It is but a fulfilling of this scripture. Providence often 
has an odd aspect in our view, until we carry the matter to the Bible; and there 
we see it exactly answering the word.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is good for men to be under frequent rebukes of Providence. Affliction 
is sore, but it is the more safe lot, Psalm 119:71. In the one men are put in 
mind of their sins, in the other they are apt to forget both their God and 
themselves. It would be profitable for the afflicted to consider the wretched 
abuse the heart is ready to make of ease and prosperity.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Slow vengeance will be sore vengeance, when it comes. For the longer it is 
a-coming, sin goes the deeper: the more God spares impenitents, the more they 
treasure up wrath against the day of wrath; the counts run on, and swell the 
more. So whether we consider it coming on in time or in eternity, the heavier 
will it be.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Great is the corruption of human nature. See it here as in a 
glass, how the mercy and goodness of God is despised by the corrupt heart, that 
will not be drawn by such cords of love. See how it turns our food into poison, 
and that which should be for our welfare into a snare and trap. See it an 
ungrateful nature, apt to be insensible of the ties of gratitude to our best 
benefactor.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Exhortation. Take heed of abusing the patience of a long-suffering 
God, of turning his grace, goodness, and forbearance into wantonness, of your 
heart filling to do evil while God spares.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider the evil of it. There is in it,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, An over-valuing of ourselves, as if we deserved not to be worse treated, 
and therefore were nothing obliged to our benefactor: Habakkuk 1:16, "They 
sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag: because by them 
their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous." Men, who are not bettered by 
God's goodness, their hearts swell in pride, as patience is used towards them: 
Psalm 73:5, 6, "They are not in trouble as other men: neither are they plagued 
like other men. Therefore pride compasses them about as a chain: violence covers 
them as a garment."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, An undervaluing of others whom providence does not treat so softly. 
Hence Job said, chapter 12:5, "He who is ready to slip with his feet, is as a 
lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease." How lightly do many that 
are at ease, look on the heavy things others suffer? They are as unconcerned 
with them, as if they were creatures of an inferior rank. Were men sensible of 
God's goodness, in his patience towards them, it would make them sympathize with 
others, wondering that it is not worse with themselves, 2 Chronicles 28:10.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, A monstrous abuse of the creature, and comforts of life, Hosea 2:8. The 
use of the creature was given to man, for his comfort indeed; but always in 
subserviency to the glory of God. But abusers of divine patience turn the 
weapons against God, which he has armed them with for his service: Deuteronomy 
32:15, "But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown 
thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and 
lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation." They are called adulterers and 
adulteresses, James 4:4, because they bestow God's good gifts on their lusts, 
verse 3. Hence the creation groans under the burden of the ungodly, 
evil-workers, Romans 8:22.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, A denying the due tribute to our Sovereign Lord and King. All that we 
have we hold of him, in the way of free mercy, Lamentations 3:22. The king in 
his palace, and the beggar in his cottage, is God's tenant: our food and 
clothing, coarse or fine, with conveniences of life, are given us of God. We can 
pay him nothing, but the tribute of praise in our lips and lives: and that is 
denied. Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">5thly, Monstrous ingratitude, a sin of a deep dye: Deuteronomy 32:6, "Do you 
thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that 
has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?" It is a devilish 
disposition of heart, that cannot be won with benefits; a base spirit, which 
good done them cannot engage. But abusers of mercies, the more God loads them 
with benefits, the more they load him with their provocations. Ah! shall men 
sin, because grace abounds? shall their hearts be filled in them to do evil, 
because sentence against an evil work is not speedily executed?</p>
<p align="justify">6thly, Practical blasphemy, as if men should say, they are hired to be vile, 
Jeremiah 7:9, 10. Abusers of the doctrine of the gospel, to licentiousness, make 
Christ the minister of sin: therefore abusers of the kind providence of God to 
that end, make God in his government of the world so. While Heaven smiles in 
outward favors on men, and they use them so, the language of that practice is 
blasphemous.</p>
<p align="justify">7thly, Much Atheism and contempt of God. It is a denial of his providence, as 
if he had no concern about human affairs, Ezekiel 9:9. It makes a jest of his 
threatenings in his word, 2 Peter 3:3, 4. It misrepresents his holy nature, 
Psalm 50:21, or bids him defiance, Isaiah 5:19, and throws off his yoke, Psalm 
12:4.</p>
<p align="justify">2 Consider the danger of it. If you go on so,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, You will make your recovery yes more and more hopeless, Jeremiah 6:29, 
30. Sin is a current, the farther it runs, the deeper it grows: and the more 
goodness men sin against, the more is their heart hardened, and their 
consciences seared. Withal it provokes God to give up with men, leave striving 
with them, and give them up to their lusts, and to the devil, to be hardened 
more.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, If God have any thoughts of good towards you, it will make your 
recovery more difficult. Strong diseases must have strong remedies: and long abused 
patience will make broken bones, at best; if you be saved, it will be so as by 
fire. At best you are but laying up for bitter repentance: the more loose and 
licentious one is in an unconverted state, the more severe pangs and throes he 
will readily find in the new birth. Witness Manasseh, Paul, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Be it as it will, that patience will have an end; you shall not sin on 
and God spare on very long. The coupling of these two will be broken, and God 
will show you that he will bear no longer with your abuse: Ecclesiastes 7:6, 
"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool." 
You will find God will awake to judgment, and wake you out of your dream; and 
you will either be his converts, or broken to pieces by him.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, The breaking up of patience with you is likely to be very sudden and 
surprising, 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3. So was it with the rich man, Luke 12:19, 20. 
God bore long with the old world, but at length the deluge came on like a 
thunderclap, in the midst of their carnal mirth and jollity. God does it in just 
recompense of long abused patience.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Abused patience, when it breaks off, will turn to fury; and the 
longer God has delayed execution, the more severe will it be when it comes on, 
Leviticus 26:28. The more a man has had in trust, his accounts will be found the 
greater and the harder to clear off, when once the creditors fall on him. It is 
most pleasing to the flesh, to live in ease and fullness; but the abuse of these 
will make a more fearful reckoning, than otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. Though the execution be never so slow, it will be sure, against 
impenitent sinners, evil-workers,</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this doctrine it is proposed to show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. In what respects the execution against impenitent sinners, evil-workers, 
will be sure.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That the execution against them will be sure.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Apply the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">I. In what respects will the execution against impenitent sinners, 
evil-workers, be sure? It will be sure, in respect of,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The full tale of their evil works: Ecclesiastes 12:14, "For God shall 
bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or 
whether it be evil." Neither the multitude of them, nor the long time they lie 
over unreckoned for, will cause any of them to be forgotten. But the ill works 
of the several periods of the sinner's life, will be charged home upon him 
exactly. For God keeps a register of all their evil works, a book that will be 
opened at the last day, Revelation 20:12; and has sworn that none of them shall 
be forgotten, Amos 8:7.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The whole aggravations of their evil works, Jude verse 15. A just God will 
remember against impenitent sinners, the manner as well as the matter of their 
sins; the time, place, and other circumstances of their evil works, will be 
remembered against them. Their abused mercies, the light they rebelled against, 
the warnings from the word and providence they slighted, the effects their ill 
example had on others, the snares others were entangled therein by their means, 
etc. will all be charged on them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The conviction of their own consciences, Jude verse 15. Sinners now find 
ways to cloak and cover their evil works, to deny or mince them: and few will 
now suffer themselves to be admonished or reproved, but they have a great deal 
to say in their own defense; but the lying lips, and tongues that speak proudly, 
will then be put to silence, Matthew 22:12. The light of conscience will then be 
like broad day-light, that is now as the darkness of the night. It will convince 
them clearly of what shall be laid to their charge, that they can no more deny 
it, John 8:9; and of the justice of God it. proceeding against them, Psalm 50:6.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Just punishment brought on them for their evil works, 1 Thessalonians 5:3. 
While God delays, men dream with Agag, that the bitterness of death is past: but 
they will find themselves deceived, as he when Samuel took the sword and hewed 
him in pieces before the Lord. They cannot escape the due demerit of their sin 
at length; but as the needle draws the thread after it, sin will draw wrath. 
Judgment is sin's shadow.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The correspondence there will be between their sin and punishment. God 
will write every ungodly sinner's sin in his punishment. Oft-times it is so here 
with them, as in the case of Adoni-bezek, Judg. 1:7; but always so hereafter, as 
in the case of the rich man, Luke 16:19, with 24. Hence the worm is said never 
to die; signifying the eternal remorse they shall have for their evil works. And 
the degrees of punishment will be suited to the degrees of their sin. They that 
have committed many sins, shall have many stripes.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Its inevitableness, when once patience is come to an end: Luke 13:24, 25, 
"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to 
enter in, and shall not be able. When once the Master of the house is risen up, 
and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the 
door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I 
know you not whence you are." The door of mercy may stand open long, but it will 
be shut at length. And then there is no more espcaping. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Omniscience will find out the flier, and discover his most secret 
crimes, and overthrow all his defences: Hebrews 4:2, "Neither is there any 
creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked, and opened 
unto the eyes of him with whom etc we have to do." Psalm 139:7, "Where shall I 
go from your Spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?" There is no 
blending of the eye of an omniscient judge.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Divine power will bring him under, and cause him to stand and receive 
the just reward of his deeds: Job 9:4, "He is wise in heart, and mighty in 
strength: who has hardened himself against him, and has prospered? There will be 
no resisting of omnipotence: the stoutest sinner will be poured out like water 
before an angry God.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, The divine severity will proceed over the belly of all entreaties, made 
out of time: Luke 13:24, 25. forfeited. They that slight mercy while God's time 
for it lasts, will get no mercy when God's time is out, and theirs is come.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, Its eternity. The execution once on, will never be off; once 
begun, will never end: Mark 9:44. In Hell the worm dies not, and the fire is not 
quenched. While God is, he will pursue the quarrel. The ungodly sin on as long 
as they are in the world, and live on as long as they will, they will not alter 
their course: and God will pursue them forever, when once he has broke off.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That the execution against them will be sure, appears,</p>
<p align="justify">1. From the inviolable regard God has to the honor of his holy law, Isaiah 
42:21. Sinners trample on it, slight its commands, and despise its threatenings; 
but God highly regards it, as that wherein he has eminently expressed the 
holiness of his nature. If sinners then honor it not in the way of duty, it will 
be honored upon them in a way of judgment. God's regard to his law may be seen 
clearly,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In the works of providence. As soon as sin entered into the world, and 
the law was broken, the face of providence on the world was quite changed. And 
it has blown continually since in the face of the creation less or more, Romans 
8:22. Oft-times it has risen to violent storms, to avenge the quarrel of the 
dishonor of the holy law by sinners. Remember how, in that quarrel, Adam was 
driven out of Paradise, the world drowned by the flood, Sodom burnt, Jerusalem 
destroyed, with the many awful strokes brought on impenitent sinners in latter 
times.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, In the work of redemption. God chose some from eternity unto salvation: 
but being breakers of the law, they behooved to be redeemed, and the price paid 
to the full reparation of the honor of the law. Christ the Son of God was their 
Redeemer; but that the law's honor might be seen to, he met with no sparing: 
Romans 8:32, "He spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all." So 
God wrote his regard to the law in the salvation of his elect, and blood of his 
Son.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The truth and veracity of God insures the execution. He has said, he will 
do it: Genesis 2:17, "In the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die." 
His Son has intimated to us from Heaven, that impenitent sinners shall not 
escape: Luke 13:3, "I tell you, Nay, but except you repent, you shall all 
likewise perish." Every leaf of the scripture almost, has something to this 
purpose: "and has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall 
he not make it good?" Numbers 23:19. God's truth must either fail, or ungodly 
sinners be reckoned with at length.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The justice of God requires it: Genesis 18:25, "Shall not the Judge of all 
the earth do right?" Men may be unjust judges, but God cannot. He will give 
every transgression a just recompense of reward: for it is in his power to do 
it, and his nature requires it. He hates sin, and cannot but hate it; and 
therefore though he delay for a time, he will punish.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The constant conduct of providence hitherto confirms it. There have been 
multitudes of ungodly in the world; but may we not put the question, Job 9:4, 
"Who has hardened himself against him, and has prospered?" Some have indeed been 
long spared, but did they not at length either bow or break before him? What 
came of the giants in the old world, of Pharaoh, of Korah, Dathau, and Abiram? 
These things happened for warnings to us. And if any have escaped during life, 
is there not sufficient evidence of execution on them in another world? as is 
evident from the case of the rich man, Luke 16.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The peremptory appointment of the day of general judgment, puts it 
out of question: Acts 17:30, 31, "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; 
but now commands all men everywhere to repent: because he has appointed a day in 
the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he has 
ordained; whereof he has given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him 
from the dead." The Judge is named for that effect already, the commission to 
him for that end has passed the seals in his resurrection; it is to be general, 
all must be judged by him; yes the sentence against the ungodly is conceived 
already, "Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the 
devil and his angels."</p>
<p align="justify">For USE I shall drop a word to,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The ungodly, evil-workers. And to you I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Let not your impunity for the present, make you secure for the time to 
come; as is the case of the wicked man, Psalm 10:6, "He has said in his heart, I 
shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity." As sure as you think 
your mountain now stands, it may suddenly be overturned; yes it shall assuredly, 
if you repent not. God is giving you space to repent: do not trifle and dream it 
away, lest you repent when it is too late.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Let not your observation of the prosperity of other sinners, encourage 
and harden you in your sinful course: as it did those, Malachi 3:15, "And now we 
call the proud happy: yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, they that 
tempt God are even delivered." You have seen much of their sinful course, and of 
God's patience. But you have not seen the end of it yet: Isaiah 17:11, "In the 
day shall you make your plant to grow, and in the morning shall you make your 
seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief, and of 
desperate sorrow." Many a day has begun fair, and held on long so, that has had 
a foul evening. And whatever you have observed of them, their prosperity in 
their ill course shall be their end in bitter repentance, or in their 
destruction, or else the word of truth fails.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Take the alarm in time, and flee from the wrath to come: Isaiah 55:6, 
7, "Seek you the Lord while he may be found, call you upon him while he is near. 
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let 
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for 
he will abundantly pardon." Know you cannot prosper to the end, in your loose 
and licentious ways. You must come to Christ by faith, and leave the world lying 
in wickedness; must break off your sins by repentance; or else you will perish. 
If you do it not, you will mind that you have been fairly warned, and lament 
forever your slighting it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the godly I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Beware of entertaining any idol of jealousy in your heart, with which 
the Lord may be provoked against you. He is impartial in his judgments, and even 
his own shall not escape: Isaiah 42:24, "Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel 
to the robbers? did not the Lord, he, against whom we have sinned? for they 
would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his laws." Though 
being in Christ you have shut the gulf as to condemnation, you may be severely 
chastised; and you may get broken bones for your transgressions, though you 
cannot lose your souls.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Be not discouraged in the Lord's way, because in it you meet with many 
sore trials, while others that are far from it go at ease. The work-ox goes with 
the yoke on his neck, while the slaughter-ox is full fed. But the former is 
preserved, while the latter is slain and hewed in pieces.</p>
<p align="justify">3 Lastly, To all I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Know that God is a holy jealous God. The way of sin is dangerous, and 
there will be no peace in the end of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Let us prepare to meet our God in the way of his judgments. God's 
proceedings against the land are slow, but they are like to be sure and sore. He 
has made the earth to quake beneath us, shown his anger from the face of the 
heavens above us.</p>
