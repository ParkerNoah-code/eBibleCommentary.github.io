          Isaiah 64:7, "And there is none that calls upon your name, that stirs
          up himself to take hold of you: for you have hidden your face from us,
          and have consumed us, because of our iniquities."

        <p align="justify">
          THIS chapter contains a prayer of the church in great distress, in
          which they plead with God for his return, confess their sin, and
          lament their case. In the sixth verse, they lament their sinfulness
          and misery, and here they bewail the helplessness of it, and the
          improbability of their recovery.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The time to which this relates is twofold; namely, the Babylonish
          captivity, and the final rejection of the Jews. This prophecy was
          before the Babylonish captivity, and that it has a respect unto it,
          will scarcely be doubted; but that it looks further, is clear from the
          Lord's answer to the prayer, Isaiah 65:1. Whence we observe, that
          though some are willing to part with Christ, he will always find
          others ready to entertain him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the text we have mentioned the general neglect of the duty, to
          which their circumstances called them: "There is none that calls upon
          your name." We are not to understand it, as if there were simply none
          at all; for in the worst of times, the Lord had always a remnant, that
          would not, for their part, give consent to his departure. The Lord
          reserved seven thousand in Elijah's days; but comparatively, there
          were so very few, that they were next to none, and could hardly be
          discerned among the multitude.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have, also, the woeful frame and temper of the spirits of
          professors in that day. "None stirs up himself to take hold of you."
          There was a general deadness and indifference, nothing like an active
          vigilant frame. They were not exercised about the holding of Christ
          still, with themselves and with others. Their best friend is taking
          his departure from their house, but they are in bed; and though they
          may coldly cry out of their beds to bid him stay, yet they do not rise
          up, and resolutely take hold of him, and say they are resolved not to
          part with him. But for them he may go, if he will, they are
          indifferent.

          DOCTRINE I. Though the Lord be on his way to depart, yet he may be
          held still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. When the Lord is on his way to go, it is high time for
          people to stir up themselves to hold him still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. Sometimes religion is at such a low ebb among a
          professing people, that Christ may even go his way, for any that is to
          hold him still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. Though the Lord be on his way to depart, yet he may be
          held still. To confirm this, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is pure love that brings Christ to a people or person,
          Deuteronomy 7:6–8; and such you know, may easily be held still. What
          should have brought him out of Heaven, but love to the inhabitants of
          the earth. His delights were with the children of men. Had he not
          enough in the hallelujahs of angels in the bosom of the Father, or was
          there any attracting object here below? No, surely. If he would have
          them home to be his spouse, he behooved to wash his filthy bride in
          his own blood, before she could set her foot within his Father's
          house. Now, if he took such a journey to come, will he not stay if he
          get entertainment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He is unwilling to go away, when he is come, and therefore he may
          be held still. This appears, if you consider: 1. That our Lord waits
          long upon poor sinners, if so be they will be so wise as receive him.
          "Behold," says he, "I stand at the door and knock; if any man will
          hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and sup with him, and
          he with me." He waited one hundred and twenty years on the old world,
          in the days of Noah. He has waited long on Scotland, and yet he is not
          gone. He has waited at our doors on most of us, and he is still ready
          to embrace us. 2. Many times he enters on his way, and yet he turns
          back again, as if he could not obtain it of himself, to leave even a
          professing sinful generation, Hosea 11:8, 9. How often did he leave
          the people of the Jews, before he parted with them altogether? Many
          good nights, is an evidence of unwillingness to go away. How often has
          he turned his back on Scotland, and yet come back again, even when he
          was almost out of sight; when we were ready to say, we shall not see
          the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living. How can it be thus?
          Truly Christ is not so bound to any land, but he may leave it
          altogether. Look to the Jews, the seven churches of Asia, and others.
          The reasons are—There may be some hidden ones among them, so that he
          cannot leave a land altogether, until these be put out of harm's way
          Isaiah 57:1, 2. Lot must be out of Sodom before it be destroyed.
          Again, there may be some chosen vessels in the loins of such a
          generation, as it was in the case of that generation that came out of
          Egypt, with whom God bare forty years for their posterity's sake. He
          does it also for the glory of his patience. God will have it to be
          seen, that he delights in mercy, and that he does not execute his
          judgments on sinners, until they extort them out of his hands.
          Judgment is his strange act. Finally, God spares a wicked people,
          until the measure of their iniquity be filled up, and the cup be brim
          full, and then the last stroke comes, which compensates for its being
          so long a-coming, with the severity of it when it is come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He gives frequent warning that he is going away before he go; and
          why all that, but to stir up people to hold him still. Thus he warned
          the old world by Noah. Not a chop was laid on the ark, but it was a
          warning to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The breach never begins on his side, nor does he go while people
          are resolute to hold him still. See how he condescends to Abraham,
          Genesis 18:23–33; and how the Lord, by Paul and Barnabas, takes his
          leave of the Jews, Acts 13:46.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, He has been held still, when he was on his way to depart; and
          what has been, may be, Luke 24:28, 29. The spouse, Song 3:4. Jacob,
          Genesis 32. Moses, Exodus 32.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. If the Lord depart from us, then the blame lies at our door,
          for then he may be held still. The case of this land is very
          dangerous, yet it is not hopeless. Our Lord is yet within a cry,
          within the reach of prayers. If he go, for want of serious invitation
          from us to stay still, we are inexcusable. Alas! that there are so few
          stirring up themselves to take hold of him. I must needs say, that the
          empty seats in this church, on the fast day, are no good sign either
          for the land or the parish. If sitting at home, or going about their
          own work that day, was a way to hold Christ still in the land, I am
          much mistaken. Surely, the people of Judah did not so much despise the
          fast proclaimed by Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles 20:3, 4. But if these
          people did, with Esther, 4:16, keep private fasts at home, when others
          were gathered for that work in the congregation, it will say much to
          clear them of contempt of the ecclesiastical and civil authority,
          calling them to fast and pray that day, and say that they were indeed
          concerned to hold Christ among us. And never more need to fast than at
          this day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. This may stir us up to wrestle with God for his stay among us, we
          may come to prevail. Where there is no hope of success there can be no
          vigorous endeavors; but a possibility of being successful in this very
          important matter, may engage us to exert ourselves. There is hope in
          Israel concerning this thing, Zephaniah 2:1–3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. When the Lord is upon his way to go, it is high time for

          I. To show you when it may be said that the Lord is upon his way, and

          I shall do this, first, more generally, and then more particularly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. More generally, with respect to a land in which the Lord has set up
          his candlestick. The Lord is upon his way,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When people have plenty of gospel means, and yet remain unfruitful
          under them, Isaiah 5:4–6; Hebrews 6:7, 8. The ox is near to the
          slaughter, when he has meat to the full laid before him to fatten him.
          If the Lord mind to lay the cities of Judah waste, he will send Isaiah
          to preach to them, and ripen them for that stroke. Alas! there is too
          great ground of fear, that this takes up a great part of the
          commission of the ministers of Scotland this day. That is an
          astonishing word: "And now also, the axe is laid unto the root of the
          trees; therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn
          down and cast into the fire," Matthew 3:10. "And now." Let us attend
          to this passage in its connection. O! what a people John had to preach
          to, and he was a burning and a shining light. The whole people flocked
          out to hear him preach, verse 5. They would not loiter at home. They
          did not stand to undertake a long journey out of the cities, to the
          wilderness to hear him, verse 1. They made open profession of
          repentance, verse 6. They were admitted by him to the sacrament of
          baptism. Finally, they had their cases of conscience to propose to
          him, Luke 3:10. But notwithstanding, says he, "Now is the axe laid to
          the root of the trees." It is with the gospel as with the sun, which
          sometimes gives a very fair blink a little before it set; and usually
          the greatest severity follows at the heels of the greatest mercy; of
          which that is a dreadful instance, 1 Thessalonians 2:16. This may let
          us see that it is high time to stir up ourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When people have been tried with many lighter rods, and have not
          been made better. Sodom got a stroke, Genesis 14. but it did them no
          good, therefore came on them that fearful overthrow. When all means
          have been used to do good to all people, and yet have proved
          unsuccessful, the Lord is near to a departure. He then says of such,
          as he did of the fig-tree: "If it bear fruit, well; and if not, then
          after that, you shall cut it down." Scotland has got a little of
          various kinds of judgments, and yet what the better are we? He who was
          filthy, is filthy still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When some of the pillars of a land fall, and others begin to fall.
          Good Josiah must be taken away in his young days, 2 Kings 22:20.
          Isaiah says, chapter 57:1, "The righteous is taken away from the evil
          to come." Luther, writing on this text says, that the Lord, after his
          death, would bring great affliction on Germany. It so fell out, two
          years after his death. Noah was taken into the ark, and Lot out of
          Sodom, before the threatened destruction came. We are not without such
          sad prognostics. But then, when the remaining pillars fail, that
          finishes the business. It was a sad token, when Jonah was fast asleep
          in the ship. When the godly that remain are not fit to stand in the
          gap, but security steals upon them. Thus, while the bridegroom
          tarried, even the wise virgins slumbered. General security says wrath
          is at the door, "for when they shall say, peace and safety, then
          suddenly destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with
          child; and they shall not escape." The security of this generation is
          too palpable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When the glory is gone the length of the threshold of the temple,
          Ezekiel 9:3–5. When the shadows of the evening are stretched out, the
          night is fast hastening on. May we not say, where is the God of
          Elijah; and the servants may complain, as their Master did before
          them, "I have labored," said he, "in vain; I have spent my strength
          for nothing and in vain." Their own, and their people's
          dead-heartedness, often close up the door of utterance; and when that
          is opened, yet the door of entrance is mostly kept shut, unless it be
          to hew them by the prophets, and slay them by the words which come out
          of his mouth, or to dart in convictions upon people, who nevertheless
          run away with the arrows sticking in them, and at last get them out,
          and lick themselves whole again. We find this is sometimes the great
          part of ministers' work, Revelation 11:10; and it is a sad sign that
          Christ and the gospel are upon the wing to depart. For within a while,
          the tormented hearers rejoice at the death of the tormenting
          preachers, that ripped up their sores, and would not let them sleep to
          death. This then should alarm us to rise up, and take hold of the Lord
          to keep him still, while the glory is yet on the threshold; but should
          not encourage any to turn their backs on the ordinances, lest they be
          found not to follow after the Lord, but to run away before him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. More particularly.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When spiritual darkness is still upon the growing hand. Then may
          people say, Woe unto us! for the day goes away, for the shadows of the
          evening are stretched out. A child of light may he in darkness, even
          when the Lord is with him, Isaiah 1:10; but then he is laying hold
          upon the Lord; but when darkness is growing, and the soul is at ease,
          God is on his way. Many get a wakening light, but it is not changing,
          therefore it decays by little and little, as the light after sunset,
          until it grow perfect darkness. But as in a dead body, when it begins
          to corrupt, there is a life and motion of another kind that succeeds,
          so there may be much seeming light swimming in the head, when the true
          light and sense of religion, in the power of it, is going away with
          all speed; Revelation 3:1, 2. True light that affects the heart, is
          troublesome and a burden, but empty knowledge puffs up and seems to
          give a name. Oh! is not the sun of many like to go down at noonday? Is
          there not a strangeness crept in between Christ and them? Is not the
          Bible a sealed book to many? O stir up yourselves to take hold of the
          Lord, lest if you delay, it turn dark night upon you. The nearer it is
          to night, the traveler should mend his pace, lest the darkness
          overtake him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When people come to the meeting place, time after time, but see not
          God's face, nor hear his voice, then he is on his way, for his back is
          turned. "They shall go," says the prophet, "with their flocks and with
          their herds to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him; he has
          withdrawn himself from them." The Lord does with many professors for
          their fearful backslidings in heart and life, as David did with
          Absalom when he allowed him to come to Jerusalem, but not to see the
          king's face. Withdrawing makes way for departing. It is high time then
          to stir up yourselves to take hold of Christ, lest if you delay, he
          be, before long, out of your reach, so as you shall not be able to
          overtake him. This was the case with the spouse, Song 5:6–8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When people are spiritually always growing weaker and weaker. God
          was on his way from Sardis, when the things that remained in them were
          ready to die. When the Lord draws near to the soul, he comes with
          strength. He strengthens his people with strength in the soul. This is
          the case with many in our day, the longer they live, the weaker they
          grow, and their corruptions grow stronger as nails grow in decaying
          bodies. They are as Jerusalem, sighing and going backwards. O stir up
          yourselves to take hold of him, lest you be, before long, like Samson
          without his hair, even weak as other men. It is time to take a firm
          hold of Christ, when our talents are come down to one, and to be
          trading diligently with Heaven, lest we be brought to beggary.
          Proverbs 6:10, 11. It is time to cherish the fire when it is come to a
          spark hidden among the ashes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When people have forsaken the Lord, and are going on in a course of
          gadding after their idols, Psalm 78:57–60. Who can live with an
          adulterous wife, that will not give over her strange lovers? Ezekiel
          6:9. This is a horrid indignity with which God will not bear, Jeremiah
          2:31–37. Alas, it is the case of many, their idols have stolen away
          their hearts. They have set up their idols of jealousy in which they
          delight more than in the Lord himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Arise now and lay hold on him quickly, lest after your idols have
          ruined you, and you go to seek help of the Lord, you meet with that,
          Go to the gods which you have chosen; and lest you be left at length
          as Michal, with an image in the bed instead of your husband.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. When peoples' gifts being blasted, are withering and decaying. When
          the Lord had a mind to leave Saul, he took the spirit of government
          from him. It is a dreadful word. "If a man abide not in me, he is cast
          forth as a branch and is withered, and men gather them, and cast them
          into the fire, and they are burned." Alas, it is sad, when people
          cannot so much as exercise a gift but before others, where they have
          the wind of praise to fill their sails. A dead body will be warm,
          while it is laid before a fire, and others may be chaffing and rubbing
          it; but when it is laid by alone, its heat departs, for it has no
          inward principle of motion. Follow many to their secret devotions, and
          it will be seen that it is custom and not conscience that draws them
          thither. How hardly can they get a while of an hour, or a very short
          space from the world, and then it is huddled over, that they may be
          eased of the burden. Though the eyes be shut, yet they see a thousand
          vanities; the heart leaves the tongue, and there is so little vital
          heat within, that the word dies in their mouths. In a word, there is
          nothing in them of real value. It is high time then, for such to stir
          up themselves to take hold of him, if so be there may be hope, for
          surely he is then on his way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, When the Lord, after many strugglings in vain with a soul,
          makes some strong, though short-lived impressions on the heart, that
          somewhat rouses the man out of his lethargy. The Lord does with souls
          as men that have no will to go away, though they have knocked long,
          and yet have got no access; at the last they give some loud knocks,
          that if possible they may get access, and if not they will go their
          way. O! it is dangerous to be sleeping now, and to disobey Christ's
          voice. Luke 13:8, 9. Hosea 13:13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now is the nick of time. Strike the iron while it is hot. If you let
          it cool, it will be out of time. Bestir yourselves then, lest he
          depart from you, never to return. Miss that, and it may be the wind
          never blow again for transporting you to Emmanuel's land. O! it is
          hard to tell what may be the Lord's last farewell to your souls, what
          may be the parting word, the parting conviction. Only we know that his
          Spirit will not always strive with men. Perhaps it may come to that
          this day with some. Now or never. Their salvation or damnation may be
          sealed. If you have not hold of him now, next may come that oath:
          "They shall not enter into my rest." We proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show what it is to take hold of Christ. He is now in Heaven,
          with respect to his bodily presence, and so there is no reaching him
          with the hands of the body; and though there were, it would be to
          little purpose. "For it is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits
          nothing." It is then a spiritual hold we ought to take of him. Now
          there is a three-fold arm which we should clasp about our Lord, to
          hold him still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The arms of faith. Faith is the hand of the soul, which first and
          last takes hold of Christ, and it is a very prevailing grace. Hence,
          Jesus said unto the woman of Canaan, "O woman, great is your faith; be
          it unto you, even as you will." An unbeliever cannot hold Christ, more
          than one that wants hands. Faith embraces Christ; it embraces the
          person of Christ. Hence it is said, "As many as received him, to them
          he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on
          his name." Christ, in the gospel, is offered to sinners in spiritual
          marriage. The daughter of Zion, especially when she sees him like to
          go away, puts off all delays, and says, "Even so I take him," and thus
          is united to him, and carries him into the secret chamber of her
          heart, not to sojourn, but to dwell there. "That Christ," says Paul,
          "may dwell in your hearts by faith." This is a noble way to hold
          Christ, for it is the keeping at the door that puts him away. Again,
          faith holds Christ by his word of promise, and it is a sure hold which
          a soul gets of him this way. Christ will not draw back of his word.
          Sometimes we have but a loose hold of men, when we have them only by
          their word, for they can do with it as Joseph with his mantle; but
          Christ will not do so, for he will not suffer his faithfulness to
          fail. The covenant is a bundle of promises, broad and wide enough, so
          as his people may get something to hold. And O! but it is a promising
          sight when Christ is going away, to see all his people running after
          him, and hanging by his chariot to hold him still. This, says he, will
          not drive far.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Faith also holds fast the tokens of Christ's love. Faith does with an
          angry God and a departing Christ, as Tamar did with Judah, Genesis
          38:25. When lovers are to part for good and all, they will require up
          their tokens; but the party that is unwilling the bargain should break
          up, will hold fast these. Faith can manage former experience in a dark
          hour, to the holding of Christ still, and can cast in its memorials to
          the court of Heaven for favor. "Remember," say they, "your
          congregation, which you have purchased of old; the rod of your
          inheritance, which you have redeemed; this Mount Zion, wherein you
          have dwelt."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The arms of love, Luke 24:29–32. They that will not love Christ,
          pretend what they will, they would even let him go without a good
          night. They that love their lusts, hate the Lord, and if they could
          get it done with their honesty, would entreat him to depart out of our
          coasts. But love cleaves to Christ. Love has cords that bind to him.
          Love does two things to hold Christ still. Love awakened, flees after
          the Lord; even as a child who is taken up with pictures, yet when the
          mother goes away, follows after, weeping, Song 5:4; 6:2, 3. Love tells
          Christ, the soul cannot part with him, but if he goes, he must not
          leave the soul, but take it with him. The house is empty when Christ
          is not there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Love holds the heart of Christ, and its hold is very strong. "You have
          ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart
          with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck." It is as death,
          that draws all to it, and holds all until a pull of omnipotency draw
          back its prey. "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods
          drown it." Love says to Christ, as Ruth to Naomi, "entreat me not to
          leave you." It is an overcoming grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The arms of prayer. A praying people are the horsemen and chariots
          of Israel. Luther used to call the prayers of the godly his great
          ordnanee. When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and when he
          let it down, Amalek prevailed. It is a sad sight when the master of a
          family is turning his back to leave his habitation; but yet there is
          hope when all the children are hanging about him, and beseeching him
          to stay. Thus Jacob had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept,
          and made supplication unto him; he found him in Bethel, and there he
          spoke with us. Prayer has done great things, and were there a spirit
          of prayer poured out on this land this day, what a blessed change
          would it make in the state of affairs. We find one Abraham getting all
          his requests for a very wicked people, Genesis 18. One Lot, saving a
          whole city, Genesis 19:20. The prayers of Jacob staying the hands of
          Esau, Genesis 32:10, 11, 12. The prayers of the church breaking open
          prison doors, making chains fall off, and an iron gate to fly open,
          Acts 12:6–10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer is pleasant melody in our Lord's ears, Song 2:14, and arrests a
          departing God. The prayers of the saints are sweet odors The words of
          a lisping child will go very far with a tender-hearted father, but not
          so far as prayers do with God. Shall not God avenge his own elect,
          which cry day and night unto him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer entertains Christ with savory discourse. It is very usual to
          keep up discourse with them we would gladly have to stay, and so to
          prevail with them; this cannot but prevail here, for our Lord, when he
          goes, gets always the last word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Prayer puts employment in Christ's hand, and so holds him still, Song
          3:4. For he will not go while sinners have any employment for him. But
          it is not every sort of prayer that will do this. It is not the gift
          but the spirit of prayer. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous
          man, avails much. Many may pray, who will do no more good with
          prayers, than the heathen mariners in the ship with Jonah. A sigh, or
          groan, or broken sentence from the spirit of prayer, will do more good
          than ten thousand prayers of another sort. Strange fire is not fit for
          the mercy-seat, but holy fire taken from the altar will ascend with
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are now, III. To show what it is to stir up ourselves to take hold
          of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It imports a man's discerning of the signs of the Lord's departure
          and noticing the same. The want of this is reproved by our Lord. "O
          you hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky; but can you not
          discern the signs of the times." Every rod has a voice, but it is the
          man of wisdom only that hears it. Men will never deny themselves to
          their ease, until they see the hazard of security; Hebrews 11:7. If
          the fire has fastened on a man's bed, and he neither feel the heat nor
          see the smoke, he will not rise up. Alas! many are so spiritually
          senseless, they know neither Christ's goings nor comings. Hence, they
          never awaken, until, with the rich man in Hell, they lift up their
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Vigorous endeavors for the truth of grace in the heart, which is
          the only thing that makes a man capable of holding Christ still. A
          dead man can do nothing but lie and rot in the grave. He who has a
          spark at home, may blow it up; but where there is not a spark, fire
          must be brought in, if he would entertain his guest. Alas! many
          overlook this, and so lose all their pains. They endeavor to perform
          duties, but neither for nor from grace. What serves a prayer that
          Christ may abide with us, if there be not grace in the heart to
          entertain and hold him? The want of grace in the heart makes all our
          attainments vain and fruitless: they still leave the soul in the same
          state of condemnation and enmity to God as before. For all duties of
          that sort, as they cannot atone for one sin, so they cannot mortify
          one lust, only grace can do it. The want of grace, also, makes our
          attempts but faint and languishing, so that at last they are ready to
          give over. Duties never flow freely from that soul, where grace is not
          as a fountain to supply them. A lamp quickly goes out, when the oil is
          exhausted. "Will the hypocrite delight himself in the Almighty? Will
          he call upon God always?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">OBJECTION. But can we work grace in ourselves?</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Though we cannot sow the seed, we may prepare the ground,
          Jeremiah 4:3. We may examine ourselves, and see the want of it, and
          that we are undone without it; and we may take no rest to ourselves,
          nor give the Lord any, until we get grace; and when we are doing this,
          which we can do, God may do what we cannot do for ourselves. And if we
          do not do this, we will be damned, not only for the want of grace, but
          for the contempt of it, that we would not stir up ourselves to get it:
          and it will be a worm in our conscience, that we did not do what we
          might have done to have got grace, and so have got Christ. But that
          you began your work at the wrong end, because that was easiest, though
          not safest. "Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
          wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A vigorous exercise of grace, received in order to take hold of
          Christ. A sleeping man is unfit to hold one that is going away, as
          well as a dead man. Sleeping prayers and faint wishes will not
          suffice. Yet, alas! these are all that Christ can get at this day from
          many that have the root of grace in them. They have hands indeed, but
          alas they are in their bosom, and it gives them pain to pluck them
          out. If there be any stirring up of themselves, their love is burning,
          and cannot part with him, their faith is resolute, and will not quit
          their hold, so that if he go he must drag them after him; their love
          cannot bear his frowns, their faith will plead kindness on him, Isaiah
          63:15, 16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, A patient, though resolute wrestling with him for his stay,
          Genesis 32:26. It must be patient continuance in well doing that God
          will regard. Many under a rod, will pretend to wrestle with God, but
          if that be removed, they give over, though the Lord be still as angry
          as ever. But the saints persevere in patient wrestling. "My eye," says
          the prophet, "trickleth down, and ceases not, without any
          intermission, until the Lord look down, and behold from Heaven." We
          are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To give reasons of the point. When the Lord is on his way, it is
          surely high time for us to stir up ourselves, to take hold of him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because then it is evident the Lord is angry, and is it time to be
          sleeping when the fire of the Lord's anger is kindled? The Lion has
          roared, who will not fear. The Lord God has spoken, who can but
          prophecy. Are we able to run away from it? or to abide it? No, no. God
          is saying to us this day, as Moses to Aaron, "Take a censer, and put
          fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly
          into the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is
          wrath gone out from the Lord: the plague is begun." Sleep a while, and
          the house may be on fire about your ears, and no escape left by door
          or window, therefore "kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish
          from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all
          they that put their trust in him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because then, the Lord has begun to resent the entertainment that
          sinners have given him, and surely it is high time for us then to
          begin to mend. Our Lord, after a long and dark day, has returned to
          Scotland, and for many years has kept house in it, furnished with the
          rich provision of the gospel. If there be some who weep, that the
          glory of the latter house is not so great as that of the former,
          suffer them to rejoice, who never saw such a glorious one; and also to
          weep, for that he has come to his own and his own received him not,
          and for that he seems now to be resenting the harsh treatment he has
          received, Matthew 23:37, 38.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because when the Lord is on his way, judgment is at the door, when
          the glory is on the threshold, the bloody commission is a giving out,
          Ezekiel 9:3–5. As Christ goes, wrath comes on a person or people. "Woe
          also unto them, when I depart from them, says the Lord." If we part
          with him, our happy days are done. There are many complaints this day,
          but I am afraid they will increase and not diminish, if the frame and
          temper of this generation be not changed. It will be a wonder if, for
          the slighting of the white horse of the gospel and his glorious rider,
          we turn not red, black and pale, before all be done. If the gospel go,
          it is like that more will go with it, 2 Chronicles 15:3–6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because, if we do not then stir up ourselves, he may, before long,
          be out of our reach. Christ may come to retaliate upon those who
          slight him, Proverbs 1:24–33. His spirit will not always strive with
          us. You have an offer of Christ today, but the world cannot assure you
          that you shall have another tomorrow. But some may say, "Where is the
          promise of his coming? for since the father's fell asleep, all things
          continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." Well, the
          threatened tree stands long in the wood, but it is cut down at last.
          The pulse beats oft in the body in the time of life, but the last
          pulse comes at length. Our breath, like a stranger, goes oft to the
          door, yet comes back again, but at last it goes, and returns no more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, to show you the necessity of stirring up ourselves in order to
          take hold of Christ effectually, Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That our ordinary frame will not do here. We must rouse up, if we
          would take hold of him to purpose; for it was never yet known that
          sleeping prayers had much power to hold Christ, Song 3:1. Seeking that
          is not striving, will be seeking in vain. "Strive," says our Savior,
          "to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek
          to enter in, and shall not be able." A soul besotted with spiritual
          sloth will let Christ, Heaven, and all the benefits of the gospel,
          slip through his fingers, and drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.
          People may lie in their bed and wish for Heaven, and carry their
          wishes to Hell with them; but if we would hold Christ, we must up and
          offer violence to Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a difficult work we have to do. The fire that is almost
          extinguished, is difficult to kindle; and when Christ has turned his
          back, it is likely to be hard work before people see his face again,
          Song 5:6. What a hard morning's work had Jacob of it, when he wrestled
          with him until the breaking of the day. It seems, also, that it was
          not easy for the disciples to hold him: for it is said, they
          constrained him, saying, abide with us. It must be hard work, for it
          is hard work. Religion exists inwardly, and the heart must be brought
          to it, or it will not do; and if you do not think heart work hard
          work, you have never tried it. O it is easy to say a prayer but to get
          the heart to cling to Christ by faith, love, and the spirit of prayer,
          is not so easy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is work in which you will have all to undo again, that you have
          done, which has provoked him to go away. Sinner! what have you been
          doing, but as it were thrusting Christ to the door? You bust been
          weaving your life into a net to entangle your feet; and building up a
          wall of partition, broad and high, between him and you, setting up
          idols of jealousy in every corner, to make the Son of God gladly to
          remove and leave you to your lusts. Would you hold him then, you must
          open out the net to disentangle your feet, pull down every stone you
          have laid, and take every one of these idols and sacrifice them to his
          jealousy. And if this be work for a sluggard, judge you?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He who has got Christ and you asunder, will strive to keep you so,
          even the devil. Sad experience confirms this. How oft are some
          convinced and resolved to stir up themselves. But then Hell is
          alarmed, and the devil endeavors to get all quiet again. "Yet a little
          sleep, a little slumber, and a little folding of the hands to sleep."
          Hence it is, that the goodness of many is as a morning cloud, and as
          the early dew, it goes away. Satan is Christ's rival, and will strive
          to keep his ground.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. It is then high time now to awake out of sleep, and take hold on
          Christ, to keep him still. All the signs of departure before named,
          agree to us. O then up now, take hold of him, keep him fast, and
          protest against his departure. There are three things, in respect of
          which, you should be concerned to hold Christ still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Be concerned for Christ's abode in the land, that the gospel be not
          removed, the pure ordinances be not taken away, 1 Samuel 4:13. That
          Christ do not remove his tent from Scotland as from Shiloh. If the
          gospel go, what will become of us? a land of darkness is
          uncomfortable. We have no security for enjoying the gospel. Pity your
          own souls, the souls of others and posterity. Let not Christ go, as
          you would not imbrue your hands in the blood of the souls of them yet
          unborn.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be concerned for Christ's presence in the ordinances. Oh! it is
          monstrous for the children to be unconcerned for Christ's presence in
          their mother's house, where they were born, and where ordinarily they
          are fed. Be concerned for his convincing presence. When the sun shines
          into a house, the motes appear. When the sword of the word is in
          Christ's own hand, it is then quick and powerful, and sharper than any
          two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
          spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
          thoughts and intents of the heart. When Christ comes to ordinances by
          his word in the mouth of his servants, he opens the volume of a man's
          conversation, and reads to him the secret history of his heart and
          life. The man is convinced of all, he is judged of all. And thus are
          the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his
          face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. O
          what a valuable thing is this! but if Satan can, he will keep people
          out of the way of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Be concerned for his converting presence. Acts 2:37. Christ in the
          gospel, has a drawing, overcoming power. "Your people shall be willing
          in the day of your power." When Christ comes in this way, mountains
          are leveled and hills become a plain. When he mounts his triumphal
          chariot, he will make rebels lacquey at his feet. "For his arrows are
          sharp in the heart of the king's enemies, whereby the people fall
          under him." Alas, that there is so little of this with us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Be concerned for his quickening presence. He brings life and
          liveliness with him to sleepy decaying Christians. "This is my comfort
          in my affliction," says David, "for your word has quickened me." The
          sun arises, and man goes to work. His presence makes the bread of life
          nourishing indeed, strengthening the soul for duty. Honor and majesty
          are before him, strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Then it
          comforts his people under their griefs, and with joy they draw water
          out of the wells of salvation. It elevates the soul in the exercise of
          grace, looses bands, dispels doubts, and makes them hold on their way
          heavenward rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Be concerned for Christ's presence with your own souls. That Christ
          may dwell in your hearts by faith, that your souls may be a little
          sanctuary for the Holy Spirit, and a throne for the Mediator. The soul
          without Christ, is but a dead soul in a living body. The want of it
          makes a soul barren, heartless and lifeless. There is never an empty
          heart among us. If Christ be not there, Satan is there. If it be not a
          palace for the King of glory, it is a den of hellish thieves, and a
          garrison for the devil where the strong man armed keeps the house and
          his goods are safe. Now to stir you up,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 1. The neglect of this is the need-nail that holds all other
          evils about us fast. Take that away, the rest will go. Though all as
          an unclean thing, yet we should be made pure and holy, get a perfect
          righteousness, revive as the corn, grow as the vine, and send forth
          our roots as Lebanon. Christ has all in hand, grace and glory, so that
          taking hold of him is the short way to all other benefits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a horrid indignity done to the Son of God, and says in
          effect, that his presence is not worth our pains to seek it. You have
          said, "It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have
          kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the
          Lord." That we can live well enough without him. "Wherefore say my
          people, we are Lords: we will come no more unto you." Yes, that we are
          the worse for his presence, and would gladly be free of him.
          Therefore, they say unto God, "Depart from us, for we desire not the
          knowledge of your ways." Like the Gadarenes, who thought they could
          not get their swine kept for him, and therefore besought him to depart
          out of their coasts. This was the sin of the Israelites, Psalm
          106:21–26.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is next step to Christ's taking farewell of a people or a soul.
          He must needs go when there is none to hold him still, Psalm 81:11,
          12. Oh it is a sad parting. Yes, woe also to them when I depart from
          them. Farther application afterwards.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. Sometimes religion is at such a low ebb, and spiritual
          sloth so prevails among a professing people, that Christ may even go
          away for any that is to hold him still. There is none that stirs up
          himself. At what a low ebb was religion in Jerusalem, Jeremiah 5:1;
          Ezekiel 22:30.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall inquire whence this proceeds, and discover the sources of
          this woeful temper, that men stir not up themselves, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It proceeds from love to carnal case. Christ's own spouse is
          sometimes so bewitched with this, that if sleeping prayers will not
          hold Christ still, she will even let him go his way, before she be at
          the pains to rise up and set her foot on cold ground, Song 5:3. Every
          one has a devil's agent within him that says, master, spare yourself.
          This love to carnal ease, makes the man avoid what is necessary for
          stirring him up. There are these two things very necessary for the
          restoring of a decayed soul, which love to carnal ease will by no
          means admit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">These are,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The duty of self-examination. Let us search and try our ways, and
          turn again to the Lord. Communing with our hearts, respecting our
          state and frame, is necessary. But this is a yoke which the delicate
          soul that loves ease cannot stoop to take on. They will pray, hear,
          and the like, for they may do these, stretched on the bed of sloth,
          but self-examination will disturb their ease.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The duty of secret prayer and fasting is also necessary, Matthew
          17:21. This has been the way by which many have got a recovery; but it
          is to be feared it is an exercise few are acquainted with, Matthew
          6:16–18. When there is a decay on men's spirits, which spurns all
          other means, this ought to be tried; and none ought to say, they have
          not time; for some have their time in their own hand by day, and all
          have the night, and a night taken from sleep for this exercise, would
          be well bestowed. But love of ease, keeps away from this uneasy work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It proceeds from abundance of world's ease. The Jews at Babylon,
          how zealous, Psalm 137. But at Jerusalem, how negligent and slothful,
          Hag. 1:2. Jacob may indeed sleep when he has a stone for his pillow,
          but much more when on a soft bed. The late troublous times kept people
          awake. When they had no rest to themselves, they gave God no rest; but
          now they have got rest, and find it is sweet, and it grieves them to
          pluck their hands out of their bosom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is observable that people are very ready to fall asleep after a
          deliverance. It then comes to them sweet, as to a laboring man. This
          was the case with Noah, after the deluge; Lot, after his deliverance
          from Sodom, and Hezekiah, after his recovery. Compare also, Genesis
          28:20, with Genesis 35:1, and downwards.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Plenty of the means of grace abused. People would think, that those
          that have plenty of ordinances, should be most lively; but indeed it
          turns often quite otherwise. The preached gospel; it is a pleasant
          song, which if it do not draw peoples' hearts after Christ it will
          lull them fast asleep, Isaiah 6:10. The continual noise of many
          waters, is apt to make people deaf. A man that has enough, if he have
          not all the better appetite, is seldom hungry, and thus men begin to
          weary of God and his ordinances. The honey comb is loathed, and they
          must be fed with something that please their fancy. Hence the power of
          religion is much injured. How many are, that would sometime ago, have
          gone many miles to hear the word of the Lord, when it was a scarce
          commodity, that will sit at home and loiter away the Sabbath, now when
          it is come to their doors. They have even got a surfeit of it; they
          are full and the bones must have rest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The cares of the world, Luke 21:34. Many, while they are young and
          without care of the world, how lively and sprightly seem they to be;
          but when once they get a family, their religion melts away like snow
          before the sun. From that time many draw back. Hence, so many young
          saints, become old sinners. It is men's being so much taken up with
          the things of the world, that ruins the concerns of the soul. Cares of
          the world make men spiritually poor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. A view of unrepented of guilt, which is not so strong as to rouse
          men up, yet it lightly startles them. I believe one main cause of
          sin's not stirring up men, is, they are so far run on in the score,
          that they dare not take a serious view of their accounts, which is a
          kind of sullen despair, Jeremiah 2:25.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. A sinful want of the influences of divine grace, without which, a
          man can do nothing. Many have sinned away the influences of the
          spirit, so as they have neither heart nor hand in religion, as they
          have had, and that by their former grieving of the spirit. Days have
          been, when the Lord has been giving them one awakening after another,
          but they would needs sleep, and the Lord has said, "they are joined to
          their idols, let them alone."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Love to some bosom lust, which they are unwilling to give up. As
          long as a man minds to keep the sweet morsel under his tongue, he will
          not stir up himself to take hold of Christ; for he knows if he take
          hold of Christ, he must let go his idol. When people's hearts have
          gone away from Christ, then they have always some other pillow upon
          which to lean their heads and take their rest. Often they never awaken
          until the Lord draw the bolster from under their head, as he took away
          Jonah's gourd, Ezekiel 24:25.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, what wonder men stir not up themselves, for Satan will see to
          it that the curtains be drawn, all kept quiet, and that they be kept
          warm in the bed of sloth. The curtains are drawn on many, and the
          light kept out of their eyes. "But if our gospel be hid, it is hidden
          to them that are lost. In whom the God of this world has blinded the
          minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel
          of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them." Light is
          an enemy to sleep, but the sun may go down at noon with some. If the
          man can be brought to slight ordinances, and sit at home, it is well,
          what the eye sees the heart rues not. If he will come to ordinances,
          and his case be there spoken to, then Satan is at work, either to make
          him drowsy, or to send away his heart to be thinking on some other
          thing, or to put the word away from himself to some other person. And
          if the word continue to be so troublesome to him, he may even come to
          turn his back on it altogether, and hate the messenger because he
          never speaks good of him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All noise that may disturb them, is carefully kept out of their ears.
          Conscience is a great disturber of false peace, and therefore it is
          either boasted or bribed to hold its peace. The consciences of some
          are boasted to silence, seared as with a hot iron, so that its speech
          is laid, 1 Timothy 4:2. And this especially by sinning over the belly
          of light, and by custom in sin, which quickly wears away all sense, so
          as a man can sin without remorse. The consciences of others are bribed
          to hold their peace, and there are three things by which it is bribed
          to hold peace, and allow them to sleep.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. With some good duties, even the easy duties of religion, as to
          wrong no man, to attend to ordinances, to recommend themselves to God
          while they put off or on their clothes, to say a prayer and give a
          sigh while they are going backwards, Hosea 10:11; Proverbs 7:14. We
          have heard of night-walkers, who rise out of their beds, climb up on
          dangerous places; people are unwilling to awaken them, but let them
          alone, they will go to bed again. Many such night-walkers there are in
          religion, who will do some duties as if they were awake, and yet are
          fast asleep.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Abstaining from gross sins which cannot but wound the conscience,
          Luke 18:11. They on whom is the spirit of slumber, will sleep in any
          place where there is nothing to prick them; like children, who will
          wallow among the dust, building their sand hillocks, until the wind
          blow it in their eyes. A roaring devil would awaken some, and
          therefore Satan transforms himself into an angel of light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Fair promises to be performed afterwards, if conscience begin to
          mutter. "Go your way for this time, when I have a convenient season, I
          will call for you." The man does with conscience, as the lazy man does
          with his friend that comes too early to him, engages to meet him
          afterwards; and also many make an engagement with their conscience
          that they never keep. However, the making of the engagement frees them
          from present disturbance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, They are well covered. "Woe to the rebellious children, says
          the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a
          covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin." There
          is a threefold covering under which men take a sound sleep. 1. A
          covering of pure mercy, that has no affinity with justice. The mercy
          with which the Spirit of God covers his people, has red lines of
          justice in it, drawn with the blood of Christ, in whom the soul is
          careful to have an interest, Psalm 85:9, 10. Ask many how they think
          to be saved? They look for mercy. Why? God is merciful. Tell them no
          mercy out of Christ, they yield it; but believe it not, for they are
          at no pains to be in him. 2. A covering of much time to come, in which
          they wrap themselves, and continue at ease; as when a man is on a
          journey, he can sleep by the way when he thinks he has much day before
          his hand. 3. A covering of sufficient grace, which in effect is
          sufficient delusion. Two sorts sleep soundly under this; first, some
          that can take their swing in their lusts now, and think it is but to
          repent and believe, and they can do that afterwards, if it were on a
          death-bed. There are, secondly, some that think the bitterness of
          death is past. They have good desires, and that is enough to secure
          Heaven. So they are like the unthrifty tradesman, who is not greedy of
          wealth, thinking he has as much as will be a livelihood, he will not
          exert himself for more, but take his ease. Now this is an easy sort of
          religion. Though a man cannot work, he can lie and wish upon his bed,
          for a Christ, a pardon, and Heaven. But woe to these desires, they
          will be found a covering not of God's Spirit, but of men's own spirit.
          "The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labor."
          Thus many lay down the conclusion, that the main work is already done,
          so they take ease. This serves many as a bulwark against all the
          attempts which the gospel can make on them. Is your salvation your
          main work? Yet at most it is but a begun work, therefore work out your
          salvation with fear and trembling. The Spirit of God's reasoning is,
          the nearer salvation is, it is so much the more high time to awake out
          of sleep, Romans 13:11. But what do you with the work of glorifying
          God, man's chief end. It is a shrewd sign, salvation is far from the
          man, that has nothing to do with grace, but to secure his own
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE I. Of lamentation over the low degree to which religion is come in
          this generation. We may well take up our lamentation and say our
          silver is become dross. The tokens of the Lord's anger are gone out
          against us. Christ is on his way to leave us, the plague is begun, the
          ark is like to be taken, but where is the man that stirs up himself to
          take hold of the Lord; or that is fit to stand in the gap. Jerusalem
          is sighing and going backwards. The Lord is angry with our mother,
          threatening to give up house with her, but the children generally are
          sleeping. Ah! we have fallen! fallen! Once a noble vine, but now the
          plant of a degenerate vine. Wickedness is at a height, and religion is
          at a low ebb. Most of us are pulling down the house about our ears.
          Few, very few, to hold it up. The floods are like to swallow up the
          ship, but Jonah is fast asleep. We shall here, First, give evidences
          of this case; and Secondly, show the evil of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Let us give evidences of the low degree to which religion is come
          in our day: and that the text is too applicable to us. "There is none
          that stirs up himself," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The gross wickedness that does this day abound in our land in the
          face of the sun, in a land where there is so much gospel light, Hosea
          4:1–3. That drunkenness, swearing, whoring, profaning the sabbath,
          contempt of the gospel, and such heaven-daring abominations, abound
          among high and low, is very evident. How rare to find a great man
          good. Profanity goes with many of them for a piece of gallantry, who
          by their profanity put themselves as far below the brutes, as God in
          his providence has lifted them up above other men. If a man has any
          sense of religion, he is judged to have been foundered in his
          education. No wonder the church of God has received bad treatment from
          such persons and others, whose religion will go no farther than their
          carnal interest. The meaner sort write as they can after their copy,
          and eagerly embrace profane causes, as they have temptations thereto,
          Jeremiah 5:1–6. If God confound them not in their counsels, ruin them
          not by their own devices, and return not their way upon their own
          head, we shall mark it as a miracle of providence. It is not long
          since a heavy judgment was inflicted upon the meaner sort of people,
          but there is reason to look, that God will destroy both head and tail
          at once.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Is not the profane spirit of the Gadarenes, gone far through the
          land? Men in effect saying to the Almighty, depart out of our coasts.
          There are many in Scotland grudging and fretting to see the Lord
          covering a table for us, and that would be glad Christ had not a foot
          of ground in the land, but hill sides and scaffolds. They are longing
          to see the ways of Zion mourning desolate, and to hear the word given
          to return back to Egypt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A profane spirit of neutrality and indifference carries away many.
          They are like Gallio, and care for none of these things. If they get
          the world, their clay God in their arms, they care not what side be
          uppermost, whether the gospel sink or swim. They are wholly careless
          that way, and behave as if they were all flesh, as if their souls were
          but salt to keep their bodies a while from corruption. As for Christ,
          they know not him nor his favor, and therefore he may go if he will
          for them. They never got any good by his presence, no wonder they are
          not concerned at the hazard of his departure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The dumb devil that possesses many hearts and families. If a Turk
          were in the houses of some Christians, saw them in their families and
          in their closets too, he would have much difficulty to know what
          religion they were of, or whether they had a God or not, unless it
          were by their swearing, or mumbling over a grace to their meat. Some
          make no conscience of prayer in their families, Jeremiah 10:25. Some
          perhaps will pray occasionally in their families, or join therein, but
          live strangers to secret prayer; these are careless daughters. I never
          like that religion where people have nothing to tell Christ, but what
          they can say before others. It is not very like that these are married
          to Christ. Now, lay aside all these, and there will not be very many
          behind to take hold of Christ. But we will come a little closer, and
          sift more narrowly; and I believe, before we have done, if conviction
          can get entrance, we will see the whole head is sick, and the whole
          heart faint.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. How many praying persons are there in our day, who, though they
          have received Christ into their mouths and houses, yet not into their
          hearts; but are still in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity.
          As for some, their practice openly contradicts their profession. They
          will swear and lie, and cheat and pray, and so wound religion. It will
          never be the like of these that will hold Christ still, if they do not
          reform, Isaiah 1:11–15. Others that are blameless, yet never get
          beyond a form of godliness, but remain strangers to the inward life of
          religion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. People confining themselves to morning and evening prayer, though
          God puts other opportunities in their hands. A healthy man keeps at
          his ordinary meals, but the sickly person that has much to do with the
          physician, cannot do so. Were people in the thriving, and exercised
          unto godliness, they would readily find an errand to God in the
          intervals. Alas! many are like Samson, they know not that the Lord is
          departed from them; and if they could not reach their knees with it,
          yet if they were waking, they would be often looking up by ejaculatory
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The difficulty people have to get an errand to Christ, except what
          self-preservation teaches them. They will pray for Heaven, because
          they are afraid of Hell; they will pray for pardon, but to tell Christ
          what ails them, except in fair generals, there is the difficulty. They
          that are thriving are not so. Exercised souls will have their
          particular cases lying near their hearts, and they must go to Christ
          with them. The case of their own souls will furnish them materials of
          prayer, in all its parts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The merry life that many have of it all their days, except so much
          as is interrupted with crosses in the world, or some visible
          outbreaking, that wound their reputation. Men have their sullen
          dejected fits, but their sorrow is of the world. How few are walking
          mournfully under the hidings of God's face, prevailing of corruption,
          pride, and unbelief. Alas! these things are hidden out of the view of
          many pretenders to religion, who feel nothing in their own eye, unless
          it be a beam. They reign as kings, without the shining of the Lord's
          countenance upon them. But were they really exercised to godliness,
          their wine would not escape being sometimes mixed with water.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Infrequency in reading or hearing the Scriptures read. Where is the
          man whose soul's case sends him away to the Bible, to see what he can
          get there for it? Souls that are awake, are readily thus employed. The
          Scriptures are Christ's last will, the magazine of Christian comfort,
          where there is what is suitable to the cases of our souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The saints turn to the Scriptures under deadness, saying, "This is my
          comfort in my affliction, for your word has quickened me;" also under
          doubts and fears, saying, your testimonies also are my delight, and my
          counselors. But alas! the dust of our Bibles may witness against many
          of us. It may long lie by us, before our own case make us turn a leaf
          of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. The little relish the Scriptures have with us. To the hungry every
          bitter thing is sweet. God has promised his Spirit to teach us all
          things, and bring all things to our remembrance. An awakened Christian
          reads the Scriptures with another eye than others do. They say with
          the two disciples, "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked
          with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures." An
          exercised frame of Spirit, is a good commentary on the Bible. It is
          like the sun shining on a lime wall, gets light and reflects it. But
          the Scriptures are to many a sealed book, tasteless as the white of an
          egg.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Unacquaintedness with answers of prayer, especially in spiritual
          things. Prayer is the exercise of those that are kept stirring and
          looking up to God, and disappointments are heavy to them. "You have
          covered yourself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass
          through." It would be a confounding question to some, were they asked,
          if they ever had an answer to prayer in spiritual things; and hard for
          many to tell when they had the last answer of prayer. Ah! do we think
          that these prayers avail ought, that God hears not, or that these are
          heard, about which we are not concerned whether they be heard or not?
          Many are no better than Saul, 1 Samuel 28:15; and worse than he, in
          that we are not troubled about it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. The great love to the world and carnality, Philippians 3:18, 19. We
          sit down on worldly enjoyments. It is good to be here. Many think of
          the world, what Peter said of being on the mount of transfiguration
          with Christ, and would make a bargain with God on lower terms. They
          would let him keep his Heaven to himself, so that he would but secure
          them from his Hell, and leave them in the world, to shift for
          themselves. Where is the man "that is coming up from the wilderness,
          leaning upon Christ his beloved?" And saying, "henceforth there is
          laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous
          Judge shall give at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them
          also, that love his appearing."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          9. The woeful misspending of the Sabbath day. The fourth commandment
          is put in the middle of the decalogue, with a "remember the Sabbath
          day," as being the bond of all religion. The growth of religion, or
          decay of it, goes hand in hand with the keeping, or neglecting of the
          Sabbath, Isaiah 58:13, 14; Amos 5:8. But alas! if we take our mark by
          this, we may say religion is at a low ebb. Few sermons in the year
          serve some people, and little thing will make some turn their backs on
          them. If people would do with their meat, in which there is a mote,
          real or supposed, as they do with the ordinances, some would come
          quickly to the churchyard, that will not come to the church. Many
          spend much of the Lord's day in their beds, long in bed in the
          morning, and soon to it at night. Some companies by their discourse,
          might be thought to be going to a market, when coming to church.
          Between sermons, how few go alone, to pray or meditate; and in company
          no spiritual discourse, but carnal, vain, idle talk, unfiting them for
          the rest of the work. In going home, no spiritual conversation. What
          they heard is buried, unless it be something they mind to quarrel or
          dispute about. At home, the day is as ill closed with many, as it was
          begun.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          10. The little spiritual discourse that is, at any time, among
          professors. "Let no corrupt communication," says Paul, "proceed out of
          your mouth; but that which is good, to the use of edifying, that it
          may minister grace to the hearers." When Christian experiences are
          spoken by any, how little do they relish with others: It is an
          effectual way to silence some companies. How few have anything to add.
          It is a mystery to many. A philosopher seeing a man with a fair face,
          and silent tongue, bade him speak, that he might see him. When
          scholars or merchants meet, their discourse tells what they are. Men
          of the same nation in foreign countries, speak their mother tongue to
          one another. Why not Christians? Alas! religion is at a low ebb.
          Nearest the heart, nearest the mouth. When there is fire on the
          hearth, smoke will come out at the chimney. Let the word of Christ
          dwell in you richly, in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one
          another, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace
          in your hearts to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          11. The little trouble ministers and fellow Christians get in our day,
          to solve doubts and cases of conscience, about matters concerning the
          state and case of the soul. This must be, either because people can
          guide all these concerns alone, and need no help; but often it has
          been seen, that they who could have helped others, have stood in need
          of help themselves, when the case became their own: or that people
          smother their exercises and cases, which is dangerous; or that they
          are not taken up about these matters. Indeed it is to be feared, the
          thing which makes many of us so easy is, either that we are sleeping
          or dead, and it is all one thing to such persons whether it be night
          or day; and therefore no asking of that question, "Watchman, what of
          the night? Watchman, what of the night?" It is to be feared, that many
          of us are as Samson, when "he knew not that the Lord was departed from
          him." I think we that are professors, have ground to propose that
          question, if it be so, why am I thus? So little exercised about our
          soul's state and case. I will guess at some reasons of it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The truths of religion are speculatively known by many, but
          realized by very few, 1 Corinthians 2:14. It is one thing to know the
          grammatical construction of words and their meaning, another thing to
          see the things themselves expressed by these words. One man hears of
          the bitterness of gall, or speaks of it, and is not moved; another
          tastes it, and his whole body shivers. Were the truth of the being of
          a God, the nature and necessity of regeneration, holiness, and the
          like, realized unto us, it would be impossible for us to be so little
          taken up about these things as we are. Paul knew the law literally,
          but was not exercised about his case, until it was realized to him. "I
          was alive," says he, "without the law once, but when the commandment
          came, sin revived, and I died." Alas! God, Heaven, and Hell, are but
          lifeless speculations to most men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The word heard is not mixed with faith of application, otherwise it
          would make some smart, Hebrews 4:2. Men having a soul ruining way of
          hearing. Hearing as if we were speaking to the man in the moon, so
          that we may say, "To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they
          may hear? Behold their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot
          hearken. Behold the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they
          have no delight in it." Alas! many are like the sieve out of the
          water, they lose all. But God's word will at length take hold of them,
          that will not take hold of it, Zechariah 1:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Many are very little at home, in the duty of self-examination. Some
          narrow spirits mind nothing but their own particular affairs; some are
          so taken up with the public, that matters at home, in their own
          breasts go to wreck. O! for the day, when what God has joined, men
          shall not dare to put asunder. Debt is a great burden to an honest
          heart, but some go lightly under it. Augustus hearing of one deeply in
          debt, who yet slept soundly, sent for his pillow, alleging there was
          some strange virtue in it. Want of consideration is a sleepy pillow
          indeed. If the sluggard manage the garden, bad weeds will get leave to
          grow. If there be no trial made, no wonder all pass for gold that
          glitters, and that bad wares go off in the dark.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. People have some moonlight grace within, that will appear very
          good, if they take but a slight view of it. Men are not troubled with
          questions about their state and case. What is the reason? "He feeds on
          ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver
          his soul, nor say, is there not a lie in my right hand?" Such are not
          disposed to rip up things to the quick. They find they have good
          meanings, good desires of Christ and grace, and upon these they can
          charge conscience to be quiet and back the charge, Matthew 5:6; 2
          Corinthians 8:12. But it is not their work to know whether their
          former awakenings and present desires, be of the right stamp or not.
          Alas! that is verified in many, "the soul of the sluggard desires, and
          has nothing. The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands
          refuse to labor."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Religion is but a by-hand work to many. It is the real business of
          few. The many are drowned in the thick clay of the world. Their work
          is like the mole in the earth, that lifts not up its eyes until
          a-dying. If they mind their soul's case at any time, they take but a
          start of that work. Many have imbibed Pharaoh's cursed principle, that
          religion is a work only for them that has nothing else to do. Martha
          was troubled about many things, and these turn the attention away from
          the one thing needful. People will never prosper, until they make
          religion their business, and season their whole conversation with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Satan who is the cause of much inward trouble to some, suffers
          others to be unmolested, and that because they have nothing that is
          worth to lose, except their souls, and these are best caught, while
          the man is not exercised about his case. If a soul attain to communion
          with God, victory over corruption, sound evidences for Heaven, then
          Satan never lets them rest, but does everything he can to disturb
          them. It is the rich ship which the pirate attacks, and the heavy
          purse which the robber tries to take.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Many never knew what true religion meant. Hence, like children,
          they please themselves with a bag full of counters, as if they were
          gold; "they think themselves rich, and increased in goods, and
          standing in need of nothing." When people know no other state, but
          that in which they are, it is little wonder they trouble not
          themselves about it. One bred a workman all his days, will go to his
          labor, his coarse fare, and cottage, contentedly; whereas one bred up
          in a palace, would take ill with it, and would weep, when the other
          would sing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Unacquaintedness with the work of wrestling with God. There is a
          great difference between prayers. God regards not everything which men
          call prayer. "They have not," says he, "cried unto me with their
          heart, when they howled upon their beds." Few are like Jacob, or the
          woman of Canaan, Mark 7:25, in urging their requests. Nay, our cold,
          lukewarm prayers say, that our life is almost gone, and that which
          remains is ready to die. We are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show the evil of this sleepy lazy temper of spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is far worse than it looks to be. It is like the locusts in the
          Revelations, "which had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth
          were as the teeth of lions." People are not aware of the danger of it,
          and so it is most dangerous, for the evil of it is not so easily
          discerned as in other cases; it is but an omission, and an
          indisposition for spiritual things. The sting of it is concealed. It
          is looked on as an infirmity, which the best have; for while the
          Bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. It rests like a
          friend in the bosom, but is indeed a bosom enemy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It comes not to an height in an instant, but creeps on by degrees, for
          it is the soul's sleep, which steals on at great leisure. First they
          grow heavy, then slumber, and then sleep, Deuteronomy 10–18.
          Conscience is not silenced in an instant, and Satan carries on his
          designs best by degrees. He did not presently thrust the forbidden
          fruit into the mouths of our first parents; but first Eve must see it,
          then taste, then eat, and then give to her husband.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is also a sweet sin. O but sleep is sweet! Meat is sweet, but
          people soon fill themselves with it; but they are not so soon
          satisfied with sleep. When a man can take no pleasure in any other
          thing, yet he can sleep. When people have lost all delight in God, in
          his word and ordinances, they can take pleasure in this lazy temper.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a temper of spirit most hateful to God. "As vinegar to the
          teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send
          him." "I would," says Jesus, "you were cold or hot. So then, because
          you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue you out of my
          mouth." A prince would take it ill to be brought into a smoky house,
          and to have vinegar presented to him, instead of wine; so God abhors
          such a temper, and the services which proceed from it. God is a living
          God, and he cannot love but loathe dead inactive souls. Christ keeps
          no communion with such. They are in bed, the doors are shut, they
          cannot rise to let him in, therefore he goes away, Song 5:3, 6, for
          they prefer their ease to communion with him. With them it is
          heartless work, and therefore God cannot love it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is destructive to the soul, Proverbs 24:30–34. When men sleep,
          Satan will be sowing his tares, and so there may be a sowing in joy,
          which will be reaped in tears. The bands when laid on the soul, may be
          soft as wool, but as iron at the breaking them off, as in the case of
          David. It casts the gracious soul into a spiritual consumption, and
          graceless souls it stings to death. "By much slothfulness the building
          decays, and through idleness of the bauds, the house drop through."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This temper murders convictions. It stifles the harbingers of the Lord
          of glory, and checks a good work in the bud, Acts 24:25; Hosea 6:4. It
          fares with many in this case, as with a sleepy man, who being oft
          called to arise, still falls asleep again, until the other depart from
          him. It also choaks many good resolutions. O what brave Christians
          would many of us have been, had we been what we resolved to be. But
          alas! this temper has made them like corn on the house tops, withered
          before it be grown; or like Rachel, beautiful, but barren. Conscience
          makes many resolve to amend, but spiritual laziness lets them not move
          a foot, for it cuts the sinews of all good endeavors, and makes men
          unfit both for doing and suffering. For doing. The Christian's work,
          is striving, fighting, wrestling, and running. But who will be fit to
          grapple with principalities and powers, corruptions and temptations,
          that stir not up themselves? This requires not only life but
          liveliness. It unfits also for suffering. For this the person is most
          unfit, because he loves ease, and nothing uneasy can be pleasing to
          him, Song 5:3. A suffering lot requires more than ordinary vigor, but
          the sleepy Christian has less. Its prevalence says we are unfit for
          suffering. It says trials are coming on, but that the generation is
          very unfit for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is a mother sin. It is both mother and nurse to other sins,
          Proverbs 24:30, 31. It breeds other sins, as it did David's adultery.
          Look as death seizing on the body, breeds worms and corruption, so
          deadness on the soul does produce noisome lusts. Whence is all that
          carnality, lightness, want of appetite after spiritual things, but
          from hence; they are the monstrous births of this womb. When once a
          man begins to awaken, these flee away; as the wind blowing, purges and
          purifies the air. This temper not only produces but feeds them. Lusts
          thrive well in the heart under this temper. Satan says to it, as
          Pharaoh's daughter did to the mother of Moses, nurse that child for
          me. Hence how difficult is it to recover after men have been long
          lying on this sleepy pillow. If a man take his disease in time, it may
          be speedily cured; but let it run on, it will not be so easy. While
          Babel's children are yet but young, they may be dashed against the
          stones, but being grown up, they will be more difficult to destroy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. This lazy temper of spirit, is the strongest arm of the devil. It
          is one of his master pieces for the ruin of souls. What can he not do
          with people, when once he has them in this net? By it he can do two
          things: 1. He can draw people by it. As dyers give a dip in the blue
          vat to cloth, that it may the better take on black; so Satan makes use
          of this temper for drawing men into other sins. Let men once take a
          draught of this intoxicating cup, and they will dance after the
          devil's pipe, Proverbs 23:21. Thus he made Peter deny his master, and
          the spouse to give Christ his leave, Song 5:3, 4. Sometimes the man
          will be ready to say, Am I a dog to do this thing? Well, but if Satan
          get the man under this temper, he will soon make him do it. As he
          draws them by this temper, so he holds them by it. By this means he
          holds fast his own. Has he a mind to bring them to rank poverty, this
          will do it. It will shut out the foolish virgins. How did Satan hold
          David by it, after he had fallen into adultery. The woman informs him,
          that the sin cannot be concealed, she is with child, 2 Samuel 11:5.
          But Satan keeps the hold. David is not awakened yet; he falls on
          schemes still to hide his sin, sends for Uriah, bids him go to his
          house, and sends a mess of meat after him, fills him drunk, and at
          last murders him; and thus was he held until the Lord brake the arm
          that held him, and awakened him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is that which Satan bends all his force to maintain, as
          being a main pillar of his kingdom. Are you fallen into this lazy
          frame, Satan's net and power shall fail, if you get not a sound sleep.
          He will do his utmost, before people be disturbed, until his time
          come. It seems then, he has a time, when he will allow people to be
          awakened. Yes! a twofold time: 1. When he has got a man over head and
          ears in some gross sins, that even a natural conscience will startle
          at. Then he will allow them to rub their eyes, put on their
          spectacles, that they may see the bloody sword of justice, hanging
          over their heads; and so may, in a fright, leap out of one Hell into
          another; for sometimes Satan sets the house on fire about the lazy
          sinner, that the smoke awakening him, he may leap out of his bed into
          the fire, and perish in despair. Though sometimes the Lord plucks the
          brand out of the fire, yet, like David, they escape not without broken
          bones. Again, he permits them to awake, when death is come, and time
          gone. If it were possible any could be secure beyond the line of time,
          Satan would rather awaken them himself, than that they should sleep
          on. The tempter turns accuser and executioner. When time is gone, he
          knows there is no hazard in their awakening, Ecclesiastes 9:10. Hence,
          some sleep on until the last breath, and pass off like lambs, no bands
          in their death.
        </p>

          USE II. Of exhortation. Stir up yourselves to take hold of Christ.
          There is much need of this exhortation. O! that I could come to every
          man's bed side this day, and sound an alarm. I may take up the whole
          congregation in four classes. A word to each,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Some that never had any awakening, that had never a qualm of
          conscience to make them say, what have I done? but can bless God they
          have lived in good belief all their days. Like Moab, they have been at
          ease from their youth, and have settled on their lees. They have not
          so much as a form of godliness, but live in ignorance, and profanity,
          or what they call morality, and sleep soundly in the devil's arms. The
          danger of their souls never brake their rest by night or by day. And
          if they heard of any under soul exercise, would be ready to bless
          themselves from it, or count it melancholy fits.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Awaken, O! young and old sinners, before the pit shut its mouth upon
          you, for you are sleeping the sleep of death. God forbid! will some
          say. Nay, others see the devil's mark on your foreheads, though you do
          not. Had you been born again, you would have had some pangs, some
          awakenings less or more, and would have been stirred up to mind your
          soul's case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Consider that by nature you are a child of the devil, and an heir
          of Hell; under the wrath and curse of God for original sin, and you
          have been adding every moment to that treasure of sin, while God has
          been adding to the treasure of wrath. Your soul got a wrong set by
          Adam's fall, and so could never to this day step one right step; but
          God has the account of them all to lay before you at length,
          Deuteronomy 32:34; Romans 2:5. Wrath is hovering over your head. "He
          who believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God
          abides on him;" and you are hanging over the pit's mouth, by the
          brittle thread of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Say not you have good hearts, for the heart is the worst part of you;
          "It is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." Say not
          that you live an honest life in the world. "For an high look, and a
          proud heart, and the ploughing of the wicked is sin." Say not that you
          have good meanings and desires, "For the sacrifice of the wicked is an
          abomination to the Lord." Say not that Christ is merciful, willing to
          save sinners; for he is not willing to save you in, but from, your
          sins. He is not willing to take dogs and swine to Heaven. He cannot
          save you, unless you take hold of him by faith, Hebrews 11:6; and you
          will never do that unless you be awakened, Matthew 9:12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You have never yet been brought the length of the first step to
          Heaven. Esau, Felix, and Judas, were farther on than ever you have
          been; for they were awakened and convinced, and that is the first
          work, John 16:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The devil is the master of the household with you. Until this day,
          his goods are at peace. Had the devil been cast out, he would not have
          quit his possession with so little noise, and they with whom he dwells
          now, shall dwell with him hereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Awaken now, or you will get a fearful awakening. "The sinners
          in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites: who
          among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell
          with everlasting burnings." O sinner, the house is on fire about you,
          rise therefore, out of your bed, and flee for your life. Is it not
          time yet to mind your soul? What breast plate have you got on, that
          the arrows of God's word cannot pierce you? Your confidence seems to
          be strong. But remember Job 18:14; Isaiah 28:18; Deut 29:19, 20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Those that sometimes have had an awakening, but now it is gone, and
          they are even where they were before, they are back to their old trade
          again. O sinner, did not God once awaken you? Was your conscience
          never alarmed? Are there not some who may mind, how God once took them
          to Mount Sinai, and caused them to hear the trumpet of the law?
          Perhaps at a sermon many years since, or on a sick bed, when death
          came to the bed side, and stared them in the face and filled them with
          horror of Hell following at its back: they resolved never to be again
          as they had been before. But when the sermon was once gone out of
          their heads, or they recovered out of their sickness, they turned even
          the old men and women they were before. I would pose your consciences
          with a few questions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When you had the awakening, would you not have given all the world
          to have that undone which you had done; that you had spent the time
          that was wasted in pursuit of your lusts in minding the concerns of
          your souls? Why then have you turned back? Did you not resolve for the
          time to come, that you would never be so unconcerned about your souls
          as you had been? What have you done with these resolutions now? Were
          you fools to make them, or fools to break them?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Did you think God's wrath against sin, and his threatenings, mere
          scarecrows to affright children? Why look you so on them now? Could
          you sleep sound this night if God should send you home with these
          arrows in your conscience again? Perhaps you are proof against these
          things now. But they had need of very strong armor, to ward off the
          blow, that have God for their opponent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Was not death very terrible then, in your case; and is the
          turning back to your old course, the way to make it pleasant now? Is
          there more sand in your glass now, than there was then? It may be
          farther from your mind, but it is surely nearer to your heels to
          overturn you, than it was then. Awaken now again, before God awaken
          you in wrath. It had been better for you, if you had never had that
          awakening. "If I had not come, said Jesus, you had not had sin, but
          now you have no cloak for your sin," 2 Peter 2:20, 21. The devil has a
          surer hold of you than ever. It will be a wonder if you escape; "for
          he who being often reproved, hardens his neck, shall suddenly be
          destroyed, and that without remedy." Murdered convictions sometimes
          rise again when men are dying, and with horrible cries drive men into
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Upsitten professors, of whom better things might be expected. Alas!
          many that have the root of the matter in them, are now under a decay;
          even Jonah is gone down into the sides of the ship. I have given
          several evidences of this. But further would you know it, try and find
          how the pulse of your affections beat in prayer, especially in secret,
          for in public people have many winds to fill their sails. Alas I fear
          if we view ourselves in the glass of our secret conversing with God,
          many of us will see ourselves so decayed as that nothing is left but
          skin and bone. Alas, what cold has benumbed our spiritual senses?
          Perhaps we are something before others, but in secret are as idols,
          that have eyes and see not, ears and hear not. Little heat of
          affection there, the body is placed on its knees before God, but the
          world gets away the heart. Though the eyes be shut, the man sees a
          thousand varieties. The heart, like a bird, gets out of the cage, and
          skips from bush to bush, wanders here and there. This argues a sad
          decay.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. These are but infirmities and little sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER: Is it but a little sin to neglect him whom the angels adore?
          Would you turn about your back, speaking to a king? Be it so, what
          think you of the number of them? Grains of sand heaped together make a
          mountain; and I believe, these your little sins, sometimes make such a
          high mountain between Christ and the soul, that the soul cannot meet
          with Christ in the duty, nor can its voice reach him. The bow will not
          shoot, unless it be bended, nor will the viol make melody, if the
          strings be not properly drawn. Prayer without fervor of spirit, is
          like a bird, whose nature is but to fly, but cannot, when its wings
          are clipped.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. It is hard to get the heart fixed. Indeed it is. But it is
          not impossible. David could say, "O God my heart is fixed." Were any
          of us under a sentence of death, and got access to the prince's
          chamber to petition for our life, we would not be gazing on the
          pictures hanging in the room. A man intent on his business in the
          world, hears not the first knock at his door for he is busy. O for an
          exchange of affections to get these which we give to the world, to
          give to God. The assaults of these wanderings we cannot hinder; but
          there is no necessity to entertain them. These wandering ghosts may
          knock at our door, but we need not open unless we please. We cannot
          hinder the birds to fly about our heads, yet we need not allow them to
          nestle in our hair. But O! what way shall a poor creature be kept from
          them. I can tell you no way how to be kept altogether free from their
          assaults, for I believe that is reserved for Heaven. The devil is the
          father that begets them, corrupt nature brings them forth, and if
          unwatchfulness and laziness be there, it will nurse them. But it is
          the work of grace to starve them. But if they be not entertained they
          will not mar the success of our prayers, and therefore I would give
          you advice in that case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Do as the builders of the wall of Jerusalem did, hold the trowel in
          the one hand, the sword in the other, that you may be ready both to
          build and to fight, to ward off these irregular motions of the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If they do come on, do as Abraham did with the birds that came on
          the sacrifice, drive them away. Refuse converse with them, and closely
          apply yourself to the work before you. The mind of man cannot be
          intent on two things at once.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Do as Samson who took meat out of the eater, and sweet out of the
          strong: turn them to an occasion of good, turn the cannon on
          corruption, and see if you can outshoot the devil with his own bow.
          There is a fourfold sweet may be extricated out of them by a gracious
          soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Humiliation of soul before the Lord. "So foolish was I and
          ignorant," says Asaph, "I was a beast before you." The soul may
          therewith be filled with shame and blushing before the Lord. Do you
          find your heart beginning to wander, turn yourself to the lamenting of
          the corruption, vanity and lightness of it. They are the nasty old
          friends of the bride, who beginning to draw about her while before the
          bridegroom, may well fill her face with blushing, and remind her of
          her father's house and her own people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sense of need. Many times people go to God, insensible of their
          needs, and so no wonder their hearts wander, like a man that goes to
          the market, wanting nothing, and so goes gazing up and down. Well,
          turn this wandering deadness and darkness of heart; men may quicken
          their sense of need of help from Christ, and supplies of grace, Romans
          7:21–24.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Importunity in prayer. These messengers from Satan should make us
          more importunate. The man going to the city of refuge, the nearer his
          heels the enemy is, he flees the faster, and knocks more rudely at the
          gates.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A desire of uninterrupted communication with God, and perfect
          freedom from that corrupt nature, that will needs draw a black score
          through the fairest line we can write, Romans 7:24; and thus the soul
          might be screwed up to Heaven, and drawn from under the feet of these
          tyrants. Resolution would do this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now to return, our moth eaten duties, our prayers that are so run with
          these worms of our earthly hearts, show, that there is little
          resistance made to them, and that we are very sorely backslidden. And
          to awaken you, I would cry in your ears these following:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          CRY. Jeremiah 2:2, "I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the
          love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a
          land not sown." O backslidden professors, decayed Christians, God
          remembers the day when it was otherwise with you, when you could not
          have lived as you do now. Have you forgotten the days of your youth
          and the love of your espousals. Where is your wilderness love now? Is
          not Christ as good a master as he was? Are you offended that he has
          taken the iron yoke off your necks and laid meat before you? Is this
          your kindness to your friend?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Abner's cry to Joab: Shall the sword devour forever? don't you know
          that it will be bitterness in the end; how long shall it be then
          before you bid the people return from following their brethren? This
          case is sweet in the mouth, but it will be bitter in the belly. The
          awakening may be very harsh, by the blow of the Lord's hand, if his
          word do not it. There are two ways God has awakened sleepy professors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By a dreadful storm of affliction. Thus Jonah and Joseph's brethren
          were awakened. The Lord will not let professors sleep on, but if the
          word will not do it, the sword may. We have reason to fear some of us
          are so fast asleep, that we will not awaken until we be roused up by
          the cry of ourselves or relations, weltering in blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Or, II. By letting them be plunged in the mire of some scandalous
          gross sin, as Peter; the bitterest way of all. Men keep up the body of
          religion, and that does before the world; but the soul of life is
          gone, and the Lord lets them so fall, as the world may be ready to
          judge they were never honest at the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The midnight cry. "Behold the bridegroom comes, go you out to meet
          him; or, prepare to meet your God, O Israel." The clouds are growing
          black above our heads. The Lord seems to be on his way, coming out of
          his place to punish us. The cup of these nations is filling very fast.
          It is high time to awake. It is not good furniture for an evil day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That cry, "All flesh is grass," and all the goodliness thereof, is
          as the flower of the field. You must die, and that before long. Nay,
          how soon, you do not know. But where are your evidences for Heaven?
          Are you fit to meet the Bridegroom of souls? O up and trim your lamps;
          all will have enough to do. It is sad traveling out of the world, when
          people know not where they shall next take up their lodging.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The church is crying to you to awake. Zion spreads forth her hands,
          and cries for help from her children. Her Lord is angry with her,
          threatening to give up house with her. Enemies are gathering together
          against her, saying, let Zion be defiled, and let our eye look upon
          Zion. Have you not sucked the breasts of her consolations. O stir up
          yourselves to plead with her Lord, for your mother. The ark is like to
          be carried captive, it is not time to sleep.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Posterity is crying to you. O pity the rising generation, the
          generation yet unborn. Murder not their souls before their bodies have
          got life. If they be brought up in darkness, and get poison instead of
          food, the present generation will bear the blame. The generation of
          the Jews that rejected Christ, brought his blood upon their children.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">4. To those that are awake, I shall only say.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Be thankful. It was God that gave you grace, and he has kept you
          awake. You had been sleeping the sleep of death as well as others, if
          he had not done it. It is a rare mercy, seeing your case is as in the
          text. It is a rare thing, a waking, active frame. It is a special
          favor from Heaven. The Lord comes by, and goes by many others' bed's
          side, and yet while they sleep, he awakens you. It is also a
          seasonable mercy. If ever there was a season to be awake, to have our
          lamps trimmed, it is now, when the enemy is at the gate, and the Lord
          is saying, "prepare to meet your God, O Israel."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be watchful. Perhaps your case now is not so easy, yet it is safer
          than before. O beware of falling asleep again. Awakening grace, is a
          tender bud of Heaven easily hurt. "Our vines have tender grapes."
          Therefore I say, I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the
          roes and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awaken
          my love until he please. It is hard to keep awake among a company of
          sleeping professors, Revelation 3:4. Resolve now in the Lord's
          strength as Hezekiah, "to go softly all your years in the bitterness
          of your soul." Be sensible of your danger, and look to the Lord for
          continued supply.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Be diligent. This is a golden spot of time; miss it not, nor let it
          slip. "The substance of a diligent man is precious." Now you have a
          fair wind for Immanuel's land, spread out your sails and steer away,
          lest if you miss it, the wind fall, and you tug and row in vain. "See
          then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. Redeeming
          the time, seeing the days are evil." Now you are even between the
          losing and the gaining. You are up the first step, go up the second.
          Take hold of him; get sure hold of him for yourself and for the
          church, Exodus 34:8, 9. Dig deep, build on the rock, get sure
          evidences for Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall shut up all, with speaking to some important questions. There
          are some of the godly really exercised about the case of their souls,
          who think themselves under a decay when they are not so. The first
          question is, How a person may thus mistake his case?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That God's people may think their case worse than it is, is plain,
          Isaiah 49:14–17. So also did Jacob, and the disciples going to Emmaus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The wearing of some glittering, though unsanctified affections,
          which they had before, while religion was yet new to them. Some never
          had more, and therefore, when these are gone, all is gone. True
          converts want not these either. New converts will have more fears,
          desires of grace, joy and delight, than mature ones. When grace comes
          first into the soul, it is with the man as with the Israelites, when
          they came first out of Egypt. "A mixed multitude went up also with
          them." But this multitude came not to Canaan. The army indeed was then
          less, but nothing the worse for want of them. So it is in this case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The settling of violent commotions, which they sometimes had. When
          these are gone, then some are apt to think, O they are undone. But
          truly there is no loss, when more solidity comes in their room. New
          ale works violently, yet when it is older, it has more life. James and
          John, sometimes were at that, they would have fired whole towns, that
          would not receive Christ, Luke 9:54. But when they received more of
          the Spirit, they were not so fiery, yet certainly, they were better
          men. Small rivers in time of rain, run more violently, but afterwards
          they still run, less violently indeed, but more regularly. Some
          gracious souls may think, O the love they had to Christ once, by what
          they have now. O they could not have prayed with dry cheeks, their
          prayers would have affected a thousand Christians. Now it is not so.
          But how do you love Christ now, would you not rather part with all,
          than with him? Are you not grieved for offending him? Do you pray
          weighted with a sense of your sinfulness and unworthiness? Disquiet
          not yourselves. Often where water goes out, wind enters. There is much
          false fire in flashes of affection. New married people may be fonder,
          but afterwards more loving.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. People's abating of their rashness and indiscretion. A man that is
          truly gracious, yet rash and indiscreet, when he reproves sin; if you
          do not presently yield, then he is in a flame. How sharp are his
          reproofs? O what zeal is there? Afterwards God gives the man more
          knowledge, and then he has less of his own passion and corruption
          mixed with his duty. There is no loss there, Numbers 20:10; Psalm
          106:32, 33. See 2 Samuel 15 compare verse 26 with 31. Now he was no
          less affected, but he was more judicious. Mark that prayer,
          Philippians 1:9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Presumption and self-confidence being much weakened. Grace mixed
          with self-confidence, will make a man seem far more than he is. Like a
          man newly recovered, thinks he is well enough, so walks stoutly, until
          he finds his strength fails; and he does not do so again, not because
          he has less strength, but is more sensible of his weakness than
          before. O! how much transported with love to Christ seemed Peter to
          be, when he said, "though all men should be offended because of you,
          yet will I never be offended." He could compare with all the apostles
          and go beyond them. But when Jesus said to him, "love you me, more
          than these your brethren?" Peter would now make no comparisons, but
          said, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Did he love Christ less,
          think you? Nay, surely; but he was less presumptuous. The wings of
          love and humility were better grown, though he did not fly so high as
          before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. A decay of natural vigor and activity. The existence of grace does
          not depend on the temper of the body, but yet the exercise of grace in
          religious duties, may be much hindered or furthered that way. There is
          more grace necessary to make a godly man naturally timorous, to speak
          a word for Christ, than to make a godly man naturally bold, to draw a
          sword in his quarrel. A man naturally passionate to put up with an
          injury, needs more grace than a man naturally mild. The one swims with
          the stream, and goes a greater way; the other against, and goes less,
          yet may be the best swimmer of the two. I take this to be the case of
          some old professors. Perhaps they could have remembered sermons,
          continued long in prayer; heard not, prayed not with dry cheeks; but
          now it is not so with them. Truly, no wonder; when natural vigor is
          gone, moisture dried up, and memory failed. Was David a coward, when
          his "men swore unto him, that he should no more go out with them to
          battle, that the light of Israel should be quenched." The man may have
          as great love to God, hatred to sin, desire to remember the word as
          ever. But he cannot make so good music as he did; not because his
          skill is failed, but the instrument is cracked. So with young and old
          ministers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. The failing of more than ordinary assistance, which they sometimes
          had. It is usual for the Lord thus to assist his people, when they
          first set out on his way; even to dandle them a while on his knees,
          until they be somewhat grown. "Behold, says he, I will allure her, and
          bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her." As men
          do with their children that are learning to walk. Few young children
          get broken brows, until they can walk freely alone; and few young
          converts have been such a reproach to religion, as standing
          Christians, Hosea 11:1–3. Why that now, is it because they have more
          grace? No; but they have more extraordinary assistance. The load may
          be lying more heavily on the Christian's back, than before, yet no
          less strength.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. More temptations than formerly. One that is but dull and heavy, may
          walk more quickly than the nimblest man with a clog at his heels, the
          horse retains his metal, though he goes not so quickly carrying
          double, as he did single. People ought not to mistake here. There are
          times when the Lord leads into temptation, and when he holds them off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Felt stirring of corruption more than before, Romans 7:21–24.
          This did not say he was under a decay. Many a time corruption stirs
          most when it has least strength. When it is nailed to the cross, it
          cannot but stir and make a noise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let not the godly then that are exercised about their case, mistake
          here. Remember there is a growing downward as well as upward, in
          humility, self-denial, self-loathing, and serious dependence upon the
          Lord, Hosea 14:5. People may have less comfort and less strength by
          sense than before, and yet have more grace, walking by faith. The
          safest walk a Christian has in the world, is walking between his own
          emptiness and the fullness of the Mediator.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION 2. How these that are under a real decay, may get an stirring
          and recovery?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Labor to work in your hearts a deep sense of the evil of this
          woeful temper. Ask your own souls in secret, Is not this the great God
          provoking sin? Though a man be guilty of many sins, yet if he stir up
          himself to take hold of the Lord, his case is then not so bad as when
          he thus neglects the remedy. This was God's quarrel with the old
          world. Is not this a common sin, and shall I, with the multitude,
          conspire against the Lord? John 6:67. How weak has it made me? Has it
          not been Delilah's lap, in which my strength has been taken away, and
          my two eyes put out? Is not this the very ruin of the foolish virgins,
          that have escaped the pollutions of the world?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Exercise faith in Christ for quickening influences. He is the
          fountain of life. Faith is the hand, stretch it out, though withered.
          It is the eye, open it, and with one look to yourself, behold your own
          inability to recover yourself. Many times men get an awakening, but
          fall asleep again. The reason is, they intend to rise, not to be
          raised; and so they are even allowed to fall again, as people do with
          children that are fallen and refuse help. Faith is a self-emptying
          grace, it sets down the man for a cipher in his own account book, 2
          Corinthians 12:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          With the other eye look to Christ for quickening influences. It is
          faith that raises the legally dead soul, Colossians 2:12. It also
          raises the sick soul out of a faint, "They looked to him and were
          lightened." A look to the brazen serpent healed the stung Israelites.
          A look at a crucified Savior will do wonders, Zechariah 12:10. Let
          faith then look earnestly to the blood of Christ, it cleanses from all
          sin, and purges the conscience from dead works, to serve the living
          God. Plead by faith the end of Christ's coming, that we might have
          life, and that we might have it more abundantly. Let faith make use of
          the privilege of union with Christ, and lay hold of the promises
          suited to your case, Hosea 14:7; Malachi 4:2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Make conscience of godly conference, like the disciples going to
          Emmaus. Conversation with godly Christians may do much good. He who
          walks with wise men shall be wise. You may say these are rare. But you
          that ever have had any experience of religion, tell your case one to
          another; and though you, and your company were both alike; yet two
          cold flint stones struck together, will send forth fire. "Iron
          sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend." "Two
          are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor;
          for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but we to him that
          is alone when he falls, for he has not another to help him up."
          Experience has confirmed all this. Christ sent out his disciples two
          and two.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Reflect on former experiences. Deeply muse on the days when it was
          better with you than now. Recall to mind the particular times when,
          and where, you had something of God, which you have not now, Psalm
          42:6. God is saying to you, "I am the God of Bethel, where you
          anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow unto me." Old
          experiences sometimes give a fresh smell, when handled anew, Genesis
          35:3. They are like spices that have long lain by hand, yet when
          broken give a fragrant smell. They do also remarkably contribute to
          fill our faces with blushing before the Lord. Every experience comes
          out with that inscription, "O generation, see you the word of the
          Lord; have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness." They
          contribute much to strengthen our faith, and to give us confidence
          with God, who is unchangeable. He who has been often cured by a
          physician, may come back to him with the greater confidence. Indeed,
          where we pay nothing, it is just contrary among men; but not so with
          God, though our hearts in a law fit may think it so. But the best
          return you can make to God, is to come always again, when anything is
          the matter with you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Comply with the Spirit in afflicting dispensations. A sinner falls
          asleep. Christ knocks by his word, he awakens not, God then brings his
          rod to awaken him. Affliction is a special season for awakening
          influences, Hosea 12:14, 15. Strike the iron while it is hot with the
          fire of affliction, as it is this day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Consider seriously the signs of the times, in order to be stirred
          up, Matthew 16:3. Look about you, and behold how the fields seem to be
          ripening for a harvest of judgment. This was the thing that roused up
          Jonah, 1:4. Could we but look over our beds, and see how the fire is
          taking hold of the house, it would make us start to our feet. Concern
          about the public, not improved to the advantage of our own souls, is
          but little worth; but the right noticing of state affairs, would make
          us like Noah, best when others are worst, doubling our diligence, and
          getting ourselves into a posture for an evil day, like Noah in the
          ark. But alas! it is to be feared the evil overtake us, and find us,
          as Agag or Saul, among the stuff; or Jonah, or the evil servant,
          Matthew 24:48, 49.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Labor to renew your repentance. Repentance is not only the work of
          a sinner at first conversion to God, but ought to be carried on all
          the days of our life; but in a special manner ought it to be set
          about, after great backslidings. Then we are called to repent, and do
          the first works. Satisfy not yourselves to be affected with your decay
          on a Sabbath day, and to stuff your prayers with dry inactive
          complaints, but forthwith call in your heart that has too long gone a
          roving. What wonder the ship dash on rocks, when there is none sitting
          at the helm. "Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are
          the issues of life." Watch against vain thoughts and words. Watch the
          beginnings of a revival, and blow up the sparks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Pray for quickening influences. It is a great mercy, and the
          church prays for it, saying, "quicken us, and we will call upon your
          name." When you come to offer your sacrifices, pray as Elijah, 1 Kings
          18:37, 38. Cry mightily for it. If your hearts be dead, yet try to
          rouse them, and force their fervency. A person may be so benumbed with
          cold, he can scarcely walk; yet by going, he becomes capable to run,
          and running gathers heat. The residue of the Spirit is with the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION 3. What shall we do to hold Christ still among us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Give him lodging in the best room. He is a King, and must be
          honorably entertained. Receive him into your hearts. Christ is
          standing at the door of your hearts, knocking for entrance, but
          threatening to go away, if you will not open. "Be you instructed,"
          says he, "O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from you, lest I make you
          desolate, a land not inhabited." He has been long knocking, if he go,
          the bodies of some may be in the grave, their souls in Hell, before he
          return. The Jews had much guilt lying on them, but the rejecting of
          the bridegroom, and marriage feast, was the great thing that ruined
          them, Matthew 22. So Scotland has much guilt, but if they continue to
          reject Christ, that will ruin them. Come then, old and young, to
          Christ. "Turn you to the strong hold, you prisoners of hope." The axe
          is laid to the root of the tree. God has his Son in the one hand, the
          axe in the other. He is setting life and death, the blessing and the
          curse, before you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let all his enemies be dismissed, the Achans in the camp. We cannot
          hold our lusts and Christ too. This is reasonable. He requires us to
          part with nothing but what they may well spare. Personal reformation
          is necessary to hold Christ still. National reformation is also
          necessary, but it must begin at home. Let us, therefore, every one
          reform ourselves and our families, for we are all guilty. There is
          none to cast a stone at another. Every one has a hand in bringing on
          wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lament after the Lord. This brought him back when gone, 1 Samuel
          7:2–6. The tears of the Lord's people, and their sighs after the Lord,
          go very far with a tender-hearted father. There are many things we
          cannot help; mourn over these, the sins of former, and present times.
          Alas! it is easy to speak of these, by what it is to be affected with
          the dishonor done to God by them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Give him employment. Christ rises not to pack up his wares, while
          sinners are about his hand, to buy them from him. O! for a deep sense
          of need, and a distinct view of our wants, that would make us be
          hanging on about his hand; and need takes a sure hold of Christ, and
          he cannot go from such, Mark 7:24–30. If anything be the ruin of this
          generation, it will be wearying of God. And alas! that is written on
          our foreheads, and therefore God is like to be weary of us, and is
          saying this day, "Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge
          me of mine enemies."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Improve his ordinances for the end for which they are appointed,
          and labor to get, and keep up communion with him in them. God has
          covered a table for us, these many years. How little the ordinances
          are regarded, is too evident. We have lost our appetite. God seems to
          be calling enemies to draw our table. O! that we were wise, at length,
          to prize them for their worth, before the want of them convince us of
          their value. If popery overspread this land again, what is now lightly
          valued, will, it is likely, be highly esteemed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Study unity, and beware of division; 2 Corinthians 13:11; Psalm
          133. Our Lord lays an astonishing weight on unity among his followers:
          "That they all may be one, as you Father are in me, and I in you; that
          they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that you have
          sent me." Let no difference of judgment, in every point, break the
          bond of peace and communion. Our divisions, if they grow, will make us
          a prey to the common enemy, as they now make us a laughing stock to
          them. A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand. If ever there was
          a time for professors uniting it is now; as the beasts in the ark,
          when the deluge was come on. It is to be feared, that the fire is
          begun, that will melt some to their cost, before it be put out. Shall
          we unite in sin? No, by no means. But mark the apostle's rule. "Let
          us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in
          anything, you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto
          you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
          the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Pray; O! pray that the Lord may not leave us. "Why should you
          be as a man astonished; as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet you, O
          Lord, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; leave us
          not." Our time is a time of need, that may make them pray, that never
          bowed a knee before. Prayer has done great things. It has opened the
          windows of Heaven, James 5:18. Prison doors, Acts 16:25, 26. It has
          held the destroying hand of God, Exodus 22:10. Prayer has defeated
          armies of enemies invading the land, 2 Chronicles 20: Isaiah 37. God
          has all in his own hand, and prayer engages him on a people's side.
          "Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, ask me of
          things to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my
          hands, command you me." Pray for yourselves, for the land, and for the
          church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION 4. Whether we have any ground to think that Christ will not
          leave us altogether? Although we have no ground to think that we shall
          escape some judgment; yet that God will not utterly leave us, there
          are some things that give us ground to hope, as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There are some, however few, in the land, that are wrestling,
          partly resolved never to give consent to Christ's departure, by word
          or deed, Psalm 102:16–18. Moses must let God alone, before he cut off
          Israel, Exodus 22. His prayers did not prevail to hold off a stroke,
          but a final stroke. Never yet did God altogether frustrate the prayers
          of a wrestling remnant. "For the Lord will be a refuge for the
          oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they that know your name,
          will put their trust in you; for you, Lord, have not forsaken them
          that seek you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There are some, whose work it is to walk with God, and to fear the
          Lord, and endeavoring to keep their garments clean; and however few
          they be, God has made large promises unto them, Isaiah 33:15–20. There
          are some, who have Christ's love tokens yet lying by them, to bring
          forth in a day of distress; who if the Lord should seem to cast off
          this covenanted land, would bring them forth and say discern to whom
          these belong, and we are his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Our mother is yet bearing children to her husband. We dare not say
          that she is so fruitful as she has been, yet she is not become barren.
          She is still nursing some, and bringing forth others. As there are
          some yet, who drew their first breath in the wilderness, so there is a
          holy seed brought forth since the revolution, to be the substance of
          the land. And in several corners of the land, some young ones are
          looking kindly to Christ. When the gardner is planting new slips in
          the garden, it is an evidence he intends not to give it over. As
          Manoah's wife said unto him, "If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he
          would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our
          hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at
          this time have told us such things as these."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. This land has been married to the Lord in covenant. It was entered
          into a covenant with the Lord, early after the reformation from
          popery. That work, indeed, has suffered many interruptions from
          enemies, yet it has always got up again. Many have laid down their
          lives for that cause. We had their prayers for the revival of that
          work, and we can scarcely think we have yet reaped the full fruit of
          their blood and prayers; or that God will divorce a people not willing
          to part with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Much is said of the glory of the latter days, see Isaiah 60.
          The man of sin will be brought down; and if the pope fall, it is
          likely prelates will not stand. But yet, matters in the churches of
          Christ, will be according to the pattern in the mount.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But after all, there is like to be a sad stroke in the first place,
          and that some of our eyes shall be closed, and many of this generation
          taken out of the way, before the Lord return, if he were once gone
          away, as Micah 7:11–13. It is like, our way to it may be through a red
          sea; so that we may say, as Balaam, "Alas! who shall live when God
          does this?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION LAST—But what shall we do in the meantime, in such a reeling
          time as this?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER.—You that never covenanted with God, enter into a personal
          covenant with him' and let others solemnly renew their covenant, and
          make a solemn upgiving of themselves unto the Lord. "One shall say, I
          am the Lord's, and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob;
          and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname
          himself by the name of Israel." This is a chariot, in which Christ's
          bride may ride safely to Heaven, through fire and water. And as we are
          again called to national fasting, so in the meantime, let that be your
          exercise. "And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of
          the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the
          house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart. All the families that
          remain, every family apart, and their wives apart."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Lay your accounts with, and prepare for suffering. Strive, like
          Paul, "to be ready, not to he bound only, but also to die, for the
          name of the Lord Jesus." The market is like to be raised, and our
          lightness and frothiness like to be daunted. The tender mercies of
          Popish idolaters are cruel. Much blood is in the skirts of the whore
          and there may be more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Labor to get yourselves enrapt up in a promise, Genesis 32:12. Many
          of God's children, have dined, supped, and dwelt in a promise, in an
          evil day. It has been instead of all, and cheered their hearts under
          the want of all, Habakkuk 3:17. It has been a comfort to them in
          distress, life, when half dead, Psalm 119:49, 50. A song in the house
          of their pilgrimage, verse 54. When the water of God's wrath is coming
          down, he is a wise man that climbs to such a branch of the tree of
          life growing on the banks, and holds by it until the flood be over.
          Amen.
