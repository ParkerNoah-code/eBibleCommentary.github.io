    2 Kings 2:14, "And he took the mantle of Elijah, that fell from him, and 
    smote the waters, and said: Where is the Lord God of Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">AMONG all the elders who have through faith obtained a 
    good report, there is none more remarkable than Elijah the Tishbite. He was 
    a person altogether extraordinary. In his exercise and experience he was 
    singularly distinguished. His translation was a striking loss to the church 
    of God; it was, however, not irreparable; his exercises were, in some 
    measure, patterns to the people of God in after ages; his experiences were 
    powerful encouragements to a following of him who through faith and patience 
    inherited the promises; and, what was of still greater importance, Elijah's 
    God still lived, and, as being the same yesterday, today, and forever, was 
    to be the object of hope and confidence to his people in all generations. In 
    all their straits he was to be looked to, and inquired after, for his 
    presence with them, and his blessing upon them. Thus, we see, was Elisha 
    exercised in the verse before us; for when overwhelmed, and in perplexity, 
    "He took the mantle of Elijah, which fell from him, and smote the waters, 
    and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">This verse shows us,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What Elisha did.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He took Elijah's mantle, that fell from him; God so 
    ordered, that it fell in Elisha's sight for his comfort, that he might have 
    it as a token of the spirit of Elijah resting on him. He willingly takes it 
    up: he did not say, What avails the mantle now, when it is not above 
    Elijah's shoulders? No; that God that did wonders by it before, can do the 
    same again, on whoever's shoulders, by divine appointment; even so the 
    ordinances of God are to be prized for the Lord's sake, not slighted for the 
    sake of the instruments, though they are not like to fill the room of those 
    that went before them.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He smote the waters with it. He was to go back to 
    the schools of the prophets in Jericho. Though the Lord take away eminent 
    instruments, his work must not be neglected, they that are left behind must 
    bestir themselves to carry on the Lord's work. Jordan was between him and 
    them, as oftentimes depths of difficulties will be found in the way of duty. 
    He might have boated it over; that was the easiest way, and to the carnal 
    eye the safest. But it was not the way his godly predecessor took before 
    him; therefore, having the same spirit as be had, he will rather believingly 
    venture on the waters, in the faith that God would carry him through, as he 
    did Elijah before him. So he "smote the waters."</p>
<p align="justify">2. We have what he said when he smote the waters: "Where 
    is the Lord God of Elijah?" It is a vehement exclamation for the presence of 
    that God that was with Elijah: "Where is," etc; or a most ardent prayer for 
    it: where are you? as some read it; for neither "is" nor "are" is in the 
    original. He inquires no more after Elijah, he has no petitions to that 
    saint when once he was departed; that had been impious; what he had to ask 
    of him, he asked while he was on earth. He does not sit down and weep, and 
    pore on the loss of Elijah, as if there had been no more hopes of good days 
    since he was gone, but he betakes himself to Elijah's God. Though Elijah was 
    gone, his God still remained. Elijah's experience of good from Elijah's God, 
    kindled in Elisha's heart a surprising desire after him, and fills him with 
    hope of good entertainment at the door where Elijah had come so good speed; 
    for these are not words of diffidence, but of mighty earnestness, and strong 
    faith; as appears by considering,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The issue of the whole, which was according to his 
    wish. God was present with him the same way he had been with Elijah before, 
    Jordan is divided, etc. These words, (he also) some make Elisha's answering 
    to himself, and read them, even he, namely, Elijah's God, yet endures; but 
    though there is no doubt Elisha believed this, yet that reading does 
    violence to the points and stops, without regarding of which there can be no 
    certain sense of any language: therefore our translation is preferable; and 
    these words (he also) are emphatical to show the freedom of God's grace, 
    which is tied to none, but open and free to all that come to him for it in 
    the way that others received it.—From these words, I take this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That the consideration of God's presence with 
    his people in former days, should bring the succeeding generation to the 
    same God for the same entertainment.</p>
<p align="justify">In speaking to which, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Instance a few of these experiences of God's people in 
    former days.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show how we should come to God for the same 
    entertainment.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give the reasons of the doctrine.—And,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Add the improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall instance a few of the sweet and desirable 
    experiences of the Lord's people, which should bring us to the gracious 
    Giver for the same, and such like; and I shall instance none but these of 
    Elijah, who, you must remember, was a man subject to like passions as we 
    are, James 5:17, and to these I think the text leads me. Some instances of 
    sweet entertainment this holy man had; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The God of Elijah gave him the sweet experience of 
    keeping warm and lively in a very cold and dead generation; so that he was 
    best when others were worst. His zeal for God burnt most vigorously when the 
    generation was turned most cold, halting between God and Baal, like true 
    fire that burns most keenly in the winter frost, when a chill and cold air 
    was the only air about him. By the warm blowings of the Spirit from above 
    upon him, he was kept warm within. When nothing but deadness was on every 
    hand, the Spirit of life from above kept him lively. So it was with Noah in 
    the old world: Genesis 6:9, "Noah was a just man, and perfect in his 
    generation." And Lot, 2 Peter 2:8, "For that righteous man dwelling among 
    them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with 
    their unlawful deeds."</p>
<p align="justify">But where is the Lord God of Elijah in these dregs of 
    time, wherein professors generally are carried away with the stream of 
    impiety from all their liveliness and tenderness that sometimes have been 
    among them, when the more wickedness sets up its head, piety is made to hide 
    its head the more? a sad evidence that God is gone from us, when the 
    standard of wickedness makes such advances, and that of shining holiness is 
    retreating, and can hardly get hands to hold it up. I will tell you two sad 
    experiences, common at this day.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The fulfilling of that scripture, Matthew 24:12, 
    "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." It is 
    a time when atheism, deism, and immorality, make prodigious advances, and 
    practical godliness is under a deep decay. I doubt if ever Satan had more 
    hands at work to overthrow revealed religion, and to raze the foundations of 
    it, than at this day; and this effort of Satan's against the church, has 
    joined with it a most lamentable decay of the vitals of practical religion 
    in those that are called by the Lord's name; so that we are like to be 
    exposed to this furious attack, wanting the best piece of our armor against 
    it; that is, an experience and feeling of the power of truth on our own 
    souls: ah! "where is the Lord God of Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) What heat there is, strikes all outward, while in 
    the meantime folks are key-cold within; a sad sign of a distempered body. It 
    is not hard to discern severals showing a great deal of concern in the 
    lamentable occurrences of our day; but how hard is it to find a man that is 
    truly awakened to the exercise of godliness by all the alarming 
    dispensations of our day, that is moved with fear, and busy preparing an ark 
    for the evil day, laboring to get the particular controversy between God and 
    his soul removed, putting out of his way the stumbling-block of his 
    iniquity, and setting matters in order for the day of the Lord? Nay, sirs, 
    though some talk in their sleep, it seems we will all sleep together, until 
    God's heavy hand give us a fearful awakening: "Where is the Lord God of 
    Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">2. The God of Elijah gave him the sweet experience of the 
    power of prayer: James 5:17, "Elijah was a man subject to like passions as 
    we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on 
    the earth by the space of three years and six months; and he prayed again, 
    and the Heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit." He was 
    mighty in prayer; by his prayers the bottles of Heaven were opened, the key 
    of the clouds turned, nay, the bands of death loosed, 1 Kings 17. He was a 
    great favorite of Heaven, whose cries pierced the clouds, got in to the 
    throne, and returned, like Noah's dove, with an olive-branch of peace in his 
    mouth. Such experience of the power of prayer had Jacob; Hosea 12:4, "Yes, 
    he had power over the angel, and prevailed;" Genesis 32. Many times the 
    Lord's people, when closed up on every side, have found a sweet outgate, 
    their souls flying upward in prayer. The prayers of the saints have been the 
    great ordinance of the church, have frustrated the plans of enemies, and 
    turned them back on their own heads.</p>
<p align="justify">But where is the God of Elijah, while the trade with 
    Heaven by prayers is so very low? Alas for the dead, cold, and fiat prayers, 
    that come from the lips of professors at this day! so weak and languishing, 
    that they cannot reach Heaven. Sometimes the Lord lets loose enemies on his 
    people, tosses them from vessel to vessel, and then the way between Heaven 
    and them was well occupied. They had still some particular suits lying 
    before the throne, and they could have given a good account of their 
    receipts. But long ease has made them lose their tongue; so that the 
    experience of many in that point now can hardly be named, unless they turn 
    back to former days. There is one experience of Elijah's, which, I fear, is 
    not uncommon among praying folk at this day, and that is, a restraint laid 
    on them, that they cannot wrestle with God for the averting of wrath from 
    the generation of God's wrath, 1 Kings 17:3–9. Such a sad experience had 
    Jeremiah also, before the Babylonish captivity, Jeremiah 14:11, and 15:1. 
    And though God does not so reveal his mind now in particular cases, yet I 
    suppose that it will be found, that those who live near God, and have the 
    spirit of prayer in such cases, may find something equivalent thereto in 
    their liberty and confidence with the Lord, and that according to the 
    subject of their requests: Ezekiel 36:37, "Thus says the Lord God, I will 
    yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The experience of the sweet fruits of dependence on 
    the Lord, and of a little going far, with his blessing: 1 Kings 17:16, "And 
    the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according 
    to the word of the Lord." Elijah saw so very few for God in his day, that he 
    thought he was alone; and the Lord strengthened his faith by such 
    experiences. Many times God's people have had such experiences of the Lord's 
    bringing great things about by small beginnings, as the cloud like a man's 
    hand, according to the promise, Proverbs 4:13, "But the path of the just is 
    as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day." Hosea 
    6:3, "His going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come unto us 
    as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth." God has many 
    ways of working in the experience of his people; and when he works by means, 
    sometimes he does great things by small means, as the feeding of Elijah, the 
    widow and her son, so long on an handful of meal, and a little oil in a 
    cruse; Haman's hellish plot is overturned by the king's falling from his 
    rest one night, Esther 6:1. Sometimes by contrary means, as Elijah was fed 
    by the ravens who were more likely to have picked flesh from him, than to 
    have brought it to him.</p>
<p align="justify">But where is the God of Elijah at this day, when what we 
    have seems to be blown upon, that it goes in effect to nothing? Our table is 
    plentifully covered, yet our souls are starved; our goodness sometimes looks 
    as a morning cloud, it blackens the face of the heavens, and promises a 
    hearty shower, but quickly proves as a little cloud, like unto a man's hand, 
    which is ready to go to nothing; yes, the generation is blinded by the means 
    that have a natural tendency to give light. Ah! "Where is the God of 
    Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">4. The experience of a gracious boldness to face the most 
    daring wickedness of the generation he lived in, though it was one of the 
    worst. This eminently appeared in his rencounter with Ahab, 1 Kings 18:1; 
    his standing alone against four hundred and fifty of Baal's prophets; 
    whatever was his natural temper, he owed this to the grace of God, for when 
    he was left to his natural courage, it failed him, chapter 19:2–4; but the 
    Lord spirited him then for the hard work he had to do, that he feared 
    nothing in his master's cause, Acts 4:13, "When they saw the boldness of 
    Peter and John, they marveled, and they took knowledge of them, that they 
    had been with Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">But where is the God of Elijah now, while the iniquities 
    of our day meet with such faint resistance, while a brow for the cause of 
    God, a tongue to speak for him, and a heart to act, are so much wanting. The 
    wicked of the world, though they have an ill cause in hand, yet they pursue 
    it boldly; but, alas! the people of God shame their honest cause, by their 
    cowardice and faint appearing in it. If God give us not another spirit, more 
    fitted for such a day, we will betray our trust, and bring the curse of the 
    succeeding generation on us.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The experience of a glorious and powerful 
    manifestation of himself, in a solemn ordinance, even at the sacrifice on 
    Mount Carmel, which was ushered in with the spirit of prayer in Elijah, 1 
    Kings 18:37–39, "Hear me, O God, hear me, that this people may know that you 
    are the Lord God, and that you have turned their heart back again. Then the 
    fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and 
    the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 
    And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, The 
    Lord he is the God, The Lord he is the God." That was a glorious day's work, 
    when Satan fell like lightning from Heaven, from which day, no doubt, many 
    dated their conversion, some their revival, and the people there generally 
    felt somewhat divine on their spirits. Such glorious days the church has 
    often had in ordinances, which have been as a high stream-tide of the 
    gospel; so that three thousand were converted at one sermon, Acts 2:41.</p>
<p align="justify">But where is the God of Elijah, when so little of the 
    Spirit's influences is found in ordinances, even solemn ordinances? Here is 
    the mantle, but where is the God of Elijah? Here are the grave-clothes in 
    which sometimes the Lord was enrapt up, but where is he himself? 
    Communion-days have sometimes been glorious days in Scotland, and sometimes 
    the gospel bath done much good; so that ministers have had almost as much to 
    do to heal broken hearts, as now to get hard hearts broken; but "where now 
    is the God of Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">6. The experience of being enabled to go far upon a meal, 
    1 Kings 19:8, but where now is such experiences, while there is so little 
    strength in the meals to which we now sit down? This is a time wherein there 
    is much need of such an experience; the Lord seems to be saying to his 
    people, "Rise and eat, for the journey is long;" and what a hard journey 
    some may have, before they get another meal, who knows?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The experience of the Lord's removing 
    difficulties out of his way, when he himself could do nothing at them; 
    Jordan divided; so Peter had the iron gate opened to him of its own accord: 
    for when the Lord takes the work in hand, were it never so desperate as to 
    us, it will succeed well with him. Sure we have need of his experience this 
    day. How is the case of many souls so embarrassed at this day, that they 
    cannot extricate themselves, by reason of long and continued departures from 
    God! so that all they can do is, that they are fighting and going backward. 
    Ah! "where is the God of Elijah," to dry up those devouring deeps! Enemies 
    have surrounded the church, and brought her to the brow of the hill, ready 
    to cast her over; "where is the God of Elijah," to make a way for her 
    escape?—I shall next consider,</p>
<p align="justify">II. How we should come to God for the same entertainment, 
    if we would come speed. There were two things Elisha did, for the presence 
    of God to be with him, as he had been with Elijah.</p>
<p align="justify">1. He prayed for it, sent his prayer to Heaven for it; 
    and if we would have the experience of God's presence as in former days, we 
    must ply the throne of grace for it this night. And there are three things 
    in his prayer, which must be in ours.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A most pressing sense of need, where he saw he could 
    not venture into Elijah's post without Elijah's God. Sense of need makes 
    earnest prayers. What is the reason we see not the glory of the Lord as 
    formerly? we reign as kings without it; men have found out ways of their 
    own, to get comfort without communion with God; they have the creatures' 
    breasts to suck at, when the Lord's consolations are not dropping into them. 
    But if ever the Lord return to this generation, there will be a hunger 
    raised in them, that all the world will not be able to satisfy.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A most vehement desire of his presence; "Where is 
    the God of Elijah?" There was a flame of desire after the Lord, that could 
    not be satisfied without him. Some have observed in nature, that the tongue 
    is tied by a double string to the heart in man. If so, it seems it has been 
    designed that the tongue should be a stringed instrument, to sound out only 
    the language of the heart. Were the heart more eager for the divine 
    communications, we would wrestle with God in earnest, and not let him go 
    until he bless us; but, alas! our cold prayers do but beg a denial.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) There was great faith in his prayers: "Where is the 
    God of Elijah?" Faithless prayers will be inefficacious prayers to the end; 
    but the hand of faith will pierce through the cloud with which the Lord 
    covers himself, 1st, He believed God could do what he sought, therefore he 
    calls him Jehovah, and the God of Elijah, who had discovered his power in 
    dividing the waters before. 2dly, He believed God would do it, he had God's 
    call to the work; Elijah was taken away from him, but he had Elijah's mantle 
    in his hand, for a token God would be with him, as with Elijah before; and 
    he was not faithless, but believing. So we must believe also, if we would 
    see the glory of God; not only the power, but the good-will of God; Jeremiah 
    17:6, 7, "Blessed is the man that trusts in the Lord, and whoever hope the 
    Lord is."</p>
<p align="justify">2. He used the means Elijah before him did, for attaining 
    God's appearance and manifestation of himself. He smote the waters; no 
    matter though the means be unlikely to produce the effect, if they be of 
    God's appointment; and in faith we must stretch out the withered hand, if we 
    would have it restored, and venture on the work upon the credit of the 
    promise.</p>
<p align="justify">As a conclusion to this discourse, let me exhort you to 
    go to the Lord Jesus this night, and wrestle for his presence as in former 
    times; and let the consideration of God's presence with his people in former 
    times, take you to the same God for the same entertainment.</p>
<p align="justify">To prevail with you, I would offer the following motives.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider it is too evident the Lord has forsaken this 
    generation in great measure. He is writing bitter things against this church 
    and land. Her beauty is marred upon all her assemblies; where the cloud of 
    glory some time rested, we may write Ichabod! Hence it is so few are 
    converted in our day; and the Lord's own children, though they get some 
    food, yet they fare not so well as in former times. Why? because the Lord is 
    withdrawn in his anger. The sun of the gospel in Scotland is as a winter 
    sun, and looks as if near the setting, at least getting under a dark cloud: 
    Isaiah 64:7, "There is none that calls upon your name, that stirs up himself 
    to take hold on you, for you have hidden your face from us, and have 
    consumed us, because of our iniquities."</p>
<p align="justify">2. This would be the way to get a blessing; importunity 
    prevails much in Heaven. Were we thus exercised, we might get a blessing to 
    this church, a blessing to this communion: Canticles 3:4, "I found him whom 
    my soul loves; I held him, and would not let him go, until I bad brought him 
    into my mother's house, and into the chambers of her that conceived me:" a 
    blessing we should seek from him to ourselves. Though the Lord is sometimes 
    so angry with a generation, that there is no turning away of his wrath, yet 
    the serious seekers of his face will always get the blessing: Isaiah 3:10, 
    "Say you to the righteous, it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the 
    fruit of their doings."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The door we set you to is a door where many have been 
    liberally helped before you, and the Lord's arm is not shortened. The saints 
    that were richest in experience got them all there, and all the fair ones 
    now in glory, he was their God, that was with them in life, death, and now 
    after death. Let the good report of his house, then, make you flock about 
    his door, for there is no ground for that temptation, Job 5:1, "Call now, if 
    there be any that will answer you, and to which of the saints will you 
    turn?"</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a door where there is nothing given for personal 
    worth. All that ever was given there to any of the children of fallen Adam, 
    was given with that protestation, Ezekiel 36:32, "Not for your sakes do I 
    this, says the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for 
    your own ways, O house of Israel!" That the most unworthy in all succeeding 
    generations might see they were welcome, it is for his own sake; and that 
    cannot change.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, What will ordinances avail without his presence? 
    Nay, they will do ill, instead of doing us good; they will bring on us a 
    curse instead of a blessing; and therefore wrestle with him, and protest, 
    Exodus 33:15, "If your presence go not with us, carry us not up hence." The 
    sermons will be to you as an empty sound, the Lord's table as an empty chair 
    of state, when the King is away. If his presence be not given you, you will 
    get no spiritual feast; and one had better be at a common table, than at the 
    Lord's table, when they do not feed: 1 Corinthians 11:29, "For he who eats 
    unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself." If the king be away, then 
    there will be no furniture for trials, none for the evil day, that seems to 
    be approaching quickly; none for a dying day that is awaiting all of us. 
    Now, if you would find him, seek him in Christ, look for him in the several 
    means of his appointment, streets, courts, etc. Put away everything that 
    mars his presence with you.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</b></p>
<p align="justify">I SHALL now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give the reasons of the doctrine, or show, that the 
    consideration of God's presence with his people in former days, should bring 
    the succeeding generation to the same God for the same entertainment.</p>
<p align="justify">This consideration may and ought to work upon us in two 
    ways.</p>
<p align="justify">1. By way of simple excitation and upstirring. When 
    Elisha considered what God had done for Elijah, it set his soul on fire, 
    inflamed his desires, set his heart a-longing after the Lord, that he might 
    deal the same way with him. Thus the consideration of God's gracious 
    appearances to and for his people in former times, should be a powerful 
    motive to labor for the same or like experiences. It should inflame our 
    hearts with a holy emulation, and earnest desire of the blessed 
    entertainment others have got before us at God's door; for the following 
    reasons—</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because, so far as we come short of it, it is a sign 
    we are so far off the way where the footsteps of the flock are to be seen, 
    Canticles 1:8; and that is so dangerous, that it may well strike a nail to 
    our heart to think of it. What is the reason we fare not so well about the 
    Lord's hand as others before us? Have we not the same God to go to, the same 
    covenant-promises? We have the same breasts of divine consolations, as full 
    as ever, but it seems we have much lost the art of sucking them, that 
    sometimes has been our experience.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because, so far as we come short, it is a sign of 
    God's anger against us, that he has some quarrel with us he had not with his 
    people in former days of the right hand of the Most High; and may not this 
    prick us to the heart, and set us to our knees? Isaiah 59:12, "For our 
    transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us." 
    What is it but the sins of the generation, that stops the communication of 
    the divine goodness? Does the Spirit of the Lord depart until he be grieved, 
    or the holy fire go out until it be quenched? Does the Lord close his 
    distributing hand until his people close their months? or does not the oil 
    run while there are empty vessels to receive it? While the furious wind of 
    persecution blew on God's people in Scotland, and the sweeping rains fell, 
    sweeping away their earth from about them, the fountain of the divine 
    goodness to them ran freely; but now, alas I through long ease, we have got 
    the springs stopped with our mud and earth.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Because we have as much need as they had: Luke 
    15:17, "And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my 
    father's house have bread enough, and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I 
    will arise, and go," etc. If we be less at God's door than other's before 
    us, it is not, I am sure, for any wealth we have at home, more than they 
    had; it is not that we do not stand in need, but that we are not so sensible 
    of our need. Many of the Lord's people have taken little rest, when they had 
    more than we can pretend to; they have been very anxious to increase their 
    stock when it was far above ours; and when we consider how fast they ran, 
    when they bad reached far above our small measure, should not that stir us 
    up to mend our pace? Philippians 3:13, 14, "Brethren, I count not myself to 
    have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are 
    behind, and reaching forth unto those things that are before, I press 
    towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Because these glorious examples should not be 
    without due influence upon us. Example is a most efficacious incitement; 
    Caesar grieved when he saw the statue of Alexander, and considered how he, 
    at the age of thirty, had conquered the world, and himself, being older, had 
    done nothing; Hebrews 12:1, "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about 
    with such a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin 
    which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is 
    set before us." How may we blush when we consider the stature of those 
    before us, that have been as the palm-tree, while we, growing in the same 
    soil, are like pitiful shrubs! Surely if our spirits were not mightily sunk 
    and degenerate, the glorious example of the Lord's people in former days 
    would set our whole soul a-going after the God of Elijah.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It should work on us by way of encouragement. Elijah's 
    example gave Elisha hopes he might find God the same to him he had been to 
    his predecessor. Encouragement is a notable spur to diligence, and is that 
    which is most likely to take with men. What is it which makes us that we 
    wrestle not for God's presence, as in former days? even unbelief, that tells 
    us we need not be at the pains, for it will not do. But the report of the 
    godly in former days contradicts the report of unbelief, and therefore 
    should bring us back to God's door; even as when a beggar, having called at 
    a door for his alms, was coming away without it, and should meet with 
    another that had been plentifully served there, who would say to him, That 
    is a good house, and though one may stand long at the door before they be 
    served, yet they give ay a liberal alms at length; would not that bring the 
    beggar back again? So should the consideration of God's presence with his 
    people in former days bring us to him for the same entertainment. For this 
    there are the best reasons; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because the experiences of the Lord's people in 
    former days were given, and put on record, for that very end. All the 
    experiences of God's presence with his people in former days, are as so many 
    signs of peace on earth, and good-will towards men. They, as it were, stand 
    at God's door, to invite and encourage those of succeeding generations to 
    come in there for the same or like entertainment; and his people do but 
    answer the design of them, when they come and inquire, "Where is the Lord 
    God of Elijah?"—2 King 2:14, "That in the ages to come he might show the 
    exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us through Christ 
    Jesus."—Romans 15:4, "For whatever things were written aforetime were 
    written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the 
    scriptures, might have hope."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because these experiences say there is enough to be 
    had in God for the seeking, if we seek in his own way: Psalm 22:4, "Our 
    fathers trusted in you, they trusted, and you did deliver them. They cried 
    to you, and were delivered; they trusted in you, and were not confounded." 
    The saints that have gone before us have spread a good report of God's 
    house, that others after them might come to the same door. They have had the 
    experience of the Lord's help in all the cases that we can be in; and 
    whatever be the difficult steps we have to go, if we mark narrowly, we will 
    see the footsteps of the flock before us in these steps through which their 
    God has graciously handed them: Psalm 34:6, 8, "This poor man cried, and the 
    Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.—O taste, and see that 
    the Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusts in him." And their 
    experiences are their testimony to the truth of his promises: Psalm 12:6, 
    "The words of the Lord are pure as silver tried."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Because we have the same advantages that they had, 
    yes, and more than some of them, that lived in darker days than we do. How 
    many have groped the way to the throne of grace, when they bad not such 
    light shining around them as we have to show the way; but, however we make 
    the comparison, we have the same God to go to that they had, who has as much 
    to give, and is as gracious as ever: James 1:17, "Every good gift, and every 
    precious gift, is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with 
    whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning;" the same High 
    Priest over the house of God, that is as well heard by the Father now as 
    ever, Hebrews 13:8, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for 
    ever;" the same covenant, for it is everlasting; the same promises, whose 
    truth and mercy endure forever.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Because all that ever the best of the saints got was 
    in the way of free grace. It was not only undeserved, but given over the 
    belly of ill-deserving: and if it be free grace that opens the door, what 
    needy sinner is there but may come forward for a share! All the love that 
    was ever bestowed on any of them, was free love, without the least 
    deserving; if you think there is any exception, look through them all, from 
    Adam downwards, and name the man if you can. Paul challenges the world to do 
    it, Romans 11:35, "Or who has first given to him, and it shall be 
    recompensed unto him again?"</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I am now to make some practical improvement. And 
    this,</p>
<p align="justify">I. In an use of reproof. This reaches a reproof to 
    several sorts of persons; as,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To our modern blasphemers, who reckon the saints' 
    experiences of the workings of the Lord's Spirit on their spirits nothing 
    but the effects of imagination, heat of fancy, or somewhat else. So true is 
    it, 1 Corinthians 2:14, "The natural man receives not the things of the 
    Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, 
    because they are spiritually discerned." But when we consider the 
    sanctifying effects of these operations felt on their spirits, how by these 
    their hearts are loosed from the lusts to which they were formerly glued, 
    inflamed with love to God and his holy law, and thus to despise the world, 
    rejoice in tribulation, joyfully to suffer for Christ, and deny themselves 
    to all that is dear to them in the world for his cause, we must conclude, 
    that these men do but new-model the doctrine of those that taught long ago 
    that Christ cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils; and that, as 
    their working is formal, suited to the spirit of the natural man; so their 
    spirit is profane.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Those that slight the experiences of the people of 
    God, and appearances to and for them, as not worth their notice, far less of 
    their pains, to got the same entertainment; and yet they did more service to 
    the cause of God, by their godly simplicity, than we are like to do by our 
    refined prudentials; and no wonder, for if a man will be truly wise, 1 
    Corinthians 3:18, "Let him become a fool, that he may be wise." A little 
    faith and dependence on the Lord for light and strength, will go farther 
    than much carnal foresight. But they had the spirit of preaching, praying, 
    and other things belonging to the service of God; and we have the bare act 
    of it. The good Lord send back the Spirit, come of the act what will!</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) To those who are ready to talk big of the 
    experiences of God's people, and of God's appearances for them in former 
    days. With a whole heart, their consciences bearing them witness, they are 
    not concerned to wrestle with God for themselves or others now, or to put to 
    their hand, in their several capacities, to the revival of practical 
    godliness in the generation; but, on the other hand, do improve it to the 
    hardening of their own hearts, and to the contempt of ordinances and 
    ministers. These are the genuine offspring of those who built the tombs of 
    the prophets, and garnished their sepulchers, yet are filling up the measure 
    of their fathers' iniquities, Matthew 23:29.—Whence I may observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That dead prophets are better liked by a formal 
    generation, than living ones, for they get less trouble of the dead than of 
    the living.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Such would make a brave use of the means of grace 
    that were in former days, which they are sure they cannot get, while they 
    have no power to improve the means that are among their hands.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) These will condemn their fathers' misusing of the 
    prophets that are gone, who yet will trample on their successors that are 
    remaining.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) To those who improve the experience of the Lord's 
    people in former days against themselves, to the deadening their own 
    spirits, instead of quickening them, when they look upon them. By the 
    subtlety of Satan, they are thereby discouraged and broken instead of being 
    animated, as they ought, to seek the same entertainment. It is the remains 
    of a legal disposition in any of the children of God, that is the source of 
    discouragements arising from this airth. They look more to the goodness that 
    was in the saints, and the ill that is in themselves, than to the blood of 
    the Lord Jesus Christ, through which alone the divine goodness did flow to 
    them, and through which it may flow as freely to themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, To those whose hard thoughts of God the 
    experience of all the saints from Adam cannot remove. So vile are they, they 
    conclude, that God's heart cannot be towards them, though they have all the 
    experiences of former saints, as so many depositions to confirm the welcome 
    of all that come to him through Christ, whatever they have been. O lay by 
    these hard thoughts of God, so destructive to yourselves, and so 
    dishonorable to God. Look among all that ever came to God, if you can find 
    one that died at his door; if that be your lot, you will be the first; but 
    God's word says you shall not: John 6:37, "Him that comes unto me, I will in 
    nowise cast out." Beware of hard thoughts of God whatever your 
    disappointments be; if the devil can get that point wrought up in you, he 
    has you fair before the wind for Hell, where the fearful and unbelieving 
    land: and there is not a readier way on earth than that, to create a Hell 
    within a man, a Hell, I say, where sin and sorrow for sin are both at a 
    height. But here some may propose this</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. No other person's case is like mine. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. And there is none good as the Lord; he is 
    goodness itself, infinite goodness, and infinitely good to sinners in 
    Christ; and that is sufficient to swallow up your matchless evil. What think 
    you of Paul, Manasseh, Adam? But though you cannot see a case like yours 
    among all the elect of God, you cannot thence conclude your case is 
    marrowless, more, than if you were in a wilderness where you could see no 
    marks of a person's foot, you might conclude never one was there before you. 
    But suppose the saints' experiences leave you, yet the word will reach you: 
    Revelation 22:17, "And the Spirit and the Bride say, come; and let him that 
    is athirst come; and whoever will let him take of the water of life freely." 
    And if your case be quite new, God will do a new thing according to his 
    word. Some person must go foremost in every case; venture you, then, on 
    Christ with that case of yours, that others that may be in it after may 
    follow, and you shall find a matchless physician for a matchless malady.—I 
    shall only add,</p>
<p align="justify">2. An use of exhortation. Let me exhort all, especially 
    communicants, to seek the Lord's presence and glorious appearances as in 
    former days; and make this your great business, never ceasing until he make 
    himself known, as in the days of old.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Seek his glorious presence to the spirits of his 
    people, as in former days. The Lord's work here is at a sad stand; cry, 
    "Revive your work in the midst of the years," Habakkuk 3:2. Their bones are 
    in that respect lying dry about the grave's mouth. O cry for the Spirit of 
    life to enter into them! Even the trees of God's planting are become mighty 
    sapless; God's wheat is mighty withered at the root; cry for a shower of 
    influences, that the work within, that is at such a stand, may go on yet, 
    and soul-exercises may be set on foot again.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Seek his powerful manifestation of himself, to purge 
    the generation's wickedness, and to make holiness more common and shining in 
    our day. There is a deluge of profanity overflowing the land: "Where is the 
    Lord God of Elijah?" Cry for his appearance, to turn the stream, to make 
    iniquity hide its head, and holiness to settle in its room. There is a 
    glorious promise to the gospel-church, in Zechariah 14:20, "In that day 
    shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness unto the Lord; and the 
    pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar;" cry for 
    the accomplishment of it, to him with whom is the residue of the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Seek his glorious appearance in ordinances, as in 
    former days, that he would beautify the place of his glory by his presence. 
    Do your utmost to get him into your mother's house, for it is a heartless 
    house when he is away. We have been in pain, we have, as it were, brought 
    forth wind, we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth: "Where is the 
    Lord God of Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Seek his glorious appearance for his churches, now 
    when they are so low, and the hand of the Anti-christian faction is so high: 
    Jeremiah 51:50, "Remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into 
    your mind;" for your mother-church in particular, against which many are 
    gathered, saying, Let Zion be defiled. Behold how pin after pin in her 
    tabernacle is loosed, that it must quickly lie along upon the ground, if the 
    Lord himself do not appear to hold it up. Seek for the revival and 
    preservation of the covenanted work of reformation, that sacred pledge 
    transmitted to us at the expense of the precious blood of many of the 
    saints, the bearing down and destroying of which is like to make these 
    nations yet swim with blood. Our rowers have rowed as into deep waters, 
    where they have sunk our nation, and solemnly buried our covenants in the 
    ruins of it: "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?"</p>
<p align="justify">Cry for their resurrection; and if you can do no more you 
    may do as Martha and Mary, that owned their relation to their brother while 
    in the grave; and say as Mary, and these with her, John 12:34, when Christ 
    asked, "Where have you laid him?" "Lord!" say they, "come and see."—For 
    motive,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider that the Lord's appearances and 
    manifestations of himself as to his people in former days, would make a 
    pleasant change on the face of affairs this day, it would be as life from 
    the dead: Isaiah 35:1–2, "The wilderness and the solitary place shall be 
    glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It 
    shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing. The glory 
    of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they 
    shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God." It would 
    renew the earth's withered and decayed face. If, therefore, you have any 
    respect for the thriving of your own souls, any pity on the perishing souls 
    of a graceless multitude, any regard to God's honor and ordinances, any 
    concern for his ark and work, seek his glorious appearance for his church.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider that matters are come to such a pass with us 
    now, that nothing less than God's gracious appearance for us, and presence 
    with us, as in former days, can prevent our ruin; we have all grounds to 
    fear an arousing stroke from the hand of the Lord, by means of a French, 
    Popish, and malignant faction, set to raze our Jerusalem to the very 
    foundation, whose tender mercies are cruelty; and if we should miss it, 
    which is not likely by all appearance, there will be a blacker sight seen on 
    this church, and these nations, by reason of that spirit of enmity against 
    the purity of religion, and against all practical religion, that has made 
    such dreadful advances this day, that, if God do not seasonably strike in, 
    will, through time, wear out the saints of the Most High.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider the glorious things spoken of the latter 
    times, to which the world seems to be advancing apace. The extraordinary 
    efforts made this day for advancing the kingdom of the devil in the 
    Christian part of the world, the universal decay of piety in the churches 
    look like a critical juncture, when the honor of God is called upon to 
    "arise like a giant refreshed with wine," to purify a people to himself, and 
    to strike his enemies on the hinder-parts. Whatever sad work may be made on 
    the churches before that come, O cry, "Awake, put on strength, O arm of the 
    Lord! awake, as in the ancient days," Isaiah 59:9.—I shall close with a few 
    advices.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Stir up yourselves to repent and reform: "Strengthen 
    the things that remain, that are ready to die," Revelation 3:2. It is high 
    time we were bending to our feet, when the fire has begun to catch hold of 
    our bed of sloth; we have slept long enough, labor now to get and keep 
    matters clear between God and your souls.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Lament after the Lord: 1 Samuel 7:2, "And all the 
    house of Israel lamented after the Lord." Upon that they had occasion to set 
    up another Ebenezer. The tears of the Lord's people after a departed God are 
    the ready way to bring back their tender-hearted Lord. Mourn over your own 
    sin, and the sins of present and former times.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Study unity, and beware of division, Psalm 133:3; be 
    more afraid of your own than of other people's sins. This church at best is 
    but weak; let us not by divisions make ourselves an easier prey to the 
    common enemy, lest God be provoked to cast us into the fire, to make us burn 
    together.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lay out yourselves for the advancement of piety, to 
    stir up one another to holiness, love, and good works. Put to your hand this 
    way to hold up a standard for Christ in the world; the devil's agents are 
    busy, not only against the out-works of religion, but to sap the foundations 
    of it. What are you doing to strengthen them? To talk and complain about the 
    defections of the time, will not do it, but apply your main force to advance 
    and strengthen the vitals of religion in yourselves and others.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Labor to put yourselves in a posture for suffering; 
    cast the burden of earth off your back, and let your shoes be on your feet, 
    your eye on the prize; pursue it over the belly of all hardships you may 
    meet with, and you will readily find God will be with you.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Pray, pray, lift up a cry for the remnant that is 
    left; let us meet continually at the throne of grace, ministers and people, 
    to tryst with him in his ordinances, and to wrestle for his presence.</p>
