    Isaiah 53:1, "Who has believed our report, and to whom it the arm of the 
    Lord revealed?"</p>
<p align="justify">NONE spoke so much of Christ as this evangelical prophet. 
    He had been speaking of him in the former chapter, verse 13, and downward, 
    and he was to speak more of him here. But in the words now read, he makes a 
    melancholy reflection on the cold entertainment the word met with in his own 
    time, and would meet with in after times.</p>
<p align="justify">The words are a heavy complaint and lamentation. And if 
    we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, To whom it was made. We find from parallel 
    scriptures that it is made to the Lord himself; John 12:38, Romans 10:16, 
    "Lord, who has believed our report?" etc. From powerful preaching he betakes 
    himself to mournful prayer, lamenting the unsuccessfulness of his message.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Whom it respects. It respects the hearers of the 
    Gospel n his own time, and in after times too; John 12:37, 38, "But though 
    he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him; that 
    the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, 
    who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been 
    revealed?" The Jews, to whom Christ himself preached; and both Jews and 
    Gentiles, to whom the apostles preached, Romans 10:16. No wonder then it 
    extend to those to whom ministers now preach.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, The matter of this heavy lamentation.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The unsuccessfulness of the Gospel, and prevailing 
    unbelief among them that heard it. Where consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) What the Gospel is. It is a report; a report from 
    Heaven, brought by Christ himself, the apostles, and prophets, to be 
    believed unto salvation. The word signifies "a hearing," that is, a thing to 
    be heard and received by faith, as a voice is received and heard by the ear. 
    Hence is that expression, the hearing of faith, Galatians 3:2.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) What faith is. It is a believing that report. The 
    word rendered believing, does properly signify to trust. So it is in the 
    Hebrew, "Who has trusted to our report?" Faith is a giving credit to the 
    Gospel, and a trusting our souls to it, as on a word that cannot fail.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) How rare that faith is; who has believed? Few, very 
    few have believed the report. It is brought to multitudes; but where is the 
    man that really trusts it, as news from Heaven that may be relied on? They 
    are but here and there one who trust it; the generality regard it but as 
    idle tales.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The great withdrawing of the power of God from 
    ordinances; "And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" The arm of the 
    Lord is the power of God; and this arm is said to be revealed or uncovered, 
    when it exerts itself in acting powerfully; as men put up their sleeves when 
    they are putting themselves in order for working with the hand. And this 
    implies three things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That there is a necessity of the mighty power of God 
    being exerted on a man, to cause him believe; John 6:44, "No man can come to 
    me, except the Father which has sent me draw him." The trusting to the 
    report of the Gospel is so far from being an easy effort of imagination, 
    that it is beyond the power of nature.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That few, very few, felt this power. To whom? 
    (Hebrews) Upon whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? The Gospel was but an 
    empty sound to the most part; they found not the power of the spirit coming 
    along with it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That hence so very few believed. Where there is no 
    feeling of that power, there is no believing. First the arm of the Lord must 
    draw, before the sinner can come; therefore these two are of equal latitude; 
    Ephesians 1:19, "What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who 
    believe, according to the working of his mighty power." Four doctrines are 
    deducible from the words.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. The little success of the Gospel, and great 
    rarity of divine power coming along with Gospel ordinances, will be matter 
    of heavy lamentation to the godly, and particularly to godly ministers.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. The Gospel is a report from Heaven, to be 
    believed and trusted to for salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. Though many hear, yet few believe or trust 
    to the report of the Gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. There is no true believing or trusting to 
    the report of the Gospel, but what is the effect of the working of a divine 
    power on the soul for that end.</p>
<p align="justify">We shall handle each of these doctrines in order.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. The little success of the Gospel, and great 
    rarity of divine power coming along with Gospel ordinances, will be matter 
    of heavy lamentation to the godly, and particularly to godly ministers.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is that success which the Gospel sometimes has?</p>
<p align="justify">II. What is that divine power which sometimes comes along 
    with Gospel ordinances.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">What is that success which the Gospel sometimes has? We 
    may take it up in these two generals. It is successful,</p>
<p align="justify">1. When sinners are thereby brought to faith in Christ, 
    Romans 1:17. The Gospel is a good report of Christ the bridegroom of souls, 
    spread in the world; and then the end of it is gained, when the sinner is 
    brought to behold him so altogether lovely, as that he gives up with all his 
    former lovers, and is married to him, to be his only, wholly, and forever, 
    Psalm 73:25.</p>
<p align="justify">2. When they are thereby brought to holiness of life; 
    when they are transformed into the image of him in whom they have beliered, 
    2 Corinthians 3:18. It is a holy gospel, and true believers of it are cast 
    into the mold of it, Romans 6:17; and being united to Christ, "put on 
    Christ," Galatians 3:27. walking as personating him, 1 John 2:6. These 
    things are so excellent, that it is very lamentable there is so little of 
    them among men.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What is that divine power which sometimes comes along 
    with Gospel ordinances? There is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A heart and life discovering power, 1 Corinthians 
    14:24, 25. The word comes, and the Lord's arm comes with it, and opens the 
    volume of a man's heart and life; and it is as if the preacher were reading 
    the secret history of a man's thoughts and actions; Hebrews 4:12, "For the 
    Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, 
    piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints 
    and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." 
    This is called the watchman's finding the spouse, Canticles 3:3.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A sharp convincing power, whereby the sinner does not 
    only see his sin, but sees the ill and danger of it, and is touched to the 
    heart with it; Acts 24:25. That is the finger of God at the man's heart, 
    according to John 16:7, 8, "When the Spirit is come, he will reprove the 
    world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment." So it was with these; 
    Acts 2:37, "They were pricked in their heart, and said, Men and brethren, 
    what shall we do?" And O, it is promising when men are sent home with a 
    breast full of convictions from the word. But if that arm of the Lord be not 
    revealed, one will be very easy, come the word never so close to his case.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A drawing and converting power; John 12:32, "And I, if 
    I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." Psalm 19:7, "The 
    law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul." While the word comes, some 
    secret power comes along, that the man is not able to resist it; but the 
    iron gate of the heart is loosed, and of its own accord opens wide, to 
    receive the King of glory. Such a power Zacchaeus felt with that word, "Come 
    down," that made his heart, which was like a strong castle to keep out 
    Christ, come as fast down, as ever an old house did being undermined; Luke 
    19:5. While this comes not, sinners will not come to Christ; John 5:40.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A quickening power; Psalm 119:50, "Your word has 
    quickened me." Sometimes the spiritual senses have all been bound up, that 
    the soul could neither see, hear, taste, smell, nor feel spiritually, more 
    than it had been dead; and a word has been dropped in with such a power, 
    that it has been like the barley-cake tumbling down on the tents of Midian, 
    or like the honey Jonathan tasted in the wood; it has cleared their eyes, 
    unstopped their ears, etc. Canticles 7:9. While this is wanting, the word 
    cannot awaken people.</p>
<p align="justify">5. A clearing power, resolving doubts, removing mistakes 
    and darkness in certain particulars, whereby one is retarded in their 
    spiritual course; Psalm 19:7, 8. Many a time souls have been so embarrassed 
    with some doubts or mistakes, that they have thereby been made to go like a 
    fettered bird, perhaps many a day and year; until at length they have got a 
    word with such power, that it has made these their fetters fall off, like 
    Peter's chains when the angel gave him a touch on the side; Acts 12:7. 
    Cornelius had sweet experience of it; Acts 10:6–44. While the power comes 
    not, they come and go with their chains on them.</p>
<p align="justify">6. A comforting power; Psalm 119:49, 50, "Remember the 
    word unto your servant, upon which you have caused me to hope. This is my 
    comfort in my affliction; for your word has quickened me." Discouragement is 
    a great load; the discouraged soul is like one going with a clog at his 
    heels. Great pressures of affliction are apt to discourage, make the heart 
    faint, the hands weak, and the knees feeble; but sometimes the word comes 
    with such power, as that it stays the fainting soul; Psalm 119:92, "Unless 
    your law had been my delight, I should then have perished in my affliction." 
    Sometimes such a high spring-tide of power comes with the word, that the 
    clog drops off, and the affliction that was so heavy is not the weight of a 
    feather, but the man rejoices in the Lord, and leaps like an deer; Isaiah 
    12:3. For the comfort of the word has loosed all his bands; Romans 15:13; 
    Hebrews 10:34.</p>
<p align="justify">7. A strengthening power; Psalm 96:6, "Strength and 
    beauty are in his sanctuary." Sometimes a man has great temptations to 
    conflict with, and he knows not how to stand before them; until he come to 
    the sanctuary with Asaph; Psalm 73:16, 17, and with Paul get a word with 
    power; 2 Corinthians 12:7. Then he is like a giant refreshed with wine, and 
    in the strength of that word goes out like David against Goliath. The Spirit 
    with the word breathing on the dry bones, makes them stand on their feet 
    like a great army.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lastly, A soul-elevating and heart-ravishing power; 
    Luke 24:32, "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by 
    the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?" Sometimes such a power 
    has come along with the word, as if in Heaven, not a window only, but a door 
    had been opened; that the man has made no doubt to say, Genesis 28:16, 17, 
    "Surely the Lord is in this place.—This is none other but the house of God, 
    and this is the gate of Heaven." And Christ has come so near him, as he 
    could tell what was the smell of his garments; Psalm 45:8; and the sermon or 
    communion place would have been gladly embraced as the dying place; Luke 
    2:29.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The third thing is, The reasons of the point. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It must be matter of lamentation to the godly in 
    general. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The honor of Christ is thereby overclouded. He is not 
    honored, but highly dishonored by sinners disbelieving the report of him, 
    not receiving him in the gospel-offer; John 8:49. Hence it was a part of 
    Christ's humiliation, that his report out of his own mouth was not believed; 
    John 12:37, 38; and after his exaltation his apostles were to do greater 
    works than he; John 14:12. And when he goes forth in the gospel conquering, 
    a crown is said to be given him; Revelation 6:2. But that crown is obscured 
    in a time of the gospel's unsuccessfulness. And Christ's honor will be dear 
    to the godly, whatever it be to others; and the affronts done him by 
    unbelievers, will lie near their hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The glory of the glorious gospel is thereby veiled. 
    The gospel is in itself glorious; 2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 Timothy 1:11. It is a 
    radiant jewel, of greater worth than all the glory of the world; but the 
    glory of it is hid, while it is not believed, and divine power does not 
    accompany it; therefore having "free course," it is said to be "glorified," 
    2 Thessalonians 3:1. And this cannot but affect the godly, who relish the 
    gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Souls are thereby lost, while salvation is come to 
    their door. The gospel brings salvation; but none can share of it where it 
    is not believed; Hebrews 4:2. What a lamentable sight it is to see men 
    slighting and despising their own misery; neglecting the great salvation; 
    continuing filthy still under means of cleansing; growing worse, by the 
    means of grace doing them no good; and finally, aggravating their own 
    condemnation; John 15:22.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The godly themselves suffer loss. The stronger 
    Christ's family is, the better the children thrive. The calling of the Jews 
    will be as "life from the dead;" Romans 11:15. The saints in the worst of 
    times will always get as much as will keep in their life; Micah 2:7. But 
    there is a difference between fend and fare well. If there were more 
    converting, there would be more confirming work too.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, And particularly to godly ministers. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Thereby their care and pains is much lost, and in 
    vain. To toil all night and catch nothing, is a heavy task. Ministers are 
    like candles; while they give light to others, they waste themselves. And 
    that is a heavy tale; Isaiah 49:4, "I have labored in vain, I have spent my 
    strength for nothing, and in vain." O there is much need of faith in the 
    work of the ministry! The gardener, shepherd and tradesman, sees ordinarily 
    the fruit of his labors; if it miss at one time, it will readily prosper at 
    another; but there is much spiritual seed sown, where there is no visible 
    fruit.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Thereby their work is rendered more difficult and 
    wearisome. When the arm of the Lord is revealed to carry on the work on 
    men's souls and consciences, it is made lightsome; they are then like a ship 
    going with a fair wind. But when the Spirit is withdrawn, they are like the 
    ship in a dead calm, that takes much strength to work her, and yet she comes 
    but little speed.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, Thereby the seals of their ministry are but 
    small. They are the savor of death to many, the savor of life to few; for 
    the one or the other they will be to all; 2 Corinthians 2:15, 16. If they be 
    not, by men's receiving their testimony, instruments to further their 
    salvation, they will be witnesses against them, to aggravate their 
    condemnation.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Then let it teach our hearts, and cause us to 
    lament, that there is so little success of the gospel, and so great a rarity 
    of divine power coming along with ordinances at this day in the land, and 
    among us. Of this there are several evidences.</p>
<p align="justify">EVIDENCE 1. The slighting of gospel-ordinances that so 
    much prevails. How easy is it for many to sit at home, and make to 
    themselves silent Sabbaths, while the Lord puts an opportunity in their 
    hands to attend ordinances! for others if they be but touched against the 
    grain, and disobliged, to cast them off for good and all! A sad evidence the 
    gospel has had little success or power with them; for the experience of the 
    power would give men a higher value for them than to neglect them; Psalm 
    63:1, 2, and 84:1–3.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Little reformation of life under the dispensation of 
    the gospel. Ministers may say with Jeremiah; chapter 6:10, "To whom shall I 
    speak and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is 
    uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken; behold, the word of the Lord is unto 
    them a reproach; they have no delight in it. He who was filthy, is filthy 
    still." The glass of the word is held before men's eyes, that they cannot 
    but see their spots; yet do they not wipe them off. Under the gospel of the 
    grace of God they live ungodly lives; in the land of uprightness they deal 
    unjustly; rebelling against the light.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Much formality in attendance on ordinances; Ezekiel 
    33:31, 32. People satisfy themselves with the work done. Few take heed how 
    they hear. They seek not to be spiritual in the work, to have communion with 
    God in ordinances, nor do they mourn when they obtain it not. They do not 
    miss the power of God in ordinances; or if they do, they can easily bear the 
    want.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Little of the work of conversion or 
    soul-exercise in our day. The gospel is the great mean of conversion, of 
    bringing sinners into a state of grace; but converts are rare. Conviction, 
    compunction, and humiliation, are rarely made now by the word; and rarely 
    issued in kindly conversion to God. Sometime the word would have raised 
    soul-exercise in them that heard it, and the word again would have brought 
    the Christian's exercise to a happy issue; but, alas! that is seldom the 
    case now.</p>
<p align="justify">Now this may be for a lamentation, that it is so; that 
    there is so little success attending the dispensation of gospel-ordinances, 
    and that there is a great rarity of divine power coming along with them. 
    For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This says, that the Lord is in a great measure 
    departed from us, ministers and people; Isaiah 64:7, "There is none that 
    calls upon your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of you; for you 
    have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our 
    iniquities." We may lament, that he is become "as a stranger in the land;" 
    Jeremiah 14:8. Ordinances are the trysting-places where he is to be met 
    with; and when he is so little found there, it is time to lament his 
    departure. We may say, as 2 Kings 2:14, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" 
    We have the chair of state; but where is the King himself? Here is the 
    napkin and linen clothes lying, but where is the Lord that was enrapt in 
    them?</p>
<p align="justify">2. That we have sinned away his presence; Isaiah 59:1, 2, 
    "Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have 
    hidden his face from you, that he will not hear." When the glory departed to 
    the threshold, Ezekiel 10:4, from the threshold, verse 18, from the midst of 
    the city to the mountain, chapter 11:23, it was for the abominations done in 
    the house; chapter 8. Why does he loath our sacrifices, refuse to smell in 
    our assemblies, but because we have made ourselves and them vile before him? 
    Isaiah 1:11–17. Had we entertained the blowings of his Spirit when we had 
    them, he had not left us in such a dead calm.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the Lord has a controversy with us, that we are 
    not yet convinced of, and humbled for; Hosea 5:15. People may be long under 
    the Lord's withdrawings, so far insensible of the causes thereof, as not to 
    be lamenting over them; 1 Samuel 7:2. Now there is no convincing us of the 
    causes of God's controversy. But if ever the Lord return to ordinances as 
    heretofore, you will see there will be a convincing and humbling influence, 
    that will bring ministers and people to their knees, taking shame to 
    themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">4. That wrath and heavy judgments are abiding us, come 
    from what they will; Matthew 3:10. It is not to be thought, that the 
    contempt of the gospel, and unfruitfulness under it, will be passed without 
    some special mark of the divine indignation. When the invitations to the 
    gospel feast prevail not, the King's armies are sent forth to destroy; 
    Matthew 22:7. When the white flag of peace is contemned, the red flag of war 
    is hung out.</p>
<p align="justify">5. That these judgments will be very sore when they come, 
    according to the measure of light sinned against. Capernaum exalted to 
    Heaven, is thrust down to Hell; Matthew 11:23. After the white horse, the 
    red and black follow; Revelation 6. Never did a generation enjoy such a 
    clear light of the gospel as the Jews in the time of our Savior and the 
    apostles, and accordingly wrath came to an extremity, to the uttermost; 1 
    Thessalonians 2:16.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, That it is high time to be lamenting after the 
    Lord, and wrestling and supplicating for his return to ordinances. Stir up 
    yourselves therefore unto this, that it be not said as Isaiah 64:7, "There 
    is none that calls upon your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of 
    you." Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a sad sign to be unconcerned about it. It 
    speaks,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Such a one to be a stranger to the experience of the 
    power of the word, and the precious enjoyment of communion with God in 
    ordinances; Psalm 63:1, 2.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To be too easily satisfied in the matters of God 
    with the husks, the shadows, instead of the foyson and substance.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) To be unacquainted with Christ, and none of his; 
    since the withdrawing of his presence is not heavy to him.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) That they could even be content Christ would never 
    come again; for they that relish not his coming in ordinances, can never 
    relish his second coming.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Great would be the advantage of his return to 
    ordinances.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It would be well for particular hearers of the 
    gospel who should share in it themselves. Strangers would be converted, and 
    converts strengthened. Duties would be a delight. Whereas a form of 
    godliness is all that can be reached otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It would be well for the church in general; it would 
    cure our divisions; all being by that means brought to acknowledge their 
    offences, and return to the Lord, and so to one another in him.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. The gospel is a report from Heaven to be 
    believed and trusted to for salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine, I shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The gospel as it is a report.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Faith as it is a trusting to this report.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The report of the gospel, and the trusting to it, 
    conjunctly.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall consider the gospel as it is a report. And 
    here we shall view it,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In the nature of a report in general.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, In the nature of a report to be trusted to, for 
    some valuable end.</p>
<p align="justify">First, We shall view the gospel in the nature of a report 
    in general. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is the subject of a report, or the thing that is 
    reported, namely, some design, action, or event, true or false. The subject 
    of the gospel-report is, a love-design in God for the salvation of sinners 
    of mankind, 2 Timothy 1:9, 10. Such was the gospel-report that was first 
    made in the world, Genesis 3:15. It is the report of an act of grace and 
    kindness in God, in favor of them, whereby he has given them his Son for a 
    Savior, John 3:16, Isaiah 9:6, and eternal life in him, 1 John 5:11. The 
    report of the event of Christ's dying for sinners, and a crucified Christ's 
    being ready for marriage with sinners; Matthew 22:4. A subject of the utmost 
    importance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is the place whence the report originally comes. 
    And the place here is Heaven, the bosom of the Father. Hence the gospel is 
    called heavenly things; John 3:12, revealed from the bosom of the Father. 
    The original place of a report is the place of the transaction, and that at 
    some distance from where it is reported. So,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The gospel is a report from Heaven, where the design 
    of love was contrived, the gift of the Son was made, and from whence he came 
    to die for sinners, and where he is ready to match with them. The gospel may 
    come from one place of the earth to another, as it did from Jerusalem to 
    other places of the world; Isaiah 2:3; Luke 24:47. But it came from Heaven 
    originally, Luke 2:13, 14.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The gospel is good news from a far country, and so 
    should be as acceptable as cold water to the thirsty; Proverbs 25:25. The 
    farther off a country is from whence a report comes, we think ourselves the 
    less concerned in it; and so do carnal men treat the gospel-report. Far 
    indeed it is; but as far as it is, we must spend our eternity in it, or else 
    in Hell; and therefore it does most nearly concern us.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The matter of a report is something unseen to them to 
    whom the report is made. And so is the matter of the gospel-report. It is an 
    unseen God, John 1:18; an unseen Savior, 1 Peter 1:8; and unseen things, 2 
    Corinthians 4:18, that are preached unto you by the gospel. So the gospel is 
    an object of faith, not of sight; Hebrews 11:1. We receive it by hearing, 
    not by seeing; Isaiah 55:3. It is not what we credit on our eye-sight, but 
    upon the testimony of another, namely, of God. Hence the carnal world are 
    fond on seen objects; Psalm 4:6. but slow to believe the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is a reporter or reporters. And in this case the 
    report is made by many. But,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The first-hand reporter is an eye-witness, namely, 
    Jesus Christ. Christ himself was the raiser of the report of the gospel; 
    Hebrews 2:3. And who else could have been so? John 1:18. What he reported he 
    saw, and gives as his testimony of the truth of it on his eyesight; John 
    3:11. Hence he is proposed to us as the faithful and true witness; 
    Revelation 3:14. who was from eternity privy to the whole design revealed to 
    us in the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The prophets and apostles, and ministers of the 
    gospel. They are the second-hand reporters. The former had it immediately 
    from Christ, the latter from them again. But none of them were 
    eye-witnesses, but ear-witnesses properly speaking. For even the apostles 
    who saw Christ with their eyes, yet owed their knowledge of the gospel to 
    their faith originally, though they were confirmed by what they saw; John 
    1:14. So it is determined; Psalm 68:11, "The Lord gave the word; great was 
    the company of those that published it."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, There is a manifestation of the thing by the 
    report, to the parties to whom the report is made. So is the grace of God to 
    poor sinners, manifested to them by the gospel; 2 Timothy 1:9, 10. It is no 
    more kept a secret from them, but they are let into the knowledge of the 
    design, action, and events, which concern their salvation. The gospel opens 
    up and reveals the secret of God's grace to sinners, with the method of 
    communicating it, even the whole plan of salvation, which from eternity was 
    hidden in the breast of God, John 1:18. Let us view the gospel,</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, In the nature of a report to be trusted to, for 
    some valuable end. And so it is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A true and faithful report, that one may safely trust; 
    1 Timothy 1:15, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, 
    that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." It was originally 
    brought from Heaven by Jesus Christ; Hebrews 2:3. the faithful and true 
    witness; Revelation 3:14. Many false reports are going in the world; and 
    those that are brought from afar, we are not in capacity to contradict; but 
    the truth of the gospel has been confirmed by the greatest evidence, 
    particularly by the death of Christ, and by the experience of the believers 
    of it in all ages.</p>
<p align="justify">2. An infallible report. A report may be true where there 
    is no infallibility; but the report of the gospel is an infallible truth, 
    Acts 1:3, for it is the Word of God that cannot lie; 1 Thessalonians 2:13. 
    Though men bring it to you, God has put it in their mouths from his written 
    word; and the speaker is Christ himself, they are but the voice. And the 
    Spirit of the Lord demonstrates it to believers, as divine truth; 1 
    Corinthians 2:4.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A good and comfortable report. It is not only good in 
    itself, as the report of the law's curse is; but it is good for us. Hence it 
    is called good or glad tidings, Luke 2:10. As the contrivance of salvation 
    is stated in the gospel, it is adapted in all points to our case. And the 
    convinced sinner, helped to believe, sees it so; that it is a good report of 
    God, bringing the contrivance every way good for him.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, A weighty report, even of the greatest 
    weight, as concerning man's greatest possible interest, Isaiah 61:1. It 
    concerns a man's eternal interest, how he may be saved from the wrath of 
    God, and made happy for evermore.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall consider faith as it is a trusting to this 
    report, the report of the gospel. And so it is not only divine faith, but 
    saving justifying faith, Romans 10:8, 9. It may be taken up in these two. 
    Faith is,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, A trusting of the gospel-report as true. It is a 
    believing of the doctrine of the gospel; Acts 8:37. Faith is the soul's echo 
    to the joyful sound. That Christ came to save sinners is true, says the 
    gospel; true, says faith. Hence the gospel is called a hearing in our text, 
    and the hearing of faith; Galatians 3:2. The voice from without entering the 
    ear, is conceived and sounds there; the voice of the gospel entering the 
    heart, is conceived and sounds like an echo, from the heart; and that is 
    faith; Romans 10:9. When a word is heard that one does not believe, there is 
    as it were a repelling it from within; and it is all one to the purpose of 
    the speaker, as if it were not heard at all. So unbelief repels the 
    gospel-testimony, receives it not as true; 1 John 5:10. But faith receives 
    it as true; and the speaker so far gains his design. And faith trusts it as 
    true,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the general, with respect to the multitude whom it 
    concerns; 1 Timothy 1:15, "It is a faithful saying, Christ came to save 
    sinners." Here is the gospel; here is faith's assent to it as true with 
    respect to sinners in general. It is the report of a common good, the common 
    salvation for sinners of mankind. The great body of mankind looks on it as 
    idle tales; but faith receives it as a true report; and admires the love of 
    God to fallen man, and not to fallen angels.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In particular, with respect to one's self; 1 Timothy 
    1:15, "This is a faithful saying, that Christ came to save sinners; of whom 
    I am the chief." Here is the application of faith, without which the report 
    of the gospel is not trusted as true; He came to save me. Faith believes 
    there is a fullness in Christ for poor sinners, and for one's self in 
    particular; that Christ and all his salvation is in earnest offered to 
    sinners, and to one's self in particular; that he is the Savior of the 
    world, and their Savior in particular, John 4:42, "We know that this is 
    indeed the Christ, the Savior of the; world." Chap 20:28, "Thomas said unto 
    him, My Lord and my God." This is evident, if you consider, that the gospel 
    comprehends you, and every one of you; John 3:16, "God so loved the world, 
    that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should not 
    perish, but have everlasting life." Proverbs 8:4, "Unto you, O men, I call, 
    and my voice is to the sons of man." If then you do not believe it with 
    respect to yourself, if you should believe it with respect to all the world 
    besides, you disbelieve it; you deny credit to it, in that which is the main 
    point for your salvation; 1 John 5:10, 11. You believe in that case no more 
    than devils do; Mark 1:24. Nay, you do not believe so much as the devils do; 
    for they cannot help believing your interest in the gospel, as well as the 
    interest of others: and therefore are at so much pains to keep you from 
    believing it, lest you be saved; if you had no interest in it, they would 
    tell you so much for your torment.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECT. But where is it written in the gospel, that 
    Christ came to save me, or that he is my Savior? I am sure my name is not in 
    it. I may believe the gospel then, though I do not believe it to hold with 
    respect to myself.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Where is it written in the law, that Adam ruined 
    you? I am sure your name is neither in the commands of the law, nor in the 
    curse of it either. But do you think you could indeed believe the law, 
    without believing its commands and curse reaching you? No; if you believe 
    not that, you contradict the express terms of the law; Galatians 3:10, "For 
    as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse; for it is 
    written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are 
    written in the book of the law to do them." O, but say you, I am 
    comprehended in the curse as a breaker of the law; true, but are you not as 
    much comprehended in the gospel as a son of Adam? Proverbs 8:4; is not the 
    promise of the gospel in as extensive terms (John 3:16,) as the curse of the 
    law?</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, let none deceive themselves, thinking they 
    believe the gospel, while they believe it not with particular application to 
    themselves. True faith trusts the gospel as true, with respect to one's 
    self; and so trusts it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. As certain truth. It does not receive the 
    gospel-report only as a thing that is probable, and likely to be true. That 
    is opinion and conjecture, not faith. Faith embraces the gospel as certain 
    truth, as a thing one is sure there is no falsehood in; John 6:69, "We 
    believe, and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God." 
    Paul was so much persuaded of the truth of the gospel, that he could declare 
    an angel accursed that should contradict it; Galatians 1:8, 9.</p>
<p align="justify">2. As infallible truth, as a thing there can be no 
    falsehood in. The reason of which is, That faith trusts the gospel as the 
    testimony of God himself that cannot lie, 1 Thessalonians 2:13. It receives 
    the joyful sound as the voice of God, John 3:33. To believe the gospel 
    because good ministers and good books say so, or because it appears 
    agreeable to our reason, is not faith, but opinion. Faith believes it, 
    because God says so. The tidings of the gospel are beyond our sight, and 
    above our reason, as the mystery of an incarnate God, an imputed 
    righteousness, etc. But because we see the divine testimony for these 
    things, therefore we believe them by true faith, just on the credit of God's 
    word, Mark 16:15. Hence it appears,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That there is an assurance in the nature of faith, 
    whereby the believing person is sure of the truth of the doctrine of the 
    gospel, and that with respect to himself particularly; 1 Thessalonians 1:2, 
    "For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in 
    the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance." So that whatever were his doubts of 
    it, and carnal reasonings against it, he is brought at length to assent 
    thereto as most firm truth.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That there is a necessity of an inward illumination by 
    the Spirit, in order to the faith of the gospel, 1 Corinthians 2:14, 10, 
    "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are 
    foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually 
    discerned. But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit." The Spirit of 
    the Lord opens the eyes, and demonstrates the truth of the gospel to the 
    soul; verse 4, "My speech and my preaching, was—in demonstration of the 
    Spirit, and of power;" otherwise there is no reaching the divine faith of 
    it; verse 5, "That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in 
    the power of God." This casts down the man's carnal reasonings against it, 
    and awes him and overcomes him into a belief of the truth; 2 Corinthians 
    10:4, 5.</p>
<p align="justify">Question Is there no doubting then consistent with the 
    faith of the report of the gospel? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. All doubting is contrary to faith; Matthew 21:21. 
    But since faith is not perfect more than other graces, it may have a mixture 
    of its contrary; chapter 14:31, "O you of little faith, wherefore did you 
    doubt?" Howbeit, the more doubting, the less faith; and the more faith, the 
    less doubting. As long as doubting is predominant in the soul to be brought 
    to Christ, there is no faith. But the Spirit of the Lord lays in a weight of 
    light, and the balance is cast on the side of the truth of the gospel, and 
    the doubting is outweighed, and faith springs up in the soul. The soul is 
    assured of the truth of the gospel, appearing in his venturing himself for 
    eternity upon it, in the sight of a holy, just God; though perhaps he is not 
    without all doubting; as there may be a moving of the heavier scale by the 
    lighter weight.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, There is in faith a trusting to the gospel-report 
    as good. Faith does not only trust the gospel, but trusts to it, trusts much 
    to it, lays stress on it, not only as a true, but also as a good thing. 
    Faith,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Looks on the gospel as a good thing in itself, and 
    desirable. For it is done with the heart; Romans 10:10. Look how a Savior, a 
    righteousness, and a pardon, must needs be good things in the eyes of 
    sinners seeing themselves lost; so the gospel that brings these to sinners, 
    must needs appear good. As the belief of the report of the law, imports not 
    only an assent to it as true, but a horror of it as evil; so the belief of 
    the report of the gospel imports not only an assent thereto as true, but a 
    relish thereof as good. So it is held out to faith under the notion of good; 
    Isaiah 55:2, "Hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that which is good, 
    and let your soul delight itself in fatness."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Faith looks on the gospel as good for one's self in 
    particular. The believing soul says, This is good news, and good for me; 1 
    Timothy 1:15, "Worthy of all acceptance." When there is a report of a 
    physician come to a country that infallibly cures such and such a disease, 
    the whole people say, That is good; but the sick of these diseases say more, 
    That is good for me. What makes one think a thing good for him, is the 
    suitableness of it to his mind and case. Many hearers of the Gospel may 
    account the Gospel good in itself, but they do not look on it as good for 
    them, at least as yet: as one who may account some kind of meat good, but he 
    is not for it. He has better before him, more agreeable to his stomach; or 
    perhaps he has no stomach for the time, so it must be set up. Thus Christ is 
    good, and his salvation; but the man has the world and his lusts to feed on, 
    that are more agreeable to him; let them stay off until death, and then he 
    will be for them. But the Gospel is to the believer not only good in itself, 
    but good for him, and that just now.</p>
<p align="justify">And so he trusts to it as good for him. And if you ask, 
    what it is that he trusts to it? Why, he trusts his salvation to it, in a 
    word; for that is it the gospel brings to sinners, Titus 2:11. marg. "The 
    grace of God that brings salvation to all men, has appeared." And the trust 
    of faith relates to it; Ephesians 1:12, 13, "That we should be to the praise 
    of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. In whom you also trusted, after 
    that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation." The soul 
    sees itself lost; the gospel offers salvation. And faith thereupon trusts 
    for it, Acts 16:31. Even for Christ's whole salvation. Which may be taken up 
    in these two.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The relative part of it; which comprehends the soul's 
    justification, reconciliation, adoption, and all other benefits of the like 
    kind. These the gospel offers, together with the righteousness of Christ, 
    upon which they are founded; and faith trusts to it for all these; Romans 
    1:17, "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to 
    faith."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The real part of it; which comprehends the soul's 
    sanctification and glorification, and all other benefits of that kind. These 
    also the gospel offers, together with the Spirit of Christ, by whom they are 
    to be wrought in sinners; and faith trusts to it for all these, Galatians 
    3:2.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus faith lays the greatest of weight on the report of 
    the gospel, even the weight of the man's salvation for time and eternity; 
    dealing with God for that his greatest interest, in the way of trust on his 
    word of the gospel; trusting to that report for his own salvation in 
    particular; Acts 15:11, "But we believe, that, through the grace of the Lord 
    Jesus Christ, we shall be saved."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, as faith is a trusting to the report of the gospel 
    for one's own salvation, according as salvation is offered in the gospel, it 
    implies these following things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Not only a willingness, but a sincere desire to be 
    sanctified, and delivered from sin, as well as to be justified, and 
    delivered from wrath; to be delivered from the reigning power, practice, 
    pollution, and indwelling of sin, as well as from the guilt of it; Romans 
    7:24, 25, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of 
    this death! I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord." A person may fear 
    from one what he does not desire; but what he desires not, he cannot trust 
    in one for. Therefore where there is no such desire, there is no trusting to 
    the gospel, there is no faith.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A renouncing of all other confidence for his 
    salvation. Faith trusting to the report of the gospel, quits 
    self-confidence, law-confidence, and creature-confidence; Jeremiah 16:19, "O 
    Lord, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, 
    the Gentiles shall come unto you from the ends of the earth, and shall say, 
    Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is 
    no profit." Philippians 3:3, "We are the circumcision, which have no 
    confidence in the flesh?" like the woman with the bloody issue, who quit all 
    her physicians, trusting for healing to a touch of the hem of Christ's 
    garment.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A hearty approbation of the way of salvation 
    manifested in the report of the gospel; Matthew 11:6," Blessed is he whoever 
    shall not he offended in me." Faith here views Christ in the glass of the 
    gospel as a crucified Savior; 1 Corinthians 2:2; believes his sufficiency as 
    such to save sinners, and them in particular, from sin, and from the wrath 
    of a holy God, in the eye of the holy law, and to make them completely holy 
    and happy; Philippians 3:9; and acquiesces in that way for their own 
    salvation; 1 Corinthians 1:24.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A betaking one's self entirely to that way of 
    salvation, by trusting to it wholly for our own salvation; Ruth 2:12. Even 
    as a poor beggar, having riches and wealth made over to him by his friend, 
    leaves off his begging, and betakes himself to that entirely for his 
    bearing. This is the soul's coming to Christ, fleeing for refuge, receiving 
    the atonement, and rolling its burden on him.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, A confidence and trust that he will save us 
    from sin and wrath, according to his promise; Acts 15:11, "We believe, that 
    through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved." This is that 
    trust which shall never be disappointed; Romans 10:11, that building on 
    Christ which shall never fall; 1 Peter 2:6.</p>
<p align="justify">III. We shall consider the report of the gospel, and the 
    trusting to it conjunctly.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The gospel is a report from Heaven, of salvation for 
    poof sinners, from sin; Matthew, 1:21; and from the wrath of God; John 3:16, 
    however dear bought, yet freely made over to you in the word of promise; so 
    as that you may freely take possession of it; Isaiah 55:1.</p>
<p align="justify">This report being brought to the sinner, faith trusts it 
    as a true report, believing that God has said it; and trusts to it as good, 
    laying our own salvation upon it. So the soul greedily embraces the Savior, 
    and the salvation brought to it in that report, as ever a drowning man would 
    take hold of a rope let down to bring him out of the waters; Canticles 1:3.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The gospel is the report of a crucified Christ made 
    over to sinners, as the device of Heaven for their salvation. It is 
    proclaimed by the authority of Heaven that Christ has died, and by his death 
    purchased life and salvation for lost children of Adam; and that they and 
    every one of them may have full and free access to him; Matthew 22:4.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith trusting this report as good and true, the soul 
    concludes, The Savior is mine; and leans on him for all the purchase of his 
    death, for life and salvation to itself in particular; 1 Corinthians 2:2.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The gospel is the report of a righteousness wherein we 
    guilty ones may stand before a holy God; Romans 1:17, "For therein is the 
    righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith." And by faith one 
    believes there is such a righteousness, that it is sufficient to cover him, 
    and that is held out to him to be trusted on for righteousness; and so the 
    believer trusts it as his righteousness in the sight of God, disclaiming all 
    other, and betaking himself to it alone; Galatians 2:16.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The gospel is the report of a pardon under the great 
    seal of Heaven, in Christ, to all who will take it in him; Acts 13:38, 39, 
    "Be it known unto you that through this man is preached unto you the 
    forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from all 
    things." This pardon is proclaimed openly by the authority of Heaven, full 
    and free, without exception of any of lost Adam's race, to whom the report 
    comes.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul by faith believes this to be true, and applies 
    it to itself, saying, This pardon is for me; it is good and suitable to my 
    case; I will therefore lean to this word of grace for my pardon, and come 
    in, for this is the Word of God that cannot lie.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The gospel is the report of a Physician that cures 
    infallibly all the diseases of the soul; Matthew 9:12, 13; Hebrews 7:26, and 
    freely; Hosea 14:4; and rejects no patients; John 6:37.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul believes it, and applies it to its own case; and 
    says, Then I will trust him for the removing the stony heart out of my 
    flesh, for curing me of the falling evil of backsliding, the fever of raging 
    corruption, the running issue of the predominant lust, and the universal 
    leprosy of the corruption of my nature.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The gospel is the report of a feast for hungry souls, 
    Isaiah 25:6, to which all are bid welcome, Christ himself being the maker 
    and matter of it too; Isaiah 55:2.</p>
<p align="justify">The soul, weary of the husks of created things, and 
    believing this report, accordingly falls a-feeding on Christ, his flesh 
    which is meat indeed, and his blood which is drink indeed; believing and 
    applying to itself all that Christ was, did, and suffered, as that whereof 
    the soul shall reap the benefit; which is the feeding by faith on a slain 
    Savior.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The gospel is the report of a treasure; 2 Corinthians 
    4:7. In it are the precious promises, within them precious Christ, with his 
    merit, like the gold mentioned; Revelation 3:18, "I counsel you to buy of me 
    gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich." The field it is hidden in, 
    may be yours; Matthew 13:44; the gospel offers you the covenant as that 
    field.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith believes the report; and the soul lays hold on the 
    covenant, and trusts entirely to the treasure hidden there for the payment 
    of all its debt, for its through bearing during life, and through death, and 
    for procuring it eternal happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The gospel is the report of a victory won by Jesus 
    Christ over sin, Satan, and death, and the world; Psalm 98:1, and that in 
    favor of all that will join the glorious Conqueror.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith believes this report; and the soul trusts to it for 
    its victory over all these, as already foiled enemies; 1 John 5:4. To name 
    no more,</p>
<p align="justify">9. Lastly, The gospel is the report of a peace purchased 
    by the blood of Christ for poor sinners; Ephesians 2:14, and offered to 
    them; Isaiah 27:5.</p>
<p align="justify">Faith believes it; and trusting to it, the soul comes 
    before God as a reconciled Father in Christ, brings in its supplications for 
    supply before the throne, believing the communication to be opened between 
    Heaven and them, which during the war was blocked up.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. Of information. This shows, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The gospel is the mean of divine appointment for the 
    salvation of sinners. Therefore it is called "the gospel of our salvation," 
    Ephesians 1:13, and to "bring salvation," Titus 2:11. The light of nature is 
    not the external mean or instrument of salvation; for it brings no report of 
    Christ; Acts 4:12. The law is not it neither; it is the "ministration of 
    death and condemnation;" 2 Corinthians 3:7, 9; but the gospel only; for it 
    is in the gospel only that a righteousness is revealed for the unrighteous; 
    Romans 1:16, 17, and in which the Spirit is conveyed to dead sinners; 
    Galatians 3:2. To slight the gospel, then, is to slight the only mean of 
    salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The gospel, however, will not be of any saving effect 
    to us without faith; Hebrews 4:2, "The word preached did not profit them, 
    not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." The gospel is the net; 
    but the soul is not caught, to be drawn out of the waters of wrath, until it 
    believe; 1 Corinthians 1:21, "It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching 
    to save them that believe." If the gospel be hidden to us, it is an evidence 
    we are yet lost; and it remains hidden to all unbelievers, who see not the 
    truth, goodness, nor glory of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The gospel-method of salvation takes away all ground 
    of glorying in the least, from the sinner; for it is by the faith of the 
    gospel; Romans 4:16, "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace." 
    The way how a sinner is to be brought into a state of salvation, is not by 
    doing of a law, or any work of a law; but by believing or trusting to a 
    report. Faith is a believing or trusting, which of all things is the 
    farthest removed from the nature of a work; and it is an injury done to the 
    free grace of God, to look upon it as a work, or to explain it so, as hardly 
    to leave any believing or trusting in it.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. Let the gospel gain trust with 
    you, as ever you would be saved from sin and wrath. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Trust the gospel as true, as universally true, and 
    that certainly and infallibly, as from God himself.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider the manner of its discovery, clearly 
    appearing to be from God, being delivered by Jesus Christ and his apostles. 
    It is a doctrine confirmed by the life and death of Christ, and particularly 
    by his resurrection from the dead; by the miracles wrought by him and his 
    apostles; John 3:2.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. Consider the manner of its propagation in the 
    world. It overturned Judaism and Paganism, the only two religions in the 
    world when it entered; and that neither by the subtlety of men and human 
    learning, nor by the force of arms; but by the means of a few fishermen, 
    declaring it in its simplicity; against whom the learning of the schools, 
    and the power of the magistrate and sword, were engaged.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. Lastly, Consider its effects on men, subduing 
    their lusts, rendering them holy as God is holy; causing them to embrace it, 
    over the belly of their worldly interest, and in spite of all hazards set 
    before them by its enemies; and carrying them up comfortably in the midst of 
    the most cruel death.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Trust to it, and lay the stress of your salvation 
    on it as good. For which cause consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It discovers a righteousness in which a sinner may 
    stand before a holy God; Romans 1:17. The law requires righteousness, a 
    perfect righteousness, under the pain of the curse, Galatians 3:10, but it 
    affords none, nor any strength whereby it may be wrought; but the gospel 
    tells us of a righteousness already wrought, and offers it to the sinner; 
    Romans 8:3, 4, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through 
    the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for 
    sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be 
    fulfilled in us." And in it there is what, in the eye of the law, will 
    justify the sinner before God, and give perfect peace in one's own 
    conscience; Romans 5:1, "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, 
    through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It sets before us the most glorious life of most 
    perfect happiness, in the clearest and surest way; 2 Timothy 1:10. The 
    brightest scheme of happiness and the most illuminated map of Immanuel's 
    land, is therein laid before us; fit to draw men's hearts to it, over the 
    belly of all opposition. The researches of happiness made by moralists were 
    as midnight darkness; the discoveries of it in the Mosaic dispensation were 
    but as the twilight; but in the gospel as the mid-day.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, It is the only channel of salvation, in which 
    salvation is conveyed to lost sinners; Acts 4:12," Neither is there 
    salvation in any other; for there is none other name under Heaven given 
    among men, whereby we must be saved." And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the channel of salvation, to which whoever do 
    betake themselves by faith, shall undoubtedly be saved; Romans 1:16, "The 
    gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes." There 
    they shall find quickening, sanctifying, and saving influences; as by a mean 
    appointed of God for that very end.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is no other channel of salvation, no not the law 
    as contradistinguished thereto; 2 Corinthians 3. It was the channel of life 
    to innocent man once; but to a sinner never. When sin entered, it quite 
    dried up as to all streams of life; Galatians 2:16," By the works of the law 
    shall no flesh be justified." In a sinking state of the church, the law and 
    gospel are confounded, and the law jostles out the gospel, the dark shades 
    of morality take place of gospel light; which plague is this day begun in 
    this church, and well far advanced. Men think they see the fitness of legal 
    preaching for sanctification; but how the preaching of the gospel should be 
    such a mean, they cannot understand, through want of experience of the power 
    of the gospel on their own souls. But,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The gospel, and not the law, has the word of divine 
    appointment for that end; Ephesians 1:13, "In whom you also trusted, after 
    that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also 
    after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise." 
    It is the word of salvation, Acts 13:26; the word of grace, chapter 20:32; 
    and the word of life, Philippians 2:16. But the law, as contradistinguished 
    to it, is under no such appointment; but is the ministration of condemnation 
    and death, 2 Corinthians 3:7, 9. Abana and Pharpar seemed as fit in the eyes 
    of carnal men to cure a leper as Jordan; but Jordan had the word of divine 
    appointment. And without such an appointment nothing can avail.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The gospel and not the law as contradistinguished 
    thereto has the blessing annexed to it. There, and only there, is the power 
    of God to salvation to be expected; Romans 1:16. It alone is the 
    ministration of the Spirit; 2 Corinthians 3:8. So the apostle could appeal 
    to the experience of the Galatians; Galatians 3:2, "This only," says he, 
    "would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or 
    by the hearing of faith?" Now, that can never be the channel of salvation 
    from which the Spirit is separated.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore know, that your life lies here, and that there 
    is no salvation but in the way of trusting to the report of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. Though many hear, yet few believe or trust 
    to the report of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this Doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Confirm this point, That though many hear, yet few 
    believe or trust to the report of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Give the reasons why so few believe the report of the 
    gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall confirm this point, That though many hear, yet 
    few believe or trust to the report of the gospel. It is clear, if you 
    consider and view these two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, A view of the church in all ages, and the 
    entertainment the gospel has met with among them to whom it came.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, A view of the church setting aside those whom the 
    scripture determines to be unbelievers.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Let us take a view of the church in all ages, and 
    the entertainment the gospel has met with among those to whom it came. It 
    has been a despised and disbelieved gospel generally in all ages, and under 
    all dispensations. Few believed it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Under the patriarchal dispensation, from Adam to 
    Moses. It was first preached in paradise to Adam and Eve, being comprehended 
    in the promise of Christ to come. By them indeed it was believed, and Adam 
    preached it; but Cain slew Abel, and headed an apostasy. And in the days of 
    Enosh, the son of Seth, there was a professed distinction made between 
    professors and others; Genesis 4:26, "Then began men to call upon the name 
    of the Lord." Noah, a preacher of righteousness, his doctrine was so little 
    believed, that that generation was swept away with the flood. An unbelieving 
    Ham was in the ark; and Nimrod shortly after headed a generation of 
    unbelieving apostates, that built the tower of Babel. Abram was called alone 
    from his country, where his father served other gods. And his posterity in 
    Egypt had little knowledge of either law or gospel left them; Romans 5:13, 
    "For until the law sin was in the world."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Under the Mosaic dispensation, they had the gospel, 
    though veiled with types and figures. But the body of the generation that 
    came out of Egypt, believed not, but fell in the wilderness; Hebrews 4:2. 
    How often did the body of that nation fall off into idolatry? What heavy 
    complaints did their prophets make time after time of the unbelief 
    prevailing in their generations?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Under the Christian dispensation. The word out of 
    Christ's own mouth was generally disbelieved; John 12:37, 38, "But though he 
    had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him; that 
    the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "Lord, 
    who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been 
    revealed?" The gospel never had so great success as in the apostles' days; 
    yet even but few believed it in comparison of others in the world; Romans 
    10:16, "But they have not all obeyed the gospel." The state of the church 
    for the times thereafter may be seen, Revelation 4 in the first six seals. 
    Then in the time of Antichrist, the world wondered after the beast, the 
    witnesses were reduced to two; and the churches of believers driven to the 
    wilderness. At the reformation the gospel had remarkable success; but yet 
    believers were but few comparatively; and there have been but few all along 
    since that time.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Let us take a view of the church, setting aside 
    those whom the scripture determines to be unbelievers; and we will soon see 
    that but few do remain. Set aside,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The grossly ignorant of Christ, and of the truths of 
    the gospel. These God himself casts out of the number; Isaiah 27:11, "It is 
    a people of no understanding; therefore he who made them, will not have 
    mercy on them; and he who formed them will show them no favor." There may be 
    a believing in an unseen, but not an unknown Christ. How can they believe 
    the gospel, that know not what it is?</p>
<p align="justify">2. The profane, who are Christians in name, because they 
    live in a Christian country; but have not a shape of a Christianity about 
    them. Surely these do not believe the gospel; Titus 1:16, "They profess that 
    they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and 
    disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate." Sanctification and belief 
    of the truth go together, 2 Thessalonians 2:13. The gospel is the great mean 
    of God's appointment for reforming the world; if then it prevail not to the 
    reforming of men's lives, it is an evidence they believe it not, Hebrews 
    4:2.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The carnal and worldly, who make the world their chief 
    good, mainly seeking that, and favoring it only. These undoubtedly are 
    unbelievers; Philippians 3:19, 20, "Whose end is destruction, whose God is 
    their belly; and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things." No 
    sooner does a man believe the report of the gospel anent the unseen world, 
    but the present evil world sinks in its value with him, Matthew 13:44, "The 
    kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hidden in a field; the which when a 
    man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, 
    and buys that field." But to the most part the matters of faith are as the 
    bird in the bush; what they see with their eyes is the bird in hand; Psalm 
    4:6, "There be many that say, Who will show us any good?"</p>
<p align="justify">4. Mere moralists, all whose religion is confined to some 
    pieces of the second table. These are they who are just in their dealings 
    with men, but know nothing of dealing with God through Christ, and make no 
    conscience of the duties of worshiping God. They come but the one half of 
    that Pharisee's length, mentioned Luke 18; and to be sure are unbelievers, 
    for Christ sets them aside; Matthew 5:20, "For I say unto you, that except 
    your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and 
    Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Gross hypocrites, who have a profession of religion, 
    and worship God, but in the meantime are loose and licentious in their walk. 
    These are they who on their knees are like saints, but have no more religion 
    than what lies in these external duties of worship. Them Christ sets aside 
    as unbelievers; Matthew 7:21, "Not every one that says unto me, "Lord, Lord, 
    shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven;" and will disown any saving relation 
    to them; Luke 6:46, "Why call you me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which 
    I say?" That gospel that cleanses not a man's hands from unjust dealing; his 
    mouth from lying, swearing, and filthy speaking; and his conversation from 
    the pollutions of the world is certainly not believed.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Close hypocrites, whose outward conversation is 
    blameless in the eye of the world, but in the meantime are inwardly 
    strangers to God and Christ. Such were those in the church of Sardis, of 
    whom our Lord says, Revelation 3:1, "I know your works, that you have a name 
    that you live, and are dead." They are not unacquainted with the practice of 
    outward duties both towards God and man; but they are absolute strangers to 
    the life of faith, communion with God, and experimental religion. They are 
    walking on in the dark, and dreaming they are in the way; yet have never one 
    foot on it These are unbelievers, for faith purifies the heart; Acts 15:9. 
    They are self-justiciaries, like the Jews of old, "who being ignorant of 
    God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, 
    did not submit themselves unto the righteousness of God;" Romans 10:3.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, All unregenerate persons; for they are 
    certainly unbelievers, as believers are regenerate; as clear from John 1:12, 
    13, "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons 
    of God, even to them that believe on his name; which were born not of blood, 
    nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." And such 
    are all those who have never been convinced of their sin and misery; nor 
    humbled, and brought to be content with a Savior on any terms; who have 
    never had Christ revealed in them; nor been savingly determined and enabled 
    to embrace him.</p>
<p align="justify">Now they of these several sorts make the throng of the 
    multitude of the hearers of the gospel. And it is but here and there one 
    that is not of one or other of them. Set aside, then, all these, few remain, 
    few believers, few who trust to the gospel-report.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall give the reasons why so few believe the 
    report of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a natural impotency in all; John 6:44," No 
    man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me, draw him." This is 
    cured in few; to few is the "arm of the Lord revealed." Believing the report 
    of the gospel, is not, as some think, an easy report of imagination. It is 
    beyond the power of nature. Yes, everything in nature is against it, and 
    rises up against it, until the Spirit of the Lord overcome them into belief 
    of the report of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The predominant power of lusts, to which the gospel is 
    an enemy. There our Lord lodges it; John 3:19, "This is the condemnation, 
    that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, 
    because their deeds were evil." The gospel is a light; but they love 
    darkness better; and therefore they will not receive the light by the belief 
    thereof. They are set upon present things, things of sense; and therefore 
    esteem the things of faith but as idle tales; John 5:44.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a judicial blindness on many. Men have 
    refused to believe the gospel, that they might get continued in the embraces 
    of their lusts, therefore God has given them over into the hand of Satan, 
    who has blinded them so, as they cannot behold the light and glory of the 
    gospel; 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information. Hence learn, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, There is great odds between hearing and doing; James 
    1:22. Many hear, but few obey; many are called, but few chosen. The gospel 
    comes to the ears of many, who receive the sound with an air of reverence, 
    but never receive it into their hearts by faith. Do not then lay stress on 
    your attendance on ordinances, as if that would render you acceptableto God; 
    Jeremiah 7:4," Trust you not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, 
    the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are these." Such a conceit 
    will be sadly exposed at the last day, as is clear from what our Lord says 
    will be the language of some at his awful tribunal, "We have eaten and drunk 
    in your presence, and you have taught in our streets." Unto all such he 
    would say, "Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity;" Luke 13:26, 27.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, This may remove the occasion of stumbling by these 
    three things. Do not stumble at it,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because the gospel has so few friends in an evil 
    day. The scripture has told us before, that few believe it at any time. It 
    is a greater wonder, that one adheres to it over the belly of persecution, 
    especially even to death, than that hundreds forsake it; considering how 
    rare the faith of it is even in a time of peace.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the foundations of Christianity come at length 
    to be attacked by men of corrupt minds. For what wonder is it, that, in a 
    time of long peaceable enjoyment of the gospel, they that never truly 
    believed it, come at length to question it, and in end downright to deny it?</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That the lives either of professors or ministers of 
    the gospel are altogether unsuitable to it. For men may profess and preach 
    the gospel too, that they never believed. Man's arm may fit men to possess 
    and preach it; but it is the arm of the Lord only that can bring men to 
    believe it.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECT. But is not that ground to question it, that so 
    few believe it? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. That is no just prejudice against it. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There are many natural truths, which yet are 
    believed by very few. I suppose the thousandth, not to say the ten 
    thousandth person in the world that sees the sun and moon, does not believe 
    the sun to be bigger than a cart-wheel, or any star to be so big as the 
    moon; and yet learned men demonstrate by reason, that the sun is bigger than 
    the whole earth by far, and the moon less than any star. But the gospel is 
    supernatural truth, which cannot be comprehended or received by mere reason; 
    1 Corinthians 2:14, "For the natural man receives not the things of the 
    Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, 
    because they are spiritually discerned." Therefore there is no ground to 
    question the gospel-report, because few believe it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The most part of men are wedded to their lusts and 
    passions, which the gospel is set for the rooting out of; Titus 2:11, 12, 
    "For the grace of God that brings salvation, has appeared to all men; 
    teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live 
    soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world." It is the interest 
    of their lusts that the gospel be not believed; and therefore the general 
    unbelief of the gospel is no prejudice against it; because men generally 
    have a strong bias against it, from the mighty power of their lusts; John 
    3:19, forfeited. But the belief of it is of equal latitude with a sincere 
    desire of enjoying God, and being like him; which is man's chief happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, The common way of the world is not God's way; and 
    they are rare persons that are right. This is evident from our Lord's 
    exhortation, Matthew 7:13, 14, "Enter in at the strait gate; for wide is the 
    gate, and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be 
    which go in thereat; because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, 
    which leads unto life, and few there be that find it." Many will be walled 
    out of the visible church, and thrown away as naught, until they be left but 
    as one of a city, and two of a family, as the gleanings of the vintage, that 
    are to be carried to Zion above.</p>
<p align="justify">They are men wondered at, Zechariah 3:8; therefore not 
    ordinary; God's jewels; Malachi 3:17; therefore not common staff; Christ's 
    little, little flock, Luke 12:32, (Greek.)</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, Lastly, Surely many deceive themselves as to their 
    faith of the gospel, thinking they believe the gospel while they really 
    believe it not; Hosea 8:2, 3, "Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know 
    you. Israel has cast off the thing that is good." The apostle observes; 2 
    Thessalonians 3:2, that "all men have not faith;" and our Lord shows it to 
    be very rare; Luke 18:8, "When the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on 
    the earth?" I suppose it will be found, that fow believe this very truth we 
    are insisting on. For as few as there are who believe the gospel, if the 
    question were put to each of us, Do you believe the gospel? Do you believe 
    it? I reckon few, if any, particularly of the unbelievers, but would say, 
    They do. The reasons of the mistake are these—</p>
<p align="justify">1. They were brought up in the profession of the gospel, 
    and they never questioned their belief of it. Many among us have no more for 
    their belief of the gospel, than Papists in Italy have for their belief of 
    Popery, and Pagans in America for their belief of Paganism. Their fathers, 
    and mothers, and priests told them so; and so they have a human faith of 
    Popery and Paganism, upon that human testimony. And so many a Scotsman has 
    no more but a human faith of the gospel, which they have taken up on the 
    word of their fathers, mothers, and ministers; and they never questioned it. 
    But the divine faith of the gospel is another thing, and that they will find 
    when they come to a pinch in that matter; Matthew 16:17, "And Jesus said 
    unto him, Blessed are you Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not 
    revealed it unto you, but my Father which is in Heaven." 1 Thessalonians 
    2:13, "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because when you 
    received the Word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the 
    word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually 
    works also in you that believe."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They never had much ado with their faith of the 
    gospel. Such as it is, it has lien by them idle all their days; like a book 
    by a scholar he never had occasion to consult; or a piece of money one never 
    offered in payment to his neighbor. Their faith of the gospel was never 
    tried with barefaced Satanical temptations, obstinately insisted in; nor 
    with their afflictions; nor with sound and thorough convictions of their 
    lost and miserable state; and all is good untried. But the trial would have 
    discovered another thing, James 1:12, that is true faith of the gospel that 
    will abide a trial, 1 Peter 1:6, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They satisfy themselves with a general historical 
    faith of the gospel, knowing nothing of trusting to it for all Christ's 
    salvation to themselves. And if that be the believing of the gospel report, 
    the devils are as good believers as they, and better too; James 2:19, for 
    the devils believe and tremble. They know not what it is to be, at the 
    instance of the law, set before the tribunal of God, in the court of 
    conscience, and to have the law there pressing them particularly with its 
    demands and curse; and for their own defense to be gladly to plead there as 
    for their life, the holiness of Christ's nature, the righteousness of his 
    life, and satisfaction for sin, and that upon the credit of the gospel 
    report.</p>
<p align="justify">But there are four things which may evince that most of 
    the hearers of the gospel, whatever they think, do not believe the gospel, 
    nor trust it as true, nor trust to it as good.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It does not purify their hearts and lives; Acts 15:9. 
    The belief of the truth is the means appointed of God for sanctification; 2 
    Thessalonians 2:13, "God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation, 
    through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth." Ephesians 
    5:25, 26, "Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might 
    sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the word." And it is 
    the word of the gospel that is so; John 15:3, "Now you are clean through the 
    word which I have spoken unto you." The word of the gospel received into the 
    heart by faith, is like a spring that works out the mud; 1 Thessalonians 
    2:13, "The Word of God effectually works in you that believe." It is like 
    leaven that seeks through the whole mass. For the Spirit of sanctification 
    is in it; John 6:63, "It is the spirit that quickens." The words that I 
    speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." So then whosever heart 
    and life is not purified by the gospel, they do not really believe it; 
    Hebrews 4:2.</p>
<p align="justify">The profane man, he who is ungodly with respect to God, 
    unrighteous with respect to men, not sober with respect to himself, does not 
    believe the gospel; for it "teaches us, that denying ungodliness, and 
    worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly, in this 
    present world," Titus 2:11, 12; and is effectual in believers; 1 
    Thessalonians 2:13, forfeited. But such a one is master of it, it is not 
    master of him. Romans 1:18, "He holds the truth in unrighteousness." The man 
    that is a slave to his passions, his pride, wrath, and revenge, believes not 
    the gospel; Isaiah 11:6. The man whose God is the world, the covetous, the 
    unjust, the sensual, the vain, etc., believes not; Matthew 13:45, 46, 
    forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It does not make them fruitful to God, as it does in 
    believers; Colossians 1:5, 6. That faith is vain that is without works: 
    James 2:20. The word of the gospel is a heavenly seed, which, received into 
    the hearts by faith, never misses to bring forth fruit. As it puts out the 
    fruits of the flesh, it brings in the fruits of the Spirit. It makes the man 
    to live to Christ, and live for him; Philippians 1:21; as the woman of 
    Samaria did, who not only lived unto Christ herself, but induced others, by 
    her example, to believe in him as their Savior. See John, chapter 4.</p>
<p align="justify">The man that makes no conscience of serving his 
    generation by doing good to others, that lays not out himself to be useful 
    for God in his place and station, that thinks it enough that he does not ill 
    to others, and hangs not out a flag of defiance against the honor of God, is 
    as really an unbeliever of the gospel, as he who is noxious, in respect of 
    God and man; for where is his fruit? Colossians 1:6. See Matthew 12:30, "He 
    who is not with me, is against me; and he who gathers not with me, scatters 
    abroad."</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is not their chief comfort, as it is to the saints; 
    Psalm 119:49, 50, "Remember the word unto your servant, upon which you have 
    caused me to hope. This is my comfort in my affliction; for your word has 
    quickened me." The scripture calls the believer's great hope, "the hope of 
    the gospel;" Colossians 1:23. And it has been proven to be so by their 
    Buffering for it even unto death; Mark 8:35, "For whoever will save his 
    life, shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the 
    gospel's the same shall save it" What bears up a man In his greatest 
    straits, must needs be his greatest comfort. The gospel is that which bore 
    up the hearts of believers, under their greatest hardships. Therefore it has 
    been found, that brown bread and the gospel has been pleasant fare to many a 
    believer. Take away the gospel, and take the sun out of the world. Whatever 
    are their straits or their storms, the gospel is their plight-anchor.</p>
<p align="justify">But alas! there are few thus minded. Give them full 
    pantries and a warm fire-side, they could be right cheery without the 
    gospel. It is the corn and the cattle, good markets, etc., they know the 
    comfort of these; but many that know that, know little of the comfort of the 
    gospel. If they be lifted up at any time, it is not the gospel that does it, 
    but some creature-comfort. If some affliction befall them, some 
    creature-comfort removed; what helps them is not the comfort of the gospel, 
    but some other creature-comfort put in its room, or hoped for.</p>
<p align="justify">If one had his stock in a ship at sea, whatever joys or 
    sorrows that man met with in his means at home, they would not be his chief 
    ones; the chief would be about the ship. The gospel is the ship the 
    believer's stock is in; and whatever joys or sorrows he meets with in the 
    world, yet his chief ones are in the gospel; Habakkuk 3:17, 18, "Although 
    the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, the 
    labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat, the flock 
    shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; 
    yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation." 
    There is such a difference between a believer and an unbeliever, as between 
    a laird and a tenant in a harvest flood sweeping away the corn. The corn 
    being swept away, the tenant has nothing left. Micah said, when his gods 
    were taken away, "What have I more?" The other comforts himself, Yet it has 
    not swept away the land. So Job 6:13, "Is not my help in me? and is wisdom 
    driven quite from me?"</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is not their chief concern what come of it. Often 
    they have no concern at all about it; they will profanely put that off to 
    them that live by it. Be it so, then all that believe it live by it, and it 
    will be their chief concern; Isaiah 38:16; John 6:63. It is the word of 
    life, and believing it is the way to live; Isaiah 55:3, "Hear, and your soul 
    shall live." They will be concerned for it as for their life; Deuteronomy 
    32:47, and take away their hope from that airth, they would reckon 
    themselves most miserable; 1 Corinthians 15:19. Therefore they will strive 
    for the faith of the gospel as their all.</p>
<p align="justify">But I fear many a hearer of the gospel would take it for 
    no ill news, if any body could but make them sure of it, that the whole 
    gospel is but a fable; a plain evidence that it is not the thing they mainly 
    trust to, else they would be mainly concerned for it.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Be stirred up then to a weighty concern to attain 
    to the true faith of the report of the gospel; that you may be of those who 
    really trust it as true, and trust to it as good. These following things may 
    be of use to put a peculiar edge on your spirits for this—</p>
<p align="justify">1. That there are so few that really believe it in a 
    saving manner. When Christ said," One of you shall betray me," the disciples 
    said, "Is it I?" And the consideration that so few believe the report of the 
    gospel, should put every one to see himself, that he be not an unbeliever.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Your salvation or damnation turns on this point; Mark 
    16:16, "He who believes, shall be saved; but he who believes not, shall be 
    damned." Many will be affected with some gross sins of theirs against the 
    law, who never see the venom of their unbelief of the gospel. But this is 
    the sin that draws deepest; and therefore that is the sin which the Spirit 
    is in a special manner to convince of; John 16:8, 9, "And when he is come, 
    he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment; of 
    sin because they believe not on me." And that is the great soul-ruining sin; 
    John 3:19," This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and 
    men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Doing this you do all; Mark 5:36, "Be not afraid, only 
    believe." This is the short way, and the only way to sanctification. It is 
    the belief of the gospel that brings sinners to the obedience of the law; 
    for thereby the soul is united to Christ, the storehouse of grace, and of 
    the Spirit of holiness; Ephesians 3:17; John 1:16. Hence it purifies the 
    heart; Acts. 15:9; and the heart being purified, the life will be so too. So 
    the apostle runs up obedience to it; 1 Timothy 1:5.</p>
<p align="justify">4. If you do not this you do nothing; 1 John 3:23, "This 
    is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus 
    Christ." John 6:29, "This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom 
    he has sent." All that you do in the way of obedience without it, will be 
    but as so many ciphers, that will amount to just nothing in the sight of a 
    holy God; Hebrews 11:6, "Without faith it is impossible to please God." Your 
    prayers, tears, justice, sobriety, etc., all will be lost without faith. 
    Whatever good works any does without faith, are but dead works; they may 
    have the shape of good works, but the soul and life is wanting. Here is the 
    reason why endeavors of reformation with unbelievers do not succeed; why, 
    when the doctrine of the gospel is corrupted, and preachers, instead of 
    preaching Christ, turn their sermons into harangues of moral virtue, they 
    and their hearers lose both grace and virtue, and turn profane.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, If you really believe the gospel, nothing can 
    ruin you; if you do not, nothing can save you. Under the law, the Jews were 
    a stubborn, disobedient generation, every now and then falling into 
    idolatry, until the Babylonish captivity; yet were they preserved, God 
    minding to try them with the dispensation of the gospel. But when they 
    rejected and disbelieved the gospel, though they had quite left their 
    idolatry, they were destroyed.</p>
<p align="justify">So whatever is your guilt, if you believe the gospel, it 
    will be wiped out; Acts 16:31, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you 
    shall be saved;" if not, whatever good you do, you will perish; John 3:36, 
    "He who believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides 
    on him." The gospel is the last method of Heaven for the salvation of 
    sinners; where the law failed, the gospel came to help out; Romans 8:3. But 
    if you miss salvation in the way of the gospel, there is not another method 
    to follow; so it is the last ship bound for Immanuel's land, and therefore 
    the only one.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall conclude with some directions how to believe the 
    gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Persuade yourselves, that the faith of the gospel is 
    beyond the power of nature; John 6:44; that there is a necessity of a power 
    from on high to bring you to believe. This will raze the old foundation, and 
    cause you look up for it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Urge on yourselves the faith of the law. It also is 
    the testimony of God. Believe it with application to yourselves. See the 
    authority of God in its commands binding on you; the truth of God, in its 
    threatening and curse, reaching you and holding you fast.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, With an eye to the Spirit's working in you, 
    consider and apply the promise of the gospel; for that is not only the 
    object, but the means of faith; Romans 10:17, "Faith comes by hearing, and 
    hearing by the Word of God."</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. There is no true believing or trusting to 
    the report of the gospel, but what is the effect of the working of a divine 
    power on the soul for that end.</p>
<p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Evince the truth of it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show what is that working of divine power whereby the 
    soul is brought to trust to the gospel-report.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall evince the truth of the doctrine. Consider for 
    it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Express scripture testimony; John 6:44, "No man can 
    come to me, except the Father which has sent me, draw him." The apostle 
    calls it therefore "The faith of the operation of God," Colossians 2:12; and 
    "the work of faith with power," 2 Thessalonians 1:11, is fulfilled. Hence 
    believing is said to be given; Philippians 1:29. Yes, no less power is put 
    forth in it, than that which was exerted in the raising of Christ from the 
    dead; Ephesians 1:19, 20.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The state that by nature we are in, "dead in sin;" 
    Ephesians 2:1. Faith is the first vital act of the soul, quickened by the 
    Spirit of life from Jesus Christ; which therefore a soul without the Spirit 
    of life, is no more capable of, than a dead man of breathing, walking, etc. 
    The raising of the dead is a work competent to God alone; the raising of 
    dead souls as well as bodies; John 5:25, 26, "Truly, truly, I say unto you, 
    The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the 
    Son of God; and they that hear shall live. For as the Father has life in 
    himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself."</p>
<p align="justify">3. There can be no faith without knowledge; and the 
    knowledge of spiritual things man is by nature incapable of; 1 Corinthians 
    2:14, "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for 
    they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are 
    spiritually discerned." How can one trust to the report of the gospel, 
    without discerning the gospel in its glorious excellency? But the eye of man 
    naturally is out as to these things. Natural truths he can discern by 
    natural powers; but supernatural truths are above his reach without 
    supernatural abilities.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Man is naturally under the power of Satan, a captive 
    of the devil, who with his utmost efforts will hinder the work of faith; 2 
    Corinthians 4:3, 4, "If our gospel be hid, it is hidden to them that are 
    lost; in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which 
    believe not." Such a case the gospel finds men in; Isaiah 61:1; and it is 
    the design of the gospel to bring them out of it; Acts 26:17, 18. But how 
    can such be the design of the gospel, but because it is the instrument of a 
    superior power; Romans 1:16, and is rendered effectual by the Omnipotent 
    himself? 2 Corinthians 10:4, 5. The strong man must be cast out by a 
    stronger.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Man's trust is by nature firmly pre-occupied by those 
    things which the gospel calls them to renounce. He is wedded to other 
    confidences naturally, which therefore he will hold by, until a power above 
    nature carry him off from them. And therefore it is a differencing character 
    between the Lord's people and all others, that they have "no confidence in 
    the flesh;" Philippians 3:3.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Self-confidence is natural to man. And therefore it 
    is the first lesson at Christ's school, to deny ourselves; which is 
    inwrapped in the very nature of faith, or trusting to the gospel; Matthew 
    16:24. Man going away from God as his chief end, set up himself for his 
    chief end; and so it is as natural for him to act from and for himself, as 
    for birds to fly in the air. So that to unself a man, which is done in the 
    work of faith, must needs be a work of divine power.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Creature-confidence. Man not being self-sufficient, 
    must needs seek something without himself wherein to rest his heart, Being 
    estranged from God, he goes to the creature; Jeremiah 2:13. And to it he is 
    so wedded in confidence, that, after a thousand disappointments, he still 
    maintains it. And the truth is, it is impossible to get the heart carried 
    off it, except to absolute despair, without putting a better in the room 
    thereof; which is done only by faith taking a God in Christ instead thereof; 
    Matthew 13:45, 46. This surely requires a supernatural power; Jeremiah 
    16:19.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Law-confidence. The law was Adam's covenant; and as 
    he was to work and win his wages, so that is the natural religion of all his 
    posterity. Nature knows no other way of acceptance with God; and men stick 
    by it until death, and a violent death too, do part them; Galatians 2:19, 
    "For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God." 
    Romans 7:4, "Wherefore my brethren, you also are become dead to the law by 
    the body of Christ." An evidence that it is another power than their own 
    must bring them off it.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Man has a strong bias and bent against believing or 
    trusting to the gospel; Romans 10:3, "For they being ignorant of God's 
    righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have 
    not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God." John 5:40, "And you 
    will not come to me, that you might have life." The contrivance of the 
    gospel lies cross to the mind and will of natural men, and they to it; so 
    that the one is the very reverse of the other. Hence the Jews and Greeks 
    both were opposite to the gospel, and in their wisdom reckoned it folly. So 
    that the soul must be new molded by a divine power, before it can receive 
    it; 1 Corinthians 2:14, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, It is the product of the Holy Spirit, wherever 
    it is; Galatians 5:22, "But the fruit of the Spirit is faith." Hence Christ 
    is called "the author of it," Hebrews 12:2, as working it in the elect by 
    his own Spirit; 2 Corinthians 4:13. It was promised in the covenant for the 
    elect, to be effected by the Spirit; and so it is peculiar to them; Acts 
    13:48, as being the work of God's Spirit only. And the gospel is the only 
    immediate outward mean of it, because it only is "the ministration of the 
    Spirit."</p>
<p align="justify">II. What is that working of divine power whereby the soul 
    is brought to trust to the gospel-report? There is a twofold work of divine 
    power on the soul for that end.</p>
<p align="justify">First, A mediate work, which is preparatory to it; 
    whereof the Spirit is the author, and the instrument is the law. It is 
    twofold.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, An awakening work; whereby the secure sinner is 
    roused up, and made to lay salvation to heart, which he was little concerned 
    about before, sleeping securely. And that is done by the Spirit's bringing 
    home the law on the sinner's conscience. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a divine power bringing home on the sinner's 
    conscience the commands of the law; Romans 7:9, "For I was alive without the 
    law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." And 
    thereby they are discovered; 1. In their divine authority, as the commands 
    of the eternal sovereign God, which clothes them with an awfulness they were 
    not accustomed to appear in to the sinner; each of them being prefaced with 
    a "Thus says the Lord." 2. As binding on the sinner in particular; so that 
    the bond of the command is found by him girding him strait, however he felt 
    little of it before; Romans 7:10, "And the commandment which was ordained to 
    life, I found to be unto death." It is observable that the ten commands are 
    all in the second person, speaking to every man as if they concerned no 
    other but him, "You shall not," etc. And when the Spirit comes, he speaks 
    them the same way to the sinner's conscience; Romans 7:7, "What shall we say 
    then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; 
    for I had not known Inst, except the law had said, You shall not covet."</p>
<p align="justify">Now hereby the sinner is convinced of sin, and brought in 
    guilty before the Lord, John 16:8; Romans 3:19. His sins original and 
    actual, of heart and life, of thoughts, words, and actions, are set before 
    him, Psalm 50:21. And he is like a thief found, Jeremiah 2:26.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This divine power brings home on the sinner's 
    conscience the curse of the law; John 16:8, And when he is come, he will 
    reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment." And it is 
    discovered to be, 1. God's curse, heavier than mountains of lead, which, in 
    virtue of his greatness, is insupportable, in virtue of his infiniteness 
    eternal, and in virtue of his truth infallible; though before it was but 
    like the sounding again of the mountains in his conceit. 2. God's curse on 
    him in particular, staking him down to revenging wrath. The Spirit of the 
    Lord says within the man, as Malachi 3:9, "You are cursed with a curse; for 
    you have robbed me, even this whole nation." As long as the sinner can ward 
    off the particular application of the curse to himself, he will little value 
    the gospel, Revelation 3:17. But the word delivers it in the general; 
    Galatians 3:10, "Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which 
    are written in the book of the law to do them;" and a divine power obliges 
    the conscience to apply.</p>
<p align="justify">Hereby the sinner is convinced of his misery, and sees 
    himself lost and undone, Luke 15:17. And so he is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Stung to the heart, and galled with remorse, Acts 
    2:37. Waves of killing grief go over his soul; he sees he has been murdering 
    his own soul, and he groans out an elegy over his dead self; Romans 7:9, "I 
    was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, 
    and I died."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Frightened with terror, Acts 16:29; with the terror of 
    God, the terror of death, and the terror of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Racked with anxiety, Acts 2:37. Sometimes he hopes, 
    sometimes he fears, but is always anxious. This anxiety fills head, heart, 
    and hands; swallows up all other cares, for the man sees how true it is; 
    Matthew 16:26, "What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, 
    and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, An humbling work, whereby the proud sinner is 
    brought low to the dust; not only finding a need of salvation, but an 
    absolute need of Christ for salvation; that there is no other way of help 
    for him; but if he get not Christ he must perish. So he is broken off from,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Self-confidence, Luke 15:17. He sees he has destroyed 
    himself, but cannot help himself, Hosea 13:9. He finds that he is without 
    strength, light, or life; that his work is quite beyond his reach, the debt 
    beyond his ability to pay; the bonds of sin, in the guilt of it, and the 
    power of it, quite above his might to break asunder, Romans 7:9.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Creature-confidence, Luke 15:16. While his conscience 
    was asleep, he pleased himself in his enjoyment of the creature, but now 
    that it is awake, the emptiness of the whole creation is felt by him. His 
    lawful comforts are foysonless, while he thinks God is his enemy; his 
    unlawful comforts have left a sting behind them, which the whole creation 
    cannot pull out. There is no rest for his heart now, but in a God in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Law-confidence, Romans 7:9, 10. Time was when he had 
    hopes of acceptance with God by the deeds of the law, and set down his 
    duties of first and second table as so much clear gain; but now he sees they 
    are all but loss, Philippians 3:6, 7. So he despairs of mending his case 
    that way; and that he cannot pay his own debt in whole or in part. And all 
    this is by means of the law too, discovered in its spirituality and 
    severity; Galatians 2:19, "I through the law am dead to the law, that I 
    might live unto God."</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, This work of divine power is an immediate work; 
    whereby faith is produced in the soul, it caused to trust to the 
    gospel-report; whereof the Spirit is the author, and the gospel the 
    instrument. And it is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A quickening work; whereby the dead soul is called 
    again to spiritual life; Ephesians 2:1, "You has he quickened who were dead 
    in trespasses and sins." Therefore the same power is said to be exerted in 
    that case, as in raising Christ from the dead, re-uniting his soul with his 
    body, Ephesians 1:19, 20. So the Spirit of Christ enters into the dead soul, 
    and the dry bones live, Ezekiel 36:27; which Spirit is communicated in the 
    word of the gospel, as the vehicle thereof, so to speak, Galatians 3:2. 
    Hence the word of the gospel is said to be spirit and life, John 6:63; as 
    being the ministration of the Spirit. An emblem of which is in the 
    resurrection of the dry bones. And hence there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A power to believe, as in a living man to breathe. So 
    the Spirit of life being the Spirit of faith in the soul, it has a 
    supernatural power, for that supernatural act, 2 Corinthians 4:13. In vain 
    do we call the lame man to walk, who has no ability of walking; but the 
    Spirit with the call of the gospel entering into the sinner, he is enabled 
    to embrace Christ on the gospel-report.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A disposition to believe; Psalm 110:3, "Your people 
    shall be willing in the day of your power;" as in Lazarus brought to life, 
    to come out of the grave, and to lie no longer there. So the soul becomes 
    pliable to the gospel-call, content to come to Christ, content to be made 
    clean. Death's bands being loosed, the neck is no more as an iron sinew; but 
    the life given disposes to What is agreeable to it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. An illuminating work. There is a knowledge in faith, 
    which is therefore called knowledge, Isaiah 53:11; John 17:3. No man will 
    trust to the report of the gospel until he know it, and know it by a 
    supernatural discovery too, 1 Corinthians 2:14. And the Spirit of the Lord 
    makes that discovery, Acts 26:18; showing the treasure hidden in the 
    gospel-field, Matthew 13:44. This the Spirit does by bringing home the 
    gospel-report to the soul; in which he demonstrates it to the soul with the 
    greatest certainty, 1 Corinthians 2:4. He demonstrates it to be,</p>
<p align="justify">1. God's own word, 1 Thessalonians 2:13. The report comes 
    in the word that Christ is sent in the character of Savior of the world; 
    that he is able to save, and willing to save the worst of sinners; and that 
    "whoever believes in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life," John 
    3:16. The Spirit of the Lord sets this in such a clear light, as that the 
    sinner sees it is not a report of fallible men; but the word of the eternal 
    God that cannot lie; the divine testimony, which is so certain that it 
    cannot be false, 1 Corinthians 2:4.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) God's word to that soul in particular, as really as 
    if a voice from Heaven did speak to him by name, saying, Such an one, Christ 
    is your Savior, able and willing to save you; and you trusting on him "shall 
    not perish, but have everlasting life," 1 Thessalonians 1:5. This is as it 
    were an internal word, applying to the soul in particular, the external word 
    which is general; and without it the special application of faith will not 
    be. Hence the Spirit is said to convince of righteousness as well as of sin; 
    which he does by a particular application of the law in the one, and of the 
    gospel in the other; John 16:8. And the Spirit's testimony of Christ is 
    distinguished from the preacher's testimony; John 15:26, 27, "But when the 
    Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the 
    Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me. And 
    you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the 
    beginning."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A determining work, effectually and irresistibly 
    determining them to believe, so that they can no longer not believe. This is 
    called the Father's drawing, namely, by his Spirit; John 6:44. The Spirit of 
    the Lord freely wins the soul, over the belly of all opposition.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To believe, and trust the report of the gospel, as 
    true. For the demonstration of the Spirit is accompanied with power; 1 
    Corinthians 2:4. Some things are so clear to all, as that two and three make 
    five, so that none can but believe it. Some things are so demonstrated by 
    sight, or by reason, that though one could not believe them before, they can 
    as little not believe them, or withhold their assent from them, after. So 
    the gospel being demonstrated by the Spirit, cannot but be believed, and 
    trusted as true; and therefore it is said to have come in much assurance; 1 
    Thessalonians 1:5, as a thing seen by the soul, or demonstrated to it.</p>
<p align="justify">And so faith is the soul's echo to this demonstration of 
    the Spirit; the soul saying he is the Savior of the world, and my Savior, 
    able and willing to save sinners, and to save me; on whom I trusting shall 
    not perish, like Thomas, "My Lord, and my God," John 20:28.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To trust to the report of the gospel, as good. For 
    the same demonstration of the Spirit so discovers the excellency, and 
    absolute suitableness of Christ to the sinner's case, and full security for 
    its salvation that is in him, upon the infallible truth of the gospel-report 
    that it being earnestly desirous of salvation, cannot but trust to it as 
    good for them, and good security.</p>
<p align="justify">So then here faith takes up the soul's eternal rest, 
    resting wholly on Christ held forth in the gospel for salvation, upon the 
    security of the word of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. Of information. Hence learn, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The faith of the gospel is to be suspected, that 
    springs up without a work of mighty power to the producing of it. These are 
    not of that sort; Ephesians 1:19, 20, who have experienced "the exceeding 
    greatness of his power toward them in believing, according to the working of 
    his mighty power; which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the 
    dead." Wild oats spring up without any pains about them; but it is not so 
    with good grain. So a false faith may spring from nature, without divine 
    influence; but true faith is the fruit of the mighty power of God. It is the 
    loss of many, that they come easily by their religion, they know not how, 
    but as in a morning-dream, it costs them nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true, grace is a seed that springs and grows up a 
    man knows not how; Mark 4:17. But it is one thing to spring up without 
    tilling and sowing; another, to spring up out of ground tilled and sown, one 
    knows not how. The gardener knows very well how he comes by his crop, what 
    pains he was at in laboring the ground, though he cannot account for that 
    how the seed he sowed did turn into such a fair braird. So faith springing 
    up in the heart may be mysterious to the believer, as to the time and way of 
    it; who yet knows there was an awakening, humbling, enlightening, and 
    powerfully determining work on him for that end.</p>
<p align="justify">Some indeed may be sanctified from the womb; but that 
    will appear in grace's exercise beginning with the exercise of reason; and 
    Satan will readily assault their faith after, that they shall find a 
    difficulty in the exercise of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See whence it is that most men's faith of the gospel 
    has no sanctifying effect on their lives. It is a mere natural faith, and 
    therefore cannot change their natures. If their faith were the produce of a 
    mighty work of divine power on their souls, whereby they were quickened, 
    humbled, enlightened, and powerfully determined, it would make a suitable 
    change on the whole man. It would be a most holy faith; Jude verse 20, as 
    making holy; produced by the holy Spirit; and uniting the soul to the holy 
    Jesus, and drawing sanctifying virtue from him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The salvation of sinners is altogether of free grace. 
    Man can do nothing to purpose for himself any manner of way. In the law-way, 
    perfect obedience is required; that is certainly beyond his reach. In the 
    gospel-way faith is required; and that is beyond his power too; Ephesians 
    2:8, "By grace are you saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves; it 
    is the gift of God." The gospel casts out a rope to hale sinners to land; 
    but the sinner has no hands to lay hold on it; his very faith must be 
    wrought in him by the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Believers have reason to be humble, and to acknowledge 
    that whatever difference in the matter of faith and holiness is between them 
    and others, it is purely owing to the work of the Spirit, not to themselves, 
    agreeable to what the apostle says; 1 Corinthians 4:7, "Who makes you to 
    differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now, if you 
    did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?" Sinners 
    are all naturally dead in sin; and free grace sends the quickening Spirit to 
    one, not to another; that "he who glories, may glory in the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">5. The difficulty that some find in believing, is rather 
    a good sign, than an ill one. They were the disciples that said; Luke 17:5, 
    "Increase our faith." The soul that finds a difficulty in believing the 
    gospel, and is loaded with that slowness to believe, and looking out to the 
    Spirit of the Lord to help him to believe, is in a hopeful case as to the 
    work of faith; Mark 9:24. The Lord makes the truth of faith, and his own 
    power in working it, to appear the better, by letting men feel the power of 
    their unbelieving hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Exhortation. Let us look to the Lord for the 
    operation of his mighty power, to cause us to believe. There is need of 
    this,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) For the begetting of true faith in us. Natural 
    powers assisted with the best means of external revelation, will not do it</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) For the increasing and exercise of faith. New 
    supplies are necessary for this. And with respect to both, both ministers 
    and people have need to look to the Spirit of God. As the ship will make but 
    sorry progress, if the wind blow not; so the gospel will be but ill 
    improved, if the Spirit of the Lord do not blow.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. The feeling of this power of God is often very 
    rare among the hearers of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">We need not insist on the proof of this; our own case is 
    a visible evidence of it. With respect to which we may consider, 1. What are 
    the causes of it; and, 2. Our duty.</p>
<p align="justify">I. What are the causes of it? Why is it so with us?</p>
<p align="justify">1. An old standing quarrel that God has with our mother. 
    The sins of Manasseh were a standing quarrel in the days of his grandson 
    Josiah; 2 Kings 23:26, and his great-grandson Jehoiakim, chapter 24:3. God 
    is saying concerning us, as Hosea 2:4, 5, "And I will not have mercy upon 
    her children; for they be the children of whoredoms. For their mother has 
    played the harlot; she that conceived them has done shamefully; for she 
    said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water," etc. 
    Do we ask, Why the Lord has so much withdrawn himself in our land? Ah! what 
    wonder is it, his soul so much abhors a land, wherein a covenant sworn to 
    him with uplifted hands, was broken purposely, burnt disgracefully, his 
    ordinances changed, his saints persecuted and murdered, and his name 
    insulted and blasphemed; and these things never yet sufficiently mourned 
    for; I doubt much if ever Scotland shall recover her ancient spiritual 
    glory, through the presence of the Lord remarkably and gloriously with her, 
    until she go back to God in the manner she came away.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A present course of backsliding among all ranks in 
    church and state. In reforming times the Spirit of the Lord returns to a 
    land; Psalm 102:16, 17, "When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear 
    in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise 
    their prayer." And so it was seen among our forefathers oftener than once. 
    Our present case in respect of the Lord's withdrawing, does therefore write 
    us a backsliding generation; whose judgment and sin, see Isaiah 57:17, "For 
    the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hidden me, 
    and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart." The 
    generation is souring apace; the elder sort losing the life of religion that 
    sometime-a-day they had; and the younger neither knowing anything about it, 
    nor caring for it. A sad evidence of the Spirit's being in great measure 
    gone.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Worldliness prevailing through long peace. Times of 
    persecution were times of much of God's presence; enemies kept professors 
    stirring. And the more they afflicted them, the more they grew; the young 
    folk were engaged to embrace a persecuted religion. But now the generation 
    is sunk in worldly cares and ease; and religion is so cheap, that it is 
    quite undervalued. It is as Josh, 24:31, "Israel served the Lord all the 
    days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and 
    which had known all the works of the Lord, that he had done for Israel;" 
    implying, that after the elders were gone too, the generation went away from 
    God, for good and all. Truly, we may say in our case, Our Joshuas are away 
    long ago; and our elders that have outlived them, are by this time nearly 
    gone. So the Lord, and his great works he did in the land, are almost worn 
    out of ken, and out of mind, with this generation; and the generation that 
    knew not Joseph and his afflictions, are filling the stage fast, and 
    proclaiming themselves unconcerned in them; trampling on that religion that 
    others suffered for. But let them take heed that sadder sufferings be not 
    abiding them, that they will neither get shifted, nor be so well buckled 
    for. See Judges 3:1, "Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to 
    prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars 
    of Canaan."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Grieving and quenching the Spirit; Isaiah 63:10. The 
    Spirit is compared to a fire; and when that holy fire is cherished and 
    nourished, a small spark may become a great flame; but being neglected, and 
    sought to be extinguished, it abates. Many have been the methods taken 
    publicly and privately to quench the Spirit in the generation; and they have 
    prevailed far, until that which remains is even ready to die. God who by his 
    own hand has given several sharp knocks at the door of some sinners' hearts, 
    who yet would not open, has therefore been provoked to go and leave them.</p>
<p align="justify">II What is our duty in such a case?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Mourn over it; lament the Lord's withdrawings as those 
    who are sensible of the great loss; 1 Samuel 7:2.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Pray much and earnestly for the return of his powerful 
    presence to ordinances; Canticles 3:1–4; Isaiah 64:7.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, Consider the word of the gospel as the word of 
    the eternal God; 1 Thessalonians 2:13, and labor to walk up to what you know 
    of the word; John 7:17. If you do so, you shall feel, that his "words do 
    good to him that walks uprightly;" Micah 2:7.</p>
