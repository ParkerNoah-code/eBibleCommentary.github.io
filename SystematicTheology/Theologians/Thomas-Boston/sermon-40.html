    EPHESIANS 1:6, "His grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved."</p>
<p align="justify">BEFORE our works can be accepted, our persons must; and 
    how that is attained is here declared.</p>
<p align="justify">The apostle taking a view of the state of salvation that 
    believers are brought into, in the fullness of it, verse 3; runs it up unto 
    the prime author of it, the Father, ib. the eternal plan of it in the decree 
    of election, verse 4; whereof the great design to be accomplished on them, 
    their true sanctification, ib. to be begun here, and perfected in glory; the 
    reason of this design, that they were predestined to adoption into his 
    family, for it was inconsistent with the honor of a holy God, to have unholy 
    children, verse 5. In this verse are two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The great end of God's predestinating the elect to be 
    his own children; "the praise of the glory of his grace." It was a display 
    of his free grace that he aimed at. Grace is love and favor freely flowing, 
    without anything in the object to draw it out. This grace shown to sinners 
    is glorious grace, like a shining sun, casting such a luster, as is most 
    admirable and attractive. And it is to be praised by the sons of men; but 
    they that do not see, and do not feel the glory of it, cannot praise it, 
    more than the blind the light of the sun. But God purposed to bring the 
    elect out of the devil's family, and make them his own children freely; that 
    they seeing, tasting, and feeling this glorious grace, might raise a song of 
    praise of it here, and joining voices in Heaven, might carry it on in the 
    highest strain there forever, praising the glorious grace appearing in their 
    adoption; opening the various folds of it, and admiring the glories of free 
    grace, forever and ever. It is dangerous then to cast a veil over it, 
    doctrinally or practically.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A particular fruit of this glorious grace; "Wherein he 
    has made us accepted in the Beloved." Where we have,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The fruit itself, the acceptance of the persons of 
    believers with God; "He has made us accepted." The acceptor is the Father, 
    verses 3, 5. The accepted are us, believers, who are "blessed with all 
    spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ," verse 3. The acceptance 
    is emphatically expressed. The word is, as if he had said, he has graced us; 
    and imports not only that he has accepted us, but freely accepted us, 
    without anything in us to render us acceptable; and bears not only free love 
    and favor, but also all kinds of real benefits and favors flowing therefrom, 
    Luke 1:28.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The way and manner of the acceptance. How can a 
    sinner be accepted of a holy God? "In the Beloved," that is, Christ. It is 
    not only for his sake, but God looking on the sinner in Christ, united to 
    him, accepts him. He calls Christ here "the Beloved," to intimate that the 
    accepting love and favor of God is first pitched on him, and then for his 
    sake comes down on his members; so he is the Beloved by way of eminency. He 
    says not, "his Beloved," though doubtless Le mainly aims at that, but "the 
    Beloved," that he might give a vent to that love to Christ that his heart 
    swelled with on the mention of this; and so uses a general term, whereby 
    Christ might be pointed out as the object whereon the loves of Heaven and 
    earth meet together.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The original spring and source of this acceptance, 
    intimated by the relative wherein. It refers not only to the word grace, but 
    to "the glory of his grace," From, through, and by which glorious grace and 
    free favor, he has freely accepted us undeserving and ill-deserving 
    creatures; that glorious grace finding a way to accept the sinner, with the 
    good leave of justice, in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">From the text, thus explained, arises the following 
    savory points of doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. I. Jesus Christ is the beloved, the eminently 
    beloved One.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. II. The way how a sinner comes to be accepted 
    of God, is freely, in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. III. Glorious free grace shines forth in the 
    acceptance of sinners in the beloved Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. I. Jesus Christ is the beloved, the eminently 
    beloved One.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing from this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show in what respects Christ is the eminently beloved 
    One.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Make some improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show in what respects Christ is the eminently 
    beloved One.</p>
<p align="justify">First, He is the beloved of the excellent ones of the 
    earth. Who these are, you may see, Psalm 16:3. They are "the saints." Him 
    all the saints love with a love above all persons and all things, Luke 
    14:26. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. They meet altogether in him in love, however they are 
    scattered through the world; hence is he called, "the desire of all 
    nations," Hag. 2:7. So that lovers of Christ and saints are of equal 
    latitude; Ephesians 6:24, "Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus 
    Christ in sincerity." The American saints and the European saints take him 
    all for their Beloved. As it is the same sun in the firmament that warms all 
    their bodies, it is the same Sun of righteousness, Christ, that warms all 
    their hearts in love. They differ vastly in their languages, customs, and 
    particular dispositions; but they perfectly agree in their love of one 
    beloved Jesus; Genesis 49:10, "Unto him shall the gathering of the people 
    be." And so they are knit as one body, whereof Christ is the beloved head.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Each one of them loves him with a superlative and 
    transcendent love; Psalm 73:25, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is 
    none upon earth that I desire besides you." They have a general love to 
    mankind, a special love to their respective countries, a more special love 
    to their relations, but the most special and peculiar love, leaving all the 
    rest behind, is to Christ, Luke 14:26. In the other they are divided, but in 
    this they meet in one; their beloved ones are very different, but their 
    beloved One is one and the same.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They love other persons and things for his sake, 
    Romans 15:2, 3; Titus 3:3–5. When the soul is in its natural state, other 
    persons and things have the man's love, but Christ has none of it; when 
    Christ discovers himself in his glory to the soul, then the man hates all in 
    comparison of him; but Christ regulates the soul's love to other things, and 
    takes it not away, but makes it run in another channel, springing from 
    himself. Now other things being loved for him, himself is the best beloved.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The liker anything is to him, they love it the more. 
    Hence the godly that bear his image, are therefore beloved by them; and the 
    more godly they are, the more beloved are they, 1 John 3:14. They love his 
    ordinances, because they bear the impress of his authority, his law as the 
    image of his nature; his way and example, because of the tread of his steps 
    therein to be seen. All which bear him to be their eminently beloved. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They love him with a love of good-will; and vent it 
    in prayer and praise; Psalm 72:15, "Prayer also shall be made for him 
    continually, and daily shall he be praised." It is not in their power to 
    profit him, and he needs nothing at the creature's hand, being completely 
    happy in his Father; but they show good-will to him, in concern for his 
    glory in the world, that his kingdom may prosper, his name spread far and 
    wide, and be perpetuated to all generations.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, They love him with a love of delight and delight, 1 
    Peter 2:7, "Unto you which believe he is precious." His name and every 
    letter of it is sweet to them, Canticles 1:3. They delight in him as a 
    sister in a brother, a child in a father, and a spouse in a husband. 
    Everything in Christ is sweet to a believer; therefore they are said to eat 
    his flesh, and drink his blood: for as by eating one finds the sweetness of 
    the meat, and every bit of it, so by faith the soul finds the sweetness of 
    Christ and everything in Christ. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They love him for what he is in himself, Cant 
    5:10–16. The glorious excellencies of his person and natures, his attributes 
    and perfections, make him the object of their love. Their hearts are framed 
    to the love of God: so they love him for himself, they love him for that 
    holiness and purity for which carnal men hate him, as the owl does the sun, 
    Psalm 30:4.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They love him for what he is to them, Canticles 
    5:16. And as he is best in himself, he is the best to them. They love him 
    for all his offices; for what he has done for them, and for what be will do 
    for them. They love him as the foundation of all their hopes, the scope of 
    all their desires, and the spring of all their joys. And fitly does he go 
    under the name, "the Beloved," even in respect of the saints: for,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] They profess him to be the beloved of their souls; 
    they are not ashamed of their choice. So the spouse calls him, Canticles per 
    tot. See chapter 3:3, "Saw you him whom my soul loves?" as if she would have 
    all to know him by that name, "her Beloved;" supposing there is none so but 
    he.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] They show him to be so, by their life and actions 
    before the world, Canticles 8:6, 7. Where love to Christ is, it will 
    discover itself by the soul's preferring Christ to all persons and things, 
    so as to part with anything when it comes in competition with him.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Christ is the beloved of the glorious ones in 
    Heaven. All eyes are upon him there, for he is there the light of the 
    pleasant land, Revelation 21:23, as the sun is in this world. And he is 
    there,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The beloved of the glorified saints, who now love him 
    in perfection, Revelation 7:10. Their love to him is now perfected, and they 
    love him with a pure and ardent love. They see him now no more through a 
    glass, but face to face; they behold the glories of his person, the glories 
    of his actings and sufferings for them; his eternal undertaking, his going 
    through with his undertaking in his birth, life, and death; and the glory he 
    now has from his Father as the reward. So their love to him is in a 
    continual flame.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The beloved of the holy angels, Revelation 5:11, 12. 
    In the temple the cherubim were posted, looking towards the ark or 
    mercy-seat, a type of Christ; which signified the angels looking to Jesus 
    with love and admiration, 1 Peter 1:12. They behold his glory, and cannot 
    but love him. They love him as the brightness of the Father's glory, as the 
    elder Brother of the family, the heir of all things, and their Lord, Hebrews 
    1:6, as the Savior of sinners, and the head of angels, by whom they and all 
    things do consist, Ephesians 1:10.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Father's beloved, Matthew 17:5. And here we may 
    consider Christ two ways, as God, and as Mediator.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, As God, equal and co-eternal with the Father and 
    Holy Spirit. He was the beloved of the Father and the Spirit. The Scripture 
    teaches that "God is love," 1 John 4:8, and that love must be eminently 
    among the persons of the glorious Trinity one towards another. Thus, 
    Proverbs 8:30, he is held out as the Creator's delight. See John 1:18, 
    Hebrews 1:2. But what our text mainly aims at, is,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, As Mediator, God-man, having a common relation to 
    God and sinners of mankind, as the representative of an elect world, and the 
    bond of union and communion between God and sinners, for the glory of God 
    and the salvation of sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As such he is the Father's beloved, his prime 
    favorite, and most accepted, his "well Beloved," Mark 12:6, in whom he is 
    "well pleased;" Matthew 3., the perpetual rest of his eyes and heart, 2 
    Chronicles 7:16. And he is his beloved,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] In respect of his person; John 1:18. He "is in the 
    bosom of the Father." For he is "the brightness of his Father's glory," 
    Hebrews 1:2. The glory of God shines forth in his face, 2 Corinthians 4:6. 
    He is "the image of God" in a peculiar manner, verse 4. Therefore says he, 
    John 14:9, "He who has seen me, has seen the Father." See Colossians 2:9, 
    and 1:19. So he is the most beautiful object in the eyes of God, in Heaven 
    or in earth; and accordingly has the highest place in his love, Hebrews 
    1:13.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] In respect of his office. The Father is well pleased 
    with him in the character he took on. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He was well pleased with his undertaking for the 
    great work of sinners' salvation. See with what satisfaction he speaks of 
    it; Psalm 89:19, "I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted 
    one chosen out of the people." He cordially accepted him as the sinners' 
    surety, and took his single bond for all the elect's debt, and his security 
    for the injured honor of his name. He was the Father's own choice, and he 
    delighted in his choice, Isaiah 42:1. He so loved the Undertaker, that,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] He promised to be with him, and furnished him with 
    all things necessary for the work, Isaiah 42:6, and 61:1.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] He bestowed eternal salvation on many, before the 
    time the Savior paid the ransom; he set them free, and gave them their 
    discharge, before the death of Christ. He rested in the Beloved's 
    engagement.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He was well pleased with and accepted him in his 
    carrying on the work that he had undertaken.—With his birth, therefore the 
    angels were employed to carry the tidings of it, and sung solemnly on that 
    occasion.—With his entering on his public work at his baptism, testified by 
    a voice from Heaven, Matthew 3., and all along, testified by his being 
    always with him, John 8:29.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He was well-pleased with his perfecting of the work, 
    by his death and burial. He did in it the most acceptable piece of service 
    to God that ever was done, John 10:17. His sacrifice of himself was of a 
    sweet savor unto God. He so loved him for it, that he raised him up, and set 
    him on his right hand forever for it, Philippians 2:8, 9, and accepts the 
    worst of sinners in him, for his sake.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As such he is the rest of the Holy Spirit, Isaiah 
    11:2. The Spirit came on the prophets, but he rested on Jesus as the 
    beloved, Matthew 3:16. All the saints as beloved ones have the Spirit in a 
    measure; but he without measure as the Beloved, John 3:34. The Spirit is in 
    him as water in the fountain, to be communicated to others, Revelation 3:1.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall conclude this point with a word of application.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. I. Hereby you may try whether you be saints or not, 
    partakers of the divine nature. If so, Christ will be your Beloved, your 
    eminently beloved One; for so he is to the saints, and so he is to God. And 
    if he is your Beloved,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You will love him above all, Psalm 73:25, which will 
    show itself in desiring him above all, prizing him beyond all, rejoicing 
    most in his favor, and sorrowing most for the want of him; and in loving 
    other persons and things for his sake.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You will hate sin above all things, because it is most 
    contrary to him, his nature and will, Genesis 3:15. You will hate it 
    universally, constantly as to the habitual bent of your heart, and 
    irreconcilably.</p>
<p align="justify">USE II. Of reproof to those who love him not eminently, 
    above all. It is an evidence, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You know him not, John 4:10. None can be let into a 
    discovery of Christ in his glory but must love him, Matthew 13:44–46. It is 
    to the blind world only there is no beauty in him for which he is to be 
    desired.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That you are in love with your sins and a vain world. 
    For who would loath the physician but he who loves his disease and cannot 
    part with it?</p>
<p align="justify">USE III. Let him be your Beloved then, and give him your 
    heart.</p>
<p align="justify">1. He is best worth your love. None has done so much for 
    sinners as Christ has, dying for them. None can do so much for you; he can 
    satisfy the cravings of your souls, and make you happy.</p>
<p align="justify">2. If you love him not, you will be constructed haters of 
    him, and enemies to him; 1 Corinthians 16:22, "If any man love not the Lord 
    Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, Maranatha!</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II, The way how a sinner comes to be accepted of 
    God, is freely, in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is implied in it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Consider the nature of a sinner's acceptance with 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The way of it.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show what is implied in the doctrine. And 
    there are these things implied in it.</p>
<p align="justify">First, A state of non-acceptance, or unacceptableness 
    with God, that sinners are in, while they are not in Christ. And we may take 
    up this in these following things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are offenders; they have sinned, and provoked 
    him, Romans 3:23. Men's doing their duty, and men's misery, may make them 
    unacceptable to men, yes, one may be unacceptable to another, who cannot 
    show wherefore, only they cannot endure them. But nothing can make us 
    unacceptable to God but sin. So the unacceptable to God are undoubtedly 
    sinners, offenders against him.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are sinners in Adam, Romans 5:12. The root was 
    corrupted, and all the branches withered and rotted in him. So his guilt 
    lies on us by nature, we are deprived of righteousness of nature, and 
    instead of that we have derived a corrupt nature from him; all which makes 
    us unacceptable to God by nature.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) They are sinners in their own persons, who are 
    capable of actual sinning, Genesis 6:5. They imitate sinning Adam, as well 
    as fall heirs to his offence. The debt left by him on their heads, they do 
    not clear, but increase daily; they continue their rebellion while condemned 
    for it. And so they are more and more unacceptable.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are unpardoned offenders. All have sinned, but 
    some are pardoned and accepted; but none are pardoned who are out of Christ, 
    John 3. The sentence of the broken law stands in force against all those who 
    are not in him, who has fulfilled the law. He is "the end of the law for 
    righteousness to every one that believes," Romans 10:4. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Their original guilt lies on them, unremoved, 
    unforgiven, 1 Corinthians 15:22. God has never forgiven them their guilt of 
    Adam's first sin, their want of original righteousness, and the corruption 
    of their whole nature. The debt left on them by their father, they were 
    never either able or willing to pay; and though they may have forgot it, God 
    has neither forgiven nor forgot it, but it lies on them still, to all 
    effects and purposes of a dreadful pursuit for it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The guilt of all their actual sins lies on them, 
    Galatians 3:10. All the sins they have been guilty of, from the first 
    sproutings of corruption in their childhood to this day, are hard and fast 
    on them. None of all their sins of omission or commission, of heart, lip, or 
    life, are forgotten by God, Amos 8:7, but the accounts are closely kept, 
    Deuteronomy 32:34; Hosea 13:12. They may have made a fashion of repenting, 
    and begging pardon, for some of their grosser sins; but since they are not 
    in Christ, there is not one of them blotted out; for "without shedding of 
    blood is no remission," Hebrews 9:22, and there is no saving benefit of 
    Christ's blood, but by being in him, chapter 12:24.</p>
<p align="justify">3. God is not pleased with them; for his being pleased 
    with any of mankind is in his son Jesus Christ, and without him he can be 
    pleased with none of them, Matthew 3; Hebrews 11:5, 6. He is not pleased 
    with their persons nor with any of their works; because they themselves are 
    not in Christ; but yet in the old stock, Romans 8:8, and their works are not 
    wrought in him, John 15:5. So the apostle teaches, that it was faith that 
    made the difference between Abel's offering and Cain's, Hebrews 11:4.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He is highly displeased with them. There is a cloud of 
    divine displeasure ever upon them, John 3. Whatever case they be in, 
    rejoicing or weeping; whatever they be doing, serving God in their way, or 
    serving their lusts, his countenance is never towards them, because they are 
    not in Christ, Isaiah 66:2, 3. There is a displeasure conceived against them 
    on the most just grounds, not to be removed until they be in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">5. He cannot endure them to have any communion or 
    fellowship with them, farther than in the way of common providence, Psalm 
    5:5. He and they are at enmity, he legally, they really; so there can be no 
    communion, Amos 3:3. And they cannot have it until they come to Christ, John 
    14:6. God may lay common favors to their hand, health, wealth, etc; as the 
    condemned man is allowed his meat until the execution; but he grants them no 
    special saving favors, no peace, pardon, etc. He may allow them to come, and 
    call them into the outer court of ordinances, and make them offers of grace; 
    but they cannot come into the inner court, nor partake of grace, not being 
    in Christ, John 10:9.</p>
<p align="justify">6. He loathes them, his soul abhors them, as abominable. 
    They are abominable in their persons unto God, as wholly corrupt and 
    defiled, Titus 1:15, 16. The whole herd of them is so, Psalm 14:3. Their 
    works are abominable, even the best of them, like precious liquor in a 
    filthy vessel, Proverbs 15:8. Sin is the abominable thing unto God, Jeremiah 
    44:4. And all their sins lie on them, and there is nothing on them to 
    correct the abominable savor of the sinner by them. Sin is abominable in 
    believers too; but the sacrifice of the sweet-smelling savor of Christ 
    corrects it, and is a savor of rest, Genesis 8:21.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, The wrath of God is upon them, and they lie 
    under his curse, John 3., Galatians 3:10. They are "children of wrath," 
    Ephesians 2:3. There is much wrath on them, and they are liable to more. 
    There is wrath in God's heart against them, in his word, and in his 
    providential dispensations. And if the thread of their life be cut while 
    they are in that state of wrath, they are forever undone without remedy.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, A way provided, how sinners may be accepted. 
    The case is not hopeless, but he who is not, may be accepted. The acceptance 
    of some with God is now secured, and cannot be lost. Believers on earth may 
    fall under the frowns of a Father, but never out of the state of acceptance 
    with him; being "accepted in the Beloved." The acceptance of the saints in 
    glory is not liable to the least cloud. The acceptance of some, again, is 
    absolutely hopeless. The fallen angels never can, nor could have been 
    accepted: the damned sometimes might, but can no more now forever be 
    accepted; they sat their accepted time. But there is a way how sinners in 
    life may be accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God is ready to accept of them now, that will come to 
    him in his own way; 2 Corinthians 5:19. The Judge of all the earth is set 
    down on a throne of grace, for receiving sinners into favor; and therefore 
    we have now an "accepted time," and "day of salvation," chapter 6:2.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is ready for sinners what may procure them 
    acceptance with a holy God, Matthew 22:4. There is a sacrifice slain and 
    offered, that is of such a sweet-smelling savor, that the most loathsome 
    sinner having the savor of it about him cannot miss to be accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is open proclamation made in the gospel, that 
    all may have the benefit of that sacrifice, and be accepted of God, 2 
    Corinthians 5:19, Matthew 22:4. Who they were whom the Father gave to the 
    Son to be redeemed, is a secret; but the ransom is paid, the sacrifice is 
    offered for you to lay hold on and be accepted by. And that is the voice of 
    the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, The sinner's bestirring himself for acceptance 
    with God. There is a way to acceptance, but the sinner must take that way, 
    else he will not get acceptance. He cannot sit still careless, and be 
    accepted: he must be where he is not yet, that is, in Christ; otherwise he 
    can have no acceptance. The sinner's bestirring himself in this matter, 
    takes in these three things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A conviction of unacceptableness to God, John 16:8. 
    Men must be convinced of their being unacceptable to God, before they will 
    come to Christ. It is their not seeing their own loathsomeness, that makes 
    them slight the sacrifice of sweet savor; and think to be accepted of God, 
    while yet they are not in Christ. And for that cause it is needful they get 
    a sight of God's holiness and their own vileness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A weighty concern and uneasiness about it. They must 
    not go on to be easy, whether they be accepted of God or not. As long as a 
    man can live contented without it, he will never be accepted. But the soul 
    shall be brought to that, that all shall be sapless with out it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Anxiety of heart for it, Acts 2:37. There must be 
    earnest; longings to be accepted of him, yes the soul must be brought to 
    esteem and so prize it, as to be content with it upon any terms, Acts 9:6. 
    Not as if these were required to qualify us for acceptance with God; but 
    that without them we will never come into Christ to be accepted in him.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The next general head is to consider the nature of a 
    sinner's acceptance with God; and this I shall do, 1. In itself, and 2. In 
    its effects and consequents.</p>
<p align="justify">FIRST, I shall consider the nature of a sinner's 
    acceptance with God in itself. And in itself it is a great and unspeakable 
    benefit, and implies these following things.</p>
<p align="justify">First, In general, it implies an acceptance of the sinner 
    with God, as a righteous person. A righteous God cannot accept a son of 
    Adam, but as righteous, that is, as being really righteous before him. And 
    so a believer in Christ indeed is, and by faith pleading Christ's 
    righteousness for his righteousness in the sight of God, he is accepted 
    accordingly. The Lord reputes, accounts, and accepts him into favor as a 
    righteous person, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Romans 4:6, and 5:19. So it stands in 
    two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God's owning and sustaining a righteousness upon the 
    believer, as answering the demands of the law fully, Romans 3:22, and 
    holding him a righteous person thereupon. The sinner standing before him in 
    the Beloved, pleading the Mediator's righteousness, the plea is sustained, 
    and God says, "Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a 
    ransom," Job 33:24. The law gives in its demands against him, of holiness of 
    nature, righteousness of life, and satisfaction for sin. And it is found 
    that all these demands are satisfied, and that the righteousness upon him 
    fully answers them all, that the law has no more to crave. And so in the 
    very eye of the law, he is through grace held righteous.</p>
<p align="justify">2. On the account of that righteousness he is accepted 
    into favor with God, Romans 3:24, 25. It was the sinner's unrighteousness 
    that cast him out of God's favor, and held him out of it. Now that bar is 
    taken away, and the righteousness upon him procures the favor of a righteous 
    God, who loves righteousness. God is perfectly pleased with that 
    righteousness, as much as he ever was displeased with the party's sin; and 
    he is so well pleased with it, that notwithstanding of all the sins the 
    party ever committed, he accepts him into favor for its sake.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, More particularly, it implies,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The ceasing of wrath against the soul, Hosea 14:4. The 
    wrath of God no more abides on the accepted person; that cloud clears. And 
    it clears so, that that shower shall never come on again, nor one drop of 
    it, of revenging wrath, forever and ever, Isaiah 54:9. The small rain of 
    fatherly anger may come on him for his after-miscarriages; but the great 
    rain of his revenging wrath shall never return, Canticles 2:10, 11.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The curse is removed, Galatians 3:13. That is the 
    sentence of the broken law, that lay on the sinner binding him over to 
    revenging wrath; which seized all mankind in Adam, and which is fortified 
    daily by actual sin, while the sinner is out of Christ. But being accepted 
    in Christ, that is taken away, Romans 8:1. The sentence is reversed, verse 
    33, 34, the cursed sinner is loosed from that dreadful stake to which he was 
    tied as the mark for the arrows of God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He is fully pardoned, Isaiah 43:25. The accepted 
    sinner gets the King of heaven's pardon, under his great seal; whereby his 
    guilt of eternal wrath is forever removed, as if he had never sinned. God 
    takes the pen, dips it in the blood of the Beloved, and blots out his whole 
    accounts. All his past and present sins are formally pardoned, and all his 
    sins to come are secured not to be imputed to him, for guilt of revenging 
    wrath, Romans 4:6–8.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He is reconciled to God, Romans 5:1. The Lord lays 
    down the legal enmity he bore against that person, never to take it up 
    again; and he gives him peace through the Beloved, Ephesians 2:14. So that 
    though all the world should be at red war with him, he has a firm peace with 
    Heaven, that he needs fear no hostilities from that quarter again forever; 
    which is enough to settle the heart amidst all troubles, Philippians 4:7.</p>
<p align="justify">5. God is pleased with him, Hebrews 11:5. Still they are 
    sinners indeed, and God can never be pleased with their sins; but their sins 
    hinder not that he be pleased with their persons in Christ. The prodigal son 
    returns to his father in rags, poverty, and want, with not a shoe on his 
    foot; the father is not pleased with the rags on his son, but natural 
    affection embraces him notwithstanding of his rags, he being his own son. So 
    God embraces the sinner in the Beloved, because he is in him.</p>
<p align="justify">6. He is highly pleased with him, Isaiah 42:21. He is as 
    much pleased with the believer's person, as ever he was displeased with him. 
    He is pleased with him, as one is with his jewels, Malachi 3:17; as if he 
    saw no sin in them, Numbers 23:21; as if there were no spot on them, 
    Canticles 4:7 In a word, he is infinitely pleased with them, and can never 
    cease to be so. For the only ground of his being pleased with them, is the 
    Beloved in whom they are, his righteousness which is upon them; and he is 
    infinitely pleased with the Beloved and his righteousness, and they are not 
    liable to any alteration, John 17:21. Indeed, if their acceptance depended 
    on what is wrought by them, or in them, it could not be so; but it is not 
    set in such a slippery foundation. He is displeased with their sins, and 
    they may smart for them; but the pleasedness with their persons in Christ is 
    not alterable, Colossians 2:10.</p>
<p align="justify">7. He admits them into communion with him, 1 John 1:3. 
    The person is let into the inner court, into the chambers of the King, 
    Canticles 1:4. The Lord treats him as a friend, and not as a mere servant, 
    John 15:16. They are now agreed, and so walk together; and not only agreed, 
    but received into special favor; and are made God's favorites, courtiers of 
    Heaven in the Beloved, in the court kept below, Isaiah 57:15. He dwells and 
    walks in them, 2 Corinthians 6:16; and they dwell in him; 1 John 4:15; Psalm 
    90:1.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lastly, God has a delight and delight in them, Isaiah 
    62:4. He looks on them in his own Son, and takes pleasure in them, as 
    covered with his righteousness. As Isaac smelling the smell of the elder 
    brother's garments on Jacob; so believers are to God a sweet savor of 
    Christ, 2 Corinthians 2:15; and therefore he delights in them, whom before 
    he loathed.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Let us consider this acceptance in its effects 
    and consequents. It is in these an unspeakable privilege. By means of it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The springs of mercy are opened to the sinner, that 
    rivers of compassion may flow towards him, Romans 5:1, etc. Many look for 
    mercy while unaccepted; but the unsatisfied law will draw a bar between all 
    saving mercy and them. But the believer being accepted, the law's mouth is 
    stopped, and mercy may flow freely.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He is adjudged to eternal life, 2 Thessalonians 1:6, 
    7; Acts 26:18. Life was promised in the first covenant, upon the fulfilling 
    of the law; now the believer being accepted of God as a righteous person, 
    for whom the law is fulfilled, is accordingly adjudged to live forever.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The channel of sanctification is cleared for him, and 
    the dominion of sin is broken in him, Romans 6:14. While the sinner is 
    unaccepted, and under the curse, communion with God is stopped, and death 
    preys on his soul; for "the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin 
    is the law," 1 Corinthians 15:56. As long as the law has a cursing and 
    condemning power over a man, sin reigns in him, like briers and thorns in 
    the cursed ground; but these being removed, sin loses its strength, and the 
    blessing coming in their room makes him fruitful. So faith sanctifies.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He is privileged with peace of conscience. Peace with 
    God makes peace within one's breast, Philippians 4:7. While one is 
    unaccepted of God, guilt lies on the conscience, which makes a foul and 
    condemning one, that will gnaw like a worm, and blast all outward peace and 
    prosperity; but being accepted, the conscience is cleansed, Hebrews 9:14, 
    and turns a good conscience, that will make one rejoice in trouble, 2 
    Corinthians 1:12.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Access to God with confidence, Ephesians 3:12; 1 John 
    3:21. God allows them whom he accepts, access to him in duties, that they 
    may come to him, as children to a father, with all their wants, complaints, 
    etc. expecting all from him that is really good for them, Job 33:24, 26. 
    They are privileged with the hearing of their prayers, communion with him in 
    word and providences, receiving, by the means of grace, light in darkness, 
    strength in weakness, health in sickness, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Acceptance of their works, Proverbs 15:8. God 
    accepting a man's person in Christ, does next accept his work, Genesis 4:4. 
    If it were never such a small work, a cup of cold water given one in name of 
    a disciple, though attended with many imperfections, yet being fruit that 
    grows on a branch engrafted into Christ, it is accepted of God, as savoring 
    of the stock.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The unstinging of afflictions and death, 1 Corinthians 
    15:55. It alters the very nature of these; afflictions are no more properly 
    penal, but correctory and medicinal, Isaiah 27:9, and death perfects the 
    cure. A bee-sting they may have, but the serpentine deadly sting is gone; 
    for the curse is removed out of their crosses, and they are blessings.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lastly, All things working for good, Romans 8:28. In a 
    state of non-acceptance, all things work for evil to a man; his prosperity 
    destroys him; the very gospel is a savor of death unto him, that he draws 
    death out of what others get life. But being accepted, the worst of things 
    tend to his profit, God being for him, nothing can be eventually against 
    him; but whether the wind blow on his back or face, it drives him to the 
    harbor.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I proceed to show the way of a sinner's acceptance 
    with God.</p>
<p align="justify">First, It is "freely." There is nothing in the sinner 
    himself to procure it, or move God to it, Romans 3:24, but as the sun shines 
    without hire on the dung-hill, so God accepts sinners of mere grace. It is 
    done freely, in that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is without respect to any work done by the sinner, 
    Titus 3:5. Grace and works are inconsistent in this matter. Men may render 
    themselves acceptable to men, by some work of theirs, that is profitable or 
    pleasant to them; but no work of ours can render us acceptable to God. It is 
    natural for men to think to gain acceptance with God, by their doing better; 
    and when they have set themselves to do and work for that end, they please 
    themselves that they are accepted. But mistake it not, that way of 
    acceptance is blocked up. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) All works of ours are excluded from our 
    justification, whereof our acceptance is a part, Romans 3:20, and faith and 
    works are opposed in that matter, verse 28; Galatians 2:16.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Our best works are attended with sinful 
    imperfections, Isaiah 64:6, and mixed with many evil works, James 3:2. So in 
    them there is ground for God's loathing and condemning us; how then can we 
    be accepted for what is in itself loathsome and condemnable?</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) We can do no good works before we be accepted, John 
    9:31; Hebrews 11:6. The tree must be good, before the fruit can be so. The 
    person out of Christ can work no works, but dead works, John 15:5, for he 
    is, while so, in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. And 
    what is all that the man can do before he believe and be accepted in Christ, 
    but a parcel of hypocritical works?</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is without respect to any good qualification or 
    disposition wrought in the sinner; Romans 4:5, "To him that works not, but 
    believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for 
    righteousness." Men may be accepted of men, if though they have done 
    nothing, they yet are well qualified for doing, or are agreeable in their 
    disposition; but that is not the way of a sinner's acceptance with God, 
    though the bias of our nature lies that way to expect it. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The way of a sinner's acceptance with God excludes 
    all boasting, Romans 3:27. And it is the design of the gospel to exclude it; 
    but if there were a respect to any good qualities in the party accepted, 
    there would be some ground for boasting.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) What good qualities can there be in the sinner 
    before he be accepted in Christ? Hebrews 11:6. It is true he, may be touched 
    with a sense of his sin, may be filled with sorrow and remorse for it, and 
    desiring to be delivered; but all these are but legal and selfish 
    dispositions, whereof not God, but self is the end. It is by union with him 
    that gracious qualities must be wrought in the soul, Acts 26:18.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When the man comes to be endued with gracious 
    qualities, as he is by that time already accepted, so if his acceptance 
    depended on them, he would come short; for still they are imperfect, having 
    a great mixture of the contrary ill qualities, that need to be covered 
    another way. And how can one expect acceptance on that, for which he needs a 
    pardon?</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, It is in Christ the sinner is accepted. It 
    implies,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The cause of a sinner's acceptance with God. It is for 
    Christ's sake; Romans 3:24, 25, "Being justified freely by his grace, 
    through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God has set forth to be 
    a atoning sacrifice , through faith in his blood, to declare his 
    righteousness for the remission of sins." And v. 19—"By the obedience of 
    one, shall many be made righteous." He is the Beloved of the Father, so 
    highly acceptable to him, that sinners are accepted for his sake, Matthew 3. 
    The acceptance of the Mediator is so full, that like the oil on Aaron's 
    head, it runs down to the skirts of his garments. He is the Mediator, that 
    brings in the sinner to the throne of grace, mediates his peace, and 
    procures his acceptance into favor with God. This is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The sole cause of the sinner's acceptance with God, 
    Romans 3:24. As in purchasing the sinner's acceptance, so in procuring it, 
    he alone is the actor. No righteousness is mixed with his, no works with his 
    works. God has an eye to none but him, and nothing but him, in accepting the 
    sinner. Some are better than others indeed, before they are accepted, but 
    both are absolutely free grace's debtors for acceptance.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The full cause, fully proportioned in its efficacy 
    to the acceptance of the worst sinners, Hebrews 7:25. As there is nothing 
    else that can procure our acceptance, so we need nothing else for that end. 
    Corrupt nature reckons it is too great a venture, to lay our acceptance with 
    God on Christ's righteousness alone; and therefore, to make sure work, 
    requires such and such works to be done, and such and such good qualities 
    the sinner is to be adorned with. But what needs wood, hay, and stubble, to 
    be laid in with the Rock for a foundation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The state of acceptableness of a sinner, wherein he 
    may, and will be, and cannot but be accepted of God; it is being in Christ, 
    united to him by faith. One must not think to be accepted for Christ's sake 
    while out of Christ; no more than the branch of one tree can partake of the 
    sap of another, while not engrafted into it; or the slayer could be safe, 
    while he was not yet got within the gates of the city of refuge. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Where there is no union with Christ, there can be no 
    communion with him; John. 15:6, "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth 
    as a branch, and is withered." Can a branch be nourished by the juice of a 
    stock with which it is not knit? Neither can a man be accepted for the sake 
    of Christ's righteousness, while he is not united to him. As it is the 
    marriage with the woman that makes her portion the man's; so it is a 
    spiritual marriage-union with Christ by faith that makes his righteousness 
    actually ours, so as to be accepted for it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ's salvation is in the event confined to his 
    body, though in the offer it is extended to all. He is the Savior of the 
    world indeed, John 4:42. But does he save all the world? No; thousands 
    perish for all that, because they do not unite with him, are not in him. He 
    is the Savior of the body, Ephesians 5:23. His body he actually saves, every 
    member thereof, and none else. He is the Savior of the world officially, of 
    his body only eventually. An ark there was provided before the universal 
    deluge, but none were saved that were not in it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The Father's good pleasure with mankind-sinners goes 
    not without him, Matthew 3. As without the verge of the city of refuge the 
    slayer could expect no protection; so without Christ there is nothing but 
    the curse, wrath, and death. God cannot accept us as righteous, while he 
    sees no righteousness on us; there can be no righteousness on us before God, 
    but as we are in Christ, shaded with his righteousness, 2 Corinthians 5:21. 
    Therefore he cannot be pleased with a sinner out of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, The covenant of peace reaches not without 
    him, Isaiah 49:8 and there is no acceptance of a sinner but in it. He was 
    the only party-contractor in it, and contracted only for his seed; and it is 
    only by faith uniting with Christ that we are actually in it. Know then that 
    the whole of your salvation lies here. You must be in Christ, or you can 
    have no saving benefit by him. For God will not accept you even for Christ's 
    sake, if you be not in him.</p>
<p align="justify">But in Christ the sinner is in a state of acceptableness 
    to God. "We take up this in these five things following—</p>
<p align="justify">1. In Christ the sinner may be accepted of God; 2 
    Corinthians 5:19, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, 
    not imputing their trespasses unto them." There God may, with safety of his 
    honor, meet with the sinner, and receive him into favor. "While the sinner 
    is out of Christ, it is inconsistent with the honor of God to accept of him; 
    where is the honor of his justice and holiness, and of his law, if that 
    should be? But the sinner being in Christ, these bars are removed, Matthew 
    22:4.</p>
<p align="justify">REASON. Christ has fully satisfied the law, in the name 
    and stead of all his, Romans 10:4. The law can demand nothing of them, but 
    what it has got of their Surety for them; so justice cannot hinder their 
    acceptance. And it has got,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Holiness of nature. It is true, it is not in them in 
    their own persons, in the eye of the law; but in Christ as a public person 
    it is; for he was born perfectly holy, brought a holy spotless human nature 
    into the world with him, which was never in the least stained, Luke 1:35; 
    Hebrews 7:26.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Righteousness of life. They cannot pretend to it in 
    their own persons; but Christ has furnished it for them; Philippians 2:8, 
    "He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death." All the ten commands 
    had their due from him. His obedience was universal, constant without 
    interruption, voluntary without constraint, and perfect without the least 
    failure in degree or measure.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Satisfaction for sin. That is quite beyond their 
    reach; but he has satisfied fully; Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us 
    from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." Death in all its 
    shapes preyed on him. The forerunners of it met him, at his entrance into 
    the world; it hung about him all his days; in end it came on him with all 
    its joint forces, carried him to the dust of death, kept him in the prison 
    of the grave, until the debt was declared to be completely paid.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In Christ the sinner will be accepted. Any, even the 
    worst of sinners shall certainly be accepted in Christ; Acts 16:31, "Believe 
    on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." Whoever shall make their 
    escape into this city of refuge shall be safe. Christ will refuse none that 
    come to him; and God will reject none that are in Christ. Let this be 
    secured, and all is safe.</p>
<p align="justify">REASON. The promise of the gospel ensures this. The truth 
    of Heaven is plighted for it, that sinners may have all encouragement to 
    come to Christ; John 3:16, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his 
    only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should not perish, but have 
    everlasting life." It is an unalterable statute, that "he who believes shall 
    be saved," Mark 16:16. The word is full of promises of this nature. See 
    Isaiah 55:1, 2. So that as Christ's satisfaction shows it is in the power of 
    a holy God, to accept sinners; the promise of the gospel ascertains it to be 
    his will.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In Christ the sinner cannot but be accepted. It is 
    impossible it should fail or miscarry; Hebrews 6:18, "That by two immutable, 
    things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong 
    consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before 
    us." Heaven and earth may pass away sooner than a sinner in Christ should 
    not be received into favor with God.</p>
<p align="justify">REASON. There is a right of a third party in this matter, 
    which it is impossible to be baulked. It is not only God and the sinner that 
    are here concerned, but the Mediator Christ appears for his interest. In the 
    covenant that passed from eternity between him and the Father, it was 
    promised him, that on condition of his fulfilling all his righteousness, 
    sinners should be accepted in him; he has fulfilled the condition, and so 
    demands it as his own right, to whom the promises were made, Titus 1:2.</p>
<p align="justify">4. That moment a sinner is in Christ, he is accepted, 
    Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in 
    Christ Jesus." No sooner does the soul come into Christ by faith, but all is 
    safe; the man is in a state of favor with God, the day is risen with him, 
    and the long and black night of the state of wrath is at an end. For then,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Heaven's offer is accepted as it was made. In the 
    gospel there is an offer of Christ and his righteousness made to the sinner, 
    Romans 1:17; and of acceptance in him, Acts 13:38. The soul by faith coming 
    to Christ, accepts the offer; so the acceptance with God offered, becomes 
    actually his.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Faith uniting the soul to Christ, upon that union 
    with him follows a communion with him in his righteousness, yes, in his 
    fullness; as in marriage there is a communion of goods, 1 John 1:3. So the 
    soul wants nothing to commend it to God for acceptance, having all in its 
    head Christ, 1 Corinthians 1:30; Colossians 2:10. The holiness and purity of 
    his birth is theirs; all the good works he did during his life are theirs; 
    and all that he suffered in life and death is theirs. All fullness being 
    united to all emptiness, the empty creature is filled, and rendered 
    accepted; the transcendent beauty of the Head casts a luster on all the 
    members.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The soul pleading Christ's righteousness, and Christ 
    interceding for the soul on that ground, the imputation of it, and 
    acceptance of the person upon it, must immediately ensue. Faith's plea is 
    well bottomed, and cannot be refused: Christ's intercession is always 
    effectual; so the righteousness that is theirs by faith, cannot miss to be 
    reckoned theirs, and they accepted as righteous thereon, 2 Corinthians 5:21.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, While they abide in Christ, they remain 
    accepted; so their union with him being everlasting, the acceptance of their 
    persons can never be interrupted; John 10:28, "I give unto them eternal 
    life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my 
    hand;" Romans 8:1. It continues in their adversity, as well as prosperity, 
    Job. 42:8. Their sins may bring them under heavy strokes, yet still their 
    persons are accepted in Christ, Psalm 89:30–34. It continues in death, as 
    well as in life, John 11:11, and will continue through eternity, Hebrews 
    7:25, for that righteousness of Christ put on by faith will ever continue on 
    them; their union with Christ can never be dissolved; and being in Christ, 
    they can never be but accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">I come now to the improvement of this subject.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Then the door of acceptance with God is open to all; 
    none are excluded, Isaiah 55:1, 2. What is given freely, one has access to, 
    as well as another, whatever they have been. Not that God will accept of any 
    who will continue in their sin, and will not come to Christ; but that none 
    shall be refused, who will come for acceptance in the method God has laid 
    down.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Seek then acceptance with God, that you may find favor 
    with him. This should be your main aim, 2 Corinthians 5:9. Here your 
    happiness lies in time and eternity; Psalm 30:5, "In his favor is life." The 
    favor of the world is both insufficient and uncertain; it cannot satisfy in 
    life, much less in death. God is the best friend, and the most terrible 
    enemy; for he is an everlasting friend, and an everlasting enemy too.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Seek it freely, without pretending to anything in 
    yourselves to recommend you to his acceptance or favor. Put no confidence in 
    whole or in part, in your doings, sufferings, attainments, Philippians 3:7, 
    8; otherwise you do put a bar in your own way, and will meet with that, 
    "Your money perish with yourself." Mind that this may procure your 
    rejection, and therefore not your acceptance.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Seek it through Jesus Christ only, that is, by faith 
    in him, laying the whole stress of your acceptance on his righteousness. The 
    Jews missed it, because they sought it not this way, Romans 9:32. No person 
    nor thing else can procure you the favor of God; no righteousness else will 
    cover you; nothing but the blood of the Redeemer can be a covert from 
    revenging justice; nor will anything else purge the conscience. All other 
    things will be but as a wall of dry boards between you and the consuming 
    fire.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Therefore as ever you would have acceptance or 
    favor with God, seek to be in Christ; to be united to him. For as there is 
    no acceptance with God, but for his sake; so there is no acceptance for his 
    sake, but to those that are in him, Colossians 1:27. There is salvation in 
    Christ, but none partake of it that are not in him; a righteousness in him, 
    but it covers none but the members of his body. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) This is the only way to be safe in time; for it is 
    the only way to be without the verge of wrath, John 3. And they that are 
    without it are safe, go times as they will, John 16. While the Lord is 
    threatening a rousing stroke on the generation, the only safety will be in 
    Christ, Micah 5:5; Isaiah 8:14; and 26:20.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is the only way to be safe in eternity, 
    Philippians 3:9. We must launch out of time into eternity, and there is no 
    escaping the gulf of eternal wrath, but in him. They that are not in him 
    must depart from him; and departing from him, they must go into everlasting 
    fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Question How may we then get into Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. 1. The only way to get into him is by faith, 
    Ephesians 3:17. And faith is the convinced soul's renouncing all confidence 
    in itself, and trusting on him entirely for salvation from sin and wrath, 
    upon the ground of the faithfulness of God in the promise of the gospel. 
    Hereby the soul knits with Christ, hangs on him, depends on him, wholly to 
    stand or fall, according as he shall deal with them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The only way to get that faith, is by his Spirit in 
    us, 2 Corinthians 4:13. Christ communicating his quickening Spirit unto the 
    dead soul, it believes; and believing is united to Christ, and accepted in 
    him. Wherefore breathe, pant, and long for the Spirit of Christ, Luke 11:13.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now drop a word very briefly to the last 
    doctrine, and so conclude this subject.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. III.. Glorious free grace shines forth in the 
    acceptance of sinners in the beloved Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">We shall consider, wherein it shines there. It shines,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In his admitting a Surety to mediate for the 
    acceptance of sinners, when he might have insisted that the soul that sinned 
    should die, Romans 5:8, "God commends his love towards us, in that while we 
    were yet sinners, Christ died for us." The necks of all the elect were on 
    the block, and it was in the hand of spotless justice to reach them the 
    fatal stroke. But glorious free grace admits a surety in their room.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He provided the Surety, John 3:16; as he did the ram 
    to come instead of Isaac lying bound on the altar. All the beasts of the 
    field could not have afforded a sacrifice sufficient for the sinner's 
    acceptance; nor the angels in Heaven a cautioner; but glorious grace gave 
    God's own Son; Psalm 89:19, "I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I 
    have exalted one chosen out of the people." So the righteousness is the 
    righteousness of God, not only of one who is God, but provided by God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He demands nothing of us, to render us acceptable in 
    whole or in part; but the cause of his accepting sinners is wholly without 
    them; Romans 3:24, "Being justified freely by his grace, through the 
    redemption that is in Jesus Christ." To us it is in no wise, Give and get; 
    but Take and have; Romans 4:16, "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be 
    by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed." So nothing 
    in us has any hand in it, but faith, as the hand whereby it is received.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The very hand of faith whereby it is received is God's 
    free gift; Ephesians 2:8 "For by grace are you saved through faith; and that 
    not of yourselves; it is the gift of God." Philip. 1:29. That one believes 
    while another does not, is owing purely to free grace, which makes the 
    difference; giving the quickening spirit to one, that is not communicated to 
    another.</p>
<p align="justify">5. In its breaking over all impediments lying in its way, 
    such as these in the case of the Corinthians, to whom the apostle says, 
    "Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be 
    not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor 
    effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor 
    covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the 
    kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are 
    sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the 
    Spirit of our God," 1 Corinthians 6:9–11. In the best of sinners, there is 
    that loathsomeness and unworthiness found, that proclaims a glory of grace 
    in their acceptance; Jeremiah 3:19, "I said, How shall I put you among the 
    children?" But in the worst of them there is nothing found but what glorious 
    grace will break over, to accept them in Christ, as in Manasseh, Mary 
    Magdalene, Paul, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In the thoroughness of the acceptance; Isaiah 1:18, 
    "Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord; though your sins be as 
    scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, 
    they shall be as wool." Acceptance among men is often cold, and by halves, 
    so as the heart is not freely toward the pardoned offender. But God's 
    acceptance of sinners in Christ is perfect the first moment; they are 
    perfectly beloved in him, John 17:21.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, In the perpetuity and constancy of it; sinners 
    are so accepted in Christ that they shall never be cast out of God's favor 
    again; John 10:28, 29, "And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall 
    never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which 
    gave them me is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my 
    Father's hand." They are not put on their good behavior as to the acceptance 
    of their persons with God, but it is secured unalterably in Christ. The 
    smiles and frowns of a Father will indeed be as they carry.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Let us loath Popery then, as the smoke of the 
    bottomless pit darkening the glory of grace in the acceptance of sinners, by 
    their merit of works, and other corrupt doctrines and practices, laying 
    another foundation than Christ. It is evident we are in danger of it, and it 
    will he our wisdom to be on our guard, that we be not caught napping, come 
    what will.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let all be encouraged to come to God through Christ 
    for acceptance, assuring themselves they may have it through him, God being 
    well pleased with him, and with every one who believes in him for life, 
    pardon and acceptance.</p>
