    Exodus 24:11, "And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his 
    hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink."</p>
<p align="justify">THE Lord is calling us to come up to him into the mount 
    of solemn ordinances; and though there be some who will abide at the foot of 
    the hill, unconcerned and stupid, like Abraham's servant and the donkey, I 
    hope there are others who will desire to go forward, though it is likely 
    there may be a struggle between hope and fear about their entertainment 
    there. How are your hearts affected upon this awful approach? are they 
    saying within you, as these Greeks, "We would see Jesus?" Or, as the 
    prodigal Jew, Luke 15:17, "We perish with hunger." And at the same time with 
    the men of Bethshemesh, 1. Samuel 6:19, "Who is able to stand before this 
    holy Lord God?" Our text gives you encouragement from this instance of the 
    nobles of Israel. Upon God's call they came up to the mount; and (which 
    divides the text into two parts), first, They were safe: "And upon the 
    nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand;" Secondly, They were 
    kindly entertained: "Also they saw God, and did eat and drink."—We shall 
    attend to these separately.</p>
<p align="justify">The first part is, they were safe in their approach. 
    Moses remarks this, to the praise of the divine clemency in a Mediator, 
    through whom sinners may see God, and not die. Sin has set man at such a 
    distance from God, and put his body into such a weak and moldering 
    condition, that consciousness of guilt and a sight of the divine glory 
    meeting together, is more than enough to exanimate and make him faint away, 
    to break to pieces the corrupt earthen pitcher the soul dwells in. Hence it 
    was a common opinion, that such a sight was deadly.—Consider here,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The parties whose safety is particularly remarked, the 
    nobles of the children of Israel. Some reckon Nadab and Abihu among these; 
    but if so, why not Moses and Aaron? It is plain they were all there, verse 
    9, and 10. I think, however, it is only the seventy elders who are meant; 
    and therefore it is expressed emphatically in the Hebrew, intimating, that 
    not only was Moses, the typical Mediator, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, who 
    were designed to be priests, preserved; but even the elders, the 
    representatives of the people, these also were safe.—You will accordingly 
    observe, that the people are as welcome to the divine favor, and to gracious 
    manifestations of God, as ministers. The' ministers be employed to open the 
    doors of the temple, the people stand as fair for a sight of the glory 
    within as they do. Though Moses, etc. went up foremost to the mount; yet no 
    man should either value himself before the Lord, or be discouraged upon the 
    character which he bears. Ordinarily, people will pray that ministers may be 
    helped in their public ministrations, to preach, etc; but they should even 
    also be concerned, that they may be helped to believe, taste, feel, and 
    feed, with the rest of the children.</p>
<p align="justify">They were nobles, great men, rulers of the people; yet 
    they went up to the mount with Aaron, and sat down to the sacred feast 
    there, after they had taken the national covenant of Israel with the rest of 
    the people, verse 8, 9.—You will thence observe, that it is the honor of the 
    nobles of a land to see God, and to be seen upon the mount with God, at the 
    sacred feast, as covenanters with him. This was some time the honor of 
    Scotland's nobility and gentry; they were forward in the national covenant 
    with God; and we have heard the days have been, when scarlet-cloaks and 
    velvet-hoods bare great bulk in such meetings as this. But, ah! how is our 
    gold become dross! they leave these things now mostly to the common people, 
    with contempt of both. What wonder is it that they have been left to make 
    themselves the tail, and not the head! to row us into deep waters, where the 
    state is sunk, and the church is broken: to turn Babel-builders, so that for 
    once the scaffolding is broken, and the builders, with many others, heavily 
    crushed. For, "these that honor God, he will honor; but they that despise 
    him, shall be lightly esteemed."</p>
<p align="justify">There were seventy of these nobles, the number of the 
    children of Israel when they went down to Egypt, and so a fit number to 
    represent the body of the people, who were now solemnly taken into covenant 
    with God. God saw it not meet to give this sight of the divine glory to the 
    multitude, and to set all down to the sacred feast on the mount; but, since 
    it was covenant-entertainment, the seventy were brought to it, as the 
    representatives of the people. Thus also the New-Testament church is 
    represented by twenty-four elders about the throne, Revelation 4:4—From this 
    you may learn, that safe communion and fellowship with God is the privilege 
    of the church of believers, the Israelites indeed.—That all the people of 
    God have not alike nearness of access to God; some come farther forward than 
    others. Peter, James, and John, were taken up to the mount of 
    transfiguration, and not the rest of the apostles.—That it is a mercy to 
    have an interest in, and relation to, these who are brought near to God, 
    especially such as will act for us in the mount with God. There may be some 
    young ones here, whose fathers or mothers are to approach the table of the 
    Lord. I would advise them to tell them to mind them there. Say, "I cannot 
    go, but, O! give up my name to Christ, consent you in my name to the 
    covenant, and tell your covenanted God, I am also content to be his." Or, if 
    you have not father or mother, tell any other godly person you know. And so 
    may one distressed Christian do with another: Song 5:8. "I charge you, O 
    daughters of Jerusalem! if you find my Beloved, that you tell him that I am 
    sick of love."—We may observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) How their safety is expressed: "He laid not his hand 
    upon them," that is, did not hurt or destroy them, Genesis 37:22. Though 
    they saw God, (verse 10.) yet they died not, their lives were preserved. 
    This imports, that he might in point of justice have laid his hand on them. 
    They were sinful creatures; and though they were on the mount of God, yet 
    they had a sinful nature with them, which did leave the marks of it even 
    upon what they did there. But he overlooked their weakness, and in mercy 
    spared them. This instructs us, that when we are at our best, if God should 
    mark our iniquity, we could not stand before him. We are ever in mercy's 
    debt, and cannot be one moment safe without being under the covert of blood. 
    Even in Heaven, it is under that canopy the saints will feast forever, 
    Hebrews 7:25.—It also imports, that the weight of his hand would have 
    crushed them. If he had but laid it on them, it would have done their 
    business. If he had but put forth his hand and touched them in wrath, they 
    would have gone like a moth with a touch of the hand.—From this we may learn 
    the utter weakness and nothingness of the creature before the Lord. He can 
    touch it to destruction, and can frown it back, when he will, into the womb 
    of nothing. Why, then, should we strive with our Maker?—More particularly, 
    that the greatest of men are nothing before the great God; Upon the nobles 
    he laid not his hand. Though they caused terror to their inferior 
    fellow-creatures, they were as unable to bear the terror of God as the 
    basest in the camp of Israel. All flesh is alike before God.—You will 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) How they came to be safe. The word nobles signifies 
    select, separate ones, who had been set apart. They were selected out of the 
    covenanted body of the people, to come up into the mount to the Lord, at his 
    call. Moses gets an order for so many to come up with him, verse 1. Having 
    that order, he first proposes a covenant to the people, and they declare 
    their acceptance, verse 3; then he writes the words of the covenant, and the 
    covenant is most solemnly entered into, ratified, and sealed; there is an 
    altar built to represent God in Christ, verse 4, and twelve pillars to 
    represent the twelve tribes. Thus these were the parties. Sacrifices were 
    offered, verse 5, showing the covenant to be founded on the blood of a 
    Mediator. The half of the blood was sprinkled on the altar, verse 6, showing 
    it was not an absolute God with whom they were to covenant, but a God atoned 
    by the blood of a crucified Savior. Then he read the book of the covenant; 
    thus proposing it to the people; and their second thoughts are as their 
    first, they solemnly consent to it, verse 7; and he sprinkles the rest of 
    the blood on them, and so it was sealed and ratified. Then, after all this, 
    he and these selected elders go up to the mount, in obedience to the call 
    formerly given; and there they saw God, and were safe notwithstanding. Thus, 
    their separation was their security. From which you may observe, That there 
    is safety in following God's call, be the calling never so high. Had any of 
    the people attempted to have gone where they went, they had smarted for it; 
    but being called, they were safe. Some, who measure reverence of God more by 
    their own carnal wisdom than by God's word, cry out on us for not kneeling, 
    but sitting, at the Lord's table. But though sitting be a gesture of more 
    familiarity than kneeling, yet seeing it is instituted, we may expect more 
    safety in it than in their kneeling, which at the Lord's table, wants both 
    precept and example,—We now come to the</p>
<p align="justify">Second part of the verse. They were kindly entertained in 
    their approach: Also (or but) they saw God, and did eat and drink.—Here 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A glorious sight which they got.—Where consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The object, God more largely expressed, verse 10, 
    "The God of Israel." Not any visible resemblance of the divine nature, but 
    some glorious appearance and token of God's special presence. Our Lord Jesus 
    Christ was known to the Old Testament church by this name, the God of 
    Israel. And that this was the Son of God, seems very plain from that word, 
    verse 1, "He said, Come up unto the Lord." Compare ch. 23:20–23, with Exodus 
    3:2–8. Now, he who sends is the Father, and it is the same who speaks here; 
    and he speaks of another person, who also is the Lord. And, seeing we read 
    of his feet, verse 10, he seems to have appeared in a glorious human shape, 
    as a pledge of his future incarnation. This, then was a most glorious sight 
    of Jesus Christ. Nothing is here described but what was under his feet; 
    though the text seems to intimate they saw more, an inconceivable glory 
    which mortals cannot make words of.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The act, "they saw." This seeing imports something 
    more than in verse 10, for it is evident that the first part of the verse 
    relates to that seeing, verse 10. And so the sense requires something more 
    to be in this. Accordingly, they are different words in the original; this 
    here signifies to contemplate and fixedly behold; from it our word gaze 
    seems to be derived. It might be read, "They beheld God;" importing, not a 
    transient glance, but a fixed view: John 1:14, "And the word was made flesh, 
    and dwelt among us; and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the 
    only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth;" which is still more 
    admirable condescension, and accordingly it is emphatically expressed.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, consider this as following upon the solemn 
    transaction of the covenant made by sacrifice.—It holds out to us,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That the great end of the covenant, next to the 
    divine glory, is the happiness of the covenanters in seeing and enjoying 
    God. There it is completed. And beyond this the creature cannot go.—(2.) 
    That not the sight of an absolute God, but of a God in Christ, is the 
    covenanters happiness. None can see God in mercy but they, for there is no 
    other way but that of the covenant; and their happy sight is no thing other 
    than a sight of God in Christ. In Christ, all the lines of our hope meet for 
    time and eternity. Observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A blessed feast of which they were partakers: "They 
    did eat and drink."—Here consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) What they did, "they did eat and drink" upon the 
    mount. They feasted upon the remains of the sacrifices of the 
    peace-offerings, verse 5. And this in token of their hearty satisfaction 
    with the covenant now made, their ready acceptance of the benefits of it, 
    and their communion with God in pursuance of it. Thus the believers feeding 
    on Christ and gospel-dainties is expressed in scripture: Psalm 22:25, 26, 
    "My praise shall be of you in the great congregation; I will pay my vows 
    before them that fear him; the meek shall eat, and be satisfied." Thus they 
    were admitted to a holy familiarity with God, to eat and drink in his 
    presence: "They saw him, and they did eat and drink."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) How they did it, with holy joy and comfort. This is 
    implied in the connection, or opposition between the parts of the text. They 
    were so far from being slain with the sight, that they were not faithlessly 
    frightened at it; but with a holy composure of spirit, they did eat and 
    drink. What they saw was not like a cloudy sky to damp them, but as a clear 
    one to refresh them. Holy reverence is necessary, but faithless fears in 
    solemn approaches to God, are displeasing to him, and hurtful to our own 
    souls, for they hinder us from eating. Happy they who can believe and 
    fear.—From this subject, we may take the following DOCTRINES, namely,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. That a sight of God in Christ, and a holy 
    familiarity with him, with all safety, is the privilege of God's 
    covenant-people, especially in these solemn approaches to which he calls 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That it is a wonder of grace that sinful creatures, 
    in their solemn approaches to God, see God, and are familiar with him, and 
    yet come off safe.</p>
<p align="justify">We begin with</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. That a sight of God in Christ, and a holy 
    familiarity with him, with all safety, is the privilege of God's 
    covenant-people, especially in these solemn approaches to which he calls 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this doctrine, we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is that sight of God in Christ, which is the 
    privilege of his people in their solemn approaches to him.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What is that holy familiarity which is their 
    privilege in their solemn approaches to him. And then,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Improve the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is that sight of God in Christ, which is 
    the privilege of his people in their solemn approaches to him.—There is a 
    twofold solemn approach of God's people to him.—There is a right approach,</p>
<p align="justify">1. When God calls them up to the mount of myrrh, where 
    our Lord abides until the day break, Song 4:6; when he calls them to come up 
    to the hill of God in Immanuel's land, where stands the King's palace, 
    namely Heaven. This call comes to the believing soul at death. Then, as 
    Revelation 4:1, there is a door opened in Heaven to the heaven-born soul, 
    which is now, as it were, wrestling in a mire of corrupt flesh and blood in 
    the body, and the voice is heard, Come up hither. This will be a solemn 
    approach when the soul of the meanest believer shall go up thither, attended 
    with a company of holy angels, and, like Lazarus, be carried by them into 
    Abraham's bosom, Luke 16:22.—It will come to both souls and bodies of 
    believers at the last day: Psalm 50:5, "Gather my saints together unto me; 
    those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice." And then God's 
    covenant-people, who dwell in the dust, shall awake from their sleep, come 
    out of the lowly darksome house of the grave, and enter into the King's 
    palace, Psalm 65.—Then they shall see God in Christ to the completing their 
    happiness forever. Then they shall be like him, for they shall see him as he 
    is. 1 John 3:2. We know little now of this sight in glory, 1 Corinthians 2, 
    9; but it vastly transcends all sights got of him here.—There it will be 
    immediate, they shall see him face to face, 1 Corinthians 13:12.—Perfectly 
    transforming, 1 John 1:2.—Everlasting, without interruption, without 
    intermission. They shall be ever with the Lord. But on this we insist not. 
    There is a right approach,</p>
<p align="justify">2. When God calls them to come up to the mount of 
    ordinances, to meet him at the sacred feast, as the nobles of Israel in the 
    text, and as we at this time are called, to feast on the great sacrifice in 
    the sacrament. This is a solemn approach. Now, what is the sight of God in 
    Christ which is the privilege here? As to this we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That it is a believing sight of God in their nature, 
    John 1:14, (above). The nobles saw the Son of God in human shape, with their 
    bodily eyes. But the great design of it was to show the privilege of the 
    saints by faith. O glorious sight! to see God in our nature, the divine 
    nature, in the person of the Son, united to our nature? O high privilege! to 
    sit at his table, and under the teaching of his Spirit, to spell the 
    glorious name Immanuel, God with us. O the sweetness of every letter and 
    syllable! God the fountain of all holiness and happiness, we, the sink of 
    all sin and misery: yet God with us. The personal union, the foundation of 
    the mystical union; and so a holy God and sinful creatures are united 
    through Christ. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That it is a sight of this God in the place of his 
    special residence; on the mount to which they were invited, where he stood, 
    as it were, on a pavement of sapphire. It is their privilege to see him on 
    the mount of ordinances, at his table, the glorious place of his feet, 
    Isaiah 25:6, 7. O the high privilege of the saints! We were all born under a 
    sentence of death, to see the Lord no more in the land of the living, and 
    (as in Haman's case, Esther 7:8.) as the word goes out of the King's mouth, 
    our face is covered. Some live all their days in this case, come to 
    communion-tables, and go away in it. But the believer laying hold on the 
    covenant, Christ draws off the face-covering, and then, with open face 
    beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, they are changed into the 
    same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. They see 
    the bread, the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) It is a sight of the glory of the place of his feet, 
    verse 10. It is a promise relating to gospel-days: Isaiah 60:13, "The glory 
    of Lebanon shall come unto you, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box 
    together, to beautify the face of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of 
    my feet glorious." The ark in the temple, and gospel-ordinances in the 
    gospel-church. It is their privilege to see a glory there, where the world 
    see none; to see a majesty in the sacrament, a spiritual glory and heavenly 
    luster in the bread and wine at the Lord's table, as sacred symbols of the 
    body and blood of Christ, 1 Corinthians 11:29. This glory and majesty in the 
    ordinances, must be discerned by faith; and because it is beyond the stretch 
    of the natural eye, therefore carnal wisdom in Rome, and the church of 
    England, has gone about to supply its place with a great deal of external 
    pomp, that may work upon the senses, defacing the simplicity of the 
    institution. But after all, to a spiritual discerner, the external glory is 
    as far below the spiritual glory, as artificial painting would in the eyes 
    of the nobles have been below the natural clearness of the body of Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) It is a sight of God as reconciled in Christ. They 
    saw God, and did eat and drink as in the house of their friend. This is the 
    sight to be seen in the gospel-glass, 2 Corinthians 5:18–20. A refreshful 
    sight to a soul pained with the sting of guilt. Christ has died, and his 
    blood has quenched the fire of God's wrath against the sinner; so that when 
    on the mount he looks to the Lord, he sees as it were a clear sky under his 
    feet: a sure token, that the storm is blown over, that there is peace from 
    Heaven, and an offended God is reconciled to us through his own Son.</p>
<p align="justify">(5) It is a sight of God as their God. They saw the God 
    of Israel. Here lay the surpassing sweetness of their sight. Such a sight 
    got Thomas, when his faith got up above his unbelief: John 20:28, "My Lord, 
    and my God." And for this sight is the sacrament especially appointed, that 
    the child of God may say, "I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved 
    me, and gave himself for me," Galatians 2:20. The nature of the ordinance 
    leads to it, which brings the word preached in the general to every 
    believing communicant in particular: "This is my body broken for you."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is a sight of transcendent glory in him. 
    Nothing is described but what was under his feet. For, search the universe, 
    there is no person, no thing like him. Even what was under his feet, is 
    described to have been a sapphire stone. But the best things on earth are 
    not sufficient to set forth the glory even of this, and therefore it is 
    added, "as if it were the body of Heaven in his clearness." They who see 
    him, see that of which they can never see the like.</p>
<p align="justify">We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what is that holy familiarity which is the 
    privilege of God's people in their solemn approaches to him.—It is a 
    believing, holy, humble freedom before their Lord! Ephesians 3:12, "In whom 
    we have boldness and access, with confidence, by the faith of him." In the 
    sight before us, the sense of their own unworthiness, and a sight of his 
    glory, did not mar their faith, nor put them in an unbelieving frame. They 
    did eat and drink; neither did the familiarity of faith mar their holy fear, 
    or make them forget their distance: compare 5:1, where they were commanded 
    to worship afar off, which no doubt they did. I will mention some instances 
    of familiarity allowed them,</p>
<p align="justify">1. They were allowed to come forward to God, when others 
    must stand back, Isaiah 56:6, 7; when others must abide at the foot of the 
    hill, (and it is at their peril if they venture forward), believers may come 
    up to the mount, and are welcome. They have a token from the Master himself: 
    Song 5:1, "Eat, O friends! drink, yes drink abundantly, O beloved!"</p>
<p align="justify">2. They were allowed to feast on the sacrifice set before 
    them. Christ the sacrifice typically slain, and believers are allowed to 
    feast on this sacrifice, to eat his flesh and drink his blood; to make a 
    believing application of a whole Christ to their own souls for their 
    spiritual nourishment: "Take, eat, this is my body, broken for you." You 
    know what it is to feed your eyes on some pleasant object that is your own. 
    The covetous man can feed his eyes on his bags of money. So believers are 
    allowed to feed their eyes on Christ; beholding, and delighting in Christ; 
    solacing themselves with his sweetness, and the sweetness of every part of 
    the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They were allowed to converse with God freely, as one 
    at the table of his friend. The peace being made by accepting of the 
    covenant, the nobles were, and all believers are, set down to the feast in 
    token of their communion with him: 1 John 1:3, "And truly our fellowship is 
    with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ." The believer has liberty to 
    tell the Lord all his mind, Ephesians 3:12, (quoted above); to unbosom 
    himself to a gracious God, and point particularly at what he would have, 
    what he would be quit of. "What is your petition?" says the King at the 
    feast.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They were allowed to be in his secrets, to see what 
    others have no access to. They saw God. Believers are allowed to see the 
    glory of his person, John 1:14, (above.) The glory of his covenant: Psalm 
    25:14, "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show 
    them his covenant."—The glory of his redeeming, his everlasting love to 
    them: Jeremiah 31:3, "I have loved you with an everlasting love."—The hidden 
    glory of his word; Luke 24:32, "And they said one to another, Did not our 
    hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he 
    opened to us the scriptures?" Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They were allowed to lay all their wants on him. 
    When believers come to the mount, in his light they see light clearly, and 
    at his table they are fed. Christ says to his guests, as Judges 19:20, 
    "Peace be on you; however, let all your wants lie upon me." Psalm 55:22, 
    "Cast your burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain you." The Lord allows 
    his people to lay all their burdens upon him;—the burden of their debt, the 
    guilt of sin, he will answer for it;—the burden of the strength of sin: 
    Micah 7:19, "He will subdue our iniquities."—The burden of our duties, and 
    through-bearing in the way of God: 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is 
    sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness."—The burden 
    of afflictions, crosses, trials; Isaiah 43:2, "When you pass through the 
    waters, I will be with you," etc.—The burden of their families; Jeremiah 
    49:11, "Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let 
    your widows trust in me."—The burden of their souIs for time and for 
    eternity: Isaiah 46:4, "And even to your old age, I am he; and even to hoar 
    hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear: even I will carry and 
    will deliver you."</p>
<p align="justify">We now come,</p>
<p align="justify">III. And last place, to make some practical 
    improvement.—And as a suitable improvement, we may observe, that this 
    doctrine, like the cloudy pillar, has a dark and a bright side.—Dark to 
    those that are not in the covenant.—Bright to all God's covenanted people.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It has a dark side to all natural men, strangers to 
    the covenant, who are none of God's covenant-people.—Such are these,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Who are grossly ignorant of the doctrine of the 
    covenant. It is a promise of the covenant: John 6:45, "It is written in the 
    prophets, and they shall be all taught of God. Every man, therefore, that 
    has heard and has learned of the Father, comes to me." And therefore, such 
    as are not thus taught, are not in it. No person stumbles in the dark into 
    this covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Those who never found the intolerable weight of the 
    first covenant, the law. You cannot be in both covenants at once, Romans 
    7:4. And if you be brought into the second, you have found the yoke of the 
    first intolerable; Galatians 2:19, "For I through the law am dead to the 
    law, that I might live unto God." You have been awakened to see your natural 
    misery, and your utter inability to help yourselves by your doing or 
    suffering; to despair of salvation in any other way, but through the 
    obedience and death of a Redeemer.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Those who were never yet pleased with the frame of 
    the covenant as God made it, who in all their pretended closing with Christ, 
    have still had some secret reserves as to some beloved lust, or as to the 
    cross.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Those who are still in league with their lusts, 
    their hearts never divorced from them: "If you take me," says Christ, "let 
    these go away." If Christ get the throne, the most beloved lusts will be 
    crucified.—It has a dark side to you as long as you continue in this state. 
    It accordingly says to you,</p>
<p align="justify">If you see God at all, it will be a dreadful sight you 
    will get of him. It will be the sight of an absolute God out of Christ, 
    breathing out fury and vengeance against you. And he who is a refreshing sun 
    to others, will be a consuming fire to you. And how will you be able to 
    abide this sight? Isaiah 33:14.—It says again, Though you come to his table, 
    you cannot come in safety. You run a dreadful risk while you go thither, 
    breaking up into the mount, without a warrant from the Lord. And it is a 
    dangerous business for an unholy soul to be found in holy ground, 1 
    Corinthians 11:29.—It says also, Though you sit down at the feast, you 
    cannot taste the sweetness of it, the sap and juice of it, namely, a sight 
    of God in Christ as your own God; and a holy familiarity with him as such 
    will be denied you. For what have you to do with the covenanted-feast, who 
    are strangers to the covenant itself?—It says, lastly, If you snatch at the 
    saints' familiarity with God, you put forth your hand to that to which you 
    have no right, and go beyond God's allowance. Remember, Matthew 15:26, "It 
    is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs." And 
    therefore you can expect no other than this entertainment: Matthew 22:12, 
    "Friend, how came you in hither, not having a wedding-garment? and he was 
    speechless."—But as this text and doctrine has a dark side to those who are 
    not in the covenant,</p>
<p align="justify">2. It has a bright side to all God's covenant-people. 
    Here is your privilege, O covenanters! you who are savingly in covenant. You 
    are come into covenant, you are divorced from the law; Romans 7:4, 
    "Wherefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law by the body of 
    Christ, that you should be married to another, even to him who is risen from 
    the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God." If divorced from the 
    law, you have given it fair count and reckoning at parting, and fallen on a 
    way of payment to it; for the covenant to which you now belong was not made 
    but by sacrifice. Some are like an obstinate woman, who will not stir out of 
    her husband's house, though he should slay her; these are desperate ones. 
    Some like a foolish woman, who runs away from her husband, without suing out 
    a divorce, or reckoning with him for the wrongs done to him; these are the 
    presumptuous, whom the law will bring back from the horns of the altar. But 
    Christ's spouse, at parting with the law, acknowledged all its demands just; 
    but being sensible of utter inability to pay, goes to Christ as the great 
    cautioner, and turns it over upon him for all.—If divorced from the law, the 
    law also will be dead to you. Where one is divorced from the first husband, 
    he is as dead to her. The stream of your comfort by the law will be dried 
    up, and it will flow from Christ alone. You will rejoice in Christ Jesus, 
    and have no confidence in the flesh. You will not draw your comfort from 
    your repentance, resolutions, vows, or reformation; but from the application 
    of the blood of the covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">2. If you be come into the covenant, your league with 
    your lusts is broken. Though sin cleaves close to you, your hearts are 
    loosed from it, and turned against it, Romans 7:17. You will hate it for 
    itself, for its contrariety to the holy nature and law of your covenanted 
    God, and not for the grievous consequences of it on yourself only. It will 
    be to you as the fetters on the captive, he cannot get loose of them; but 
    well he knows they are not his choice, though they were of gold.—Your hearts 
    will be loosed from all sin, your hearts will hate it universally; Psalm 
    119:128, "I hate every false way." You will have a special eye for evil on 
    your iniquity, so that you will gladly yield the offending right eye to be 
    plucked out, and give your consent to the cutting off of the right-hand 
    idol.—In a word, you have taken Christ, not for a shelter to your sins, but 
    for a destroyer to them, 1 Corinthians 1:30. Your business with the Mediator 
    of the covenant will be as much for sanctification as justification, to 
    partake of his holiness as well as his righteousness, his Spirit as well as 
    his blood, Matthew 1:21.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, You have come into the covenant, if you have the 
    covenant's mark. The beast has his mark, and many are fond of it this day. 
    Christ has also his mark, which he sets on his covenant-people.—There is the 
    ear-mark; John 10:27, "My sheep," says he, "hear my voice, and I know them, 
    and they follow me." See also Exodus 24:7. Christ bores the ears of all that 
    are his. They are taught of God, and have taken Christ for their teacher; 
    they have a certain sense suited to discern Christ's voice from that of 
    others, agreeable to their new nature: "A stranger they will not follow." 
    They know the voice of their beloved, Song 2:8. They look to him to be 
    taught the way in which they should go; their ears are open, and their 
    hearts willing to know his will, that they may do it. They wish to have 
    shown them his truths, his ways, and ordinances, that they may cleave to 
    them, Acts 9:6.—Again, There is a fire-mark: Luke 14:26, 27, "If any man 
    come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and 
    brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 
    And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my 
    disciple." He reconciles all his to the cross; and they are content to 
    follow him at all hazards, and are fully resolved to follow the Lamb, 
    wherever he goes, Revelation 14:4; to side with him whoever side against 
    him, being determined neither to be bribed nor boasted from him. Now, this 
    doctrine has a bright side to all such, and bespeaks them as from the holy 
    mount in this manner:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Come up hither to the Lord. Rise, the master calls you 
    to the feast at his table. Come in, you blessed of the Lord, to Christ's 
    banqueting-house, why stand you without? Trample on all your doubts, whether 
    they arise from the Heaven above you, or from Hell within you, and come 
    forward to that God whose covenant you have laid hold on.</p>
<p align="justify">2. If you open your eyes, you shall get a glorious sight 
    of God in Christ. A sight which will be satisfying, and will darken all 
    created glory. Though but bread and wine appear at his table, a greater than 
    Solomon is there. Only believe; faith is the eye of the soul. Let us not 
    have occasion to challenge your hearts after this communion with that which 
    Christ said, John 11:39, "Take you away the stone."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Use a holy freedom in Christ's house, for he allows 
    you. And do not reckon yourself a stranger at his table, seeing the feast is 
    to confirm the covenant, Song 5:1. Make a believing application of all the 
    benefits of his purchase. Say first of all, Song 5:16, "This is my beloved, 
    and this is my friend;" and then conclude, that with him all is yours.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Fear not, O trembling soul! Entertain indeed a 
    profound reverence of God, but away with your faithless fears, which confuse 
    and discompose the soul on the mount with God. Remember, upon the nobles he 
    laid not his hand. Being in the covenant, you are under a covert of blood, 
    and, by virtue of it, may assuredly expect, safety.—Here some may propose 
    this question, How shall we manage that we get this sight? To which I 
    answer,</p>
<p align="justify">Be exercised to take up the covenant in a suitable 
    manner, verse 1–4. Take some time this night by yourselves, and consider the 
    covenant,—your undone state without it,—the suitableness of it to your 
    case,—the absolute necessity of being in it. Labor to understand it, and 
    examine yourselves, as to your willingness to come into it.—Solemnly enter 
    this night into the covenant, verse 3. Though you have done it before, do it 
    again, and do it with more heartiness, verse 7. Let this solemn transaction 
    with God go before your solemn approach, and do not venture to set God's 
    seal to a blank, to sit down at his table, while you have not honestly 
    accepted of his covenant.—Again, sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on your 
    souls, before you venture to go forward, verse 8. Apply Christ's blood by 
    faith to your own souls, laying the weight of all your guilt over upon it; 
    believing firmly, that it is sufficient to purge you from all sin; and in 
    this way come forward to the Lord with holy boldness, under the covert of 
    this blood.—Once more, shake off all worldly thoughts and affections: labor 
    to be in a heavenly frame; the nobles left the crowd at the foot of the 
    hill, and went up into the mount. Put off your shoes, when you come on this 
    holy ground.—Still farther, come forward under a due sense of the command of 
    God; they went up because they were called, and so must you from conscience 
    of Christ's command: "Do this in remembrance of me." Labor to have the sense 
    of this command increased upon your spirits, as necessary to produce 
    suitable obedience.—Lastly, open the eyes of faith, and look; the mouth of 
    faith and eat what is set before your soul there, a slain Savior, with all 
    his benefits. Amen.</p>
