    Providential Dispensations</font></b></p>

<p align="justify">Psalm 18:30, "As for God, his work is perfect."</p>
<p align="justify">THE Psalmist by this time had followed the Lord through 
    many a deep step, and he had endured various troubles. Here, in the text, he 
    looks back on these ways in which the Lord had led him, and gives his 
    verdict as to them: "As for God," etc. In the words there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A magnificent preface: "As for God." He stands up here 
    in his defense against an ungodly world, to justify his proceedings: "As for 
    God," I that have tried his way can speak to his commendation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. What of God he commends: His way. There is a twofold 
    way.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That wherein men walk to and with God.—Personal; 
    Christ, who is the way to the Father—Real; holiness, without which no man 
    shall see the Lord. None of these are here meant.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The way wherein God walks with men, the way of his 
    providences, his dispensations, the way he takes with men in disposing of 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The commendation is perfect; there is no flaw in that 
    way. Be his dispensations never so hard, there can be no fault really 
    observed in them by the most discerning eye; they are faultless. These words 
    afford us this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That the dispensations of providence are 
    altogether perfect and faultless, however they appear to our carnal hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">In illustration I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Take notice of some, among many, seeming faults our 
    corruptions would spy out in the dispensations of providence.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Inquire in what respects the way of God is perfect.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Confirm the point.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to take notice of some, among many, seeming 
    faults our corruptions would spy out in the dispensations of providence.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The reason of dispensations not seen. The design of 
    Providence lies oftentimes hid, and it is no easy matter to discover it: 
    "Your way is in the sea, and your path in the great waters, and your 
    footsteps are not known," Psalm 77:19. The Lord leads the man and he knows 
    not where; therefore corruption is ready to storm at this, and disdains to 
    follow the Lord, unless he will tell him what way he is going; but the fault 
    is in the eye, not in the way. Time is big with the discovery, but must go a 
    while before it is brought forth: Acts 10:17, "Now, while Peter doubted in 
    himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold the men which 
    were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood 
    before the gate." John 13:6, 7, "Then comes Jesus to Simon Peter; and Peter 
    said unto him, Lord, do you wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, 
    What I do you know not now, but you shall know hereafter." When the 
    spectacles of faith are on, no fault appears.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Providence seeming to forget the promises, and the 
    word seeming to miscarry. Then we are ready to say, as in Jeremiah 15:18, 
    "Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be 
    healed? will you be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?" 
    Abraham thought he saw this fault, and he would take a way of his own to 
    rectify it. But though the promise tarried, yet it was accomplished, for 
    Isaac, and not Ishmael, was to be his heir. Fools' haste is no speed.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Providence going cross to the promises, his works to 
    his word, pulling down with the one hand what he seemed to be building up 
    with the other. Thus it appeared, when Abraham was commanded to sacrifice 
    Isaac, Genesis 22. So also it was when God threatened to cut short the days 
    of Hezekiah, Isaiah 38:1. But there is no fault here yet; wait the end, as 
    in these instances; they are but raw travelers, who think that the way lies 
    always even forward; the way in the wilderness is often crooked.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Providence running, as it seems, quite contrary to the 
    design of it. Many times the Lord has a design on foot for the good of his 
    church and people; but a continued tract of disappointments cross it more 
    and more, until the very grave-stone seems to be laid upon it. Thus it was 
    with Joseph, when he was put into the dungeon. But what fault is there here, 
    more than when the sun sets to make it darker and darker, until day-break. 
    Stay until the dawning of the design. Oftentimes providence reads best 
    backwards: "For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his 
    servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up 
    or left," Dent. 32:36.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Providence laying aside the most likely means. But 
    where is the fault here? for if he lay aside these means; he will accomplish 
    his designs by other means, and what though they be unlikely? This stumbled 
    the world, 1 Corinthians 1:23, 24, "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the 
    Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks, foolishness: But unto them 
    which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and the 
    wisdom of God." Naaman in distress stumbled at the unlikeliness of the means 
    prescribed by the prophet for the cure of his leprosy, 2 Kings 5:11. The 
    disciples of Jesus also stumbled, and judged the death of Christ a very 
    unlikely mean of leading him and them to glory; and they had the same 
    opinion of his ascension, John 16:6, 7. Men have their own ways: they will 
    needs think that they know best what is good for them. But God knows that 
    his people are not good choosers of their own lot, and sovereignty will have 
    a latitude.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Providence falling on means quite contrary to the 
    design of it. But what the worse was the blind man that he was cured with 
    clay put upon his eyes? The Lord works healing by wounding, and comfort by 
    tears. The earthquake, the troubling of the waters, the dungeon of Joseph, 
    the den of Daniel, the whale of Jonah, yes, we know, that "all things work 
    together for good to them that love God, and are the called according to his 
    purpose," Romans 8:28.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Wicked godless men getting the sunny side of the brae, 
    walking contrary to God, and yet providence smiles, that never an ill turn 
    almost misgives in their hand. This made Asaph stammer, Psalm 73:12–14, 
    "Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in 
    riches. Truly, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in 
    innocence. For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every 
    morning." It shook Jeremiah, chapter 12:1, 2. But there is no fault in this, 
    that the sun of prosperity rises on the wicked: "For when the wicked spring 
    as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that 
    they may be destroyed forever," Psalm 92:7. The sun rose fair on Sodom that 
    very day on which it was destroyed; all Israel followed Absalom; Jonah fled 
    from the presence of the Lord; Haman finds all things going to his wish. But 
    see the end of all these things.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Astonishing strokes lighting on those that are most 
    dear to God. Ecclesiastes 8:14, "There is a vanity which is done upon the 
    earth, that there be just men, unto whom it happen according to the work of 
    the wicked." Eli's sons are slain, his daughter-in-law dies, and himself 
    breaks his neck. The two sons of Aaron die at the altar. How numerous were 
    the afflictions that came upon Job. But where is the fault here? Christ's 
    cross, to a child of God, is better than the world's crown, 2 Corinthians 
    12:9. 10.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Great afflictions meeting the Lord's people in the way 
    of duty. This was Jacob's case in many instances. He was in the way God bade 
    him go, yet he met with many trials and afflictions. It has been so also 
    with many of the Lord's people in all ages. But the Lord has his holy ends 
    in these things; he shows them that they are sinful creatures; though they 
    are in his way, tries their faith and patience, and makes way for higher 
    experiences.—I am,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show in what respects the way of God is perfect.</p>
<p align="justify">1. All the dispensations of providence are exactly 
    according to the pattern shown in the word. If you would know wherein a man 
    has exactly built a house, look to the draught given him. Meet with what we 
    will, all may be reduced to, and explained by, scripture doctrines, 
    prophecies, promises, threatenings, or examples.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are exactly suited to the necessities of his 
    people, and to the designs of them. God weighs every grain of sand which he 
    puts in our glasses; he will never put in too little, nor too much; nothing 
    wanting, nothing superfluous. Dent. 32:4, "He is the Rock, his work is 
    perfect; for all his ways are judgment; a God of truth, and without 
    iniquity; just and right is he."</p>
<p align="justify">3. In respect of the times of them. Nothing too soon 
    done, nor too late; all fall out in their proper season, determined in the 
    unchangeable council of God.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In respect of its stability. Our ways are unstable, 
    and that is a great fault; but God's ways are not so. That which is crooked 
    cannot be made straight. There will always be a crook in our lot. That is 
    sure, and we could not walk even without it.—I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Confirm the point. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the saints in their experience see this. They 
    readily and fully acknowledge it, Hosea 14:9, "Who is wise, and he shall 
    understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of 
    the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them, but the transgressors 
    shall fall therein." This is their unanimous vote when in a right mood, and 
    will be so in Heaven, when the web is out. Then will they say, "He has done 
    all things well."</p>
<p align="justify">2. That they are all the product of infinite holiness, 
    which can do nothing wrong.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That they are all directed, as well as contrived, by 
    infinite wisdom, which knows best how to frame matters.—It remains that,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I make some practical improvement, in</p>
<p align="justify">1. A use of information. Are the dispensations of 
    providence all right? Then,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) If anything be wrong with us, we may see where the 
    fault lies, not in God, but in ourselves, Job 10. The oar he rolls his 
    vessel with is in the waters of affliction, and therefore we think the oar 
    is crooked; but that is our misjudging of God.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That we should justify God in the harshest 
    dispensations, give him the glory, even when we walk on the mountains of 
    darkness. Providence will abide a look of the most piercing impartial eye. 
    But when the eye is infected, it will take up things in their wrong colors.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Of comfort to the people of God, whatever providences 
    they meet. Be they never so dark, be they never so little understood by 
    them, yet they are all right and faultless. God does not distribute favors 
    to them by guess, but by measure and weight.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Of reproof to those who censure, murmur, and quarrel 
    with the dispensations of providence. This is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) to accuse God of folly, as if he were not wise 
    enough to govern the world that he has made. O how often fall we into this, 
    as if we could have ordered better than providence has done. Murmuring will 
    step up, and correct the escapes of infinite wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Of injustice, as if he were too hard upon his 
    creatures, that deserve better at his hand. For why would people murmur at 
    their right and due?</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Of impotency, as if he could not take away our 
    crosses as easily as he brings them on, or could not make them work for our 
    good.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Of exhortation. Let all of us, especially the 
    Lord's people, be exhorted to submit and stoop to sovereignty, be our lot in 
    the world what it will. There is none want their own crosses. Every one has 
    some burden or another to bear; and if we would in truth come after Christ, 
    we are enjoined "to take up our cross, and follow him."</p>
