    Destruction</b></font></p>

    Matthew 7:13, 14, "Enter in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and 
    broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in 
    thereat. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto 
    life, and few there be that find it."</p>
<p align="justify">MEN in this life are but on their way, not in their 
    home-house, where they are to abide; and it nearly concerns all, since life 
    on the one hand, and destruction on the other, are before them, having their 
    different gates and ways leading to them, to take heed which gate, which way 
    they choose, to enter and go by. "Enter you in at the strait gate," etc.</p>
<p align="justify">The scope of these words is, to remove a great 
    stumbling-block against serious religion, that lies in the way of the world; 
    that is, the great difficulty there is in such a course of life, and the 
    very small number of those that follow it. This makes terrible havoc in the 
    world, and time after time men fall over this stumbling-block. Our Savior 
    had been preaching his sermon on the mount, wherein he gives such a view of 
    true and real religion, as could not miss to be very unacceptable to carnal 
    men. They were ready thereupon to say, These were hard sayings, few will 
    ever fall in with them; the vote of the plurality of men is against that 
    way, and points to a far easier course; and can we imagine but there is 
    safety in the trodden path, and shall we forsake it for an overgrown one? To 
    remove this, our Savior peremptorily determines the wide and beaten road, 
    wherein the throng of the world goes, to be the way to destruction; and that 
    the way to life is a very narrow one, hard to find, and hard to walk in; and 
    therefore, from the necessity there is of obtaining eternal life, and 
    escaping eternal destruction, at any rate, cost what it will, exhorts us to 
    enter in at the strait gate.</p>
<p align="justify">In the words we have two things.</p>
<p align="justify">I. An exhortation and warning how to direct our course 
    for the other world, which this world and life is but the avenue to; "Enter 
    you in at the strait gate," etc. And here we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The course pointed out to us which is the safe one, 
    "the strait gate." A gate is properly the port of a city, as Acts 12:10, or 
    of a court, as Acts 3:10, but I do not find it used for the door of a house. 
    So here it is plain there is a metaphor; and some think the metaphor is 
    double, namely,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That Heaven is here compared to a house, into which 
    a strait gate leads;</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To a city, to which is a narrow way. But if Heaven 
    is here compared to a city, Hell is so too for there is a wide gate, and a 
    broad way leading to destruction, as well as a strait gate and a narrow way 
    leading unto life. But I think it is not the scripture way to speak of Hell 
    under the notion of a city. I judge, then, the metaphor is one: that Heaven 
    is here compared to a house; as Luke 13:25, "When once the master of the 
    house is risen up," etc; as Hell also is, being held out under the notion of 
    a prison, pit, dungeon, etc; but such a house as has a court before it where 
    is the gate which they must enter by that would enter into the house. So it 
    is plain, that the "gate," the "way," and "the entering in at the gate," is 
    in this world, and in this life, Genesis 28:17. And so it is in the case of 
    Hell. Wherefore the godly, true converts, are, as it were, in the outer 
    court of Heaven; the ungodly and unregenerate in the outer court of Hell; 
    both making forward to their place.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A course hinted at which is unsafe. For speaking of 
    the strait gate, he supposes there is also a wide gate, the which also he 
    directly teaches after. So there are two gates before us, very different in 
    themselves, and leading to very different ends.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Our duty and interest with respect to these gates. It 
    is to enter in at the strait one. Here the Lord directs our choice as to 
    these gates. As soon as we begin to discern between good and evil, we begin, 
    as it were, to enter at one of these gates; and we will be sure to choose 
    the wide one as easiest, until we hear the voice of Christ, and be persuaded 
    to change our course. Satan invites to the wide one, the world throngs in at 
    it, it is most agreeable to the flesh; but our Savior bids us choose the 
    strait one, warns us to beware of the wide one. This is a shocking call and 
    warning to nature, hard to digest. Who would choose to thrust in by a strait 
    gate, where there were a broad one in which one might have full scope? 
    Therefore we have</p>
<p align="justify">II. A reason for this exhortation and warning, consisting 
    of two parts.</p>
<p align="justify">First, That though the other gate is easy, and much 
    frequented, yet it is most dangerous; and they are fools that prefer the 
    road unto destruction, to the road unto life, because the former is easier 
    than the latter; for what wisdom can there be is fondly embracing that 
    present ease, which must end in eternal agony? Here, then, our Savior points 
    out the opposite gate, the gate opposite to the strait one, that we may 
    avoid it; and he points it out, together with the way conformed thereto. The 
    gate and the way, I think, are not to be conceived as separate things, as a 
    way leading to a city, and a gate leading into a house, but as an undivided 
    space; however, the gate and the way may be distinguished; they are to be 
    conceived as making ono undivided space, for our Savior speaks of them as 
    one, "that go in thereat," or "by It," not "by them."</p>
<p align="justify">Some take the way in this metaphor for the space between 
    the two sides of the gate, at which rate the gate contains the way. But this 
    makes the gate the immediate entrance into the house, which I do not find 
    that word used for; for certainly the way lands one in the house, according 
    to the text. Besides, the mention of the way of the same nature with the 
    gate, would at this rate be superfluous; for wherever there is a wide gate, 
    there must be such a broad space; and where a strait gate, there must be 
    such a narrow space; for it is the broadness or narrowness of the space left 
    between the sides of the gate, that makes the gate broad or strait. 
    Wherefore I judge the gate and the way are to be conceived as a continuous 
    space, the one terminating in the other.</p>
<p align="justify">Some conceive the way to lead to the gate, and so to be 
    first in order. But this still makes the gate the gate of the house, or the 
    door of it, which, we have found, cannot be admitted; and our Savior himself 
    distinguishes these two, Luke 13:24, 25.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore I conceive, that, according to the order of the 
    text, the gate is before the way; so that entering in by it, wo enter into 
    the way, as one going in at the gate of an outer court, and passing through 
    it, passes on the way into the house. And thus you have the metaphor stated, 
    which is necessary for understanding the mind of the spirit in the text, as 
    to the spiritual doctrine taught thereby. Now here we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The nature of the gate opposite to that we are 
    called to enter in by, and of the way joining it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The gate is a wide one. The entrance into the way to 
    Hell is very easy. It is a room port and spacious, whereat multitudes may 
    throng in, without troubling one another. None will need to thrust through 
    here, it will admit them with all ease; for it is perfectly agreeable to the 
    flesh, to the natural inclinations. It is so wide, that people may close 
    their eyes, run at random, and not miss it; even young ones may get in at it 
    without difficulty.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The way that joins it is broad. When they are through 
    the gate, they are on a way that is a broad one, where they will get full 
    scope and elbowroom. They will not find themselves pent up there, as in a 
    narrow road. There they are not hampered in their natural inclinations, by 
    conscience, Bible, &amp; c., but get lull scope for the vanity of their mends, 
    the aversion of their wills to good, and proneness to evil, and all their 
    disorderly affections.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The use made of it. It is much frequented; "many 
    there be which go in thereat." The wideness of the gate, and breadth of the 
    way, affording so much ease to passengers, invite people to it: and it takes 
    so, that the throng of the world goes that way. There are many different 
    dispositions of carnal men, these contrary one to another; there are 
    covetous and prodigals, profane and formalists, etc., but however opposite 
    they are one to another, they meet there; and the gate and the way are so 
    wide, that there are roads therein for each of them.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, The end of it, and tendency. The end of it is 
    destruction, and to that it tends, (Gr.) leads away. However easy the gate 
    and way are, every step taken therein is a step to eternal ruin. So, however 
    inviting the beginning and progress in it be, the end of it is frightful. 
    There is a pit at the end of the broad way, which may scare men from 
    entering on it.</p>
<p align="justify">The second part of the reason is, That though the gate we 
    are called to enter in by is indeed difficult, yet it is safe, and a happy 
    one.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The nature of the gate and way joining it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The gate is strait. The entry into the way of religion 
    is difficult; it will require a great deal of resoluteness to get in by it. 
    Luke 13:24, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate." One must thrust through 
    it, cast off their burdens; they will not get in with them on their backs, 
    they must bring themselves into a narrow compass, leaving all superfluity of 
    naughtiness at the entry. The Jewish doctors speak of the gate of 
    repentance, the gate of prayer, and the gate of tears. These and the like 
    are indeed the gate we are to enter by; and they are strait.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The way joining it is narrow, (Gr.), afflicted or 
    compressed. It is like a strait shoe that presses the foot. It is not easy 
    walking in it, more than in such a shoe, or in a way where there is little 
    room for the foot. Afflictions and temptations beset it, and it leads over 
    the belly of natural inclinations; which march cannot be easy.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The unfrequentedness of it; few find it. There is 
    no difficulty to find the wide gate, it glares in the eyes of every 
    passenger; and no difficulty of entering by it. But there be few that so 
    much as find the strait gate; they seek it not; blinded with corrupt lusts, 
    they cannot take it up; and, consequently, few enter by it; either they 
    perceive it not, or if they do, the straitness of it frights them.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, and Lastly, The happy tendency and end of it, 
    notwithstanding; (Gr.) which leads into life. It is not a stepping into it, 
    but a going to it in a continued course. It leads away from the devil, the 
    world, and the flesh; and brings at length through many a weary step into 
    eternal life in Heaven. So all the hardship of the gate and way is 
    recompensed at length in the end.</p>
<p align="justify">Several doctrines are deducible from the words.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. Whoever would direct their course aright for 
    the other world, must necessarily enter in by the strait gate.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is supposed in it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Consider this strait gate.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The entering in by it.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. There are some truths supposed in this. It supposes, 
    that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. All men here are on their journey to the other world; 
    Ecclesiastes 9:10, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; 
    for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, 
    where you go." This life is but the avenue to the other life, and this world 
    but a thoroughfare to the other world; like a town lying on the road to a 
    city, which passengers go through on their journey; Ecclesiastes 1:4. 
    However men talk, none have a tack of life. The young are but on their 
    journey, even as the aged. All know what part of their way is passed, but 
    none knows what remains.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We will all get there at length one way or other, 
    without all perhaps. There is no doubt of finding a course that will carry 
    us thither; all the difficulty is in falling on and steering the right 
    course; Psalm 49:10. Many have taken journeys which they have never got to 
    the end of; many have been baulked of the end of their intended journey, 
    because they took the wrong way. But right or wrong, we will all get to the 
    other world.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a wrong course for the other world, which we 
    are in hazard of taking. It is a wrong one, as leading, though surely enough 
    to the other world, yet to the wrong part of it, the land of death and 
    destruction eternal; "for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads 
    to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat." And we are in hazard 
    of taking that road; for the natural bent of our spirits lies that way. 
    Satan is busy to decoy us into it, and the example of the throng of the 
    world has great influence.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Yet there is a right course for that world too; a way 
    to it opened, which if we can fall on, it will bring us safely to that part 
    of the other world that is the land of eternal light and life. It is true, 
    it was once blocked up; but Christ, by his obedience and death, has opened 
    it; Hebrews 10:19, 20. This should be gladly received by us, since it is of 
    such a vast moment to us.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It is possible we may fall on this right course. It is 
    true, we cannot without serious consideration, and applying ourselves 
    thereto; we will never stumble on it, nor snapper on it going at random, as 
    we may on the course of destruction; but if we will hear the voice of Christ 
    our director, and direct our course accordingly, we will not miss it; 
    Proverbs 9:4–6; Psalm 119:9.</p>
<p align="justify">6. But naturally we are off that course: we have our 
    entrance on it to make. Adam, and in him all mankind, was once upon the 
    straight road to life: but there was such a mist raised by the breath of the 
    old serpent, that he lost his way; and so we in him were led off the way; 
    Romans 5:12, "As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; 
    and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." And now in the 
    first place we are wandering on the mountains of vanity; there Christ finds 
    us as strays, and gives us direction how to direct our course, where to 
    enter, what to stand off from.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The gate we must enter by, is a strait one, not easily 
    found, hard to enter by. The course to Hell, is wide at the beginning of it, 
    strait at the end, exceeding strait; Romans 2:9, "Tribulation and anguish 
    upon every soul of man that does evil," etc. The course to Heaven is strait 
    at the first, and broad at the end; Revelation 21:7, "He who overcomes shall 
    inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son." Happy 
    they who digest the straitening at first! they are in the way to eternal 
    liberty; Romans 8:21.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lastly, There is no gate but the strait one, to enter 
    on that course by. There is no choice here, for Heaven; for however men may 
    imagine wide gates to it, the scripture acknowledges only a strait gate 
    leading to it; so that he who cannot endure to think to be abridged of his 
    liberty, or to enter in by a strait gate, must give over thoughts of life in 
    Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall consider this strait gate. And here we shall 
    show,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, What that strait gate is.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, What makes it so strait.</p>
<p align="justify">First, What is that strait gate? According to what was 
    said in the explication of the words, it is the entrance into religion, 
    whereby men become really religious; John 10:9, "I am the door; by me if any 
    man enter in, he shall be saved," etc. Hebrews 4:3, "For we which have 
    believed, do enter into rest," etc. This is conversion unto God, by faith in 
    Jesus Christ; Hosea 14:1, compared with John 14:6. Hence the "door of 
    faith;" Acts 14:27, is expounded of conversion; chapter 15:3. This is the 
    gate we must enter by. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This is the gate of the outer court of Heaven, which 
    one having entered through, he is immediately in the court of Heaven; 
    Hebrews 4:3, forfeited. And he is so in the court of it, that he cannot miss 
    it in the end; Philippians 1:6. No converts nor true believers can perish 
    more than one can pluck out of Christ's hand what he minds to hold; John 
    10:28. And therefore they are reckoned "fellow-citizens with the saints;" 
    Ephesians 2:19, making up one family with those above, chapter 3:15. For the 
    one are but within the house, the other are in the court of the house.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This is the gate by which men are set on the way to 
    Heaven, and begin their journey thitherward. They that have passed through 
    this gate are travelers to Immanuel's land, now fairly upon the road; 
    Canticles 8:5, with the smell of Heaven about them; chapter 3:6. They are 
    come out of Egypt, they have passed through the Red sea, and they are now in 
    the wilderness, in their way to the promised land.</p>
<p align="justify">3. This is the gate that looks directly to the door of 
    Heaven, and by the way lands them in it. As the wide gate looks directly to 
    Hell, and lands the passengers there, if they go forward; so the entrance 
    into real religion, by conversion, through faith, looks to Heaven, and lands 
    the passengers there.</p>
<p align="justify">4. This is the gate by which men turn their backs on the 
    wide gate and broad way; for it is just opposite to them; Hebrews 4:10. Men 
    may shift about from one way and course of life to another; but until they 
    enter this gate, they are still in the broad way to destruction; Matthew 
    18:3, where there is room enough to shift to opposite sides. But once 
    entered here, they are fairly separated from the world lying in wickedness, 
    and joined in with the family of God; 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18, and they shall 
    never mix with them again; Psalm 12:7, "You shall keep them, O Lord, you 
    shall preserve them from this generation forever."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, this gate is a strait gate. The entrance into a 
    course of ungodliness is not strait; nay, the entrance into a form of 
    godliness is not strait; men may be got in there by the gentle bow of good 
    education, like Joash; by a common easy work of the Spirit on their 
    affections by the gospel; Matthew 13:20, 21; by the current example running 
    strong that way at a time, like Simon; Acts 8:12, 13. The strictest entrance 
    into it, is by an abortive law-work, as the Israelites; Exodus 20:18, 19. 
    But even that is so wide, that it does not press the unholy heart to purity; 
    Deuteronomy 5:27, 29.</p>
<p align="justify">But the entrance into real religion by a sound 
    conversion, is a strait gate, in these respects.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is so strait that it is not easily taken up by the 
    eye; Matthew 7:14, "Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that 
    leads unto life, and few there be that find it." Most part of the world 
    never notice it, more than if there were not such a gate at all. How many 
    live joyfully year after year, never once troubling their heads with the 
    question, What conversion is? whether they be as yet converted or not? When 
    the Spirit of the Lord begins to deal with others, they mistake it for 
    melancholy fancies. Yes, many times the parties themselves do not know what 
    it is that is dealing with them, for a time, and it remains still a mystery 
    in great measure, John 3:8. Masters in Israel this day own it not; but 
    instead thereof set up the reforming of vicious habits, and applying to the 
    practice of virtue, with as little success towards reforming the generation, 
    as there is truth in the principle; though, if we had it, it would not carry 
    us beyond the length of some Pagan moralists.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is hard entering into it at all. Many seeing it at 
    a distance, are frightened from it by the straitness of it, John 6:60, 66. 
    Many entered actually, come out again, and make their escape from it, unable 
    to bear the pressure of the very first entry, like Felix, Acts 24:25, who 
    trembled at Paul's preaching, and said to him, "Go your way for this time; 
    when I have a convenient season, I will call for you." Sound conviction of 
    the sin of our life and nature, with the misery we are therefore liable to, 
    will bring a man to his knees, and straiten and press him sore; like those, 
    Acts 2:37, who "were pricked in their heart, and said, Men and brethren, 
    what shall we do?" Many a man in the entry of it comes to think, that he 
    will never get through, but that he will certainly die in his birth.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The passage through it is diffic Sometimes it is 
    shorter, sometimes longer; and often does men's want of wisdom make it 
    longer than otherwise it would be, Hosea 13:13. But short or long, it is 
    difficult for the time.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) For men cannot get the scope there, that they were 
    accustomed to have. They are abridged of their sinful liberty. Hence they 
    give many a greedy look back to the flesh-pots of Egypt; which they would 
    actually turn back to, were there not a strong hand pushing them forward, 2 
    Thessalonians 1:11.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They cannot get up their head there; but must as it 
    were creep through on their knees. There is a power from Heaven that brings 
    down the man from his former heights. The converting word to Zacchaeus was a 
    humbling word, "Come down," Luke 19:5. And if there was no mystery in these 
    words, but they only looked to his coming down from the tree, whence arose 
    that mighty change immediately wrought on him? Nay, converting work is 
    soul-humbling work, Acts 9:6; 2 Corinthians 10:4, 5. And they will never get 
    up their head, until they be through at God in Christ by faith, Acts 15:11.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They are pressed there, to the laying aside of all 
    their superfluities that they were accustomed to carry along with them, 
    James 1:21. There is no room in the gate for them, and these too. Christ 
    says, "If you take me, let these go away." Hence the wise merchant sells 
    all, and buys the pearl. It presses not only to the purging of the life of 
    some sins, but all sins, even the darling idol among the rest; and not of 
    the life only, but the heart too, Psalm 24:3, 4.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, What makes this gate, the entrance into 
    religion, so strait?</p>
<p align="justify">1. The mighty contrariety of our nature to it, Romans 
    8:7, "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the 
    law of God, neither indeed can be." Take a fish out of the water into the 
    open fields, it is restless; it pants as if it were pent up in the narrowest 
    space. There is a strong propensity in our nature to evil, and aversion to 
    God and goodness; so that much of the power of converting grace is employed 
    in making the soul willing, Psalm 110:3. And when it is made willing, it is 
    presently through the gate; the main work is done, the soul readily comes to 
    God through Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The various lusts hanging about the soul. The gate is 
    room enough for receiving the man; but it is strait and pinching to him, 
    when he comes with all these about him.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is a variety of these lusts unmortified about 
    every unrenewed man, Titus 3:3. They hang about him like a numerous family 
    to be fed, crying, Give, give. When the man comes to the gate, he finds it 
    strait, for there is an old man with him, that is to be put off, which there 
    is no access for into the house, Ephesians 4:22. But they are reluctant to 
    part.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) These lusts are of a swelling nature at all times. 
    They are the ill weeds in the ground of the corrupt heart, that wax well. He 
    brings with him wide desires, that would require much room, Habakkuk 2:5. 
    And therefore because they must be pressed until they be contracted, and 
    brought to one for all, the gate feels strait, Psalm 27:4.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They swell in a particular manner when one is 
    entering the gate; Romans 7:9, "I was alive without the law once; but when 
    the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." The law, closely applied to 
    an unrenewed heart, has an irritating power upon it; that is, lusts, that, 
    in time of security, lay dormant, awaken for their own defense, when there 
    is an attack made on them to throw them out. They lift up themselves then, 
    and move like an ant's nest stirred and disturbed; and like a furious horse, 
    that rages the more he is checked.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The keen opposition made by Satan to the soul's entry. 
    When the soul begins to entertain thoughts of turning to God, Hell is 
    alarmed, and its forces brought out to oppose with all vigor, Revelation 
    12:12. They whom he disturbed not, while his goods were in peace, are then 
    dogged with temptations, and all ours are laid to the water to row them 
    against the stream that flows from the Spirit of God to carry them into real 
    religion. Satan plies then with,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The force of the example of the multitude, Acts 
    28:22. He presses them with the odiousness of being singular in the world; 
    that if there were such danger in the broad way, it could not be so throng, 
    that with the multitude there is safety, and if it be ill with them, it will 
    be ill with many. That failing, he plies the temptation,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Of time enough after, what needs to turn to such a 
    strict course so soon? The young get, by the sleight of Hell, a fair broad 
    view of many years they have to come, wherein they may get all done at 
    leisure, in time enough; and by that means the time of youth is given up 
    with many to the broad way; the entering on religion in earnest being put 
    off, until once they be settled in the world. When that is come, then they 
    find they have another thing to care for, for that time, Luke 14:20; and it 
    is put off to old age, which most part never see. But if they do, custom in 
    sin has taken away the sense of it; and it is put off to a death-bed; and if 
    they get it, there the toss of sickness renders them incapable; or when 
    their time comes at last, the wind from Heaven rises not; so they sink in 
    the harbor, never get away to the gate. But if that will not do,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They are plied with their being too-long a-doing, 
    and that the time is past, the day of grace over; to drive them to despair 
    with Judas. Satan will run with them from one extreme to another; and from 
    defender of the secure, he will turn accuser of the awakened. He will preach 
    to them then the justice of God, to persuade them he will be inexorable; he 
    will muster up their sins before them, to render them hopeless; and show 
    them their repeated slights of Christ, to bear them in hand that they have 
    forfeited the benefit of his mediation.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, And for that cause he will dog them with 
    temptations to sin, more than ordinary, that finding corruption more strong 
    and prevalent than before, they may be brought to quit hopes of ever 
    obtaining the victory.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The enmity of the world against religion, 1 
    Corinthians 16:9, "There are many adversaries." These are set up to nip the 
    work of Heaven in the bud, and to mar any good work as it begins to appear, 
    Canticles 2:15. The carnal world is the great agent for Satan, and carries 
    on his work in this case by giving instruction causing to err, by force, or 
    by fraud, by mockeries, or by slight healing of the wounded.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The nature of the thing makes it a strait 
    gate. A law-work cannot miss to be straitening to a sinner. Conviction of 
    sin, of heart, lip, life, and nature, cannot but press sore; the spirit of 
    bondage, girding the soul with the cords of death, and the curse of the 
    broken law, makes a strait entry, Romans 8:15. And it will be a hard pull 
    for an awakened, law-condemned, and self-condemned creature, to gripe, and 
    hold the gripe of the promise of grace in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">III. We shall consider the entering in by the strait 
    gate. And here three things must be spoke to.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, What they enter into by it.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, How they enter in.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, What this entering bears.</p>
<p align="justify">First, What do they enter into by the strait gate? They 
    enter by it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Immediately into the narrow way of the practice of 
    religion, in a holy life and walk suited to the Gospel, Acts 2:41, 42. There 
    it is the strait gate sets them. How long there way may be from the gate to 
    the house, they know not; but once entered, they hold on,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In a new road, a quite new one; 2 Corinthians 5:17, 
    "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are 
    past away, behold all things are become new." They enter into a new road 
    they never traveled before, where they have a new rule to walk by, new 
    company to walk with, a new guide to follow after, a new scope and end to 
    aim at. And thus are they entered, as it were, into a new world, being no 
    more of this world, though in it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In a safe road, however unacquainted with it they 
    were before; Proverbs 1:33, "Whoever hearkens unto me, shall dwell safely, 
    and shall be quiet from fear of evil." Before they entered the strait gate, 
    they were in a most dangerous road, however easy and safe it appeared, 
    Proverbs 9:17, 18; but then they are entered into a safe one, however 
    dangerous it appears. It is covered above, that no storms of wrath can fall 
    there; and what rises from below, they will get safely through, Canticles 
    3:11.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Mediately, they enter by it into Heaven. That is the 
    house the strait gate looks to, which none can come into but by that gate; 
    and all that come in by that gate do certainly reach it at length, Matthew 
    18:3, Acts 3:19. Thus entering by the strait gate, they enter at length,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Into a roomy-house; John 14:2, "In my Father's house 
    are many mansions." How strait soever the gate is, there is no straitening 
    in the house; while they that took the wide gate, shall when they come to 
    their house, be straitened like prisoners crammed together in a pit; they 
    that enter the strait gate, shall in their house walk at liberty in white.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Into a house of all ease and fullness, Revelation 
    21:7. There will be nothing wanting there for their satisfaction. If it was 
    with much anxiety, fear, and sorrow, they got through the strait gate; yet 
    there will not be the least vestige of these things there; Revelation 21:4, 
    "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more 
    death, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are 
    passed away;" but they will, by entering the strait gate, enter into joy; 
    whereas others, by entering the wide one, shall enter into eternal anguish.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, How do they enter in by this gate? They enter 
    in by it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Coming out of themselves, Matthew 16:24. God by his 
    spirit sets fire to their nest, and brings them out there. He opens their 
    eyes in conviction, pricks them to the heart in compunction, brings them 
    down to the dust in contrition and humiliation; until he overturns the 
    foundations of the house of their former rest, and leaves them not a foot to 
    stand on. They are made to despair of salvation by themselves. Their former 
    gain is counted loss, Philippians 3:7, 8, and they are carried off their own 
    bottom, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Coming to Christ in the free promise of the Gospel by 
    faith, John 10:9. Many think this an easy step; but so far from it, that if 
    there is not an arm of omnipotence to thrust the soul forward, it will never 
    make that part of the strait gate, Isaiah 53:1. Meanwhile, the Spirit of God 
    deals with the enterer rationally; so that seeing all refuge else failed, he 
    cannot go back, but thrusts forward to Christ in the free promise, Jeremiah 
    2:22, 23, like the drowning man clevering to the rope at all adventures.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Coming unto God by Christ; Hosea 14:1, compared with 
    John 14:6. This is conversion, which true coming unto Christ always 
    terminates in; Hebrews 7:25. For man having by sin turned away from God as 
    his God, Lord, Lawgiver, and Master; the Mediator Christ was sent, to bring 
    us back to him again; 1 Peter 3:18, "For Christ also has once suffered for 
    sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God." And by faith 
    in Christ we do come back to him, to live to him, and for him; Acts 20:21. 
    This shows the faith of many in Christ to be but pretended; while by it they 
    do not return to God as their Lord and Lawgiver, to live to and for him; 
    Matthew 13:20, 21.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, What does this entering bear which we must set 
    ourselves for?</p>
<p align="justify">1. A discerning of the gate, the strait gate; Matthew 
    7:14. Many had traveled over that spot of ground called Bethel; Genesis 28., 
    who never discerned the gate of Heaven there; but Jacob saw it, verse 17. 
    So, many go up and down the world, come to ordinances, where the gate is 
    pointed out; and yet are never able to take it up. Nay, that gate is to us 
    like the well to Hagar; Genesis 21 never seen by us until the Lord open our 
    eyes. O pray, that God may discover this gate to you.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A finding of an absolute necessity of entering by it; 
    Luke 15:17. We will never enter there, while we are careless and indifferent 
    about our state in the other world; while we have the folly to think, that 
    we may get a wide gate to Heaven. This foolish imagination ruins thousands. 
    What need they straiten themselves, entering by the strait gate, while a 
    more roomy one will do as well? But you must be convinced, that the strait 
    gate, and it only, is that by which you can ever get there.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Resoluteness for a happy arrival in another world at 
    any rate; Matthew 11:12, "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the 
    violent take it by force." Until once men come to this, they will never 
    enter the strait gate; or if they do, they will never go through. The 
    enterers are all such as must be forward, cost what it will; because they 
    see they are ruined forever, if they get not forward; Luke 15:17, 18.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A contentment to forego our present ease, in order to 
    our getting safe to the other world; Matthew 26:24, "If any man will come 
    after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." This 
    life is appointed of God for our trial with hardship and labor, and the 
    place of rest for the laborers is in the other. But O how hard is it to 
    bring sinners to be content to forego their ease for the present! They hang 
    by the soft easy course until their nest be fired, and their bed of sloth be 
    strewed with thorns and briars, that there is no rest there any longer; 
    Proverbs 6:9, 10; Acts 2:37. But until once they are brought content to 
    sacrifice their ease, there is no entering.</p>
<p align="justify">5. A resolute entering into the gate; Luke 15:18. However 
    strait and uncouth it appears, they will not be frightened from it. They 
    dare no more meddle with the wide gate, considering whereto it leads. The 
    soul in this case is like the slayer fleeing to the city of refuge, who, 
    whatever difficulties be in the way, breaks through their, until he be 
    within the gates of it.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, A resolute going through it, without turning 
    back from it, as Felix did; Acts 24:25; or sticking in it as Ephraim; Hosea 
    13:13. However strait the gate is, the true enterer will thrust forward, 
    striving against all difficulties, and restless until he get forward to God 
    in Christ; Luke 13:24. For he sees, that until he be there, there is no 
    safety, however easy the blind world is.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information. This informs us, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. No body walking carelessly, inconsiderately, and at 
    all adventures, will ever get a safe arrival that way in the other world. 
    They may go to the pit that way; for sleeping or waking they go with the 
    stream, and it will carry them down; but the course to Heaven is rowing 
    against the stream, that will never do at this rate. Wherefore there is need 
    of consideration, and working out our salvation; Philippians 2:12.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They must begin well who would end well; and enter by 
    the strait gate, who would lodge forever in the roomy and spacious house 
    above. It is the narrow way that leads to life, the strait gate that enters 
    into the narrow way. To expect life then without entering by the strait 
    gate, is a vain thing; it is in effect to think that holding the course to 
    Hell in this life, we shall for all that land in Heaven at death. "But 
    (Galatians 6:7) be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, 
    that shall he also reap." An ungodly life will make a wretched end.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a necessity to bestir ourselves, lay 
    salvation to heart, and see what course we take for the other world. The 
    secure sinner must awake, lest he sleep the sleep of death; 1 Corinthians 
    15:34, "Awake to righteousness, and sin not." The careless, thoughtless 
    about eternity, must begin to look to himself, that he do not perish; 
    Proverbs 6:9, "How long will you sleep, O sluggard? when will you arise out 
    of your sleep?" There is a strait gate before us, which we will not get into 
    sleeping; and if we get not into it, and through it too, we are gone.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is an absolute necessity of conversion for every 
    one of us; for that is the strait gate we must enter by, if ever we come to 
    Heaven; Matthew 19:3, "Except you be converted, you shall not enter the 
    kingdom of Heaven." If there is not a work of converting grace wrought on 
    us, we will never get to glory. We are so totally corrupted by nature, that 
    if there is not such a change made on us as amounts to a new birth, we 
    cannot see Heaven; John 3:5, 6, "Except a man be born of water, and of the 
    Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." We are so far off the way 
    naturally, that we must be converted.</p>
<p align="justify">5. They do but deceive themselves, who imagine they are 
    in the narrow way to life, who are yet strangers to a work of conversion. 
    That is an entering into religion, without coming in by the door, but 
    climbing up some other way. And to such may that be applied; John 10:8, "He 
    who enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, 
    the same is a thief and a robber." It is lamentable, that so few appear to 
    betake themselves to the way of religion; and that among the few who do, 
    there are so many who miss or neglect the first step. Many come too easily 
    by their religion; and so fares of it, it comes to no good account in the 
    end.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Vain are their pretenses to religion, and vain 
    are their hopes of Heaven, who are so prejudiced at religions strictness, 
    that they cannot endure it, nor think of being bound up to it. What is that, 
    but to be utterly averse to the strait gate and narrow way? And where is 
    such people's religion for the present, and what hopes can they have of 
    Heaven for the future? Will the course of the world, the wide way, ever 
    bring them thither? Will men pretend to be followers of Christ, and yet be 
    loathers of religious strictness? Or will they think to be partakers of 
    Heaven, and yet not be followers of Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Reproof. It serves to reprove,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those who are unconcerned to direct their course 
    aright for the other world. And such are all they who make no inquiry for 
    the strait gate, nor trouble their heads about it. It is an evidence they 
    are not for Zion; Jeremiah 50:4, 5. It had been better for these had they 
    never heard the gospel; for at this rate they slight the warning Christ has 
    given; they neglect the gate he is pointing out to them; and they say in 
    effect, What needs all this ado about the other world, and the safe gate to 
    it?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those who keep by the wide gate, despising the strait 
    one, and hope to do well enough in the end too. Truly this is to hope that 
    the Bible will be found a fable; and all the warnings of danger to sinners, 
    mere scarecrows. Such may read their doom; Deuteronomy 29:19, 20, "And it 
    come to pass when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in 
    his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of 
    mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst; the Lord will not spare him, but 
    then the anger of the Lord, and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, 
    and all the curses that are written in this book, shall lie upon him, and 
    the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven." And in end they will 
    find it not a sound of big words, but such as will press them down forever.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Those who will neither enter themselves, nor suffer 
    others so far as they can hinder them; Matthew 23:13. There is a generation 
    of enemies to the strait gate, who do what they can to keep others from it, 
    as well as themselves, and so vent the malignity of their disposition 
    against religion. They lay all the hindrances in their way that they can; 
    take all opportunities to discourage them in any attempts that way; they lay 
    out themselves to tempt them to evil, and lead them into sin. Alas! whose 
    work is it you do, when you do so? Is it God's work, Christ's work? Surely 
    you cannot imagine that. Nay, it is Satan's work, who himself is busy at it, 
    whom you serve; and your reward will be accordingly. Particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Mockers of religions exercise, who make a jest of 
    seriousness and of serious persons. We are warned, that in the last days 
    there should be such; 2 Peter 3:3, 4, "Knowing this first, that there shall 
    come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, 
    Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all 
    things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." Observe of 
    them that they were profane; for none but those of very profane spirits will 
    dare to jest on sacred things. They are atheistic; for none that have the 
    belief of the being of a God to judge them, and of the Bible's being really 
    his word, will be a scoffer at others for regarding it. O that such would 
    consider their danger, the bands that are abiding them for their looseness; 
    Isaiah 28:22, "Be not mockers, lest your bands be made strong."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Those who being employed to direct others what 
    course to take for the other world, make no conscience of directing them to 
    the strait gate. They call to them continually, Do, do this and the other 
    duty, exercise this and the other virtue, without endeavoring to lead them 
    to Christ in the first place, and the great duty of believing in him; as if 
    men needed nothing but application or plying themselves to make them 
    Christians. But conversion to God by his Spirit is overlooked; and vital 
    union with Christ, the necessary spring of all holy obedience; John 15:5, is 
    neglected; Ephesians 2:10.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Of Exhortation. Then, as ever you would direct 
    your course aright for the other world, enter you in by the strait gate. I 
    shall branch out this in two particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">First, As ever you would direct your course aright for 
    the other world, lay aside your prejudices against religious strictness; lay 
    your account with, and peremptorily set yourselves for thrusting through the 
    strait gate into the narrow way, that so you may get to Heaven, bidding 
    farewell to the wide way of the world. This exhortation is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. For the young that are setting out in the world. I 
    would have you to set out in the mean time for the other world too; because 
    whether you do it or not, you are really going thither; and how soon you may 
    be there, you know not. And pray take heed how you direct your course at 
    that time of day; for according as you begin then, you will readily hold on 
    after; Proverbs 22:6, "Train up a child in the way that he should go; and 
    when he is old, he will not depart from it." O have a care that prejudices 
    against religious strictness get not a seat in you; but be you reconciled to 
    it, and set to it in earnest.</p>
<p align="justify">2. For the aged that are gone out into the world. I would 
    have you to set out at length for the other world also, directing your 
    course aright thither; the rather that you are far on already in the way to 
    it, and for the most part off the right way as yet. It is high time you were 
    began to change your course, lest, if you go on any longer, you harden in an 
    ill course without remedy.</p>
<p align="justify">Many are the prejudices both old and young have against 
    religious strictness, the conceited hardships of it, the singularity and 
    unfashionableness of it, and many others I shall not now stand upon. But 
    pray, let what our Savior here advances against them, serve to strike the 
    bottom out of them all; that is, the absolute necessity of it. In vain do 
    men dispute about a way to a place, and object against it as rough, etc, 
    when there is no other way to it; for in that case it is plain, they must 
    either take the way as it is, or give over thoughts of the place.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, our Lord has told us, "The gate is strait;" and I 
    would therefore have you to set yourselves for it, strait as it is; and 
    peremptorily to lay your account with enduring hardness now, in firm hope 
    that so you may safely arrive at length in the other world, where you shall 
    walk at liberty. Bid an eternal farewell then to the wide gate and way, and 
    be resolute to enter and go through the strait one.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. All prejudices you entertain against religions 
    strictness, are in favor of the corruption of your nature; and does that 
    need anything to feed and strengthen it? 2 Thessalonians 2:12. Do but 
    impartially consider any one prejudice you have against it; and you will 
    find it is in favor of someone lust or other, and that it is a screen to 
    defend it; Romans 1:18, compared with Jeremiah 2:25. It is the corrupt 
    affection biases the judgment, and sets men on palliating licentious 
    courses, and unfavorably representing religious strictness. And judge you, 
    what must be the issue of feeding the corruption of our nature which is to 
    be mortified.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All the difficulty of religious strictness arises only 
    from corruption in ourselves and others; Romans 7:14, "For we know that the 
    law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin." Religious strictness is 
    in Heaven carried to its utmost pitch; Revelation 21:27, "There shall in no 
    wise enter into it anything that defiles, neither whatever works 
    abomination, or makes a lie; but they which are written in the Lamb's book 
    of life." Yet there they are at perfect liberty; Rom 8:21. Why? because 
    corruption is purged out. Learn therefore, that any uneasiness there is in 
    religious strictness, the blame of it is not to be laid at religion's door, 
    but our own. Religious strictness grates only on,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Our own corrupt hearts; as the shoe straitens and 
    pains the sore foot, and cannot be suffered on it, though it was very easy 
    while the foot was whole; Romans 7:23, 24. Though we would think it 
    intolerable to be held any considerable time in the water, the fish are not 
    at all straitened in it; for it is agreeable to their nature; and so would 
    the way to holiness be to a holy heart. Now, a course of life grating on the 
    corruptions of our hearts, is even as necessary for our partaking of 
    Christ's eternal salvation, as Christ's course of suffering in his life and 
    death was for the purchase of it; Galatians 5:24, "They that are Christ's 
    have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A corrupt sinful world; Revelation 6:10. They cannot 
    endure it; they wonder what should carry any unto it, and they are apt to 
    reproach one for it; 1 Peter 4:4, "Wherein they think it strange that you 
    run not with them to the same excess of riot, "speaking evil of you," No 
    great wonder the hangman's voice grates on the malefactor's ears; for he 
    pronounces his doom; and so do the godly by their religious strictness 
    pronounce doom against the wicked; Hebrews 11:7. But why do we care to 
    please the world lying in wickedness, in those things that will sink them in 
    ruins? or seek to walk with them with whom we should not lodge at the 
    journey's end?</p>
<p align="justify">3. The greatest difficulty in religious strictness, is at 
    first entering into it. It is with religion as with other useful and 
    profitable courses of life, trades, or employments; the greatest hardship is 
    at the beginning; afterwards it becomes more easy through use; Matthew 
    11:29, 30. May be some's experience may contradict this; it is a good while 
    since they attempted, and it is as hard this day as then. What is the reason 
    of that? You are ay but beginning, you do not hold close to it. So it fares 
    with you as with children at school, who being every now and then kept at 
    home, learning is a constant pain to them; whereas it turns easy to them 
    that are held close to it; Proverbs 2:1–6. Therefore be peremptory, and 
    resolute, and constant; and of a truth it will be otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Whether would you choose your eternal state with the 
    religiously strict, or with the more mirthful and world-like part of 
    mankind, that walk more loosely? No doubt that will be the language of every 
    heart; Numbers 23:10, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my 
    last end be like his." Then pray live with them, and walk with them. If you 
    like their end, lay by your prejudices against their way, in which they walk 
    unto it. If you have a horror of the end of them that walk loosely, and yet 
    like their way best, you will be self-condemned. If you would go east, you 
    would not travel with the company going west.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Religious strictness is the only course in 
    which any will get to Heaven; the loose course will land men in destruction. 
    The text is very express; and makes no exception of great or small, rich or 
    poor, young or old. There is no body, but will be straitened sometime or 
    other; it is impossible that any should get always walking at liberty. 
    Choose you then, whether you will take your straitening before or after 
    death, for time or for eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">If you imagine that some were far from religious 
    strictness, that yet got to Heaven at length, consider then they were 
    brought to repentance for their neglect of it. And will you follow a 
    pattern, that those who gave it bitterly repented of? If you do, you must 
    follow it out in repentance too, else you are ruined. And is it a wise 
    course, to be laying up matter for repentance, and to stand off from a 
    course, the neglect whereof you must repent, or you perish? Pray consider 
    that repentance will be more easy now than on the brink of eternity; and it 
    will be more sure too, for it is what very rarely is reached at that time of 
    day.</p>
<p align="justify">As for some directions or helps, I offer only these two.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Set before you, in the first place, the death of 
    Christ, for your justification and reconciliation with God, deliverance from 
    the curse and eternal wrath; and by faith flee in under the covert of his 
    blood, for these effects. Without these men may reach civility, the moralist 
    his practice of virtue, the legalist a form of godliness; but no true 
    religious strictness, more than the cursed fig tree could ever bear fruit 
    after, Luke 1:74, 75.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Set before you the life of Christ in the world, as the 
    rule, the reason, and the endearment of religious strictness. Every 
    Christian should set before him the life of Christ, and often view it, for 
    it is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The rule of religious strictness, the example and 
    pattern we are to copy after, John 13:15, 1 Peter 2:21, 1 John 2:6. Here it 
    is we have the perfect draught of religious strictness. The strictest of the 
    saints have had their out-of-the-way steps; vain men have pieces of 
    strictness, which is not according to this pattern, being nothing but the 
    product of their blind and proud minds. But in the example of Christ we have 
    a perfect pattern of religious strictness; for in him we see what is the 
    sort of walk really pleasing to God, in as much as we see there how God 
    himself become man did walk. And when he has condescended to this, will we 
    not eye it?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The reason. We have the naked divine authority, 
    call, and command to religions strictness in the law. In the life of Christ 
    we have that authority enforced by his own example, obliging us the more 
    forcibly unto it. The example of superiors is an additional law, binding the 
    inferiors to conformity. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the supreme, the most high 
    God, as well as he is man; and since he was man, he was religiously strict; 
    certainly, for that very reason we should be so too.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The endearment. How forcible is that exhortation to 
    religions strictness! Ephesians 5:1, 2, "Be you therefore followers of God, 
    as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has 
    given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet 
    smelling savor." There is no such powerful remedy against prejudices at 
    religious strictness, as the believing consideration of the death of Christ. 
    Is it possible that faith's view of the death of Christ should leave us 
    indifferent to, and far more averse to the life of Christ? No, sure; 2 
    Corinthians 5:14, 15, "For the love of Christ constrains us, because we thus 
    judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for 
    all, that they which live, should not live unto themselves, but unto him 
    which died for them, and rose again." Let your consciences be sprinkled with 
    his blood, and your hearts will be knit to religions strictness. But alas! 
    it is want of faith in his death, that makes us so indifferent to the 
    imitation of him in his life of religions strictness.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, As ever you would direct your course aright for 
    the other world, be concerned, that, in the first place, you may be truly 
    converted; that you may be found converts in the first place, entering the 
    strait gate by a work of thorough conversion wrought on you.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider the necessity of conversion to God. It 
    is absolutely necessary by our Savior's declaration; Matthew 18:3, "Except 
    you be converted, you shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven;" and by 
    the nature of things too; for how is it possible they should walk with God 
    in the narrow way, who have not entered by the strait gate, being once truly 
    turned to God? This is the beginning of the Christian course, without which 
    it is impossible there should be any progress in it, or happy end thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. To think to be truly religious, without being 
    once true converts, is a vain thing, a delusion, because a contradiction. It 
    is a building on the earth without a foundation; Luke 6:49, which can tarn 
    to no good account in the end. True religion is to walk in Christ; but one 
    mast first be in him; Colossians 2:16, "As you have therefore received 
    Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him." It is to walk in newness of life, 
    but we most be new creatures first; Romans 6:4. It is to walk with God, but 
    we must first be converted to him.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. Without it all your religion will amount to no 
    more but a form of godliness destitute of the power; 2 Timothy 3:5. It will 
    be but as a body without the soul; and all your services will be but bodily 
    exercise, that will profit little. "For God is a Spirit; and they that 
    worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in truth," John 4:24. But how 
    can that be without conversion? Philippians 3:3, "For we are the 
    circumcision, which worship God in the spirit." Though the wall is fair 
    plastered, it is loose in the heart; and so makes but a fair show, like a 
    whited sepulcher.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. Lastly, The want of it is a spring of apostasy; 
    1 John 2:19, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they 
    had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went 
    out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us." How 
    many do for a time blossom fair in religion, who at length totally wither? 
    They give their names to Christ pretending to have separated from the world; 
    but afterwards they turn deserters, and get away to the enemy's camp. Why, 
    truly, if they had ever by sound conversion come out from among them, they 
    had never gone back; Psalm 12:7, "You shall keep them, O Lord, you shall 
    preserve them from this generation forever." But the axe of converting grace 
    never went to the root of the tree with them; wherefore though some branches 
    of sin were lopped off, the root of bitterness untouched, spreads again. For 
    your help here, labor to impress your hearts with concern to have a good 
    foundation laid. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Think it not enough to reform your lives, and to 
    cleanse the outward man. Remember religion is the hidden man of the heart; 1 
    Samuel 16:7. So the power of the natural enmity must be broken, and the 
    heart reconciled to the holy law, not in some, but in every point thereof 
    known to you; Hebrews 8:10, "This is the covenant that I will make with the 
    house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into 
    their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and 
    they shall be to me a people." For this only is true conversion, the heart 
    being turned back again to God; 1 Kings 18:37, in cordial reconciliation 
    with and absolute resignation to his holy will expressed in his law.</p>
<p align="justify">2. For this cause, you would study to discern the law in 
    its spirituality and vast extent, and closely apply it to your own soul's 
    state and case. Here Paul's conversion began; Romans 7:9, "I was alive 
    without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I 
    died." By this means you will be convinced of the total corruption of your 
    nature, heart, and life; what a gulf of guilt you are sunk in under the 
    curse; the which may fill you with fear, sorrow, and anxious concern what 
    course to take to be saved. Then study to discern the promise of the gospel 
    in its sufficiency and suitableness to your case; and to see Christ in it; 
    and closely apply that to your own soul. For this is it that completes 
    conversion; Hebrews 7:19, "For the law made nothing perfect, but the 
    bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near unto God." By 
    this means you will be enlightened in the knowledge of Christ, as a suitable 
    Savior, having a fullness of grace in him to be communicated for your 
    regeneration, and a fullness of merit to carry off your guilt; which will be 
    a fit means to raise in you a desire of him, and hope of remedy through him; 
    and so to draw you to him by faith, and by him unto God.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. There is a wide gate to enter by, and a 
    broad way joining it; but it leads away to destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">Here we shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The wide gate there is to enter in by.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The broad way joining the wide gate.</p>
<p align="justify">III. This way's leading away to destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Improve the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall consider the wide gate there is to enter in 
    by. Were there no other but the strait gate in the course to the other 
    world, then there would be no fear of going wrong, all behooved to go that 
    way, or not at all; and it would have been so, if there had been no part of 
    the other world but the happy one. But there is another part of that world, 
    a Hell as well as a Heaven; and so there is a gate towards the former as 
    well as the latter; and that is the wide one, which we are to beware of.</p>
<p align="justify">According to what is said of the strait, the wide gate is 
    the entrance into a course of ungodliness, whereby men become actually 
    ungodly. Thus men set their face towards Hell, and begin to move toward the 
    land of darkness; Ephesians 2:1, 2. Whensoever this entrance is made, then 
    they are on the course whose end is destruction; and it is made very early.</p>
<p align="justify">And that entrance or wide gate, is the gate of the 
    corrupt natural inclination of the heart; Proverbs 4:23; Mark 7:21–23. This 
    gate begins to open to us with the first dawnings of reason, and opens wider 
    and wider as we grow up; Genesis 8:21. Our first looks in the world are 
    asquint; we discover a cast to the wrong side, an averseness to good, and 
    proneness to evil; Romans 8:7, "The carnal mind is enmity against God." That 
    is the natural inclination of the heart, that soon shows itself in what we 
    call the innocent babe, and widens more and more through the several periods 
    of childhood, youth, and manhood; Proverbs 22:15.</p>
<p align="justify">This gate was set up by Adam's fall; Romans 5:12. He 
    breaking the first covenant, broke out this gate to destruction, to and in 
    himself and all his posterity; and mankind naturally rush in at it, not 
    considering whereto it leads. Besides this, there had never been another 
    gate to the other world, for fallen man, had not Jesus Christ by his 
    suffering, life, and death, opened it.</p>
<p align="justify">This gate is a two-leaved gate, opening wide.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, On the one hand, it opens wide toward the creature, 
    away from God; Jeremiah 2:13. That is the way the natural inclination of the 
    heart lies. When God made man he gave him a set of heart towards himself as 
    his rest and happiness; Ecclesiastes 7:29, "God made man upright:" without 
    any motion towards the creature, but in God and for God; and good reason, 
    for all the good of the creature lay there, it being otherwise but a cipher 
    signifying nothing without him; Matthew 19:17. But Satan in the first 
    temptation set up the creature separately from God, and over-against him; 
    and though so it was mere emptiness, he blew it up with wind from Hell, and 
    made it appear a rest for the heart, and cheated our first parents into a 
    choice of it for their rest; Genesis 3:6. So the first leaf was opened, and 
    has stood open to this day with mankind. And this I say,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Opens wide towards the creature, the vain and empty 
    creation; Habakkuk 2:5, compared with Proverbs 30:15, 16. As the beasts 
    incline to the earth, the birds to the air, and the fishes to the water; so 
    does fallen man to the creature. He knows no other happiness naturally, 
    desires no other, cannot understand how there can be another. He falls as 
    naturally to seek it here, as the infant to suck the breasts that bare it.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a broad leaf, opening very wide; because of the 
    boundless desires of the heart to be satisfied, the vast variety of the 
    creatures to try the experiment on, and the insufficiency and 
    unsatisfactoriness of them all; Ecclesiastes 1:2; Isaiah 55:1, 2. The wide 
    hungry heart that is without God, the wide world filled with nothing but 
    vanity and lies, makes the leaf of the natural inclination to the creature 
    very wide.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It opens a way from God; Hebrews 3:12, "Take heed, 
    brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in 
    departing from the living God." It is not possible, but that the heart 
    turning to the creature for a rest and happiness, mast turn away from God; 
    Matthew 6:24, "For no man can serve two masters." The heart of man naturally 
    contracting a friendship with the world, states and declares an enmity 
    against God; James 4:4, "Know you not that the friendship of the world is 
    enmity with God? Whoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the 
    enemy of God." And the children of men setting out in the world, while they 
    set their face thus to the creature, cast God behind their back; Ezekiel 
    23:35. They know him not, desire him not; it is a mystery to them, how the 
    enjoyment of him can make one happy; they are apt to think it is but a 
    fancy; Psalm 4:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus this natural inclination of the heart to the 
    creature is the one leaf of the wide gate. But here it is</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTED, How can the inclination of the heart to the 
    creature be accounted a leaf of the gate to Hell, when every creature of God 
    is good, and we are allowed the enjoyment of it, and an inclination towards 
    it is lawful, and in several cases expressly required?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. The creature may be considered two ways.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) By itself, separately from God.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In God and for him. The first way it is regarded as 
    a fountain and original spring to drink at for satisfaction; in the other, 
    as a stream only coming from God, and leading back to him. Now, it is not in 
    the latter, but the former respect, that we call the inclination to it a 
    leaf of the broad gate. And it is in that first respect that the heart is 
    naturally inclined to it. Upon it, separately from God, the heart naturally 
    fixes, looking for that from it, which it should only look for in God; 
    whereby it is put in the room of God. And this godless pursuit of the 
    creature, separately from God, not in him; for itself, and ourselves, not 
    for God, was never allowable, and is no other but the course of them that 
    are gone in at the wide gate; Ephesians 4:17, 18. Consider here,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The inclination to it separate from God, plainly 
    discovering itself, in either a profane neglect of him, or else a crafty 
    shifting of him, in our desires after, or enjoyment of the creature. No 
    doubt one may lawfully have an inclination towards health, wealth, 
    relations, etc. But then it should be in God; in his fear, regulated by his 
    word; but as an incast to the great bargain of his favor, not as a 
    principal. But the generality of men quite neglect him in these, Psalm 10:4, 
    while others that have some principles formed in them, craftily lay the 
    thoughts of him aside in these things, that they may not be hampered in 
    their desire or enjoyment of the creature; Jeremiah 9:6. A glaring evidence 
    of inclination to it separate from God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The inclination to it for it or ourselves, not for 
    God, discovering itself, in that there is no regard had, in the desire, or 
    enjoyment, to the honor of God to be advanced thereby, but to please 
    ourselves merely; though</p>
<p align="justify">(1 Corinthians 10:31,) "whether we eat or drink, or 
    whatever we do, we should do all to the glory of God." It is purely 
    something in the creature itself, not anything of God about it, that grounds 
    the inclination to it; and that is a piece of spiritual idolatry, and a 
    debasing of the soul, to desire any creature for itself merely.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, On the other side, it opens wide towards sin, away 
    from the holiness of God expressed in his law; Psalm 58:3, "The wicked are 
    estranged from the womb, they go astray, as soon as they be born, speaking 
    lies." When God made man, he gave him a set of heart towards holiness, 
    Ecclesiastes 7:29, so that as God himself was the rest of his heart and 
    portion, so his holy will and law was the rule of his walk. But the heart of 
    man falling out of its rest in God, unto the godless pursuit of the 
    creature, the yoke of obedience to him came to be thrown off. So the natural 
    inclination of the heart opens wide,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To sin; Jeremiah 17:9, "The heart is deceitful above 
    all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?" The taste is quite 
    vitiated; nothing relishes with men naturally but sin. As, on the one hand, 
    they go to the creature, to suck its dry breasts; so, on the other, they are 
    bent on the fulsome breasts of their corrupt lusts; Ephesians 2:3. These 
    corrupt lusts as so many brats of Hell, naturally bred in the heart, open 
    their mouths wide, crying, Give, Give; and nothing can satisfy them, but the 
    puddle waters of sin, which are agreeable to their nature.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Away from the holiness of God expressed in his law; 
    Romans 8:7. There is not only a carelessness or an indifference to holiness, 
    but an aversion to it; such as an untamed bullock has to the yoke. Hence 
    holy walking and spiritual exercises, are naturally burdensome to the 
    corrupt heart, which loves sinful liberty, and hates to be hampered by the 
    holy commandment. So that what of these the man is in a sort brought to, it 
    is but bodily exercise, the heart is not in it, Ezekiel 33:31.</p>
<p align="justify">This also is a broad leaf, opening very wide. For the 
    corruption of nature is an unfathomable gulf, that there is no filling up 
    of; the sinner may be surfeited, but never can be satiated. The way of sin, 
    as being the way of error or wandering, has no end; one evil step still 
    leading on to, and making way for another. Thus you see the wide gate, that, 
    opening to all the children of fallen Adam, they are all ready disposed to 
    inter into. Which entering is next to be noticed.</p>
<p align="justify">The entering into this wide gate is, the giving way to 
    the corrupt natural inclination of the heart; the not resisting of it, but 
    yielding unto it; Rom, 6:12, "Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that 
    you should obey it in the lusts thereof." This gate should of right be 
    closed; the bitter fountain should be stopped immediately, the weeds of 
    corruption should be nipped in the bud, and men should presently begin a war 
    with themselves in mortification of their lusts. But instead of that, they 
    soon begin to follow the corrupt natural inclination; and that in,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Giving way to the vanity of their minds; Ephesians 
    4:17. They find in them a restless heart, and they go in pursuit of that 
    rest, not to God, but to the creature. Man's mind is naturally blinded; and 
    what it points out to him for happiness and satisfaction, he pursues; the 
    heart going as the vain mind leads. Thus men are lured on. The vain mind 
    first points out a satisfaction to us in meat, then in mirthful clothing, 
    then in mirth and jollity; at length it opens as we grow up, into the wide 
    field of pleasures, profits, and honors; and here men wander as in a 
    wilderness, seeking rest, thinking to find it in this and the other vanity, 
    and still disappointed; yet after all disappointments, the vain mind still 
    has a new vanity to present unto us, and we go to it with new hopes of 
    satisfaction; Isaiah 57:10, "You are wearied in the greatness of your way; 
    yet said you not, There is no hope; you have found the life of your hand; 
    therefore you were not grieved." Now, the engaging in this pursuit is 
    entering the wide gate with a witness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Giving way to the corrupt bent of the heart towards 
    sin, and against the way of holiness; Romans 3:11, 12, "There is none that 
    understands, there is none that seeks after God. They are all gone out of 
    the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that does 
    good, no not one." Lusts begin to stir in the heart, and crave of them; and 
    instead of starving them, they begin to think of feeding and satisfying 
    them. So they break over the hedge of the divine law, and get into the 
    devil's ground, omitting their duty to God, and committing sin against him, 
    in compliance with the natural inclination. This also is a plain entering of 
    the wide gate. Now, there is a twofold entering this wide gate.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, One that is more secret and undiscerned to the party 
    himself. Thus we are all once entered into it, before ever we are aware, by 
    the early sproutings of corruption in childhood; doing sinfully and 
    corruptly before ever we begin to consider what we are doing, Psalm 58:3; 
    Proverbs 20:11. Thus we are entered into the service of sin and Satan, 
    before we begin to consider who or what they are. And where pains are not 
    taken by good education to curb these early sproutings, they grow readily 
    too strong afterwards to be held down, either by one or other; Proverbs 
    29:15, "The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left to himself brings 
    his mother to shame."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Another that is more deliberate, and of choice. 
    Thus when the children of men are come to the years of discretion, and can 
    discern between good and evil, they see on the one hand the strait gate of 
    religion, and the wide gate of sin and vanity; and having a bias and cast in 
    their nature to the wrong side, they refuse the strait gate and choose the 
    wide one as the most agreeable to them, Jeremiah 2:25. Of this there are 
    three more notable kinds.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The throwing off the bonds of good education, as 
    things with which they are hampered. Thus many set out into the broad way, 
    and land in destruction at length, Proverbs 5:11–13. Parental government is 
    the first government that God puts us under; therefore in the Proverbs 
    written to give the young knowledge the very first exhortation is; verse 8, 
    "My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of 
    your mother." How dangerous must it then be, either to throw it off before 
    God takes it off; or when he has, to throw off the impressions made thereby? 
    None of them can be, but in compliance with the corrupt natural inclination 
    to give it the swing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Casting one's self into ill company. The second 
    exhortation in the Proverbs respects that; verse 10, "My son, if sinners 
    entice you, consent you not." We are so ready to be cast into the mold of 
    the company we choose, especially if it be ill, that when one is so engaged, 
    he may be reckoned to be gone in at the wide gate. If he had no mind to go 
    with them, why would he choose their fellowship?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Apostatizing from a profession and appearance of 
    religion; when one having for some time given promising tokens of a 
    religious disposition, throws off all, and goes plainly into the way of the 
    profane world; Hebrews 10:38, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no 
    pleasure in him."</p>
<p align="justify">The snare leading to this is readily the predominant sin. 
    That makes its entrance most easily unto us, and most powerfully prevails to 
    carry us into the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall consider the broad way joining the wide 
    gate. Agreeable to what is said of the gate, the broad way joining it is the 
    way of men's own heart; Isaiah 57:17, "For the iniquity of his covetousness 
    was I wroth, and smote him: I hidden me, and was wroth and he went on 
    frowardly in the way of his heart:" Which heart being naturally a corrupt 
    heart, is the way of irreligion and ungodliness, Psalm 1:1. As soon as men 
    have entered the gate of the corrupt natural inclination, giving up 
    themselves thereto, they are on the broad way, the way of their own heart. 
    And here I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That the way of one's own heart or natural 
    inclination, is indeed the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, What are the parts of this broad way leading to 
    destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Speak of the broadness of this way.</p>
<p align="justify">First, I shall show that the way of one's own heart or 
    natural inclination, is indeed the broad way. This appears,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, From that corrupt set or bent which the hearts of 
    men have got by Adam's fall. Whatever vain men give out concerning the 
    dignity of human nature, the testimony of God concerning the heart of man is 
    quite otherwise; Jeremiah 17:9, "The heart is deceitful above all things, 
    and desperately wicked; who can know it?" Our Savior represents it as a 
    poisoned fountain, Mark 7:21, 22, and what poisoned it, was the fall of 
    Adam, Romans 5:12. The way then that it leads, must needs be the broad way 
    to destruction, and therefore "all we like sheep have gone astray; we have 
    turned every one to his own way," Isaiah 53:6. In that set,</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a bending away from God, who originally was, 
    and of right is our chief end, Psalm 14:3, Jeremiah 2:13. The heart of man 
    has not only left its rest in God, but is filled with natural enmity against 
    him, Romans 8:7; has a dislike of his nature, which is holy, and of his law, 
    which is a transcript of his holiness. There is a downright contrariety in 
    his nature against the nature of God, and in his will against the will of 
    God; Job. 21:14, "Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire 
    not the knowledge of your ways."</p>
<p align="justify">2. A bent towards the creature as the chief good, in the 
    room of God, Jeremiah 2:13. Hence the natural voice of the heart in man is, 
    "Who will show us any good?" Psalm 4:6. For Adam falling from God, betook 
    himself to the creature, to get out of it that satisfaction, which he was to 
    have had from God; and in this case he left us; and naturally we go on that 
    way, until powerfully turned to God again by grace.</p>
<p align="justify">3. An aversion to good, such as an untamed bullock has to 
    the yoke, Jeremiah 31:18. It is a pain to the natural man to admit the yoke 
    of Christ; Hosea 4:16, "Israel slides back, as a backsliding heifer." So 
    that a slavish fear of punishment, and a servile hope of reward, are the 
    main things that can move them to duty; whereas, if the heart were left to 
    its free choice, without these extrinsic motives, they would never yoke with 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A proneness to evil; Hosea 11:7, "My people are bent 
    to backsliding from me; though they called them to the Most High, none at 
    all would exalt him." The bias of the heart lies that way, so that it is the 
    very first way the children of men go; Psalm 58:3, "The wicked are estranged 
    from the womb, they go astray, as soon as they he born, speaking lies." None 
    need to teach them the way of sin; leave them to their choice, they will as 
    naturally go that way, as water will go downward, or sparks of fire upward. 
    Who then can doubt, but the way of the heart is the broad way?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, This appears from the necessity of regeneration, 
    which is absolute and universal; John 3:3, "Except a man be born again, he 
    cannot see the kingdom of Heaven." Men must be made new creatures before 
    they can do good works, Ephesians 2:10; united to Christ by faith, before 
    they can do anything to purpose; John 15:5, "Without me you can do nothing." 
    This necessity springs from the total corruption of our nature, whereby it 
    is indisposed to all good; John 3:6, "That which is born of the flesh, is 
    flesh." Whence it is evident, that the natural way of the heart is the broad 
    way; for that which is wholly corrupt, cannot act but corruptly; and that 
    nature which must be made new, before it can do good, must needs, until it 
    be renewed, be still going wrong.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Lastly, This appears from the difficulty there is 
    in the conversion of sinners unto God; Jeremiah 13:23, "Can the Ethiopian 
    change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, that 
    are accustomed to do evil." Great is that difficulty. Mercies will not do 
    it, judgments will not; the sinner will trample on the goodness of God 
    leading to repentance; he will go on in sin, though the fire of wrath is 
    flashing on his face. A preacher from the dead would not convert a sinner; 
    Luke 16:31. It is only the irresistible power of grace changing the heart 
    that will do it; Jeremiah 31:18. This speaks the natural way the heart goes 
    to be the broad way, and no other.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, We shall consider "the parts of this broad way 
    leading to destruction." It is so very broad, that we cannot enter into a 
    detail of the particular parts thereof. But in the general there are two 
    parts of it. 1. The way of vanity; and, 2. The way of vileness.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The way of vanity; Ephesians 4:17. As soon as one 
    has entered by that part of the wide gate of the natural inclination, 
    opening toward the creature, away from God, he is upon the way of vanity, a 
    broad, spacious way to destruction. He then begins a vain life, a course of 
    vanity of conversation; 1 Peter 1:18. And in this way most men, yes all, but 
    regenerate men, are going. And it is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A way that sets a man farther off from God. With the 
    prodigal, he is then on his journey into the far country; Luke 15:13. Every 
    step in this way is a step farther away; and the older he grows in it, the 
    relative distance between God and him is increased. God and the sinner part 
    at the point of original corruption; and the sinner taking the way of 
    vanity, is soon far from him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A way wherein he applies himself close to the creature 
    for his chief good; Jeremiah 2:13. Having left God, he takes up with the 
    empty creation, to hammer a happiness to himself oat of creature-comforts; 
    in imitation of fallen Adam embracing the forbidden fruit instead of a God. 
    And here four things are to be considered,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The man is sensible of a want; Psalm 4:6, "Who will 
    show us any good?" He is conscious to himself, that he is not 
    self-sufficient. There is an empty space in his heart, which he must needs 
    labor to have filled up. And it cannot be otherwise, since he has lost God, 
    and is without him in the world; Ephesians 2:12; and that God is the only 
    object capable of filling the heart, an infinite good only being 
    commensurable to the boundless desires of the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Having lost sight of God as man's happiness, he 
    looks about through the creation for the supply of his want, for a match to 
    his soul, which he finds cannot live alone by itself; Ecclesiastes 6:9. 
    Though the man has lost God, if he had not lost his eyes too, he would see 
    there was no way for him, but to see to recover the enjoyment of God again. 
    But his eyes are darkened in this broad way, that he cannot see how God, and 
    God only, can be a happiness to him; 1 Corinthians 2:14. The word of the 
    gospel tells him this of God, and Christians tell it him from their 
    experience; but he cannot comprehend it; therefore he looks about for it 
    elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) In this case the creature shows fair; the world 
    appears in its beauty and gaudy dress. It displays its wealth at a distance, 
    and looks out with all its charms, "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the 
    eyes, and the pride of life;" 1 John 2:16. And the man is taken thinking if 
    be had it he would be well. He looks on it as a fit match for his heart, and 
    is not without hopes of gaining his point. And Satan is busy here to forward 
    the project, representing the creature most speciously, and inflaming the 
    sinner's desire after it. See Matthew 4:8.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The sinner being taken, falls a-courting of the 
    creature, for the enjoyment of the wanted happiness in it; Psalm 4:6. 
    Flushed with big hopes, he sets out on this project, and plies it closely. 
    And this is the broad way of vanity, in which he travels endlessly, until 
    either the grace of God open his eyes, and turn him back to God; or else 
    that in Hell he lift up his eyes, and see he has been ruined with courting 
    all along a deceitful shadow.</p>
<p align="justify">This courting of the creature to be a match for the 
    heart, is not slightly managed. But,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is begun early; Psalm 58:3. As soon as ever the 
    children of fallen Adam are sensible of a want, they go to that door for 
    supply; while as yet there are no desires after God, they are gaping wide 
    after the creature. Behold the little children, how fond of things grateful 
    to the taste, and pleasant to the eye, while the compass of their 
    understanding reaches no farther! What a mighty satisfaction do they promise 
    themselves in these! And as they grow up, and the world opens out to them, 
    and spreads its deceitful glories; how do their desires after it, and 
    hunting for them, increase proportionally!</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is prosecuted assiduously, no time being lost for 
    the thing purposed. The project is closely pursued, that if it prove 
    successless, it is not through carelessness; Isaiah 57:20; Psalm 127:2. They 
    are early and late at the creature's door. Whatever disappointments they 
    meet with, it makes no change of their mind, nor do they go to another for 
    their happiness; Romans 6:20.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is managed vigorously. They are not indifferent 
    about their success, but in good earnest; their heart is wholly set on it. 
    The most valuable talents they have, are laid out upon it; Isaiah 55:2. They 
    take true pains upon it; they are not loiterers, but labor to gain their 
    point; Isaiah 55:2; Matthew 11:28, and that to weariness in the midst of 
    difficulties; Habakkuk 2:13. They are like hewers in stone, on the matter; 
    Jeremiah 2:13; and strike on rocks until the fire flash in their faces.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, It is continued all along, until the Lord from 
    Heaven put a stop to it; either in mercy, showing them their error, and 
    bringing them back unto God in Christ, to take up their rest in him; or else 
    in wrath, taking them away from it by death, and so plucking up their hopes 
    by the roots; Matthew 25:45, 46; Luke 12:20.</p>
<p align="justify">Now this way is the way of vanity, in that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a false and deceitful way, Psalm 119:128, and 
    can take with men only by means of darkness, blindness, and ignorance, verse 
    104. In it shadows are proposed to the heart instead of a substance, the 
    creature promising that which it is not able to perform; causing men to 
    expect that out of it that is not in it. In it the bait appears; but the 
    hook is hidden, which yet effectually ruins; 1 Timothy 6:10. And in it men 
    hunt their own sorrows and destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is an unprofitable way. In it a life is spent to no 
    valuable purpose, and at the end it appears to have brought no lasting 
    advantage; Romans 3:12. But thus men are running in the broad way, wearying 
    themselves for a thing of nothing; like children running in a sunny day 
    catching butterflies, missing many of them, and the beautiful colored wings 
    of those they catch going to ashes between their fingers. It is 
    unprofitable,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In that they quite fall short of the great end God 
    proposes to men, namely, his glory; Romans 3:23. Instead of living to his 
    honor, they live to his dishonor, preferring the creature to the Creator, 
    and putting it in his room as their chief good. And that must needs be a 
    vain life, which does not reach the chief end it was given for. What then 
    can be expected, but the doom of the unprofitable servant?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In that they quite fall short of the end they 
    propose to themselves, namely, happiness, or a rest to their hearts; Hosea 
    8:7. This is what all their days they seek, but never get in any of their 
    days, nor at the end; nor is it possible to get it in that way; for it is 
    the way of vanity. And is not that a vain life, where one must die 
    disappointed of the great thing they mainly sought all their life?</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a trifling way, in which one trifles away a 
    lifetime, busy doing nothing, no substantial lasting good, nothing that will 
    give comfort in a dying hour, nothing for the better world; Psalm 90:9. God 
    has sent us into this world, to do business for eternity, to pass trials for 
    the happy world to come; but men going the broad way, forget their business, 
    and trifle away time; it lies like lumber on their hand, and they are gladly 
    to go in quest of this and the other vanity, to get it driven off, as if 
    they had nothing to do.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a restless way; Matthew 11:28, 29. Solomon 
    speaks of a vanity tossed to and fro; Proverbs 21:6. Such is the whole life 
    of one in the broad way. There is no rest for the heart in this way. 
    Whatever amusements for a time they may get in it, they can never lay the 
    heart to rest. Laying down the head upon one vanity to rest, the pillow is 
    soon drawn away; or there is a thorn of uneasiness found in it, and they 
    must shift themselves to another vanity, which quickly proves as 
    unsatisfying as the other. So that they are like one on the top of a mast, 
    they can get no rest.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, It is a way of endless wandering, through 
    repeated disappointments. Here men are like the Sodomites about Lot's house, 
    struck with blindness. They are going about for satisfaction, and groping 
    for it everywhere, but can never find it; wearying themselves to find that 
    door, but all in vain. But there is no end; but after a thousand 
    disappointments a new vanity is tried, and the experiment made on another; 
    Isaiah 57:10. And so men are still going the round of vanities; until either 
    grace is dropped into their hearts, turning them to rest in God; or else 
    they drop into the grave, dying disappointed.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The broad way is the way of vileness; Psalm 14:1. 
    As soon as one is entered by that part of the wide gate of the natural 
    inclination opening towards sin, away from the holiness of God expressed in 
    his law, he is upon the way of vileness leading straight to destruction; 
    Titus 1:5, 16; Revelation 22:15. And it is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A way wherein men vile by nature soon grow more vile, 
    and loathsome in God's sight, by going farther away from the holiness 
    required in his law; Jeremiah 9:3, "They proceed from evil to evil, and they 
    know not me, says the Lord." Here actual sin is heaped on original sin, a 
    sinful life added to a sinful nature, and the natural corruption spreads 
    itself in heart, lip, and life; so the farther they go in it, the farther 
    from all good.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A way wherein they apply themselves to the satisfying 
    instead of starring and mortifying their lusts; Psalm 58:3. Having no heart 
    for the way of holiness, they set themselves to the way of sin, and pursue 
    the same at the expense of the honor of God, and the wounding of their own 
    consciences, until in end they land in the pit of destruction at the end of 
    the way, if repenting not. And here four things may be considered,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The heart of man is naturally possessed with a fry of 
    sinful corrupt lusts craving to be satisfied. See what proceeds out of the 
    heart; Mark 7:21, 22, "Evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 
    thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, 
    blasphemy, pride, and foolishness." And if they were not in it, they would 
    not come out of it. They are bred in the womb of the corruption of our 
    nature; and by influence from Hell they are soon brought to spread out 
    themselves. These gape and open wide to be satisfied with what is agreeable 
    to their nature.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sinner, instead of starving them, sets himself to 
    make provision for them, instead of denying them to gratify them; Psalm 
    78:18. And this is a hard task, the hardest that ever one took in hand; for 
    it is like feeding of a fire, that never says, It is enough. Lusts may be 
    surfeited, but will never be satisfied. So it is a weary task the sinner 
    has, Jeremiah 9:5, and a laborious one, as in a close battle, James 4:1–3.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The creature lying within the bounds of the law, 
    cannot satisfy them; and no wonder, for it was never appointed to be 
    satisfactory to us, so as to afford the rest of the heart. Even in paradise 
    there was a want, which nothing but the enjoyment of God could fill up. The 
    regular desires of a heart housed in God, and centering in him, the creature 
    may satisfy in the regular use of it; but nothing regular will satisfy 
    irregular lusts.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Wherefore the sinner breaks over the hedge unto that 
    lying without the bounds of the holy law; and the satisfaction not found in 
    allowed, it seeks in forbidden fruit, Proverbs 9:17. Thus the man wandering 
    in the way of vanity, is every now and then turning to the way of vileness; 
    he is like the hungry beast on a bare pasture, that having ate up all within 
    the hedge to the red earth, at length breaks over the hedge; as Dinah 
    gadding abroad in the way of vanity, at length fell into a pit of vileness 
    and defilement. And here two things present themselves for the entertainment 
    of these vile lusts.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The desires of the flesh to be fulfilled; Ephesians 
    2:3. And here is a mire of vileness for the sinner to wallow in, in the 
    broad way, called the filthiness of the flesh; 2 Corinthians 7:1. In it are 
    to be seen drenched drunkards, gluttons, unclean persons, filthy speakers, 
    and all sensualists, whose great business it is to gratify their senses, 
    neglecting their souls; as if they were nothing but living flesh, or their 
    souls only as salt to keep their bodies from corrupting.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The desires of the mind to be fulfilled; Ephesians 
    2:3. This mire is called the filthiness of the spirit; 2 Corinthians 7:1. 
    Here are endless depths of enmity against God, rancor of spirit against and 
    distaste of true holiness and purity, unbelief of the gospel, pride and 
    selfishness, covetousness and earthly-mindedness, and innumerable evils 
    more, in which sinners indulge themselves in the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">These two issue in a fourfold road of the broad way, in 
    each of which are many walking.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Black ignorance, wherein not a few rest satisfied 
    without a tolerable knowledge of the foundations of religion; Psalm 82:5. 
    They are taught to work, but not to read; if they were, either they forget 
    it, or else they make no due use of it. The desires of the flesh and mind 
    wholly take them up; and they neither have, nor desire to have the knowledge 
    of God and his ways; Job 21:14. They know it would but hamper them in those 
    things which take best with darkness, and cannot abide the light; John 3:20, 
    "For every one that does evil, hates the light, neither comes to the light, 
    lest his deeds should be reproved." But alas! they consider not, that it 
    will end in everlasting darkness; Hosea 4:6; Isaiah 27:11.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Bare morality, lying in conformity to the letter of 
    the ten commandments; whereby they keep some decency in civil society, but 
    are utterly estranged from religion, and have not so much as an appearance 
    of it. They are good neighbors, but no good Christians; deal fairly in 
    things of this world, but have no dealing with things of the other world; 
    mind their business and affairs of life, but quite forget the one thing 
    needful. Their greatest excellency lies in negatives, like the Pharisee; 
    Luke 18:11, "I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, 
    unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican;" as if they did not look on 
    themselves obliged to honor God, farther than not to affront him openly. 
    This is a road of the broad way; Matthew 5:20, "For except your 
    righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, 
    you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">3. A form of godliness wherein men go the outward round 
    of, the duties of religion, but still continue strangers to the life and 
    power of it, 2 Timothy 3:5. These are the whited sepulchers, men who tack a 
    new life to the old heart; who sometimes have taken up from their 
    extravagancies, but were never truly converted; who with their religion, 
    such as it is, still retain the predominant love of sin; and always have 
    some beloved lust, in the room of God in Christ. They are like those beasts, 
    of which there is nothing good but the skin; and hence so many apostates, 
    who turning their back on religion, and proving scandalous and profane in 
    their lives, do but appear in their native colors, and what they always 
    were, before they cast off their mask. Let such consider these scriptures; 
    Psalm 125:5, "As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord 
    shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity." Matthew 24:51, "The 
    Lord shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; 
    there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Open profanity; wherein men bear the devil's mark on 
    their foreheads, giving themselves the loose in the open course of 
    scandalous enormities, Galatians 5:19–21. These are they that "declare their 
    sin as Sodom, and hide it not" who take pleasure in making themselves vile; 
    scorn to be hampered with the rules of religion, sobriety, and decency; who 
    make a mock of sin, and are going to destruction jovially, as with tabret 
    and pipe. This surely is the broad road in the broad way; and they cannot be 
    thought to be deceiving themselves with hopes of Heaven, for they cannot 
    think it a place for dogs and swine. If they do, they will be disappointed; 
    Revelation 22:15, "For without are dogs." etc. A profane life will make a 
    miserable end; Ephesians 5:6, "Let no man deceive you with vain words; for 
    because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the children of 
    disobedience."</p>
<p align="justify">Now this is the way of vileness, wherein men render 
    themselves loathsome in the sight of God; their souls in this way still 
    gathering more defilement to them, and all the defilement sticking, none 
    carried off, while they are upon it. Every sin leaves a blot on the soul 
    whereby it is laid under pollution agreeable to its nature. Thereby,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The soul is rendered unlike God; and the more sinful, 
    the more unlike him in his moral perfections. Now, God cannot but love 
    himself, and his own purity; and therefore he cannot but hate and loathe 
    what is made unlike him, and contrary to him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The soul being made unlike God, its beauty is marred, 
    and it becomes loathsome. Holiness is the glory or beauty of God; Exodus 
    15:11, "Who is a God like unto you, glorious in holiness?" and God being the 
    supreme pattern of all perfection, holiness must also be the beauty of the 
    creature; and consequently sin must be the deformity of the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, We shall consider the broadness of this way; 
    which we may take up in these two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is large room in it for passengers to walk in. 
    The vain and vile mind is an unfathomable depth; and the way to destruction 
    is of an immeasurable breadth. So the mind has room to wander up and down, 
    and to range to and fro in the broad way. Endless vanities present 
    themselves there, innumerable vilenesses are to be found there, according to 
    Jeremiah 17:9, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately 
    wicked; who can know it?" so that he who has disrelished one, may betake 
    himself to another; and every lust of the heart may find with which to 
    gratify it there.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is no hampering with hedges in it. It is the way 
    of lawless liberty; the very nature of it is to lay aside all restraints, 
    and to allow all licentiousness. In that way the bands are broken asunder, 
    and the cords cast away from the travelers. Bible-rules, dictates of 
    conscience, and suggestions of the Spirit of holiness, are laid aside in 
    that way, as things that would narrow it. Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is easy to fall on it. It is such a broad way, that 
    there is no difficulty to hit it, Psalm 58:3. Though one shut his eyes, and 
    walk at all adventures, he will not miss it; because it is the way of 
    natural inclination; so all the difficulty is to keep off it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is easy walking in it. There is full room there for 
    all the sinner's vain and vile inclinations. They go with the wind while 
    they are on it; they row with the stream; for the natural bent lies that, 
    way, Jeremiah 4:22. They have no more ado but follow it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is not easy to get off it; Jeremiah 13:23, "Can the 
    Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do 
    good, that are accustomed to do evil." Many seem to themselves and others 
    for a time to leave it; and yet they do not change their way, but only their 
    road; going off from one road of the broad way to another, as from profanity 
    to formality.</p>
<p align="justify">III. We shall consider this way in its leading away to 
    destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">Here we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Show the import of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Confirm it,</p>
<p align="justify">First. We shall show the import of this. It imports, 
    that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Destruction is at the end of this way, however the 
    travelers notice it not; Proverbs 9:17, 18, "Stolen waters are sweet, and 
    bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knows not that the dead are there, 
    and that her guests are in the depths of Hell." As sure as heaven's 
    happiness is at the end of the narrow way, Hell and destruction are at the 
    end of the broad way. There is no separating what God has thus joined.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The farther one goes in that way, the further away he 
    is from safety, and the nearer to destruction. Progress in the broad way 
    carries one still farther from God, from holiness, and from salvation; Psalm 
    119:155, "Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not your 
    statutes." They are far from the God of salvation, the way of salvation, and 
    so from salvation itself; and still they draw nearer to destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Holding on the way, they cannot miss of destruction; 
    Romans 3:16, 17, "Destruction and misery are in their ways." They will land 
    at length in the place of destruction. Psalm 9:17, "The wicked shall be 
    turned into Hell, and all the nations that forget God." They will find 
    themselves in the state of destruction, Matthew 25:46. A destruction of 
    their well-being, not of their being; for they will not be substantially 
    destroyed, or annihilated, to make an end of their being; but destroyed as 
    to their comfort and ease, or tormented, to make an end of their well-being. 
    What is destroyed, is not therefore annihilated, Luke 4:34; compared with 
    Matthew 8:29. Annihilation properly is momentary, their destruction will be 
    everlasting, 2 Thessalonians 1:9; annihilation brings into a state of 
    negative rest, but they will have no rest, Revelation 14:11; but be 
    tormented forever and ever; chapter 20:10, "Their worm that dies not," must 
    have a subject to live in; and the fire is not everlasting, but for 
    everlasting punishment, Matthew 25:41, 46.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, To confirm that this way leads to destruction, 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This is the constant voice of the word. God himself at 
    the beginning spoke it first of all; Genesis 2:17, "In the day that you eat 
    thereof you shall surely die." The text is Jesus Christ's declaration of it. 
    It was the common and constant voice of all the prophets and apostles, to be 
    found in almost every leaf of the Bible. Thus the truth of God insures it; 
    and if men will promise themselves peace in it over the belly of all this, 
    what help is there for it? But they will be miserably disappointed; 
    Deuteronomy 29:19, 20, "The Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of 
    the Lord, and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses 
    that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot 
    out his name from under Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The rectoral justice of God demands it, Genesis 18:25; 
    compared with 2 Thessalonians 1:6, "He who rules among men must be just;" 
    and therefore must punish crimes, as well as reward good services; and must 
    not the ruler and judge of the world do justice too? Yes, his own honor, and 
    the good of mankind, require it; and it is the intimation of that justice 
    that keeps some decency in the world. We see very well, that some men have a 
    sunshine of peace in the broad way, while others have much adversity in the 
    narrow way. There must then be a judgment for punishment at the end of the 
    broad way. And some sinners are punished now in their way, as an earnest of 
    it; but all are not, for assuring it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The nature of things, duly considered, manifests it. 
    The soul of man is immortal, and dropping the body, still lives. God alone 
    can be our happiness, as being alone commensurable to the boundless desires 
    of our souls. Now the broad way leads away from God, consequently away from 
    happiness; and the future state being not a state of trial, but of 
    recompense, the separation from God there must be total and final, and 
    consequently the misery of the rational creature complete. What can be the 
    end of the way of vanity, but absolute disappointment, cutting and galling 
    of the soul; how can that disappointment be evited, when men pass away out 
    of this world, and this world shall perish, and so they can never have more 
    of what they sought their satisfaction in? What can be the end of the way of 
    vileness but destruction, while nothing of their vile ways remains with 
    them, but the lust after them, the cutting remembrance of them, without any 
    possibility of gratifying their lusts more?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, The voice of the natural conscience confirms 
    it; Romans 1:32; and 2:15. There is something within the sinner that 
    forebodes destruction to him in this way; though through the violence of 
    lusts it prevails not, or is not heeded; Job 15:21. It is their 
    consciousness of this that makes them always in a hurry, and to stave off 
    serious communing with themselves; for if they would descend into 
    themselves, and give the broad and narrow way a fair hearing, they would 
    find conscience within them frightening from the former, and pressing to the 
    latter.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information. Hence we may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the way of one's setting out in the world is a 
    matter of vast consequence. It is of great weight how one begins his course 
    of life. If it is begun well, it will readily end well; if the beginning be 
    ill, the end will be conform, if there is not a sound change. made. You see 
    there is a wide gate to enter by, and it sets on a broad way leading to 
    destruction. What need then is there to enter right, since if we enter 
    wrong, we cannot proceed right until we enter again by a new gate? This 
    calls aloud to,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The young to look well at what gate they enter, how 
    they begin their course, and set off in the world; Ecclesiastes 12:1, 
    "Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth." This for the most 
    part is little considered; but the young go forward at random, thinking it 
    of little moment how their first years be spent, hoping their riper years 
    may be spent regularly. This is to enter the wide gate, leaving your soul in 
    pawn, that you may come back again, and will not go forward. But one step 
    makes way for another, and the return for the most part is forgot, and the 
    pawn lost.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The aged to review their entering; and now that they 
    are far on in their way, to consider what gate they entered by. It is 
    impossible you can be on the right way, whatever your way is, if you entered 
    not by the right gate. Maybe your way now is not quite so dirty as your 
    entrance was; you have perhaps left the follies of an ill-spent youth, and 
    taken up yourselves; but you may have done all that, and yet be on the broad 
    way. Is there a sound work of conversion in your case? Are you become new 
    creatures? 2 Corinthians 5:17. If not, you are still in the old way.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That giving scope to the natural inclination of the 
    heart, sets one surely on the broad way to destruction. For that inclination 
    is the wide gate, which the broad way joins, the former issuing in the 
    latter. People generally think little of the opening of their hearts towards 
    the creature, and towards sin; but if there is not a struggle begun against 
    both, but way given to any of them, the party is entered by the wide gate, 
    and is on the broad way. Our worst enemy is within: and that heart will ruin 
    a man, that is not struggled against, but yielded to, and carries a man in 
    its way. The pliableness that way is frowardness against God; Isaiah 57:17.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, The way and course of life that is most 
    grateful and easiest to our corrupt nature, is most dangerous; it is the way 
    to destruction. Nature likes not to be hampered, but to go at liberty, 
    ranging the treasures of vanity, and wallowing in the mires of vileness. But 
    that present ease is a pledge of future destruction; that lawless liberty 
    betrays one into eternal confinement; that casting off of the bands of duty, 
    prepares one for the bands of wrath in the end.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Exhortation. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Consider your way, what way you are on, whether on 
    the broad way or not; Hag. 1:5, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, Consider your 
    ways." Should one cry to you, that about the place where you are going there 
    is a way that is deadly dangerous, you would certainly look to your feet, to 
    see that you were not on it. Here is a voice from Heaven telling you, that 
    in this world where you are, there is a way leading to destruction; O then, 
    be not secure, but consider seriously what way you are on, whether on it or 
    not. Lay then this matter to heart, examine your state and way, and put this 
    question to yourselves, What way am I on?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. This is a piece of duty you owe to God, in 
    return of all the calls of Heaven to you by ordinances and providences; 
    Micah 6:9; Revelation 3:20. Sometimes he speaks to you by his word, 
    sometimes by providences; will you not give him a hearing, standing and 
    considering what way you are on, and where it leads? It is dangerous to give 
    a deaf ear to all; Proverbs 1:24.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. It is a piece of justice you owe to your own 
    souls, 2 Corinthians 13:5. Were a man driving a parcel of beasts, and one 
    should tell him, There is a way thereabouts that ends in a precipice, he 
    would certainly consider whether he were on it or not. But it is sounded 
    again and again in men's ears, that there is a broad way that leads to 
    destruction; yet they will not do their souls the justice once seriously to 
    consider whether they were on it or not, but just drive forward at all 
    adventures.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. As is the way you are on, so will the end be. 
    Death and life hang on the way you are on. If you are on the broad way, you 
    are on the way of death and destruction; if not, you are on the way of life, 
    and is not that worth your considering the matter?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. Lastly, It would be of great use to have that 
    point cleared. Should you find yourselves not on the broad way, you might 
    have the comfort of it, that you are in the way to life, and shall certainly 
    get thither. If you were convinced of your being in the broad way you might 
    get off from it yet, and so escape being ruined by it. Some need be at no 
    great pains to find out this, if they would but consider things calmly and 
    impartially. But I shall drop these few things about it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those that never saw themselves on the broad way, and 
    destruction awaiting them at the end of it, are certainly upon it, by that 
    token that they are going on their way blindfolded, 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4. 
    Unconvinced sinners are surely unconverted; for who will ever go right that 
    once are wrong, until they see themselves wrong?</p>
<p align="justify">2. They that have not entered by the strait gate of 
    conversion and regeneration, but have climbed up another way to the way they 
    are in, Matthew 18:3; John 3:3. They who, whatever changes have been made in 
    their head, in point of light to discern the truth; in their affections, in 
    point of relish of it; and in their life, in point of escaping the 
    pollutions of the world; yet their nature has never been changed, never got 
    the new heart impressed with inclination towards the whole law, and 
    reconciled to the whole yoke of Christ, but the predominant love of sin 
    still remains in them, are certainly on the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They that have a reigning disgust at the narrow way, 
    whether in themselves or others, Romans 8:7. There is a generation that 
    choose such a measure of religion for themselves, but they can have no more 
    of it, they cannot think to be bound up to all the rules of it; they hate it 
    in others, and cannot admit it in themselves. These are in the broad way, by 
    this token, that all the saints aspire to a perfection of holiness, and love 
    it, Philippians 3:13, 14.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, They whose choice is a loose and licentious 
    way, in the way of vanity or vileness, and can find no pleasure but in such 
    a way, Romans 8:15. This argues a temper of spirit wholly carnal, and 
    estranged from the life of God; that cannot favor the things of God, but of 
    the flesh; and that is a deadly condition, Romans 8:5, 6. To such Heaven, as 
    a holy place, would be a prison, a place wherein they could have no 
    pleasure, and they may be sure they shall never be brought thither; since 
    they are not by heavenly dispositions made meet for it, Colossians 1:12, 13.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, You that are brought off the other way, be suitably 
    affected with, and walk worthy of the deliverance, as being brought off the 
    way of destruction. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be thankful to God for it, who by his grace drew you 
    off from it, Psalm 107:20, 21. Look back to the precipice that you were once 
    carelessly standing on, to the way of destruction that you were securely 
    going forward in; bless him that opened your eyes to see your danger there, 
    and to see another way safe, however narrow; that by his grace determined 
    you to forsake the broad way, and choose the narrow; and by the power of his 
    Spirit drew you off the one, and set you on the other.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Entertain no hankering after that way again; beware of 
    giving rueful looks back to it. It is an exhortation given to those espoused 
    to Christ; Psalm 45:10, "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your 
    ear; forget also your own people, and your father's house." And it is not 
    given in vain; for in the best there is an old man remaining corruption, 
    which perceiving the free and unhampered gate of the carnal world in the way 
    of vanity and vileness, is apt to envy them in a sort, and secretly to wish 
    they had the same scope with them; Proverbs 23:17, "Let not your heart envy 
    sinners; but be you in the fear of the Lord all the day long." This is most 
    dangerous, which, if not timely suppressed, will inflame the whole soul, and 
    lay it in ruins; Numbers 11:4–6, 33, 34, therefore "remember Lot's wife," 
    Luke 17:32.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Do not grudge your difficulties and hardships in the 
    narrow way; 1 Peter 4:12; James 1:2–4. In it you meet with correction, but 
    in the other you would have met with destruction; and there is no more 
    reason to grudge, than one brought off a way where he would have broke his 
    neck, has no grudge to breaking his toes on the safe way that he is brought 
    on. The hardships of the broad and narrow way differ as much as the curse 
    and the cross, as the killing sword and the surgeon's lance, as eternal 
    wrath and God's fatherly rod.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Pity them that are on the broad way, and be 
    concerned for their recovery. Pity them; for alas! they know not what they 
    do, where they are, the deadly danger they are in. Be concerned for them; 
    for they are going to destruction and are not aware of it; Proverbs 7:22, 
    23, and 9:17, 18. How can you miss to be so affected towards them, if you 
    are sensible what once was your own case; Titus 3:3, "For we ourselves also 
    were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and 
    pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Sinners on the broad way turn off from it as the 
    way of destruction. "Turn you, turn you from your evil ways; for why will 
    you die?" Ezekiel 33:11.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. There is no escaping of destruction continuing 
    on it, whatever you may imagine; 1 Thessalonians 5:3. God has said it; how 
    can you hope for safety in that way, over the belly of an express 
    declaration from Heaven?, He is infinite in knowledge, you cannot outwit 
    him; in power, and you cannot outbrave him; he is essentially true, and you 
    will not be able to make him a liar; Numbers 23:19. See Deuteronomy 29:19, 
    20.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. It will be a total destruction it will bring 
    you to; 2 Peter 2:12, 13. A destruction of your souls, bodies, and comforts; 
    Proverbs 6:32, and 8:36; Isaiah 66:24; Luke 16:24. Look as it was with Sodom 
    when it was utterly overthrown, there was nothing left, but they and all 
    theirs were destroyed; so will the end of the broad way be to you.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. It will be an eternal destruction; 2 
    Thessalonians 1:9, "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from 
    the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." A destruction 
    not of your being indeed, but of your well-being; ever dying, but never 
    dying out; Matthew 25:46; Revelation 14:11; and 20:10. Your way may be long 
    indeed, but the destruction at the end of it will be longer; you will 
    compass your way at most in a few years; but the destruction will never end, 
    but go on through eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. You may get off it now, and so escape 
    destruction in it; Ezekiel 18:30. Satan and an evil world may persuade you 
    to go on in it, but they cannot force you thereto. There is no necessary 
    connection between your having gone in it hitherto, and your going on in it 
    still. It is a course that may be broken off; the grace of Christ is able to 
    bring you off it; and if you be truly willing, will bring you off it; 
    Jeremiah 31:18, 19.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 5. God is calling you to turn from it and leave 
    it; Ezekiel 33:11. Christ has opened to you another way, a way of life, and 
    is inviting you earnestly into it. He is proposing himself as the way; John 
    14:6, and calling you to him; Matthew 11:28. This his voice sounds in the 
    way, and reaches your ears while you are on it, the broad way; Proverbs 9:5, 
    6. But it is not to be heard at the end of the way. Therefore it is said, 
    "Today, if you will hear his voice." At the end of the way the voice of the 
    Lamb of God ceases as such, and becomes the roaring of the Lion of the tribe 
    of Judah; Luke 19:27.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 6. Lastly, The calls you have to turn from it will 
    be an aggravation of your destruction if you go on; Matthew 11:22. The 
    remembrance of them at the end will be cutting and galling, when there will 
    be no remedy. It will be the never-dying worm that will gnaw forever; to 
    think, that, for the pleasure of walking at your liberty in the broad way 
    for a few years, you brought yourselves to be shut up in the pit of 
    destruction forever. Therefore (Hebrews 12:25), "See that you refuse not him 
    that speaks; for if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, 
    much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from 
    Heaven;" lest (Proverbs 5:11, 12) "you mourn at the last, when your flesh 
    and your body are consumed, and say, How have I hated instruction, and my 
    heart despised reproof?"</p>
<p align="justify">Now, if you would change your way, and leave the wide 
    gate,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be peremptory in it, and resolute for it; for you will 
    not want opposition. Satan will oppose the change violently by his 
    temptations; the carnal world will oppose it; your former licentious 
    companions will be sure to counsel, and mock you from it if they can; and 
    your own lusts within will be an active party against it. But remember 
    (Matthew 11:12) "the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent 
    take it by force."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do not delay it, but turn immediately, as the psalmist 
    did; Psalm 119:60, "I made haste, and delayed not to keep your 
    commandments." If your resolutions for it be sincere, they will not admit of 
    a moment's delay, more than the casting of a burning coal out of your bosom. 
    If you delay until the next day or the next hour, you may be at the end of 
    your way before that time; and what avails your purpose of turning then? As 
    when the cry of fire in a house is made, men go immediately to quench it, 
    knowing that every minute the fire is proceeding and gaining ground; so when 
    men are convinced in earnest, they will forthwith set to turn.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Set yourself by all means for the strait gate, and do 
    not think of getting over into the narrow way at the broad side; Luke 13:24, 
    "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many will seek to enter in, and 
    shall not be able." This is a fundamental mistake in the conduct of many; 
    whereby, leaving the way of looseness and carelessness, they commence mere 
    moralists or legal formalists, but no more true Christians than they were 
    before. Satisfy not yourselves without a deep conviction of your sin and 
    misery, faith in Jesus uniting you to him, true repentance and conversion 
    unto God by Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Be not frightened at, discouraged by, or made 
    to turn back because of the straitness of the gate; but peremptorily enter, 
    and resolutely thrust forward, until you be quite through on the narrow way 
    of holiness; Luke 13:24, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. The wide gate, with the broad way joining 
    it, does so take with mankind, that the multitude of the world goes in by 
    it, at all adventures.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this subject, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Explain the point.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Confirm this sad truth, That the multitude of the 
    world go in by the wide gate into the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Show how it comes to pass, that the multitude take 
    the broad way, not withstanding of the destruction at the end of it.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall explain this point. And we may take up the 
    sense and import of it in these four things, all of them the genuine import 
    of the text.</p>
<p align="justify">First, There is among mankind a going in at the wide 
    gate. However dangerous it is, yet it is frequented by poor unthinking 
    souls. Though of right it should be loathed for the pollution of it, and 
    should be shunned with a horror of it for the danger thereof, yet men do go 
    in at it. That is,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They enter and pass through the wide gate, giving 
    way to the corrupt natural inclination of their hearts, when they begin 
    their course of life in the world, Psalm 58:3. This, according to what was 
    said, lies in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Giving way and scope to the bias of their heart 
    towards the creature, away from God. The children of fallen Adam naturally 
    go away from God, when they begin their course, Psalm 14:2, 3; and they go 
    to the creature in his room and stead, Jeremiah 2:13. They find they want, 
    they need, and cannot but desire to have supply; they want a rest to their 
    hearts, a match for their souls, something that may satisfy their desires. 
    But what door go they to for the supply of their want? Not to God's, but to 
    the creature's, Psalm 4:6, John 5:40. There they fasten on the dry breasts, 
    refusing the Lord's offers, Isaiah 55:1, 2.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Giving way to the bias of the heart towards sin, away 
    from the holiness required by the law. God in Christ calls them to take on 
    his yoke, Matthew 9:29, but they cannot submit their necks to it, Romans 
    8:7. They choose sinful liberty, and look asquint on the way of God's 
    commandments. Beginning their course in the world, and sinful liberty and 
    religions strictness being both before them, they reject the latter, and 
    readily embrace the former. Sin appears delightful and pleasant, holiness 
    rugged and unsightly to them; so they go with the bent sail of their hearts 
    towards sin, hoping to find there what will satisfy.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Passing through the wide gate, they are set on the 
    broad way; they go in thereat, namely, into the broad way, which the wide 
    gate is the entry to, and so they go on,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Walking in the way of vanity, Ephesians 4:17. They 
    spend their lifetime in a vain pursuit of happiness in the creature, which 
    all along disappoints them, and in the end worst of all; Jeremiah 2:5, "Thus 
    says the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are 
    gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?" They 
    weary themselves in the pursuit, and in end obtain nothing that can satisfy, 
    Habakkuk 2:13. Their whole life is filled up with mere amusements; and 
    beyond this they reach not to any solid and lasting happiness, which can 
    only be had in the enjoyment of a God in Christ, Luke 17:28, 29.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Walking in the way of vileness, Ephesians 2:3. The 
    creature within the hedge of the divine law not affording the desired 
    satisfaction, they break over the hedge, and range up and down among 
    forbidden profits and pleasures, if so be that stolen waters may make up to 
    them what is wanting in allowed ones. And none of these answering 
    expectation neither, they go from one act of vileness to another; and the 
    disappointment still renewed, their lusts crave anew of them, and they seek 
    afresh to satisfy them. Thus their life is spent, until their way is at an 
    end, and in the end they fall into destruction. This is the going in 
    thereat.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, They go in thereat at all adventures, rashly 
    and heedlessly, without considering. Great is the danger of that way, 
    destruction being at the end of it. They are told their danger; conscience 
    tells them of it; they are warned of it from the word; providence sets many 
    frightful examples before them, one being made example to another, but all 
    in vain. Their vain minds and corrupt lusts hurry them forward; they fix 
    their eyes on the bait that is pleasing, but notice not the ruining hook; 
    and so they go on at all adventures, whatever be the issue.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, They are many that thus go in at the wide gate 
    into the broad way. As destructive as it is, there is a multitude of the 
    children of men on it. Whoever mind for it, they need not fear want of 
    company of fellow-travelers therein. They are many,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Absolutely. There is never wanting on the broad way a 
    number of travelers, to encourage one another. There is a multitude to do 
    evil. There they are of all ranks and qualities, great and small, of all 
    professions, ages, and sexes.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Comparatively, in comparison of those on the narrow 
    way. So says the text. There is such an odds between the two parties, that 
    the broad way-men make the many, the other but a few. If the broad way of 
    sinful liberty, and the strait way of religion and godliness, were put to 
    the vote in the world, the former would undoubtedly carry it; those for it 
    being so far superior in number to those for the other.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, The wideness of the gate and broadness of the 
    way influences this. The agreeableness thereof to the corrupt minds of men, 
    invites powerfully to enter and come on; and being entered and come on, it 
    keeps them from going back, and prompts to go on. It is a powerful 
    influence, which the destruction at the end of the way is not able to 
    balance.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall confirm this sad truth, That the multitude 
    of the world go in by the wide gate into the broad way. This may appear 
    from,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Scripture testimony, which is the testimony of God 
    himself, who neither can deceive, nor be deceived. Scripture light all along 
    discovers the multitude of the world to be on the broad way. This it does 
    several ways; and particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Witnessing the universal corruption of human nature; 
    Psalm 14:2, 3, "The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, 
    to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all 
    gone aside, they are altogether become filthy; there is none that does good, 
    no not one." If you think this was meant only of those in the Psalmist's 
    day, you may be cured of that mistake, by the apostle's application of it to 
    all the world; "They are all gone out of the way, they are together become 
    unprofitable, there is none that does good, no not one. Now we know that 
    whatever things the law says, it says to them who are under the law; that 
    every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God." 
    This speaks it to be natural to man to betake himself to the broad way, 
    though not primitively natural; for, Ecclesiastes 7:29, "God made man 
    upright;" yet secondarily, and accidentally, as our nature was corrupted in 
    Adam, John 3:6, "That which is born of the flesh, is flesh." Job 14:4, "Who 
    can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one." So that this is the 
    first way all men go, and in which they hold on until turned by grace.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Witnessing the general depravity of men's lives. How 
    forcible is that testimony;. 1 John 5:19, "The whole world lies in 
    wickedness?" The godly are such a small number in the world, that the name 
    of the world is left to the corrupt part; and they are so very corrupt, that 
    they are said to lie in wickedness. The straying in the broad way begins 
    very early; Psalm 58:3, "The wicked are estranged from the womb, they go 
    astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies;" and God's elect ones are 
    once engaged therein as well as others; Isaiah 53:6, "All we like sheep have 
    gone astray;" and go on until returned unto Jesus Christ; 1 Peter 2:25, "For 
    you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the shepherd and 
    Bishop of your souls." But still the multitude strays on, Philippians 2:21, 
    "For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The constant call to the multitude to repent and turn. 
    That call supposes them to be quite wrong, and out of the way; Matthew 9:13, 
    "I am come to call sinners to repentance." It was the sound the prophets and 
    apostles made in the world, each of them in their time, where they executed 
    the commission. So the house of Israel is bespoken; Ezekiel 33:11, "As I 
    live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but 
    that the wicked turn from his way, and live; turn you, turn you from your 
    evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?" So says the apostle; 
    Acts 17:30, "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands 
    all men everywhere to repent." And in all ages the necessity of this call to 
    repent does continue, there being but few who answer it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, The sweeping judgments a holy God has at times 
    sent on the world, were sure tokens of the multitude being on the broad way. 
    Once the whole inhabitants of the earth, save eight persons, were destroyed 
    by a deluge of water. Sodom and Gomorrah were consumed with fire from 
    Heaven, only Lot and his family escaping; whereas God was ready to have 
    spared the whole, if there had been but ten righteous ones in the place. The 
    destruction of Jerusalem was another dispensation of that kind, of which our 
    Savior says, Matthew 24:21, 22, "For then shall be great tribulation, such 
    as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall 
    be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be 
    saved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." And the 
    burning up of the world with fire at last, is a speaking evidence that still 
    the multitude will take the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, From our own observation, if we will but take a 
    view of the world, as we have access to be acquainted with it by seeing and 
    hearing. I shall not speak of the many nations lying in Pagan idolatry, nor 
    others without the verge of the visible church. It is plain, that among 
    those that have the light of the gospel shining among them, the multitude is 
    on the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Every body may see, how quite unlike to the rules of 
    the gospel are the lives of the generality that hear it; Titus 2:11, 12. 
    Sobriety, righteousness, and godliness, are taught by it; but few learn the 
    lessons. What excess of passions and vanity of mind carry most men beyond 
    all bounds of sobriety, to their own hurt? What unrighteousness prevails to 
    the injuring of others, so that in every society, greater and lesser, there 
    are heavy complaints of this kind? And how little regard to God, his honor, 
    his law, and interests, is to be seen among men, to the provoking of the 
    eyes of his glory? If the multitude is not on the broad way, how is it thus? 
    Truly, if you see not that the multitude is upon it, it is an evidence you 
    do not know it by that name, and are unacquainted with the narrow way.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They that have eyes to see may see, how rare 
    experimental religion is in the world. The multitude trouble not their heads 
    about it; but live at ease, without any saving acquaintance with Christ, 
    ignorant of the life of faith, and struggle against the body of sin and 
    death. Conviction of one's lost state by nature is very rare; the work of 
    conversion is yet more rare. Few have a profession or appearance of 
    religion; and among those that have it, how many are utter strangers to the 
    power of godliness? The truly serious will be convinced of this; for they 
    must be ready to take up Micah's lamentation; Micah 7:1, 2, etc. See it.</p>
<p align="justify">III. How comes it to pass, that the multitude take the 
    broad way, notwithstanding of the destruction at the end of it? This may be 
    accounted for, if we consider these following things—</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the most agreeable way to their corrupt nature. 
    It is the very way of their heart; Isaiah 57:17. The heart of man naturally 
    is a treasure of vanity, a fountain of vileness; Jeremiah 17:9; Mark 7:21. 
    How can the broad way of vanity and vileness miss to be agreeable to it? 
    Likeness begets love and liking; so their souls natively choose the broad 
    way, wherein are to be found what things promise, though deceitfully, 
    satisfaction to the vanity of their minds, and the corrupt lusts of their 
    hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The blindness of their minds; Ephesians 4:17, 18. They 
    see not the danger, to fright them from it; they cannot, they will not see 
    it. Their unmortified lusts cast up such mists as darken the eyes of their 
    mind; that though the danger is told them a thousand times, they cannot 
    perceive it; Proverbs 9:17, 18, will not believe it; Deuteronomy 29:19, 20, 
    they see not any of those things that might draw them from off it; 1 
    Corinthians 2:14. There is an attractive virtue, beauty, and glory in the 
    contrary way, Proverbs 3:17, but they do not perceive it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Prejudices against the narrow way. They not only have 
    not a good opinion of it; but they have an ill opinion of it, are prejudiced 
    against it; Acts 28:22. It appears to them an overgrown, rough, and 
    frightful path; which, if they consult their interest, they must hold off 
    from. Christ's yoke is taken for an uneasy yoke, his burden for a very heavy 
    one. And so they determine against it, without giving it a fair trial.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The broad way is really easier for the time; "Wide is 
    the gate, and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be 
    which go in thereat." In it one has no more ado, but to follow the 
    inclination of his own heart; but to go with the wind of corrupt passions 
    and affections; but in the narrow way he will have that wind in his face, 
    and must keep up a struggle against his lusts, to mortify them. Thus present 
    ease engages them to that way that ends in destruction, and present 
    difficulty frightens them from the way that leads to life in the end.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Satan, the enemy of their salvation, has a mighty 
    influence on them to carry them to, and keep them on that way. He is "the 
    God of this world;" 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4, and men are naturally under his 
    power; Acts 26:18. He has a favorable party within them; so that the way he 
    would have them go, is the way their natural bent lies. Hence he has easy 
    work to prompt them forward, for he rows with the tide. Add to this his 
    subtlety, whereby he can easily overreach them; and his diligence, whereby 
    he slips no occasion to put them on; and no wonder he drives the multitude 
    before him.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Example contributes exceedingly to it; Matthew 18:7. 
    One goes into that way, another follows, and so on. It is true, there are 
    examples on the other side too; but good example has not such influence as 
    bad; because men are naturally corrupt, and therefore want but one to go 
    before, that they may follow according to their natural inclination, like 
    water going down a hill, where the passage is cleared. But it is against the 
    grain to follow good example.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, Want of consideration; Luke 15:17. Few are at 
    pains to weigh things, and deliberately to choose their way; but they take 
    the broad way upon trust, as that which first offers to them. They look not 
    afar off, beyond the present time; they consider not what the end will be, 
    but embrace the fair appearance for the present before them. They are 
    engaged in the broad way before they are aware; "for childhood and youth are 
    vanity;" Ecclesiastes 11:10. Youth is headstrong; and men are hurried on 
    with strong and impetuous passions, until they have got a set they cannot 
    throw off; Jeremiah 13:23, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the 
    leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do 
    evil."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information. Hence we may learn, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Prevailing sloth, and love to carnal ease, makes 
    terrible havoc in the world. These are they that make the wide gate and 
    broad way so taking, that the multitude go in thereat; and consequently this 
    betrays them into utter ruin; Proverbs 6:9–11. Sloth so prevails, that they 
    cannot think to abide a stress, no not for things of the greatest weight; 
    but what is easiest, and requires least pains, that is accounted best; and 
    they cannot be moved with the after-reckoning.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The broad way that leads to destruction, is the most 
    thronged way in the world. Some take another way indeed, but the multitude 
    is on the broad way. Many are the civil and religious differences among men; 
    but here the multitude meet altogether upon one way, notwithstanding all 
    their differences. There are different roads in this way, for the rich and 
    the poor, the old and the young, the professor and the profane; but their 
    way is one, and leads to the same place, where these differences will exist 
    no more; Psalm 125:5; Matthew 24:51. At present they join to make up the 
    multitude in the broad way.</p>
<p align="justify">3. What a poor defense of one's way and manner of life is 
    it, That it is the way that generally prevails, that the most part follow? 
    Alas! is not the multitude on the broad way? But will that make it a way for 
    our imitation? The apostle, describing the walk of the Ephesians when they 
    were dead in sins, tells us, it was "according to the course of the world;" 
    Ephesians 2:2. And he urges the Romans not to "conform to it;" Romans 12:2. 
    That way is to be suspected that is the most taking with the multitude.</p>
<p align="justify">4. What it is that keeps sin and iniquity in countenance 
    in the world. It is the multitude of its followers; 1 Peter 4:4. Sin has a 
    baseness or filthiness about it, which is a spring of shame; yet men will 
    refuse to be ashamed of their vile and corrupt courses; Jeremiah 8:12; and 
    some will pride themselves in them, glorying in their shame Why? The 
    multitude stamp these courses with their authority; and so they may appear 
    with open face; for blackness is no reproach among black people. But Christ 
    appearing in the glory of his Father, and all the holy angels, with him, in 
    the end, will sink the glory of the authority of the multitude; then shame 
    will cover them; Daniel 12:2.</p>
<p align="justify">5. No wonder the serious godly have a lonely, 
    uncomfortable, and despised life in the world. Israel was a type of them in 
    that case; Numbers 23:9, "Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be 
    reckoned among the nations." Micah laments his lonely case, because of the 
    multitude being on the broad way; Micah 7:1, etc; he could have few to take 
    part with him, few to unbosom himself to. Hence God's people are the world's 
    wonder; Zechariah 3:8; Psalm 71:7. They are despised as an humorous, odd, 
    fantastic kind of people, addicted to singularities; because the multitude 
    is on another way they dare not take.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The church's peace and prosperity in the world cannot 
    be long lasting; for the corrupt party in the world bears the sway, the 
    multitude being on the broad way; Canticles 2:2. So "the silence in Heaven 
    is but for half an hour," Revelation 8:1; the corrupt multitude soon fill 
    all with confusion again. Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Her peace has often been broken with persecution, 
    the prevailing multitude crying "Crucify him, crucify him." The multitude 
    then like swelling waters go over the head, and threaten to swallow her up, 
    to raze Jerusalem to the very foundations. And had not the Lord been on her 
    side, they had destroyed her quite and clean long before now.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Her peace restored, her purity is removed; Canticles 
    1:6. The multitude on the broad way deface her glory and beauty, and she is 
    made to "lie among the pots;" for a corrupt multitude will still do 
    corruptly, and like the mixed multitude infect all societies, until the 
    infection spread, and the corruption become universal.</p>
<p align="justify">We see it is our case this day. Time was when 
    persecution, blood, and violence rode in triumph; and nothing was heard from 
    the multitude in church and state, but crucify, raze, etc. Now that humor is 
    changed, and the persecutors as well as the persecuted are despised; but 
    there is a general corruption in principles and practice, whereby truth and 
    holiness are wounded in the vitals; a hundred times more dangerous to the 
    church than the persecution was.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. As ever you would escape 
    destruction in the end, do not go the way of the multitude, the way the most 
    go. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Believe it, that the multitude is on the broad way to 
    destruction. Believe it, since Christ has said it. Open your eyes, and you 
    may see it. You have the more need to be fixed in this principle, that we 
    are naturally prejudiced in favor of a multitude, and to think, that the 
    truth and goodness of a cause must needs be on the side of the many. And if 
    that obtain with us in this case, we will be ready to embark, and go down 
    the stream with them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Never think to shelter yourselves in an ill way, among 
    the throng of them that are on it. The throng there may blind you as to the 
    destruction at the end of the way, but can never afford you protection. If 
    the whole world were on the broad way, they could not alter the nature of 
    it, and make that which is evil and destructive, good and safe.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In your course of life, follow not the multitude of 
    the world, but distinguish yourselves from them, though you should undergo 
    the censure of being singular; Exodus 23:2; Romans 12:2. Make not the many 
    in the world your pattern; but choose that way which the best, not which the 
    most are on.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider the way of the multitude is the way to 
    destruction, as is clear from the text; and however people may please 
    themselves with companions in sin, it will be no comfort to go to Hell with 
    company, as may be learned from Luke 16:28. Why should regard to a multitude 
    prevail with us, to go to destruction with them?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. There will be no getting to Heaven without 
    striving against the stream of the multitude of the world; Ephesians 6:12. 
    God calls you to come out from among them, 2 Corinthians 6:17; to forget 
    your people, Psalm 45:10; yes, to save yourselves from them, as from a 
    company of destroyers, Acts 2:40. You must fight your way through them, if 
    ever you would receive the crown; resolute not to go along with them, cost 
    what it will; as our Lord teaches; Luke 14:26, "If any man come to me, and 
    hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and 
    sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. This was the way the cloud of witnesses went 
    before us, refusing the way of the multitude. Thus did Noah in the old 
    world; and thus did Abraham, Moses, and all the prophets. Thus our Savior 
    himself had the multitude against him, he and they walking in a way and 
    manner of life quite opposite; and so all his apostles. Can we think to 
    travel with the multitude, and lodge with the saints in the end?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. What is a multitude against God? Job 9:4. Is it 
    reasonable that the authority of men shouId take place against the authority 
    of God? All men are liars; God neither can deceive, nor be deceived. Why 
    then should not his word be our rule to be stuck to in all things that it 
    requires or forbids, say the contrary who will? Can a multitude secure you 
    from the punishment of sinful ways? No; they cannot secure themselves; Psalm 
    9:17.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 5. Lastly, To follow the multitude, is to 
    strengthen the conspiracy against God. And how will you answer it to him, 
    that when you saw the stream going against him, his work, and his way, in 
    the world, you went along with it, and so added to the force of it? In such 
    a case, he is saying, "Who is on my side? Will you also go away?" It 
    concerns all to see what they will answer to this.</p>
<p align="justify">ADVICE. Let not the scarecrow of singularity frighten you 
    into the way of the multitude. Noah was a very singular man in the old 
    world, and Lot in Sodom; and had they not been so, they had perished with 
    the rest. None will see Heaven, but a singular kind of folk; Mark 8:38.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. It is a strait gate and a narrow way that 
    leads unto life.</p>
<p align="justify">In speaking to this, we will consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The strait gate.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The narrow way leading away unto life.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall consider the strait gate. And having spoken 
    of this already, I shall here drop but a few things of it,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The strait gate is the entrance, and the only 
    entrance into the narrow way that leads unto life. This speaks four things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. That mankind naturally are off the way to life; Romans 
    3:12. And if they hold on the way they begin, they will never see it There 
    is an absolute necessity for all men once to choose a new way, and turn off 
    from the way they are naturally going in. God set upright Adam on a way to 
    life, the way of perfect obedience; Ecclesiastes 7:29; but he left it, and 
    all his posterity in him; Romans 5:12. There is a new and living way opened 
    by Christ, the way of walking in him; Colossians 2:6. This is the narrow 
    way; and that unbelievers were never on.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is access for sinners off the way to life, yet 
    to get on it; Proverbs 9:4–6. Wanderers may yet set right; they that are 
    going in the way of death may yet be set on the way of life. While they are 
    not arrived at their journey's end, there is still hope; therefore, Matthew 
    5:25, "Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with 
    him," etc. But once come to the journey's end by death, there is no more 
    hope; Ecclesiastes 9:10.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a gate, though a strait one, by which they 
    may get through to the narrow way to life. This is the appointed entrance 
    into it; whoever would be in on it, must go about, and enter by it; and 
    going through the gate, they shall be undoubtedly on the way; John 10:9. 
    Look about then to discern it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, There is no getting on the narrow way, but by 
    the strait gate, John 3:5. To climb up another way, is a vain and fruitless 
    attempt. As is one's entrance, so will his progress be. The actions mast 
    needs be of the nature of the principle; and there will be no bringing forth 
    of good fruit in the narrow way, until once the tree be made good by 
    entering in at the strait gate, Matthew 7:17.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The strait gate being the entrance into the way 
    leading to life, it is, in plain terms, an inward and thorough change, 
    relative and real, made on a sinner. For this is it, without which there is 
    no reaching the way of true holiness, the way leading to life. I say,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a change made on the sinner, whereby he is not 
    what he was before; 2 Corinthians 5:17, "If any man be in Christ, he is a 
    new creature; old things are passed away, behold, all things are become 
    new." This cannot be refused by any, who acknowledge themselves born 
    sinners. To continue and go on in sin, in vanity and vileness, is 
    inconsistent with entering on the narrow way to life; Romans 8:13, "For if 
    you live after the flesh, you shall die; but if you through the Spirit do 
    mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live." You must then undergo a 
    change, from what you naturally are and incline to, if ever you mind for 
    life.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is an inward change; Ezekiel 36:26, 27. An outward 
    change without that will not do. A new life and conversation pinned to the 
    old corrupt heart and nature, will make but a painted sepulcher, that can 
    never be pleasing to him, who "sees not as man sees, but looks to the 
    heart;" 1 Samuel 16:7; Matthew 23:27, 28. True holiness lies inwardly, 
    though it shines forth in the outward man; 1 Peter 3:4; and without an 
    inward gracious principle, all is hypocrisy, mere form and show.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a real change, affecting one's nature, and 
    making it new; 2 Peter 1:4. There must be a new temper of spirit, with a new 
    bent and set of the heart; whereby one is made to incline to the way of 
    holiness he was averse to before; and disinclined to the vanity and vileness 
    he was prone and bent to formerly. Therefore it is called a "being born 
    again;" John 3:3, a "a putting on the new man;" Ephesians 4:24. And there is 
    a necessity for such a change, in order to holiness of life; for there most 
    be new gracious qualities in our nature, to be a principle of holy walking.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a relative change, affecting one's state; 1 
    Corinthians 6:11. Children of wrath will always be children of disobedience; 
    and cursed trees will never bring forth blessed fruits. They must be in a 
    state of grace and favor with God, standing in new relations, who shall walk 
    with God, in the narrow way to life; Romans 8:1. To expect that those who 
    are not children of God, will obey him; that those who are not at peace with 
    him, shall serve him acceptably; that they who are under the curse of the 
    broken law, shall walk in the way of life, is vain. The first covenant may 
    have children; but they will be bond-children; to be cast out, not to be 
    heirs; Galatians 4:24, 30.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, It is a thorough change; 2 Corinthians 5:17. 
    It must go through the whole man; every part being sanctified, though in 
    this life no part be wholly sanctified; 1 Thessalonians 5:23. Light let into 
    the head, while there is no gracious change in the heart; a casting away 
    some sins, while others are still stuck to; a taking of some scrapes of the 
    law for the rule of our life, while another part of it is staved off; is a 
    plain evidence, that one is not entered by the gate.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus you see the gate by which one enters the narrow way; 
    thus you have a general prospect of it. To describe it more particularly, 
    there are these seven steps of it—</p>
<p align="justify">1. Conviction, conviction of sin and misery. This is the 
    very first step, the awakening of the sinner, and coming to see himself all 
    wrong. A new light shining from Heaven, the man by it sees his sin as he 
    never saw it before; John 16:8. His sins are set in order before him, and 
    stare him in the face like a Spirit. He sees his actual sin, and his 
    original sin; the evil of them, and their contrariety to the holy' nature 
    and law of God. He sees his misery, he beholds himself lost and undone; Luke 
    15:17; Romans 7:9, under the wrath of God, the curse of the broken law, and 
    the bands of death.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Saving illumination in the knowledge of Christ; 2 
    Corinthians 4:6. This is the merchantman's finding the one pearl; Matthew 
    13:46. Hereby the sinner sees a Savior in the transcendent glory of his 
    person and offices, able and willing to help him out of his state of sin and 
    misery; a Savior suited to the divine perfections, and to his own case; on 
    whom therefore he may freely venture his salvation. This is a higher step of 
    the gate, whereon the sinner is brought in sight of the narrow way.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Renewing of the will, whereby the sinner is made 
    pliable to the gospel-call; Ezekiel 36:26; Psalm 110:3. The iron sinew in 
    the neck is hereby broken; the sinner called by the gospel, is hereby drawn 
    with cords of love and bands of a man. Christ seen in his glory, captivates 
    his heart; John 12:32. By this saving work on the mind and will, the dead 
    sinner is quickened; there is a vital principle put in the soul, whereby the 
    soul is both persuaded and enabled to go up a step.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Faith in Jesus Christ, believing on his name; John 
    1:12. Thus the merchantman buys the one pearl; Matthew 13:46. The soul being 
    drawn comes to Christ, and comes away to him freely, taking him for all, and 
    instead of all; Psalm 73:25. The soul bids an eternal farewell to the way of 
    vanity and vileness, no more to go in quest of happiness there; Jeremiah 
    16:19, looks for the supply of all its wants in and from Christ alone; for 
    by faith we are married to Christ, and so come to rest in him.</p>
<p align="justify">5. New relations to Heaven. This is a glorious step which 
    a sinner gets up to by faith; and it lies here. The sinner having believed 
    in Christ, is united to him; Ephesians 3:17; being united to him, is 
    justified; 1 Corinthians 6:11; being justified, is reconciled to God; Romans 
    5:1; being reconciled, is adopted into the family of Heaven; Ephesians 2:16, 
    19; being adopted, God is his God; John 20:17. Whereas formerly being out of 
    Christ, he was a condemned creature, an enemy to God, a child of the devil, 
    without God in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Habitual sanctification, the sanctification of our 
    nature; Ephesians 1:13; 1 Corinthians 6:11. Hereby the sinner's nature is 
    renewed; Ephesians 4:23, 24, his whole person, soul and body, is sanctified; 
    1 These. 5:23. New qualities are infused into the mind, will, and 
    affections; whereby he becomes a new creature, formed after the image of 
    God, because formed in a likeness to the man Christ, by receiving out of his 
    fullness grace for grace; John 1:16. Thus the seeds of all graces are 
    planted in him, new habits, habits of grace, the immediate principles of 
    every gracious action.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, Repentance unto life, true gospel-repentance; 
    Jeremiah 31:18, 19; Ezekiel 36:31. This is the highest and last step of the 
    strait gate, which immediately sets the man on the narrow way leading to 
    life. It is not that legal repentance, which being the effect of a work of 
    conviction by law, judging and condemning the sinner, falls in with the 
    first step of the strait gate. But it is that whereby a sinner, not only 
    convinced of his sin and misery, but illuminated in the knowledge of Christ, 
    having his will renewed, believing, new related to Heaven, and having his 
    nature sanctified, does turn from sin unto God, out of love to God, and 
    hatred of sin, as contrary to his holy will and nature; which is the only 
    repentance acceptable to God. And before a sinner is thus furnished for it, 
    it is impossible he can reach it.</p>
<p align="justify">But until one is brought to this repentance, he can never 
    set a foot on the narrow way of holiness leading to life; Acts 2:18. For 
    before one can go right, he must needs turn right; and he can never turn 
    right from sin unto God, until he turn thus. The whole gate is a strait 
    gate, and this is a strait step; but no man, without making it first, shall 
    ever go a step in the narrow way; Luke 13:3.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall consider "the narrow way leading away unto 
    life." And here we shall consider, 1. The narrow way itself. 2. Its leading 
    away unto life.</p>
<p align="justify">First, The narrow way itself. That is the way into which 
    the strait gate sets a person; the gate leads him on the way, so that having 
    passed through the gate, he is on this way. Here consider 1. What this way 
    is. 2. The parts of it. 3. The narrowness of it.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, What is this way? This way is the way of holiness; 
    Isaiah 35:8, "An highway shall be there, and a way, and its hall be called 
    the way of holiness." The broad way is the way of one's own heart; the 
    narrow way is the way according to the heart of a holy God; the broad way is 
    the way of vanity and vileness; the narrow way is the way of purity and 
    holiness; Psalm 24:3, 4.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a twofold holiness, habitual and actual. 
    Habitual holiness is holiness of nature, in a holy new frame and disposition 
    of soul, whereby the man is reconciled unto the holy law, which he was at 
    war with before; the heart inclining unto those things which the law 
    commands, and disinclining to, and having an aversion to the things that it 
    forbids, Hence it is expressed by "the law written on the heart;" the 
    renewed heart and the law lying both one way, and agreeing as an honest 
    man's thoughts and written words whereby he expresses his thoughts; Hebrews 
    8:10, "For this is the covenant which I make with the house of Israel after 
    those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, mid write 
    them in their hearts," etc. But this belongs to the strait gate, being that 
    which the entering in at the strait gate issues in.</p>
<p align="justify">Actual holiness is holiness of life, in thoughts, words, 
    and actions of a holy kind; whereby a man walks up in some measure to the 
    holy principles and dispositions of the new nature, and so adds a new life 
    to his new nature; 2 Peter 1:5–7; that is, having gone through the strait 
    gate, ho walks on the narrow way. So, more particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">The narrow way is the way of obedience; 1 Peter 1:14, 15. 
    That is the way that leads to life; even as Jesus Christ was, during his 
    life in the world, obedient even to the death of the cross, and then was 
    received up into glory; whom therefore we must follow in this way, if we 
    mind to be with him in the end; Hebrews 12:1, 2. Now, there are two things 
    that go to the constitution of the way of holy obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">1. For the matter thereof, it is the way of God's 
    commandments; Psalm 119:32. It is the holy law that chalks out this way to 
    us, in the several command of God therein. Where there is no commandment, 
    there can be no obedience. Whatever show of holiness there may be in things 
    that God has not commanded, it is but superstition, not holy obedience; 
    Matthew 15:9. Where there is a transgressing of the commandment, by omission 
    or commission, there is a going off the way of holy obedience, which is 
    bounded on every side by the holy commandment. Thus the narrow way is 
    distinguished from the way,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Of profanity; wherein men walk after their own 
    lusts, casting God's commandments behind their backs. These refuse to be 
    narrowed in their walk by the rule of life given in the word; they look upon 
    it as a thing that would hamper them, and therefore practically say, as 
    Psalm 2:3, "Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from 
    us." Their lusts, not the holy law, is their rule.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Of superstition; wherein men, without the 
    commandment of God, pretend to serve and obey him in a holy manner. This is 
    a narrow way of men's own making, Matthew 5:2. They themselves devise 
    commands of their own hearts, and make things duty or sin, which God has not 
    made so, Colossians 2:20–22.</p>
<p align="justify">In opposition to both these, the narrow way is the way of 
    God's commandments; that, and that only, which is pointed out to us by the 
    authority of God in the moral law of the ten commands; the which the profane 
    man neglects, and the superstitious adds unto; but the true Christian takes, 
    as it stands, for the rule, and the only rule of his life, afraid either to 
    neglect it, or add unto it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. For the form thereof, it is the way of walking in 
    Christ, Colossians 2:6. Without this, the walking in the way of the 
    commandment is no holy obedience, but a legal selfish course of life, which, 
    though it may be of use in society among men, yet is not acceptable to God, 
    because it savors not of Christ, John 15:5. This makes it true Gospel 
    obedience, the only obedience that a sinner can expect to have taken off his 
    hand with acceptance in the court of Heaven. It lies in these four things:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In taking the law as out of the hand, not of an 
    absolute God, but of a God in Christ, Matthew 17:5. Natural men, because of 
    their spiritual blindness, receive the law as innocent Adam did, from God, 
    without eyeing the Mediator as the channel of its conveyance; hence they set 
    themselves to obey it as they can and think meet, that they may have life by 
    their obedience to it. This mars their obedience, makes it servile, and 
    unacceptable to God, Galatians 4:24, 30, because it is not perfect. But the 
    true Christian receives the law from a God Redeemer and Savior in Christ, 
    Exodus 20:1, 2. Hence receiving life by faith in the free promise, they set 
    themselves to obey out of love to a reconciled God, in point of gratitude to 
    the Redeemer, and as the way in which he has appointed them to walk towards 
    the perfection of that life he has purchased, and bestows of free grace.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In depending on Christ for strength for every step 
    of their way, as branches that must bring forth fruit by communication of 
    sap from the stock, John 15:6. This the Apostle exhorts to; 2 Timothy 2:1, 
    "Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus." Hence the Christian goes 
    out in the way of holy obedience, as David went out against Goliath, "in the 
    name of the Lord of Hosts;" 1 Samuel 17:45; "in the name of the Lord Jesus," 
    Colossians 3:17. Therefore in his obedience he is self-denied, and humble, 
    acknowledging himself an unprofitable servant when he has done all.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In depending on him for acceptance of all their 
    obedience, not daring to trust the acceptance thereof to the nature of the 
    work itself, Genesis 4:4, compared with Hebrews 11:4. This is a difficult 
    step in the narrow way, which none but true Christians do make, Philippians 
    3:3. To be denied to our obedience when it is done, to lay no stress of its 
    acceptance, on our diligence, sincerity, and attainments in it, is not easy. 
    However, it is certain, that the acceptance is for Christ's sake only, 1 
    Peter 2:5.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, In daily recourse to Jesus Christ for 
    purging away the errors of our way, Zechariah 13:1. There are none that walk 
    so exactly, but they are still making wrong steps, and contracting new 
    defilement, which cannot be purged but by the application of the blood of 
    sprinkling; nay, there is not one step the best make, but there is some 
    defilement cleaves to them in it, so that still they need to wash their 
    feet, John 13:10. This, then, is the daily exercise in the narrow way; and 
    there is no walking in it but in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">The sum of what is said, is, That the narrow way is the 
    way of holy obedience, wherein one walks in Christ, in the way of God's 
    commandments. And this way of holy obedience may be taken up in these two.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The way of doing or working, in obedience to the 
    preceptive will of God, Ecclesiastes 9:10. God sets every man the work he 
    has to do, his salvation work, and his generation work; in every relation 
    wherein we stand to God or men, our duty is set us by his commandment; he 
    has appointed us what we have to do for his honor, and the good of ourselves 
    and others. And to the performance of every part thereof we are to set 
    ourselves, in obedience to his will, and that in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The way of bearing or suffering, in obedience to his 
    providential will, Matthew 16:24. God allots to every one their particular 
    burden of crosses and afflictions; and requires them to go on their way 
    under them, for their trial. Here is exercise for the bearing graces, faith, 
    self-denial, patience, hope, etc. And we must set ourselves to the Christian 
    bearing of these things, in obedience to his will, and that in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus shall we walk in the narrow way, doing and bearing 
    in Christ, taking our duly and our trial as out of his hand, and going on 
    with both in a believing reliance on him.</p>
<p align="justify">And this way bears a two-fold set of marks upon it, all 
    along from the beginning to the end of it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The footsteps of the flock, Christ's flock, Canticles 
    1:8. It is the way wherein the company of the saints have traveled in all 
    generations; so that those who will see, may see the prints of the feet of 
    Christ's flock on the narrow way, as those of the devil's drove are to be 
    seen on the broad way. On the former you will see the prints of the feet of 
    the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, ail the Old and New Testament saints; on 
    the latter you will see the prints of the feet of Cain, Pharaoh, Judas, and 
    all the wicked in all generations. The habitual practice of the saints is 
    what makes these footsteps in the narrow way, consisting of two discernible 
    parts.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The fore-part, namely, faith, faith in Christ, and 
    the promises through him. This is the fore part of their footsteps, that 
    being it by which the saints from Abel, in all generations, did and suffered 
    great things, Hebrews 11:1–39. They believed, and worked their good works; 
    believed, and bore their trials and afflictions. The promise of Christ was 
    given, Genesis 3:15, to set them at first on the way, and the very first 
    motion on it was Adam and Eve's believing it; and so it has been in every 
    footstep of the flock since, and will to the end, Galatians 2:20.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The hind part, namely, sincere obedience. This is 
    the print of the heel, Hebrews 11:4, 5, 7, etc. Believing the truth, they 
    conformed to it in their lives being cast into the mold of it; receiving the 
    promise by faith, they sincerely obeyed the command; embracing the Gospel, 
    they took the law for the rule of their life, making no exception of any of 
    its commands, as seeing them all stamped with the authority of their God, 
    Creator, and Redeemer; baying received Christ the Lord, they walked in him 
    in all holy obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus the footsteps of the flock are distinguished from 
    all other. Many a different footstep is on the broad way, but none of them 
    all are of this make. The footsteps of atheists and infidels are to be seen 
    there, of profane ones, mere moralists, formalists, and hypocrites; but as 
    the fore part of all their steps is unbelief, so the hind part is profanity, 
    or mere external hypocritical obedience, unacceptable to God. Either they 
    are legalists, pretenders to obedience, and neglecters of faith; or carnal. 
    Gospellers, pretenders to faith, making no conscience of good works, or 
    universal obedience; or they are profane despisers of both. But the 
    footsteps of the flock consist of both together, James 2:18.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The footsteps of Christ himself; 1 Peter 2:21. All 
    mankind having gone off their way, and not knowing how to find it again, it 
    pleased the Father to send his own Son in our nature into the world, that, 
    by his walking in the world, men might see, in a bright example, the way of 
    walking acceptable to God. Accordingly be came, and entering on the narrow 
    way, he walked it all along, and left the prints of his feet thereon from 
    the beginning to the end thereof; Philippians 2:8. In the example of the 
    best of the saints, there are some wrong, out-of-the-way steps; but his 
    footsteps are perfectly regular, without the least imperfection, or the 
    least part of a step out of the way. And they also consist of two parts.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Faith in God his Father, and the promises of the 
    covenant made to him. Christ in his divine nature is the object of faith; 
    John 14:1, compared with Jeremiah 17:5; but in his human nature he was a 
    subject of faith. The man Christ believed in God his Father, trusted in him 
    perfectly, and relied on him, upon the ground of his faithfulness; Psalm 
    22:8, 9; Hebrews 2:13. He had promises of assistance; Isaiah 42:6, 
    acceptance and a glorious reward; chap, 49:8; Hebrews 12:2. And accordingly 
    he waited for the fulfillment of them, and was not disappointed; Psalm 40:1, 
    and declares the divine faithfulness from his experience; verse 10. Yes even 
    now in his exaltation at the right hand of God, he continues his faith and 
    assured hope of what of the promises remains to be accomplished; so that the 
    man Christ in glory is a believing waiter, still, Hebrews 10:12, 13; which 
    should endear to us waiting on God, since the man Christ himself was, and 
    still is one of the company of believing waiters on God. And this shows us 
    how Christ came to receive the seals of the covenant, the sacraments, 
    namely, to confirm his faith in God.</p>
<p align="justify">Here then we have the print of Christ's own footsteps in 
    believing, which also makes the fore-part of them; for the man Christ 
    believed, and so obeyed; which is lively set forth, Isaiah 50:5–7, "The Lord 
    God has opened mine ear, and I was not rebellions, neither turned away back. 
    I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the 
    hair; I hidden not my face from shame and spitting. For the Lord God will 
    help me, therefore shall I not be confounded; therefore have I set my face 
    like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed." Hence when he came 
    into the world, he was circumcised on the eighth day; before he entered on 
    his public ministry, he was baptized, had the voice from Heaven, and then 
    was carried to the wilderness; Mark 1:9–12; and before he entered on the 
    hardest piece of all his work, he received the sacrament of the Passover and 
    of the supper.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Perfect obedience. As his faith was, so was his 
    obedience perfect, every way complete and sinless; 1 Peter 2:22. It was 
    perfect in parts; Matthew 3:15, he fulfilled all righteousness. In the doing 
    part, he accounted nothing too hard, loving his very enemies; in the 
    suffering part, he went through the hardest pieces mildly and, patiently; 
    Philippians 2:8; 1 Peter 2:23; perfect in the degrees of it, everything 
    carried to the utmost pitch; Isaiah 42:4; in the principle of it, love to 
    his Father's glory, and the salvation of sinners; perfect love appearing in 
    the greatest possible instances; Psalm 40:6–8; and in continuance from the 
    cradle to the grave; Philippians 2:8.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus Christ walked the narrow way; and, by the prints of 
    his feet, put another set of marks on it, whereby it is more fully and 
    clearly distinguished from all other ways. The imperfections that attend the 
    saints' walk, leave the matter of the way in some obscurity; so that carnal 
    men noticing them, from thence would make the narrow way very broad, since 
    in many paths of destruction, they can discern the footsteps of saints. The 
    adulterer sees David's footsteps in his way, the drunkard, Noah's; the 
    curser and swearer, and apostate, Peter's; not considering that these were 
    the out-of-the-way footsteps, from which they turned back by bitter 
    repentance, in which steps they neglect to follow them. But the footsteps of 
    the Shepherd of the flock, puts the way beyond all doubt; that it is the way 
    of purity and holiness, the way of faith and obedience, that has nothing in 
    common with the broad way, the way of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, What are the parts of this way, the narrow way? 
    Many are the steps or pieces of the way, from the beginning of it at the 
    point of conversion to God, unto the end of it at death; and it is longer to 
    some than to others, partly because of the various lengths of men's lives, 
    partly because some are so happy as to be more easily converted than others; 
    which two things make an unequal length of the way. But longer or shorter, 
    it consists of two parts.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The way of mortification; Romans 8:13, "If you 
    through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live." This 
    is a part of the narrow way, which lies all along from the beginning to the 
    end of it, in which therefore the saints going towards life must still be 
    making progress, since they will never come to the end of it until death. 
    The strait gate of conversion and regeneration sets one upon it, because 
    these are not perfect; but still there is a mixture of the old with the new 
    nature; of sin and corruption with holiness. It lies in these two.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Mortification to the creature, in opposition to the 
    way of vanity. This is begun in the soul's coming to Christ; Jeremiah 16:19, 
    and is to be carried on all along the believer's life after; Canticles 4:8, 
    until he be without the reach of an enchanting deluding world, no more to be 
    moved either with its smiles or frowns. Paul was on that way when he said; 
    Galatians 6:14, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our 
    Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the 
    world." The Lord carries on his people in it, by ordinances, giving them 
    there lively views of creature vanity and emptiness, in the glass of the 
    word, sacraments, prayer, meditation, etc; by providences laying gall and 
    wormwood on the breasts of the creature, until the believer be as a weaned 
    child; Psalm 131.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Mortification to sin, in opposition to the way of 
    vileness that unregenerate sinners walk in, Romans 6:6, 7. This is to get 
    the mouth out of taste to the pleasures of sin, to be dying to it, to he 
    rooting up the weeds of sin daily, that grow up in the soil of an evil 
    heart. And it reaches to the whole body of the sins of the flesh, if it be 
    genuine mortification, Colossians 2:11. If any one is known and spared, it 
    is no true mortification; the man is in the way to death and destruction, as 
    the ship to sinking where one leak is neglected to be stopped, Psalm 119:6. 
    Particularly, it reaches to,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Particular lusts and corruptions, the members of 
    this body; Colossians 3:5, "Mortify therefore your members which are upon 
    the earth; fornication, impurity, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, 
    and covetousness, which is idolatry." These are many, and of divers kinds, 
    fleshly lusts, and spiritual lusts; pleasing lusts, and tormenting passions. 
    All come under the name of worldly lusts, which the gospel teaches to deny 
    the cravings of, Titus 2:12. On every one of them, men in the way to life 
    keep a watchful eye, to knock them down as they begin to set up their heads; 
    to wrestle against them, seeking their death and destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">In a special manner, that lust which one is most addicted 
    to, commonly called one's predominant; whether it be the sin which one's 
    constitution, calling, circumstances, or anything whatever, makes most 
    easily to beset him, Hebrews 12:1; that must be mortified, though it be as 
    hard to compass as to pluck out a right eye, or cut off a right hand, 
    Matthew 5:29, 30. And none can prove himself on the narrow way, without the 
    mortification of that, Psalm 18:28. And we may judge of our progress in the 
    narrow way, by our progress in that.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The sin of our nature, the body itself whereof these 
    particular lusts are the members, called the flesh, Galatians 5:24. That 
    sinful disposition that is born with us, making us prone to evil, and averse 
    to good; ready to comply with temptations to sin, hard to be brought up to 
    our duty; holding fast ill impressions made, and letting good ones easily 
    slip. The axe of mortification must be laid at the root of the tree, if we 
    would take the narrow way.</p>
<p align="justify">Now these are mortified by refusing compliance with them, 
    and acting the graces contrary to them, Galatians 5:16, 17. Hereby they are 
    starved and weakened, and grace is cherished and strengthened, Romans 13:14; 
    Hebrews 5:14.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The way of vivification, or newness of life, Romans 
    6:4; in the practice of good works, Titus 3:8; that is, thoughts, words, or 
    deeds agreeable to the will of God, and pleasing in his sight. This is 
    another part of the narrow way, which lies all along from the strait gate to 
    the end of the way at death; which the grace implanted in the heart in 
    regeneration exerts itself in; for the new nature must have its fruit in 
    newness of life, whereby a man lives to the honor of God, his own good, and 
    the good of mankind. It also lies in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Living to God, in opposition to the creature, 
    Galatians 2:19. The unregenerate man is dead to God, but alive to the 
    creature; all the inward motions of his soul are towards the creature, not 
    towards God. It is his portion; his joy is in the having of it, and his 
    sorrow in the want of it. He has no kindly motion towards God for himself, 
    more than they that are in the grave. But entering the strait gate of 
    regeneration, one becomes alive to God, Romans 6:11; and dead to the 
    creature, Colossians 3:3. And so he goes on the narrow way, as dying to the 
    creature, so living to God; resting in him as his portion, seeking him 
    always as his chief good, loving him above all, rejoicing and delighting in 
    the enjoyment, of him, sorrowing for the want thereof, and for sin that mars 
    the light of his countenance, Colossians 3:1–3. All this the tenor of his 
    life witnesses, Psalm 30:5; and 4:6, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Living to righteousness, in opposition to sin, 1 Peter 
    2:24. The unregenerate are dead to righteousness, but alive to sin, Romans 
    6:20; as free from righteousness as those in the grave from what is done on 
    the earth, they meddle not with it, Ephesians 2:1. But entering the strait 
    gate of regeneration, they are put in a state of death to sin, and of life 
    to righteousness, Romans 6:4; Colossians 3:1; they awake to it, 1 
    Corinthians 15:34. And so they go on in the narrow way, living to it as 
    servants of it, Romans 6:18. And this their living to righteousness extends 
    to the whole will of God known to them, Acts 13:22; Colossians 4:12; and 
    makes their obedience universal, Colossians 1:10. It lies in these following 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Living to righteousness towards God; that is, living 
    godly, Titus 2:12. There is a duty that in justice we owe to God 
    immediately, as our Creator, Preserver, and Redeemer; that is, the duty of 
    piety, in all the instances thereof required in the first table. Whoever 
    walk on the narrow way, live to pay that duty, as owing, in point of 
    righteousness and gratitude too. Therefore they are concerned to live to 
    honor him in the world, taking that for their chief business in it, 
    Philippians 1:21; and see no comfortable use they are for in the world, if 
    they get him not honored in their stations. So they look on their interest 
    as twisted with the interests of his glory.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Living to righteousness towards ourselves; that is, 
    living soberly, Titus 2:12. We owe a duty to ourselves, and it is bound on 
    us with a bond of justice or righteousness, in as much as we are not our 
    own, but the Lord's. That duty is required of us in the second table 
    obliging us to consult the good, honor, and welfare of our own bodies, to 
    treat them as the temples of God, and therefore to hold off from all things 
    that may be hurtful or defiling to them; and to advance the good of our own 
    souls, by aiming at and pursuing after their perfection in truth and 
    holiness, Philippians 3:14; and to hold off from what may darken or pollute 
    them. And this is a great part of the business of the life of those on the 
    narrow way.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Living to righteousness towards our neighbor; that 
    is, living righteously, strictly so called, Titus 2:12. We are not born for 
    ourselves, but for others also; and we owe a duty to mankind, our 
    fellow-creatures, according to the several instances thereof required in the 
    second table. Since we are men, we must always keep on, never cast off 
    humanity towards any of our kind, be they rich or poor above us or below us. 
    We should breathe a universal good-will toward mankind, seeking the good of 
    our kind, and disposed to acts of beneficence towards them, as we have 
    ability and opportunity. This humanity requires, justice makes a debt, and 
    Christianity inspires men with, who are on the narrow way, Galatians 6:10; 
    Luke 6:36. Ah! how will we answer to our common Father, if we take no care 
    to be useful to, and in our generation? What stock have we laid up for the 
    other world, if we have not laid out ourselves for the good of others in 
    this? Luke 16:9. That temper of spirit whereby one is selfish, concerned for 
    none, but his sweet self, is a flaming evidence of being on the broad way; 
    and much more that whereby one is disposed to ran down all about them, to 
    spread their terror around them, to be a plague to society, disturbing all 
    that are near them, Ecclesiastes 9:18. If those in that temper see Heaven, 
    we must give up the Bible as a fable, and confound Heaven and Hell, Isaiah 
    11:6; Titus 3:3; James 2:13; Revelation 13:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus you see that those on the narrow way look upward, 
    inward, and outward, laboring each of these ways to be useful, and to fill 
    up their room in the world; so living to righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">And these two parts of the narrow way Christ has chalked 
    out to his followers by his death and resurrection, which are the exemplary 
    causes of mortification and vivification.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, Let us consider the narrowness of the way to 
    life. This narrowness of the way is not absolute, but respective, in respect 
    of the imperfection of our present state; for the boundaries of it are 
    eternal, it being for substance the very same the saints will walk in 
    through eternity, when they will walk at greatest liberty. But a way may be 
    very narrow and pressing to one, that will be perfectly large and easy to 
    another, in regard of the very different sizes the passengers may be of. So 
    a shoe may be very strait for a swelled foot, that will be large abundantly 
    for the same foot, when it is hale and sound. The glorified saints have a 
    hale foot; so the way is large and broad enough to them in life; we have the 
    swelled one; so the way, though for substance the same, is narrow to us 
    going to life. Now the narrowness of the way to life rises from a 
    complication of these three.</p>
<p align="justify">1st. The exactness and purity of the law that bounds this 
    way of holy obedience, Psalm 119:4. No sinful latitude is allowed here; 
    every wrong step is condemned by it. It hems in the traveler on every side, 
    and that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To the right matter of obedience; which is not to be 
    measured by man's choice but God's command; Matthew 15:9. If it is devised 
    by a man's own heart, whatever species pretext of sanctity it has, it is 
    rejected with a "Who has required this at your hand?" Isaiah 1:12; and far 
    more if it is forbidden of God, it is an abomination to him, though one 
    should be so blind as to think it good service; John 16:2. There is no holy 
    obedience but in what is commanded of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the right manner of obedience. Suppose it be a 
    thing that in itself is duty, yet if it is not done in a right manner, it is 
    no walking in the narrow way. Here the traveler is hemmed in to,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The love of God, as the principle of his obedience. 
    His labor mast be a labor of love, else it is lost labor; Hebrews 6:10. Love 
    to God himself must dispose us to obey him, else he will not reckon we obey 
    him at all; for he sees the heart; and what is not with the heart can never 
    be acceptable; 2 Corinthians 8:12.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The will of God must be not only the rule, but the 
    reason of our obedience; Ephesians 6:6, 7. It is no true faith, but where 
    one believes because God has said it; nor holy obedience, but where the 
    thing is done because God has bid it. So one may do what God commands, and 
    yet not obey him, if he does it not in obedience to his command.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) To the glory of God as the chief end of his 
    obedience; 1 Corinthians 10:31. If anything else have that place, God will 
    not reckon it obedience to him; Zechariah 7:6. So there is much lost labor, 
    where though the thing in itself be duty, yet it is marred by the low and 
    selfish ends it is done for; Matthew 6:1. Thus ministers may lose their 
    preaching, people their prayers, any body whatever good they do, doing the 
    same for selfish ends.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, Faith in God through Christ, as that which 
    casts their obedience into the mold of gospel-obedience, the only holy 
    obedience of a sinner; Colossians 3:17. The work of faith in the case is to 
    fetch in strength from Jesus for holy obedience; 2 Timothy 2:1, and so to 
    perform it, Philippians 4:13; and then to lay it over on Jesus for 
    acceptance with God, Hebrews 11:4, 6.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The bias of the heart that lies away from and 
    contrary to the holy law. This the apostle complains of as what made his 
    walking in the way uneasy; Romans 7:21. There are notable remains of the 
    natural enmity in the best while they are here, a woeful disposition not 
    liking to be bounded by the pure commandment. There are lusts of the heart 
    that bend forth on every side, and cannot be hedged in without pain. Hence 
    the way appears narrow, and feels strait and pinching; and the walking in it 
    is indeed one continued struggle to the end; the way of holy obedience lying 
    quite cross to the natural inclination, over the belly of which the traveler 
    most go. Now there being nothing of this in Heaven, the way of obedience 
    will not be narrow to the saints there.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, The many embarrassments in this way from without. 
    Our text (Gr.) calls it an afflicted or compressed way. Had the children of 
    God no more ado but to make their way forward in the path of God's 
    commandments, over the belly of their own corruptions, they might have 
    enough ado with it. But that is not all; whatever impediments or 
    entanglements Satan and an evil world can get laid in their way, will be 
    sure to be found there. Hence they have thickets of temptations, 
    tribulations, discouragements, etc., to break through. Sometimes the smiles 
    of the world are gladly to flatter them off their way; sometimes its frowns 
    to frighten them from it; and sometimes a speat of ill example is like to 
    carry them off their feet. Besides all this, there are trials from the hand 
    of God to be met with in it. So that it is a way beset with briars and 
    thorns; Ephesians 6:12; John 16:33. Hence, Hebrews 12:1, 2, "Let us lay 
    aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us 
    run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the 
    author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him 
    endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of 
    the throne of God."</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, We are to consider this way its leading away to 
    life. And here I will show, 1. What is that life it leads to. 2. How the 
    narrow way leads to it.</p>
<p align="justify">First, What is that life the narrow way leads to? That is 
    in a word, a happy life in the other world; Mark 10:30. Entering the strait 
    gate, the dead sinner gets life, else he could never go on the narrow way; 
    and the life then received is eternal; for from the moment it is received, 
    it shall never be extinguished through the ages of eternity. But there is so 
    great a difference, in degrees and attending circumstances, between the 
    believer's life here, and in Heaven, that this last is called life by way of 
    eminency. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Heaven is the region of life where no death can enter; 
    but whoever is there, lives; Revelation 21:4. This world at best is a 
    mixture of the dead and the living, even above ground; and more than that, 
    the dead always are the far greater part in the mixture, which makes this 
    world an unsavory, melancholy place to them in whom spiritual life is begun; 
    Psalm 120:5. But when they come there, they will find themselves in the land 
    of life, where there is no winter, but an eternal spring; no dead, but all 
    living.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Their life will be perfected there; Hebrews 12:23. It 
    is begun here indeed; but yet there is a great mixture of death with it, 
    even in the liveliest saints here; they have a whole body of death carrying 
    about with them; Romans 7:24. But there will not be the least member of it 
    about them there. Even their life of comfort will be completed there, though 
    they may have much ado to keep it from extinction here.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, No death can ever have access there; but there 
    life will be spun out in joy and comfort to all eternity, without any 
    interruption. While they are here they still know that death is abiding 
    them; but when they arrive there, they know they are forever beyond its 
    reach any more. They are set down there by the fountain of life, and allowed 
    a full participation of the waters of life, that they can die no more.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, How does the narrow way lead to life? And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st. NEG. Not by way of merit, proper or improper. Proper 
    merit is what arises from the intrinsic worth of the thing done, fully 
    proportioned to the reward. Such is the merit of Christ's obedience and 
    death. But no such merit can be in our works; for there is no proportion 
    between our obedience and eternal life, whatever the papists pretend; Romans 
    8:18; 2 Corinthians 4:17; and whatever they be, they are due from us to God; 
    Romans 8:12; Luke 17:10. Improper merit is what arises from  ensuring 
    such a reward on such a work as the condition thereof; so that the work 
    being performed, the reward becomes a debt. So Adam's perfect obedience 
    would have been meritorious. But no such merit is in our works. Legal 
    Protestants advance this, though they do not call it merit, while they 
    pretend that God has promised eternal life on condition of our obedience; 
    thinking it enough to free them from the doctrine of merit, that they do not 
    pretend to an intrinsic worth in the works, proportioned to the reward. But 
    what more do they yield in this, than innocent Adam behooved to have 
    yielded, had he perfected his obedience? Do they not hereby confound the two 
    covenants? for all the difference remains only in degrees, which do not 
    alter the kind. The scripture rejects this as well as the other; Romans 4:4, 
    and 6:23. Paul would not lippen to it; Philippians 3:9.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Positively, The narrow way leads to life by way of 
    order and connection. It leads thereto,</p>
<p align="justify">1. By way of order in the nature of things, whereby one 
    thing necessarily goes before another. Thus the beginning of a thing goes 
    before the end of it; and there is no reaching the end without beginning it. 
    So the narrow way is the beginning of the Christian course, eternal life in 
    Heaven the end of it, Romans 6:22. Thus the sun rising must go before its 
    getting to the meridian, the seed-time before the harvest, and the first 
    fruits before the whole. So walking in the narrow way must go before life in 
    Heaven, Proverbs 4:18, Psalm 126:5, Romans 8:25. This establishes infallibly 
    the necessity of holy obedience, it being as impossible for subjects capable 
    of holy obedience to see life without it, as to reach the end without 
    beginning the work, etc., Hebrews 12:14. But will any say, that the 
    beginning, the sun rising, etc., are the condition upon which the end is 
    given, the sun is set to the meridian, etc.?</p>
<p align="justify">2. By way of connection, whereby one thing is knit with 
    another, whether in the nature of things, or by special appointment. Thus 
    the means and the end, the way and the journey's end, are connected in the 
    nature of things; that whoever neglects the means cannot reach the end; that 
    whoever takes not the way cannot reach the journey's end. So the narrow way 
    is the mean to be gone through, the way to the journey's end eternal life, 
    Philippians 3:13, 14. Thus the wrestling and the prize, the Christian fight 
    and the crown, are connected by divine appointment; but the former does 
    neither properly merit the latter, nor is it the condition thereof, 2 
    Timothy 4:7, 8, compared with Revelation 4:10. In the narrow way there must 
    be fighting, because there is opposition; but if you go along that way, you 
    will get to life, even as if you go by such and such places, you will get to 
    such a city; yet is not the going that way the condition of admission into 
    the city.</p>
<p align="justify">The true state of the matter lies here. Eternal life is 
    freely given to the soul here in the first moment of believing; it is begun 
    in them, John 3:36, and 5:24, 1 John 5:12. It exerts itself, and has its 
    operation and progress in the walking in the narrow way; and death being the 
    end of the way, where the body of death is dropped, the soul then comes to 
    have that life completed, as one having perfected the journey enters the 
    city. The which overthrows all merit and conditionality of works as to 
    eternal life, and in the meantime infallibly establishes the necessity of 
    them to it, namely, considered in its perfection in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">Practical inferences may be deduced from the whole.</p>
<p align="justify">First, An easy entrance on religion is somewhat 
    suspicious like and needs to be examined; because it is a strait gate that 
    leads to life. I will not take on me to deny a sovereign gospel-way of 
    conversion, that swallows up any notable law-work, though I have no 
    experience of it. A sovereign God must not be limited; but I may say this,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is not the ordinary way. Ordinarily a law-work, 
    greater in some and lesser in others, goes before, according to that 
    Galatians 3:24, "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster, to bring us unto 
    Christ, that we might be justified by faith." Thus the converts, Acts 2, 
    Paul, the jailor, and others. And hereto I believe the experience of 
    Christians generally does agree. As for Lydia, she was a convert before, a 
    Jewish proselyte, Acts 16:14.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The easy way of entering on religion is a flaw in the 
    foundation, in the case of some; Matthew 13:20, "But he who received the 
    seed in stony places, the same is he who hears the word, and anon with joy 
    receives it." Where observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is a receiving the word of the Gospel at first 
    brush, anon.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is a mighty stir in the affections at that 
    reception; the party is transported with joy.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The flaw lies in the superficialness of the work, 
    its not going deep enough, verse 5, namely, by the digging work of 
    conviction and humiliation, Luke 6:48, so that the party has no root, 
    Matthew 13:21.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, As it came lightly, it goes lightly, ibid.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Whoever pretend to it, ought well to examine it before 
    they sit down contented with it. And this may be done, to the sufficient 
    clearing of the matter.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) By considering what their entrance, whatever it was, 
    set them into. If it set them into a sound and thorough repentance for sin, 
    the matter needs no more dispute; if not, their pretenses are vain. If their 
    repentance was sound and thorough, whatever they had or had not before, they 
    then got a piercing sight and sense of the sin of their lives, and sin of 
    their nature too, and sincerely repented of both; Galatians 5:24, and 
    particularly of their predominant, from which their hearts would then be 
    loosed in a particular manner; Luke 19:8.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By considering what way they are on. If their 
    habitual tract and course of life is a course of holy obedience, let them 
    not disquiet themselves as to the manner of their entry; for it is not 
    possible to get on the narrow way, but by the right gate; Psalm 119:6. But 
    as the strictest law-work issuing in a loose course of life, will be found 
    to have been but a foretaste of Hell; so an easy way of entering on 
    religion, followed with a loose and licentious course of life, will be found 
    to be the wide gate and broad way to destruction. That was the religion of 
    some, whom in our fathers' days they justly called Antinomians and Ranters, 
    who, pretending to a sovereign gospel-way of conversion, gave the swing to 
    their lusts, and led scandalous lives, a reproach to the gospel. But if that 
    be the gate to life, we may throw by our Bibles, and regard them no more; 
    but</p>
<p align="justify">(2 Peter 2:17.) "these are wells without water, clouds 
    that are carried with a tempest, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved 
    forever."</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Strictness in religion, nice, exact, and 
    pointed walking therein, is not only justifiable, but necessary; for narrow 
    is the way that leads unto life, and it will not allow wide steps. It is the 
    way of the world to expose the entering by the strait gate under the name of 
    "melancholy, madness," and "distraction;" and strict walking on the narrow 
    way, under the name of "fantastic singularity, preciseness, and needless 
    nicety." But let the world cry it down as they will, the Bible, and 
    particularly our text, cries it up as not only justifiable, but necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">But before I come to justify it, and show the necessity 
    of it, I mast first fix the true notion of it. For there is a spurious 
    strictness in religion, which is oft mistaken for the genuine strictness, 
    especially by the parties themselves; whereas the former belongs to the 
    broad way, the latter only to the narrow. That there is such a spurious 
    strictness, is without controversy; Acts 26:5, "After the strictest sect of 
    his religion, Paul lived a Pharisee;" and therefore the apostle's caution is 
    very necessary; Galatians 4:18, "It is good to be zealously affected always 
    in a good thing." Now,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This spurious strictness in religion, which is to be 
    rejected as a work of the flesh, is a strictness of men's own making. It is 
    not God's commandment that girds them so strait; but where God leaves them 
    at liberty, they bind up themselves; and so their strictness is downright 
    superstition in the sense of the Bible, however they may pretend to be 
    enemies to superstition; Matthew 15:9; Colossians 2:20–22. And so it is, 
    though they may take themselves to be bound to it, by God's commandment, 
    while in reality there is no such thing; John 16:2. For an erring conscience 
    taking that for God's command which is not so, can never make it so; Acts 
    26:9. It may be discerned by,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Its disproportionableness, making men more strict in 
    these things, than they are in the things unquestionably commanded of God; 
    Matthew 23:25. Nature is always fond of its own brats; and will treat them 
    as one does his own children, while uncontroverted duties are treated like 
    step-children; even as the earth gives its strength to the weeds, while the 
    flowers have much ado to fend.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Its justling out some substantial duties of 
    religion; Matthew 15:2–6. So the apostle teaches that the spurious 
    strictness of some clashed with the sixth command; Colossians 2:22, 23. No 
    duty can be contrary to another. When therefore some point of strictness 
    clashes with some moral duty of the ten commands, carrying one off from it, 
    be sure it is strictness of the wrong sort. Thus while men's strictness bars 
    them from the ordinary means of grace, in which Christ feeds his people, and 
    from the duties of love and beneficence towards their neighbors, we may be 
    sure it is spurious.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, Its giving a set to men's spirits quite unlike 
    the spirit of the gospel. Spurious strictness arises from a legal 
    disposition, and gives the spirit a legal set and bias, reckoning highly on 
    their strictness; Philippians 3:6, 7. It puffs up with pride and 
    self-conceit; Colossians 2:18, fills with bitterness of spirit: Titus 3:3, 
    and gives a fireiness of spirit, inconsistent with the spirit of the gospel, 
    which is a spirit of love and meekness: James 3:17. This strictness is to be 
    avoided, as dishonoring to God, injurious to one's own soul, and hurtful to 
    our neighbors.</p>
<p align="justify">2. But there is a genuine strictness for all that, the 
    which is recommended in our text. And it is a strict walking up to the 
    revealed will of God, so far as we know it, in all things; not daring to 
    come and go on these points, but sticking close to them, though to our loss 
    in the world; being inflexible in them, over the belly of temptations, the 
    world's contrary example, its fairest smiles, and bitterest frowns.</p>
<p align="justify">What girds the man here, and makes him inflexible, is, 
    the authority of God on his conscience; Acts 4:19, 20. Wherefore, be the 
    thing in itself never so small, and the loss or hazard in cleaving to it 
    never so great; yet being commanded of God, he must stick to his point. It 
    is enough to him; Psalm 119:4, "You have commanded us to keep your precepts 
    diligently."</p>
<p align="justify">There is a twofold measure of this strictness; and all 
    that is in or over it, is condemnable as looseness.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The law of God, the law of the ten commandments; James 
    1:25; Ezekiel 18:5–9. That is the eternal rule of righteousness, which no 
    circumstances whatever can make cease to bind. What in our practice comes 
    short of that, whether with respect to our duty to God, ourselves, or 
    neighbor, is a defect of true strictness, and what is over, is spurious 
    strictness, unacceptable to God; for there is no wisdom in being wise above 
    what is written.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The example of Christ; 1 Peter 2:21. Herein we have 
    the former set before our eyes, that we may the more clearly discern it, and 
    find it the more powerfully enforced. Our Lord Jesus was in his life the 
    perfect pattern of true strictness; 1 Peter 2:22. He was indeed, by a 
    spuriously-strict generation of legalists, accused as not strict enough, 
    because he observed not the traditions of the elders, would not go to their 
    heights to refuse tribute to Caesar, scrupled not the society of publicans 
    and sinners, that he might do good to their souls, nor to make clay on the 
    Sabbath-day to advance a moral duty of the sixth command. But in all these 
    things he was the strict party, walking closely up to the law of God; they 
    were the loose party, as going aside from it. And so will they be found, 
    who, under pretense of strictness, bind up themselves from those things 
    wherein they have his example to follow. The closer we are to Christ's 
    example, the more truly strict are we.</p>
<p align="justify">This strictness may be discerned by,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The uniformity of it, Psalm 119:6. Truly strict in 
    one, strict in all, James 2:11. For a man to pretend to be strict in some 
    opinions, and loose in his practice; strict in duty to God, but loose in 
    duty to man, is abominable. The truly strict will be a strict observer of 
    his words and thoughts as well as his actions; of his relative duties to 
    man, as a parent, child, master, servant, etc; as well as of religions 
    duties to God, praying, reading, etc; of truth between man and man, as well 
    as of the truth of religious principles.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The due proportion kept in it, proportioning the 
    concern to the weight of the matters. The neglect of this is taxed; Matthew 
    23:23, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for you pay tithe of 
    mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the 
    law, judgment, mercy, and faith; these ought you to have done, and not to 
    leave the other undone." As the least filing of gold is gold; yet the 
    greater the weight the more is the worth, and ought to be the concern for 
    it. So though no revealed truth, nor commanded duty is to be slighted; yet 
    religion and reason say that according to their weight and worth our concern 
    for them should be regulated. And it is as absurd to let our zeal run out so 
    on circumstantial truths, as to swallow up our concern for fundamentals; to 
    show more concern about ceremonial duties, than the substantial duties of 
    morality; as it is to guard the feet and legs, and to leave the heart open 
    to the sword of the enemy.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, The gospel-spirit where with it is managed, 
    Philippians 3:3. True strictness arises from faith in Christ in the heart, 2 
    Corinthians 4:14, 15. So the man walks strictly, as if he were to win Heaven 
    by his strictness; meanwhile he quits it all in point of confidence, as if 
    God had not required it. Hence true strictness is always attended with a 
    gospel set of spirit; whereby the man is jointly concerned for the honor of 
    the holy law, and of the grace of the gospel; is adorned with self-denial, 
    humility, meekness, love to God, and love to mankind, good-will and 
    beneficence to his fellow creatures.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the true notion of strictness thus stated,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It is altogether justifiable, however it is run down 
    in the world, and looked on with an evil eye. To justify it, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The infinite majesty of God, whose commands are here 
    strictly stuck to, Exodus 20:2. Will any man come and go upon his prince's 
    orders given him, whatever he do with what he is bid by others? The infinite 
    distance between God and us, fully justifies a precise regard to all his 
    commands, an inflexible adhering thereto in every point, though the whole 
    world should countermand them. And were it duly considered, it would oblige 
    to exactness of obedience without disputing, without shifting, Acts 4:19.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The risk that is run by tampering in these matters, 
    Matthew 10:28. Let the matter be weighed in an even balance; put the 
    greatest loss and hazard in the world in the one scale, to bring off from 
    strictness; the displeasure of God must be laid in the other; and is not 
    that sufficient to outweigh the former, and to determine a wise man to the 
    side of strictness. So, as long as God's frowns are more terrible than the 
    world's, religious strictness will be justifiable.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The life of Christ in the world. Was it a strict life 
    or not? It certainly was; for he could say, "I do always those things that 
    please the Father," John 8:29. Was it justifiable or not? Was he to be 
    condemned as too precise? If his life was justifiable, how can they be 
    condemned for strictness, who make it their pattern? especially considering, 
    that he left us an example to follow, and that they do not fully come up to 
    the strictness of it. Truly the wounds the carnal world give to the 
    strictness of Christians, go through their sides to Christ himself, who was 
    vastly stricter than they can reach; and they will reckon for them; Jude 
    verse 15.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Man's state of perfection. Every being is allowed to 
    aspire towards its perfection; and shall it be a crime in a man to aspire 
    towards his? Now, man's perfection lies in the religious strictness 
    described before. This appears from this, that the glory of God is the chief 
    end of man, and man glorifies God by conforming to his law, the eternal rule 
    of righteousness; so that the more exact that conformity is, the more does 
    he reach that end; and when he is arrived at a fully strict conformity to 
    it, then he is at his perfection. This was the road God set innocent Adam 
    on, who fell by letting down his strictness. This is the point the glorified 
    saints in Heaven are arrived at, where there is perfect strictness, without 
    the least deviation. How then comes strictness to be so treated in the 
    world? Are they angry that some endeavor to get out of their ruins, going, 
    though, alas! slowly, in the way towards their perfection?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It is not only justifiable, but necessary,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In respect of the command of God; Psalm 119:4, "You 
    have commanded us to keep your precepts diligently," [Hebrews exceedingly;] 
    to a degree, a pitch of exactness. And what that is, we see, Mark 12:30, 31, 
    "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your 
    soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength; this is the first 
    commandment. And the second is like, namely this, You shall love your 
    neighbor as yourself." The apostle wills Christians "to walk circumspectly;" 
    Ephesians 5:15. [Gr. exactly, nicely, precisely;] going up to the utmost of 
    everything. The pure law requires the utmost purity and exactness; and it is 
    blasphemy to think or say, that Christ has relaxed anything of the purity 
    required in every command. Therefore strictness is as necessary as the 
    authority of God can make it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In respect of its being commanded on our utmost peril; 
    Matthew 5:19, 20, "Whoever shall break one of these least commandments, and 
    shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven; 
    but whoever shall do, and teach them, the same shall be called great in the 
    kingdom of Heaven. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall 
    exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case 
    enter into the kingdom of Heaven." Should we leave ourselves loose in any 
    one point, we risk our salvation, as the ship does sinking wherein one leak 
    is left unstopped, verse 29. No length of time will excuse our giving 
    ourselves the loose; Matthew 24:13, nor no hazard in the world whatever; 
    Mark 8:38.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In respect of our necessary conformation to Christ; 1 
    John 2:6, "He who says he abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even 
    as he walked." How necessary it is that we be conformed to Christ, the 
    apostle teaches; Romans 8:29, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did 
    predestine to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the 
    first-born among many brethren." Our baptism shows it; Galatians 3:27, "For 
    as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ." And 
    that we cannot be if we are not strict in religion. By a loose, careless 
    course, we carry the image of the first Adam; and by a strict course of 
    life, we must bear the image of the second Adam.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, As an evidence and character of sincerity; 
    Psalm 119:6, "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all your 
    commandments." The reason hereof is manifest from James 2:10, 11, "For 
    whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty 
    of all. For he who said, Do not commit adultery; said also, Do not kill. 
    Now, if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you are become a 
    transgressor of the law." For if any command is respected as the command of 
    God, all his commands will be so; since they all bear the impress of the 
    same divine authority. And one's taking it on him to come and go on God's 
    commands, is an evidence that God's authority has no due weight with him. 
    See the touchstone of sincerity; John 15:14, "You are my friends, if you do 
    whatever I command you."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall give you the following advices for true 
    strictness in religion.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Begin your strictness at the right end, in entering 
    the strait gate by a sound conversion; Luke 13:24. Unconverted strict folk 
    their case is most hopeless; Matthew 21:31, 32. Solomon gives the reason; 
    Proverbs 26:12, "See you a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope 
    of a fool than of him."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Set before your eyes the true rule of strictness, 
    namely, the law of God and the example of Christ. The constitutions of 
    churches, opinions, practices, and examples of parties getting the room of 
    these, have in all ages bred much spurious strictness. But "to the law and 
    to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because 
    there is no light in them," Isaiah 8:20. If we be Christians, let Christ's 
    example be our rule.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Put on the bands of true strictness, being impressed 
    habitually with the authority of God on your consciences, and the 
    constraining love of Christ in your hearts. These are the straitening bands 
    of God's making; Exodus 20:2, "I am the Lord your God, which have brought 
    you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Be well apprized of the matter of true strictness. It 
    lies only in things wherein God has bound us up, not in things wherein we 
    bind up ourselves without his authority. And you may know it by these two 
    marks:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It bears hard on the natural inclination and lusts 
    of the heart. These find themselves straitened by the band; Matthew 5:29, 
    "If your right eye offend you puck it out," etc. Whereas spurious strictness 
    is agreeable to these, and feeds and nourishes them. So the former is 
    difficult, the latter is easy to the natural man. What an easy thing is it 
    to maintain a strict opinion, to separate from a church, when there is no 
    hazard? But to maintain a strict practice in the substantial duties of 
    religion, to separate from the unregenerate carnal world in one's state and 
    frame of life, is not easy.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is a promoter of sanctification of the soul, and 
    makes one a better man, advancing the strength of grace, and conformity to 
    the image of God in the whole man; Romans 14:17. What the better were the 
    Pharisees that they would not eat with unwashed hands, nor go near publicans 
    and sinners? How much more may strictness be known to be trifling and 
    spurious, that has a native tendency to bring leanness on the soul?</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Be strict in the faith and a holy life. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Let every truth be dear to you, sticking to it on 
    all hazards, without giving up with it; Proverbs 23:23, "Buy the truth, and 
    sell it not." For none of the truths of God, but are more precious than all 
    we have to lose for them. But it is a weakness to think that there is no 
    keeping of the truth without breaking of the peace with them that differ; 
    Romans 14:14, compared with verse 3; Philippians 3:15, 16, while the 
    foundation-truths remain for the bond of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Be strict in inquiring into sin and duty in 
    particular cases, habitually; Proverbs 3:6. You profess to take Christ for 
    your leader; then consult him in all things, that you may know what he calls 
    you to by his word and providence. That is a strict man that observes the 
    motions of the pillar of cloud and fire, and its rests, that he may move 
    thereby or rest.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Act in all things by a religious principle; 
    Colossians 3:17; 1 Corinthians 10:31. Since the law of God is a perfect 
    rule, it cannot but reach all human actions; either by particular precepts, 
    or general ones, such as Philippians 4:8, and these reaching temporal as 
    well as spiritual matters. It is true strictness then to act so.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Never consider for your practice, whether a thing be 
    but a little sin or a great one. If it be a sin at all, avoid it, tamper not 
    with it; 1 Thessalonians 5:22, "Abstain from all appearance of evil." Jude 
    verse 23, "Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh." Be it never so 
    little, it will leave a great stain on the soul; which, if not purged by the 
    blood of Christ, will drown it in perdition. And little sins make way for 
    greater.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) In doubtful practices, wherein you are not clear, 
    choose always the side safest for the conscience, whatever there be to draw 
    you to the other. If there is a case wherein you are not sure whether the 
    doing of such a thing is sinful or not, you are sure there will be no sin in 
    forbearing it? Then let it alone; Romans 14:5, 23.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) Be strict observers of your duty to God, in all the 
    instances thereof required in the first table. Do not make light of dropping 
    a duty now and then, a prayer in secret, or in your family, a sermon, etc. 
    The case and loss of Thomas deserves consideration here; John. 20:24, 25, 
    "But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus 
    came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. 
    But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the 
    nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand 
    into his side, I will not believe." If providence bars you from it, it is 
    not you that drop it, but God ceases to require it.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) Be pointed and nice in your duty to man, in all the 
    instances thereof required in the second table. Remember the flaw in the 
    Pharisees' strictness; Matthew 23:23. Walk precisely by the rules of justice 
    towards others; being readier to quit a halfpenny to them, than to keep two 
    pennies off them, as you would rather abide a stress by cold, than take a 
    burning coal into your bosom. Be just and faithful in your business, 
    whatever it is, as knowing that whatever is gained by unfaithfully-done 
    business, is unjustly got, and stolen with you. Stick precisely to truth, 
    hate and despise lying. Loose talkers, that have not a strict regard to 
    truth in common life, whatever regard they pretend to divine truths, are and 
    shall have their part with the abominable; Revelation 21:8. More 
    particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">(8.) Be conscientiously strict in the duties of your 
    relations, as knowing your relational stations are those wherein God has set 
    you for the time, to take trial of you. If you are a parent or child, a 
    husband or wife, a master or servant, closely live up to the duties of your 
    relation; and let your strictness be of a piece, and let not a but fall in 
    your relation; a very good man or woman, but a tyrannical husband, etc. And 
    where undutifulness of your relatives mar the exercise of softer principles, 
    learn to act by a principle of justice and reason.</p>
<p align="justify">(9.) Have a strict and awful regard to the character of 
    superiority that God has given to any over you; for that superiority is a 
    piece of the divine image. It is looseness of conscience, not true 
    strictness, that takes away all sense of that, and allows no regard to them 
    that bear it, unless their personal character be winning; that is in effect, 
    they will regard them for their own sake but not for God's sake; Jude verse 
    8; 1 Peter 2:18.</p>
<p align="justify">(10.) Be the same in secret as in public. Let your 
    strictness take place where no eye sees but God's, as well as where the 
    world's eye is on you; for if it be of the right stamp, it will be so; Acts 
    24:16. For the law and conscience are the same, and God is the same in 
    secret as before men; and if you are not the same, you are strict only to be 
    noticed by men.</p>
<p align="justify">(11.) Lastly. Be strict observers of your own heart, as 
    well as your life; Proverbs 4:23, "Keep your heart with all diligence; for 
    out of it are the issues of life." If you be never so strict in your outward 
    man, it will be loathsome hypocrisy if the inner man is not watched; Matthew 
    23:27, 28; Romans 2:29.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus ordering your life, you will be persons of Christian 
    strictness, whom Christ will own, and which he will approve at the last day, 
    when the looseness of the world, and their spurious strictness, will both 
    appear naught.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE V. Last. Few of mankind find the strait gate, 
    and narrow way leading to life.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this subject, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Explain the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Confirm it.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give the reasons of it.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. To explain this point, we shall, 1. Consider how few 
    find the strait gate and narrow way. 2. Show in what respects they are few.</p>
<p align="justify">First. We shall consider how few find the strait gate and 
    narrow way. And it may be taken up as importing these three following:</p>
<p align="justify">1. All are naturally off from it, Romans 3:23. Mankind 
    was carried off from it in Adam, even all of them to a man, verse 12. And 
    man's natural state is a state of wandering, wandering on the mountains of 
    vanity, in the wilderness, like lost sheep, straying passengers; and behold 
    the end of their course, Proverbs 21:16, "The man that wanders out of the 
    way of understanding, shall remain in the congregation of the dead."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is not easily found out by any, 1 Peter 4:18. In 
    all cases the best things are hardest to reach; so while the wide gate and 
    broad way are fallen on with all ease, the strait gate and narrow way are a 
    darned road that one cannot easily light on. We are so liable to passions, 
    prejudices, and misapprehensions about it, it is so far above our natural 
    capacities, that there is no finding it out without the Spirit of Christ 
    pointing it out to us effectually.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is but few that discover it, so as on good grounds 
    to be able to say, This is it. There are so many false gates and ways, that 
    seem to be it, but are not, that they are rare persons who are not deceived 
    by one or other of them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Few enter by the strait gate, and travel the narrow 
    way, though there is no other passage for sinners unto life. It is a gate 
    and way but little frequented. It is not many that are brought within sight 
    of them; but of these many draw back, and but few enter and go on. There are 
    but few regenerate persons, sound converts, truly holy ones, in the world. 
    The most part go in the way of sin, few in the way of holy obedience, 
    walking in Christ, in the way of God's commandments.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Howbeit there are some that do enter by that 
    gate, and travel that way. In the worst of times there are always some sound 
    converts, truly holy in the world, and will be to the end, Matthew 16:18. 
    When their number is completed, few as they are, the world will be at an 
    end.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, In what respects are they few?</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are not few absolutely, or considered in 
    themselves. If we consider the general assembly of them, Hebrews 12:23, them 
    that have, do, and shall find it, they are a goodly company. They are a 
    great multitude, so great that they pass all human numbering, Revelation 
    8:9; they are so many, that they are like the stars, innumerable, Genesis 
    15:5, compared with Galatians 3:29. The shed blood of a Savior springs up in 
    an innumerable issue.</p>
<p align="justify">They are upon the way but by parcels, being like an army 
    who began their march at the sounding of the march, (Genesis 3:15.) to the 
    heavenly city, have continued it all along since that time to this day, and 
    will continue it yet for a time, namely, to the end of the world. It is now 
    four thousand years and more, since the van, the first generation, ended 
    their march, and were settled in the city, the righteous Abel being the 
    first man that entered it; and since that time all along the following have 
    been entering in their order. There is a part of that host now upon the way, 
    advancing to the city; but the rear is not as yet began to more. They that 
    are upon the way at a time, are in different nations and parts of the earth; 
    they in the same country are often but few of them together upon one spot. 
    Hence speaking what they see and feel, their mouths are filled with such 
    complaints of solitude as these; Psalm 12:1, "Help, Lord, for the godly man 
    ceases; for the faithful fail from among the children of men." Micah 7:1, 
    "Woe is me, for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the 
    grape-gleanings of the vintage." But stay until the whole host have finished 
    their march, and appear in one body in the heavenly city, they will be there 
    such a vast multitude as no man can number, but the man Christ their 
    captain, whose understanding is infinite, because he is God.</p>
<p align="justify">Let not the fewness of them that find it, frighten any 
    from it, because they cannot think of being solitary, wanting much company. 
    For it is but for a little by the way that they will be tried with 
    solitariness. They that live godly in the lonliest abode, shall before long 
    be forever in a glorious throng, where they will have glorious company.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are, nevertheless, few comparatively, in 
    comparison with those that, entering by the wide gate, go the broad way. 
    Though considered by themselves, they are a great multitude, yet compared 
    with them in number, they fall far short of them. The regenerate are few in 
    comparison with the unregenerate, sound converts with the unconverted, the 
    truly holy with the unholy, saints with sinners, those that find the strait 
    gate with those entering the wide gate.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To confirm this heavy truth, we shall take a twofold 
    view to clear it. 1. A view of the scripture-account of this matter. 2. A 
    view of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">First, We shall take a view of the scripture-account of 
    this matter.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Our Lord expressly tells us, that of the many called 
    few are chosen, Matthew 20:16, and 22:14. Now, all those that enter the 
    strait gate, and are on the narrow way, are chosen, Revelation 17:14. Faith 
    is the faith of God's elect, Titus 1:1, and they only are brought unto holy 
    obedience, 1 Peter 1:2. All the elect are called, Romans 8:30. But all the 
    called externally by the Gospel are not elect or chosen; on the contrary, 
    many are called that way, and but few chosen; so that of those to whom the 
    Gospel-call comes, there are but few chosen and brought in by the strait 
    gate to the narrow way; the multitude of them still wander. And then many 
    are not even externally called.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's flock is of those, who, entering by the 
    strait gate, go the narrow way, following him, John 10:27, Canticles 1:8. 
    But his flock is a very little one, namely, in comparison of the devil's 
    drove; Luke 12:32, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good 
    pleasure to give you the kingdom." In vain will one pretend to restrict that 
    to the disciples or believers then present; since it agrees to all his to 
    the end of the world, verse 35–40. His children are comparatively so few in 
    the world, that they are for signs and wonders; Isaiah 8:18, "Behold, I and 
    the children whom the Lord has given me, are for signs and for wonders in 
    Israel." A certain evidence that they are very rare. And that this is meant 
    of Christ is clear, from Hebrews 2:13, "Behold, I and the children which God 
    has given me." Israel was a typical people, chosen out of the world, few in 
    comparison of the rest of the world; and Christ's flock are his Israel.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The scripture represents them under such terms as 
    respect a greater multitude from whom they are distinguished. They are the 
    first-born, Hebrews 12:23; and how few the first-born are in comparison of 
    other children, every body knows, being but one of each family, even of the 
    most numerous families: the first fruits, Revelation 14:4, James 1:18. But 
    how small are these in comparison with the whole harvest? So the 
    Scripture-account states them but few.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Let us take a view of the world. In whatever 
    period we cast our eye on it, we will find that still the broad-way men were 
    the multitude, the other the few.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The generation before the flood was such. Good men 
    were rare in it, but evil men abounded exceedingly. What a character have 
    they? Genesis 6:11, 12, "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the 
    earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and behold, 
    it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth." And the 
    flood sweeping all away but eight persons, clears it demonstratively, that 
    there were very few, if any, godly among them. The apostle calls them the 
    world of the ungodly, 2 Peter 2:5.</p>
<p align="justify">2. From the flood to the calling of Abraham, how few were 
    good men! That mighty apostasy, headed by Nimrod, who with his followers 
    built the tower of Babel, demonstrates this, Gen 11; they being such a vast 
    company, that they were divided into many nations, with the confusion of 
    their languages, while the original holy tongue remained with the race of 
    Shem, that had no hand in that rebellion against Heaven; as it did also, I 
    think, with the Canaanites that were engaged in it. But then even Shem's 
    race was fearfully degenerate when Abraham was called; Joshua 24:2.</p>
<p align="justify">3. From Abraham to Moses, what a doleful case was the 
    world in, sunk in idolatry and profanity! I will by no means say, that in 
    these days there was no true religion or godliness, but in Abraham's family; 
    Melchizede, Ishmael, etc., were good men; but certainly they were very few 
    in these days; ten could not be found in Sodom. In Jacob's family itself 
    Rachel had stolen her father's images, Jacob had occasion to purge his 
    household of strange gods. How low was religion sunk, even with them, while 
    they were in Egypt? See Ezekiel 20:6–8, Romans 5:13.</p>
<p align="justify">4. From Moses to Christ, or from the erecting of the 
    Jewish Church, and all along under the law, until the setting up of the 
    Gospel-kingdom among the Gentiles, by the apostles, making the New Testament 
    church, there was the same face of affairs in the world. The ceremonial law 
    was the hedge of the church, separating her from all other societies, and 
    enclosing her among the Jews, and the few proselytes that came to her from 
    among the nations. The rest of the nations in the world at that time were 
    sunk in idolatry, ignorant of the true God, and the acceptable way of 
    worshiping him, Acts 14:15, 16. And what a figure made the Jewish church 
    generally during that time, at every turn going off to idolatry, profanity 
    spreading, formality prevailing, may be learned from their prophets, whom 
    from time to time they murdered, until at length they murdered the Lord of 
    glory, Matthew 23:31, 32, Acts 7:52. How few was the number of the truly 
    godly even among them in all ages? What a heavy life had Moses among them? 
    David complains, Psalm 12:1, "Help, Lord, for the godly man ceases; for the 
    faitful fail from among the children of men." Isaiah chapter 1:9, "Except 
    the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been 
    as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah." Jeremiah, chapter 
    9:2, "Oh! that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, 
    that I might leave my people, and go from them; for they be all adulterers, 
    an assembly of treacherous men." Micah, chapter 7:1, "Woe is me, for I am as 
    when they have gathered the summer-fruits, as the grape-gleaning of the 
    vintage; there is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the first ripe fruit."</p>
<p align="justify">5. From the setting up of the New Testament church until 
    the grand apostasy under Antichrist, the narrow way was still trod by few in 
    comparison; as is evident from the accounts we have in the New Testament, 
    the persecutions everywhere raised against the apostles, and the state of 
    the churches quickly after their erection, as Corinth, Galatia, and the 
    seven churches of Asia. For the first three hundred years Paganism continued 
    the national established religion in the empire, and Christians were treated 
    as slaughter-sheep. When peace was restored, and Christianity was 
    established by law, damnable heresies broke in among them, and particularly 
    Arianism overspread all; and the apostasy went on until it issued in the 
    darkness and apostasy under Antichrist.</p>
<p align="justify">6. During the time of the reign of Antichrist, until the 
    Reformation, a thick darkness overspread the Christian world. It so 
    prevailed that "all the world wondered at the beast," Revelation 13:3, that 
    is, the Christians, and particularly the European world. Those on the narrow 
    way were so few, that they were represented by two witnesses prophesying in 
    sackcloth; Revelation 11:3.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, From the Reformation to this day, is the last 
    period the world has yet seen, and that we account our own times; which, 
    however they have increased the number of the ungodly, beyond what they were 
    before the Reformation, yet afford but a melancholy view of the fewness of 
    them on the narrow way. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is not a third part of the world that professes 
    Christianity at this day; so that were they all godly that are baptized, and 
    profess the name of Christ, they would be but few. Nay, it is reckoned, that 
    dividing the world into thirty parts, nineteen of these are inhabited by 
    Pagans, who know not the true God; six by Jews and Muhammadans, who reject 
    Christ, not acknowledging him the Savior of the world. So five only of 
    thirty remain professing Christianity.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Of these five, two are reckoned of the communion of 
    the Greek church, who have a very miserable face of Christianity among them; 
    denying the souls of the faithful departed to be admitted to the beatific 
    vision until after the resurrection; praying for the dead; admitting 
    children at seven years of age to the supper, thinking they then begin to 
    sin; adorning their churches with pictures; ministers and people sunk in 
    gross ignorance. The other remaining three parts are divided between the 
    Popish and the Protestant churches, the former being idolaters and 
    Anti-Christian.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, In the Protestant churches there are but few 
    that appear to be on the narrow way, in comparison of those therein on the 
    broad way. There are multitudes that are, according to the scripture, to be 
    cast out of that happy number; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Gross heretics, sunk in fundamental errors, denying 
    the imputation of Christ's righteousness, his satisfaction, his Godhead, 
    blaspheming the holy Trinity. Of which sort not a few are to be found in the 
    Protestant churches; not to mention the deists, who regard neither Christ 
    nor Antichrist, rejecting the bible and the gospel by the lump. These surely 
    are none of the number; Galatians 5:19–21, "Now the works of the flesh are 
    manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, impurity, lasciviousness, 
    idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, 
    seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such 
    like; of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, 
    that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Jude 
    verse 4, "For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of 
    old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God 
    into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus 
    Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The grossly ignorant. What swarms of these are to be 
    found in the churches, who have no tolerable measure of the fundamental 
    principles? We may, by observing how many such are among those on whom pains 
    are taken to instruct them, guess how they abound in countries and 
    congregations where no tolerable care is taken of that matter. So that the 
    bulk of people in many places are careless about and quite rude in these 
    things. Now, "it is a people of no understanding; therefore he who made them 
    will not have mercy on them, and he who formed them will show them no 
    favor," Isaiah 27:11.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The profane, who are openly vicious in their lives, 
    walking in the broad way with a witness. These everywhere abound, having 
    nothing of Christianity but the name, are a public nuisance to society, and 
    therefore a scandal to the Christian profession; which has no doubt 
    contributed to the bringing of Christianity under contempt; Galatians 
    5:19–21, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Mere moralists, who lead a civil life in the world, as 
    good neighbors in society, but worship not God, if it is not in the public 
    congregations, and have not so much as a form of godliness. These also must 
    be cast out; Matthew 5:20, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the 
    righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, you shall in no case enter into 
    the kingdom of Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Naughty professors of religion, such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those who are a scandal to a profession, by their 
    habitual course of untenderness of life. They will talk of religion, but in 
    their walk there is nothing of it to be seen. They will go about religious 
    duties, but then their tongues, hands, and feet go at random all the rest of 
    their time, as if they did these to get leave to walk licentiously, as was 
    the case with the whore; Proverbs 7:14, 15, "I have peace-offerings with me; 
    this day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet you, diligently 
    to seek your face, and I have found you."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They who, though they are regular in the most of their 
    way, yet vent their naughtiness in someone or other scandalous practice, 
    hanging about them, such as injustice, lying, evil speaking, intolerable 
    pride and self-conceit, deceitfulness, etc. This makes secret disgusts among 
    professors, alienating their affections; Matthew 5:19.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Those who are as blameless in the outward man, as 
    human frailty permits; yet still retain some idol or idols of jealousy in 
    the heart, and never come to a sincere compliance with the whole will of God 
    revealed to them; Psalm 66:18, and 119:6.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Inexperienced professors, strangers to the 
    work of grace on their hearts, and the life of God in their souls; who have 
    no experience of converting, regenerating grace; and no acquaintance with 
    the life of faith, the spiritual combat, and communion with God in duties; 
    John 3:3. 2 Timothy 3:5.</p>
<p align="justify">Cast out these, how few do remain! So it is evident as 
    the light that few of mankind find the strait gate and narrow way leading to 
    life.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall give the reasons of the point: or, whence it 
    is that few find the strait gate and narrow way. It arises from,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The natural blindness of men's minds; Ephesians 4:17, 
    18. They cannot discern it in its heavenly excellency, beauty, and glory; 1 
    Corinthians 2:14. They hear of it, and are pointed to it, but their eyes are 
    held that they cannot see it nor find it, as the Sodomites about the walls 
    of Lot's house. And until the eyes of one's understanding are opened by the 
    Spirit, he will never take it up; and that is the privilege of few; Isaiah 
    53:1. Human learning, wit, and sense, avail not here.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The perverseness of men's wills; John 5:40. Men 
    naturally have a listlessness for it; they care not for it, therefore they 
    do not find it. Nay, they have an aversion to it, their hearts are set 
    against it; Romans 8:7. And until the will be renewed, they will never come 
    on the narrow way. A day of power, the mercy of few, is necessary to bring 
    them to it; Psalm 60:3. And when the Spirit is at work with them for that 
    end, they struggle against it like a hooked fish in the water.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The natural bent, propensity, and attachment, to the 
    broad way. That is the way of men's own hearts, as the way of water is to go 
    down, not up the brae; so that let them alone, they would never choose, 
    desire, nor seek another, Isaiah 57:17, and in the depth of sovereign wisdom 
    the multitude is let alone; they get their will with a vengeance. They will 
    have head; Job 21:14, and get it; Hosea 4:17.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Satan is busy to keep them off from it; 1 Peter 5:8. 
    He is the great seducer, who bewilders sinners, leading them into byways, 
    according to their different tempers and dispositions. He represents the 
    narrow way in frightful colors, the broad way as pleasant and safe; so fills 
    them with prejudices against the former, and in favor of the latter. And if 
    at any time a sinner is like to enter the strait gate into the narrow way, 
    he doubles his diligence, and plies him closely to keep him off from it.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Ill example falling in with the natural 
    inclination, carries all headlong before it; Matthew 18:7. There is some 
    good example too in the world; but then it goes against the stream of the 
    natural inclination, and so proves ineffectual. But ill example, going with 
    the stream, easily prevails; men are apt to promise themselves peace in an 
    evil way, on which they see others going, and enjoying peace too.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. of Information. Hence learn,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Most of mankind then must perish, since there is no 
    getting to life but through the strait gate and narrow way, which few find. 
    Proud men, from a conceit of their own excellency, cannot admit this, that 
    God will cast away the most part; but the fallen angels were of greater 
    excellency of nature than men; yet he casts them all away, saves none of 
    them. They see not the consistency of it with his mercy; but mercy must be 
    regulated with justice, otherwise it is a softness unfitting the Judge of 
    all the earth; and mercy will have its triumph in saving some, even all that 
    take the way for it consistent with justice. They say, that then Adam will 
    be more prevalent to ruin, than Christ to save; but it is more to save one 
    sinner, than to ruin thousands, yes a world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Saints then must needs be a singular kind of persons 
    in the world, having a way of their own different from that the multitude go 
    in; for they are few that find the narrow way. This cannot miss to make them 
    look an odd sort of folk, fantastic, and humorous in the eyes of the world, 
    Isaiah 8:18, 1 Peter 1:4. And whoever cannot digest that character from the 
    world's hand, but must needs, for preserving their reputation, conform to 
    the world, and the way in vogue with the multitude, are not fit for Heaven. 
    They are the fearful, Revelation 21:8, deniers of Christ, Matthew 10:33, as 
    ashamed of him, Mark 8:38.</p>
<p align="justify">3. No wonder the interests of religion be low in the 
    world: it has few cordial followers. Truth falls in the streets, and 
    holiness of heart and life is rare; both are unfashionable, the guise of the 
    world lies contrary to both; for few find the narrow way. That religion is 
    greatly run down, sometimes persecuted, always mocked and maligned, cannot 
    miss, while the state of matters is such that few find the narrow way.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Then certainly it is not easy to be a 
    Christian, to fall on the strait gate and narrow way. The unconcernedness 
    and carelessness of men about religion, as if they could hardly go wrong in 
    that matter, is unaccountable. Can it rationally be thought an easy thing to 
    hit that mark which the most part miss? to find that way which but few of 
    mankind do find? But that fond conceit of the easiness of finding it, is one 
    great reason why so few find it.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Exhortation. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Let all consider well and examine what way it is 
    they are on. Ask yourselves, Am I on the broad way, or on the narrow? and 
    endeavor to be clear as to that concerning point.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. This is a point of the utmost concern to you; 
    death and life hang upon it. If you are on the broad way, you are on the 
    road to destruction, if on the narrow way, on the road to life. And will you 
    be careless as to such a weighty point? will you not do your own souls the 
    justice to consider of it?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. It is certain you were once on the broad way, 
    Ephesians 2:3. The only question competent here, is, Whether you are brought 
    off from it into the narrow way, or not? If you never saw yourselves on it, 
    it is a sad token you are on it still, though you perceive it not; 
    Revelation 3:17, 18. Though your eyes have been opened to see yourselves on 
    it, and your danger on it, it is a question for all that, Whether you are 
    brought off it, or not?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. The most part are on the broad way, few have 
    found the narrow one. You have the more need to consider which of them you 
    are on. If many had found, few missed the narrow way; yet since there are 
    any who miss it, the matter being of such weight, might oblige you to put it 
    to the trial as to yourselves; much more ought you to put it to the trial, 
    when they are so few that find the narrow way, and so many miss it.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. There are many ways taken for the narrow way, 
    that are not it; and self-deceiving is rife in the world; Proverbs 21:2, and 
    none more confident than the fool, chapter 12:15. Therefore try your way, 
    before you trust it.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 5. Lastly, It will be a fearful disappointment the 
    careless sinner will meet with at last, a frightful awakening the sleepy 
    thoughtless sinner will get, falling into destruction at the end of his way; 
    Matthew 25:11, 12, "Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, 
    Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Truly I say unto you, I know you 
    not." Isaiah 50:11. "Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that compass 
    yourselves about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the 
    sparks that you have kindled; this shall you have of mine hand; you shall 
    lie down in sorrow." Awake therefore in time, and consider your way before 
    it be too late.</p>
<p align="justify">After what has been said on both the ways, I will only 
    add two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. If you are on the narrow way, you have entered by the 
    strait gate of conversion to God; Matthew 18:3; you have felt the bitterness 
    of sin, and therein the bitterness of death; have been brought freely away 
    out of yourselves to Christ by faith, and through him unto God by a sincere 
    repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. If you are on the narrow way, you feel the narrowness 
    of it, yet are resolute not to leave it, but go through with it; and so your 
    life is a continued struggle; Philippians 3:14. The commands of God are your 
    rule, the example of Christ your pattern, the will of God the reason of your 
    walk, the honoring of God the end and design of your life, and the Christ of 
    God the fountain of your strength for the way.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly You who are not yet on the narrow way, set 
    yourselves to find it; use your utmost endeavors to get at it by the strait 
    gate, for otherwise there is no reaching it. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be not easy without, but seek to experience a work of 
    sound conversion on your souls. Pray for it, hear the word for it, and muse 
    on your own case for it, admitting conviction and cherishing it; laboring to 
    get such a sight of Christ in his glory and beauty, as may lead you to 
    thorough repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Set yourselves for a life of holy obedience, following 
    the footsteps of Christ himself, and the footsteps of the flock. Apply 
    yourselves to the way of mortification, dying to the creature and to sin 
    daily; to the way of newness of life, living to God in opposition to the 
    creature, to righteousness in opposition to sin.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Lastly, You who are on the narrow way,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Bless God for it, and be thankful, that while he 
    reveals it to few, he has revealed it to you; that you are among the few, 
    and not among the many.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Walk circumspectly. Satan will be laying snares for 
    you, that you may stumble and fall, and if possible to get you off from it. 
    The fewer are on it, the world notices them the more, ready to improve their 
    wrong steps to the dishonor of the way. The greater will your sin be, if you 
    walk not worthy of such a rare privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Walk on resolutely, however narrow and straitening the 
    way be to you; for it leads to life; and the broad way, however easy, to 
    death and destruction.</p>
