    Isaiah 25:8, "He will swallow up death in victory!"</p>
<p align="justify">SUCH as are desirous duly to manage this solemn communion 
    occasion, will have in their view the other world. We are all on a journey 
    towards it, and, if suitably exercised, will improve this occasion to lay 
    down our measures for eternity. Between us and that other world, lies the 
    great gulf of death; through it are two passages; one deep and devouring, 
    where the sinner passes alone; there the waters flow with all that force and 
    strength which they acquired by the breach of the covenant of works. By this 
    passage, sinners are thrown out into the land of utter darkness and misery. 
    The text shows us the other passage, which is shallow and safe, where the 
    sinner passes on at the Mediator's back, the waters being dried up by the 
    soles of his feet, whoever passes this way, enters into Immanuel's land, the 
    land of life; for "he will swallow up death in victory."</p>
<p align="justify">In these words, we have a prophecy of the happy success 
    of a battle fought by the Mediator on account of elect sinners. The success 
    is most certain; therefore it is in the Hebrew, "He has swallowed up," 
    &amp;c.—Here consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The combatants; the two mightiest that ever 
    encountered. Upon the one hand is death, with his devouring month, a 
    champion who never yet could find his match among the children of men, until 
    the great HE, in the text, entered the lists against him, even Jesus Christ, 
    who being man, was capable of feeling the force of death; but being the Lord 
    of hosts also, verse 6, could not but be conqueror at length. So death and 
    the Mediator are the combatants.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The encounter of the combatants, implied in these 
    words, "He will swallow up death in victory." Death attempting to prey upon 
    that elect world which was given to Christ by the Father, he, as Mediator, 
    to pluck that prey out of death's devouring mouth, encounters the terrible 
    enemy while he is making havoc of poor sinners; and, having taken upon him 
    the guilt of his elect, which gave death a power over them, death advances 
    against him, and attacks him, and he abides the contest. No sooner was he 
    born, than Death, mounted on his pale horse, advanced against him, and 
    striking at him, filled Bethlehem with the blood of babes and the shrieks of 
    parents. Though it could not then reach him the deadly blow, it pursued him 
    still, shot out its poisonous arrows against him all along, until they came 
    to a close engagement on the cross, where it wrestled him down even into the 
    grave, the proper place of its dominion. So the Mediator got the first fall.</p>
<p align="justify">3. But behold the issue of the battle. Death, who in all 
    other battles wins whatever party loses, loses the day here; the victory is 
    on the side of the slain Mediator. The slain Savior again revives, gets up 
    upon death, stands conqueror over it, even in its own territories, breaks 
    the bars of the grave, takes away the sting it fought with against him, and 
    puts it and all its forces to the rout; so that it can never show its face 
    against him any more, Romans 6:9, "Knowing that Christ being raised from the 
    dead, dies no more, death has no more dominion over him."</p>
<p align="justify">4. The Mediator's pursuit of the victory, until it be 
    complete for these that are his, as well as for himself: "He will swallow up 
    death in victory." The vanquished enemy has yet many strongholds in his 
    hand, and he keeps many of the redeemed ones at under; some of them as 
    prisoners, that they cannot stir; others of them though they can stir, yet 
    can go nowhere, but they must drag the bands of death after them. But the 
    Mediator will pursue the victory until he swallow up death, totally abolish 
    it out of his kingdom, that there shall no more of it be seen there forever, 
    as a thing that is swallowed up is seen no more at all; our Lord is cutting 
    it down daily, and the last of it shall go over at the last day, 1 
    Corinthians 15:54, "So when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and 
    this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall he brought to pass the 
    saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.—These words 
    contain in them this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That our Lord Jesus, having fought death, and 
    obtained the victory, will pursue the victory, until death be utterly 
    abolished out of his kingdom.—Three things are here to be attended to.</p>
<p align="justify">I. The battle.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The victory.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The pursuit.—After which,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I shall subjoin some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall consider the battle between death and the 
    Lord of life.—And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Under what character has the Lord of life fought this 
    battle? He fought it,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As the head and representative of the elect world, 
    as their Mediator, who took burden on himself for all that the Father had 
    given him; for otherwise he had nothing to do with death; nor had it any 
    concern with him: John 5:15, "I lay down my life for the sheep." Adam, the 
    head of all mankind, had betrayed us all into the snare of death, we were 
    not able to break it, or to make our escape thence; but Christ undertook it 
    for the elect, as their Head, and so sought death in their room and stead: 1 
    Timothy 2:6, "Who gave himself a ransom for all." "But he was wounded for 
    our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of 
    our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed," Isaiah 53:6. He 
    bare what we should have borne, stood the shock which would have ruined us; 
    he was wounded and bruised in this battle, but all for us. Verse 8, "For the 
    transgression of my people was he stricken." And hence we are reckoned in 
    law to have died in him: Romans 6:10, 11, "For in that he died, he died unto 
    sin once; but in that he lives, he lives unto God. Likewise reckon you also 
    yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus 
    Christ our Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As their Redeemer and Deliverer: Hosea 13:14, "I 
    will ransom them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death: 
    O death! I will be your plagues; O grave! I will be your destruction." By 
    sin we fell a prey to devouring death, the broken law concluded us under the 
    power of it. The prey could not be taken from this mighty one, without both 
    price and power; so Christ engaged with death, and by his death ransomed 
    death's prisoners: Hebrews 2:15, "That through death he might destroy death, 
    and him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them 
    who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage." He 
    spoiled it of its power, that they might get free. The kingdom he had 
    received of his Father could not be recovered, nor the captives set free, 
    without stroke of sword, his overcoming death, that held them fast; 
    therefore he fought the battle.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) As a captain or general at the head of his people: 
    Hebrews 2:10, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are 
    all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their 
    salvation perfect through sufferings." God has designed that the elect shall 
    fight their way to Heaven, and therefore has given them Christ as a leader 
    and commander: Isaiah 55:4, "Behold I have given him for a leader and 
    commander to the people." They most march through the Red Sea of death to 
    the upper Canaan; but Christ goes before, drying up the waters. There are 
    cords of death on the most lively believer, yet he must set himself to break 
    them; but Christ has made them like a thread of flax, when it touches the 
    fire. They must encounter the king of terrors; but the King of glory, 
    marching in the front, has received all the deadly sting—I shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The attack made upon him by death. Death, finding the 
    Mediator standing in sinners' stead, advances against him with all its 
    forces, with which it was furnished by the breach of the first covenant; 
    and, when managing this contest,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Death brings up its strength against him, that is, 
    the law, 1 Corinthians 15:56, "The sting of death is sin, and the strength 
    of sin is the law," which, finding him a sinner by imputation, out him down, 
    Galatians 4:4, "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the 
    law." The law cries for justice against sin, and justice takes the Mediator 
    by the throat, saying, Pay what you owe; then he "restored what he took not 
    away," Psalm 69:4. The law brings up against him a black band of curses, and 
    pours into his soul: Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse 
    of the law, being made a curse for us." It soon began to shoot its arrows 
    against him. When he was born, he must be born in a stable, laid in a 
    manger, for there was no room for him in the inn; persecution is raised 
    against him in his infancy; he must be all along a man of sorrows, poor, not 
    having where to lay his head; he is hungry, thirsty, weary, etc. At length 
    the battle grows hotter, the heavens are black above his head; and in the 
    garden, and on the cross, showers of arrows dipped in the curse fly at him. 
    He sweats bloody drops, falling down to the ground,—cries out, "My God, my 
    God, why have you forsaken me?"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Meanwhile he who has the power of death (Hebrews 
    2:14.) advances against him, Satan sets upon him in the wilderness with most 
    grievous temptations, Matthew 4. Being beat back, he returns, and renews the 
    assault: Luke 4:13, "And when the devil had ended all the temptations, he 
    departed from him for a season." At length the hour and power of darkness 
    comes, and then the bands of Hell exert their utmost vigor against him, 
    storms from Hell blow hard upon him, the fountains of the great deep are 
    opened on him: John 14:30, "Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the 
    prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me." Colossians 2:15, "And 
    having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, 
    triumphing over them in it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The congregation of men dead in trespasses and sins 
    stir up themselves against him: Isaiah 53:3, "He is despised and rejected of 
    men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid, as it were, 
    our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not." Judas betrays 
    him, the Jews gape on him like a lion, crying, Crucify him; Pilate condemns 
    him; he is scourged, crowned with thorns, smitten on the crowned head, his 
    body racked until it was all out of joint, nailed to the cross, hangs there 
    mocked, and pierced with a spear.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Death comes with its sting upon him, and pierces him 
    to the heart, and casts him down dead: 1 Corinthians 15:56, "The sting of 
    death is sin:" this gives it the power of hurting any. The guilt of all the 
    sins of the elect lay upon him, which could not but make the sting of death 
    inexpressibly sharp and piercing. Thus a thousand deaths in one met together 
    on him, for the Lord made the iniquities of us all to meet on him; and all 
    the arrows that should have pierced all the elect forever, have entered into 
    his affections; and, having fallen under death, he was carried prisoner to 
    the grave.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Let us consider the victory Christ obtained. He tells 
    us he has fought and overcome: Revelation 3:21, "To him that overcomes will 
    I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set 
    down with my Father in his throne. Yes, he has triumphed over his enemies in 
    his glorious ascension into Heaven. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. How this victory over death was obtained. It was 
    obtained,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) By his death. This was the decisive stroke: Hebrews 
    2:14, "That through death he might destroy death, and him that had the power 
    of death." It was such a victory as Samson's last victory over the 
    Philistines, when he pulled down the house, and died himself with the 
    Philistines in the fall of it; and therefore he cried upon the cross, "It is 
    finished." Death has done its utmost and can do no more; by his death he 
    satisfied the law in all it had to demand of him as the elect's Surety; he 
    paid the debt, and removed the guilt. Sin being removed, and the law 
    satisfied, death has no more that strength or sting with which to set upon 
    him at first; and so it fell with him.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By his resurrection. Thereby he got up above death, 
    which had lost its power, and could hold him no longer, Acts 2:24, "Whom God 
    has raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible 
    that he should be held of it." He stood a conqueror in the grave, death's 
    own quarters; he broke asunder its iron bars, and brought away its keys; 
    behold they hang at his belt, Revelation 1:18, "And have the keys of Hell 
    and of death." So death's dominion over those that are his, got an 
    irrecoverable stroke, and he who had the power of death as to the elect, 
    namely, as an executioner, namely, the devil, was also destroyed.—I next 
    inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">2. What sort of a victory it is Jesus has obtained over 
    death?—It is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A dear-bought victory, it cost the glorious 
    Conqueror his precious life; he suffered the bruising of his heel, before 
    the serpent's head could be got bruised. He suffered in his body, and also 
    in his soul, to such a degree, that the holy human nature could not have 
    borne up under it, had it not been supported by his divine nature.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A complete victory in respect of himself, though not 
    yet complete in respect of his members: Romans 6:9, "Knowing that Christ 
    being raised from the dead, dies no more, death has no more dominion over 
    him." Now he is beyond the reach of death and all his enemies, sitting at 
    the Lord's right hand until he make his enemies his footstool, Psalm 110:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A glorious victory, saints and angels singing the 
    triumphant song. Hear the acclamations of joy and wonder with which he was 
    met at his return from the battle, Isaiah 63:1, "Who is this that comes from 
    Edom, with died garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his apparel, 
    traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, 
    mighty to save." What a glorious victory wan it which he obtained over the 
    king of terrors, who subdues the most potent armies, overcomes the 
    conquerors of the earth; but behold the great spoiler spoiled, the conqueror 
    conquered by the King of glory.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) An everlasting victory. Now death's power is 
    irrecoverably broke; the serpent is wounded in the head, which is a deadly 
    wound, it shall never be able to rally its broken forces against him any 
    more; it went oat into the world full, but the King of saints has met it, 
    and spoiled it, so that it in some sort is now empty.</p>
<p align="justify">As a practical improvement of what has been said, I would 
    on this occasion earnestly call upon you,</p>
<p align="justify">1. As mortals, dying men and women, to come over this day 
    to the conqueror's side. Our Lord has obtained the victory over death, come 
    you and surrender yourselves to him, break your covenant with death and 
    Hell, enter into his covenant, and honestly enlist yourselves under his 
    victorious banners, abide no longer among his enemies.—To prevail with you, 
    I would lay before you the following motives.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) If you are out of Christ, you live in death's 
    territories; yes, you are dead; while you live, death has dominion over you, 
    Ephesians 5:14, "Wherefore he says, Awake you that sleep, arise from the 
    dead, and Christ shall give you light." You are spiritually dead, the 
    threatenings of the law, as the bands of death, gird you about; the divers 
    lusts you serve are as the chains of death unto you. O! awake, before you be 
    cast out of this world, and buried out of his sight.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The conqueror is ready to receive you, and give you 
    the privileges of the subjects of his kingdom, Zechariah 9:11, 12, "As for 
    you also, by the blood of your covenant, I have sent forth your prisoners 
    out of the pit, wherein is no water; turn you to the stronghold you 
    prisoners of hope, even today do I declare that I will render double unto 
    you." Christ is coming this day in the word to your graves, and saying to 
    you, as to Lazarus, Come forth, bestir yourselves, O prisoners of hope! and 
    come away, when the Redeemer and deliverer, who has overcome death, is 
    calling you! Abide not under the dominion of the foiled enemy, but come away 
    to the victorious Lord of life.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Behold how he loved the children of men, John 14:13, 
    "And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may 
    be glorified in the Son." Why did he fight this battle with death, but to 
    rescue sinners to himself, as a prey out of the mouth of the devouring lion? 
    Shall not his dying love win you, his dying groans awake you, out of your 
    sleep in sin? Does not every wound he received call you to cast away your 
    sins which lay so heavy on him? will you love death, and slight the 
    Redeemer, Proverbs 8:26, "All they that hate me love death."</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) How will you grapple with death, if you come not out 
    of your sins to Jesus Christ? Man, remember you must die; the day is coming 
    these eyes will be closed, the breath that is now going out and in will go, 
    to return no more until the last pulse beat. How will you be able to grapple 
    with the king of terrors alone? Death cast down the man Christ; if it did so 
    to the green tree, what will become of you, a withered, dead branch? You 
    shall find death lively as to you, armed with its sting against you, since 
    you are not in Christ, his victory belongs not to you, but the first death 
    will turn you over into the hands of the second death; and so you shall be 
    eternally dying, but never die.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Come to Christ and you shall have the benefit of his 
    victory over death: John 8:51, "Truly, truly, I say unto you, If a man keep 
    my sayings, he shall never see death," never feel the sting of death, its 
    nature shall be quite altered to you. O! are you not thinking what way you 
    shall get through that ford on that Red Sea, which you know not how soon you 
    may come to? Come to Christ, lay hold on the conqueror by faith, in the way 
    of his covenant; the sealed covenant will be your pass for safe conduct to 
    the other side; it has carried all through that took their passage with it 
    hitherto, and so will it you.—I exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">2. To prepare yourselves for celebrating the triumph of 
    this victory. The saints above are celebrating it at the upper table, you 
    are called to celebrate it at the lower table: "This do you in remembrance 
    of me." Let not Satan get advantage of such as look for the benefit of this 
    victory, to slight the memorial of it, lest they vex the Spirit of God, and 
    pour contempt on Christ's institution, and give their souls such a throw as 
    they will not easily recover, while their fig-leaf covers of excuses will 
    avail them nothing. Let none, however, venture rashly on such an ordinance. 
    Take heed to your state, see that you be not the King's enemies, but his 
    friends, by your coming honestly into his covenant, and putting a divorce 
    into the hands of all your idols. In the midst of the triumphal throng, he 
    will notice the man that wants the wedding-garment: Matthew 22:11, "And when 
    the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a 
    wedding-garment." Sinners dead in trespasses and sins are not fit to 
    celebrate the memorial of Christ's victory over death. Off with the grave 
    clothes of your lusts, then, that you may be fit guests for the Lord of life 
    on such an occasion.—Take heed to your frame; a dead frame is not fit for 
    such an occasion. Alas! for the deadness on the spirits of professors at 
    this day. O! labor to get a lively frame of spirit, with which to celebrate 
    the memorial of Christ's victory; get faith, love, repentance, desires, 
    thankfulness, etc., in exercise; and for this end, I recommend to you this 
    night, to meditate on, and take a believing view of this battle.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It was a set battle; not an accidental rencounter, but 
    determined from eternity: Galatians 4:4, "But when the fullness of the time 
    was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law." 
    Zechariah in his time proclaims the war: Zechariah 13:7, "Awake, O sword! 
    against my shepherd, against the man that is my fellow, says the Lord of 
    hosts." Nay, it was proclaimed in paradise: Genesis 3:15, "And I will put 
    enmity between the woman and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise 
    your head, and you shall bruise his heel." The ceremonial law, by which so 
    much blood was shed, plainly predicted that a bloody day was coming.—It was,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A hot battle. Heavy were the strokes given here: Psalm 
    22:14, "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint, my 
    heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my affections. My strength 
    is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; and you have 
    brought me into the dust of death." It was a bloody battle, Isaiah 9:5, "For 
    every battle of the warriors is with confused noise, and garments rolled in 
    blood; but this shall be with burning, and fuel of tire." A dreadful noise 
    was here, the law, men and devils, crying against the Son of God, death 
    roaring for its prey, and the Mediator himself crying with strong cries and 
    tears. What garments rolled in blood were here on every side!—rolled in the 
    most precious blood of the Son of God: Isaiah 63:2, "Wherefore are you red 
    in your apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the wine-fat?" A 
    bloody spouse have we been to him.—It was,</p>
<p align="justify">3. A solitary battle on Christ's part. His enemies were 
    many, but he was alone; Psalm 22:12, "Many bulls have compassed me."—Isaiah 
    63:3, "I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the people there was none 
    with me." All were against him, none were with him to take a share; so thick 
    did the arrows of death fly, that neither man nor angel dared set out their 
    head, or venture into the battle on his side.—It was,</p>
<p align="justify">4. A longsome battle. He fought all along, from the 
    cradle to the grave, from his birth to his burial: Isaiah 53:3, "He is 
    despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;" 
    though it came to a height at the latter end.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, There were no quarters for him in this battle: 
    Romans 8:32, "He spared not his own Son, but delivered him up to the death." 
    He was made to drink a cup of pure unmixed wrath. He met with no sparing, 
    that so, the arrows of death being all spent on him, his people might get 
    free.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</b></p>
<p align="justify">YOU have been celebrating the triumph of Christ's victory 
    over death, and professing yourselves the subjects of the conqueror, yes, 
    the members of his body. If you approve yourselves true to your profession, 
    here is the best news you can possibly hear in this world, news which may 
    animate you to fighting the good fight: "He will swallow up death in 
    victory."</p>
<p align="justify">I have yesterday handled two heads in the method. A third 
    point now to be spoken to is, Christ's pursuit of the victory. Our Lord 
    Jesus will pursue the victory he has obtained over death, until it be 
    utterly abolished out of his kingdom.—Here,</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall premise some things for the better 
    understanding of this point.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show how he pursues the victory.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall premise some things for the better 
    understanding of this point.—And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. I premise that sin entering into the world, death 
    obtained a universal dominion over mankind: Romans 5:12, "Wherefore, as by 
    one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed 
    upon all men, for that all have sinned;" it reigned as a king, verse 19, 
    "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses;" it became universal 
    monarch, swaying its scepter over all nations, kingdoms, and empires, from 
    the one end of the earth unto the other. Every man receiving life in this 
    world, not excepting those that are born to crowns and kingdoms, are born 
    subjects to death. It is the most terrible king, even the king of terrors; 
    an absolute one, against whom there is no rising up. This universal dominion 
    it got by law, upon sin's entering: Genesis 3:19, "Dust you are, and unto 
    dust you shall return." 1 Corinthians 15:56, "The sting of death is sin, and 
    the strength of sin is the law."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The kingdom of death consists of two very different 
    territories or countries; one is the upper country, namely, the sinful 
    world; the other the lower country, in the other world, that land of utter 
    darkness, where the light is as darkness. In the former, the government of 
    death is comparatively mild, but in the latter inexpressibly horrible. Here 
    death's subjects have some gleams of light, joy, hope, though mixed with 
    many sorrows; but there they will never see light more, nor enjoy the least 
    ease from their pangs, which is the second death, Matthew 22:13, "Cast him 
    into utter darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Death's power over sinners by the law, reaches to the 
    transporting of them out of this world into its dominion in the other world; 
    it has power to carry them to the pit, and shut the bars thereof forever 
    upon them. Hence we find the rich man dying, and buried, and then in Hell 
    lifting up his eyes, Luke 16:23; an impassable gulf is fixed between that 
    miserable company and the saints above, verse 26; so that by death's power, 
    had it not been hemmed in, all mankind had landed there.</p>
<p align="justify">4. That all mankind might not perish, the Father gave a 
    kingdom to his Son, which he was to conquer out of the kingdom of death in 
    this upper world: in which kingdom life might reign for evermore through 
    Jesus Christ: John 6:37, "And this is the Father's will which has sent me, 
    that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise 
    it up again at the last day." This our Lord undertook willingly, resolving 
    to spare no expense, even of his own blood, to recover it.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Our Lord Jesus coming on this expedition, finds all 
    mankind fettered with the bands of death; death has seized them all without 
    exception, fastened on their souls and bodies, keeping them as prisoners, 
    until they should be transported into the pit from whence there is no 
    redemption; and his own that were given to him of the Father, he finds 
    enrapt up in the common ruin; so he, putting on a zeal for his Father's 
    glory and the salvation of the elect, encountered death in their room, and, 
    after a bloody battle, gained the victory. But after all this the chains of 
    death still continue on his people, and they lie under them until the 
    conqueror, who by his death has purchased their liberty, come and loose 
    them, in pursuit of this victory.</p>
<p align="justify">I am now to consider,</p>
<p align="justify">II. How he pursues the victory, "swallowing up death in 
    victory."</p>
<p align="justify">1. He looses the bands of that spiritual death under 
    which he finds them, morally dead, lifeless, senseless, and motionless to 
    any spiritual good. He puts a principle of spiritual life in them, 
    quickening them by his Spirit, Ephesians 2:1, "And you has he quickened who 
    were dead in trespasses and sins." With authority he asks the grim 
    vanquished tyrant, as he did others in the case of Lazarus, O death! where 
    have you laid him? He comes to the grave, saying, My word and my Spirit roll 
    away the stone; and with a powerful voice he cries, Dead soul, come forth. 
    Then feeble death loses its grips, and the dead comes forth to walk before 
    God in the light of the living; and then he is a new creature; old things 
    are done away.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He looses the band of legal death off the sinner; he 
    is by nature a condemned man, dead in law, and death holds him fast with the 
    cords of unpardoned guilt. But now the soul, uniting to Christ by faith, and 
    so being clothed with his perfect righteousness, having his satisfaction 
    applied to him, the cords of the guilt of eternal wrath give way, can hold 
    no longer, and so death is beat from its grip of him, Romans 8:1, "There is 
    therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." Now may the 
    soul say, It is God that justifies, who is he who condemns? The mighty Lord 
    has burst the bars of iron asunder, death's snare is broken, and we are 
    escaped.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He destroys the body of death in the believer. Still 
    the grave-clothes hang about the believer, even strong corruptions and 
    divers lusts, the remains of that death from which they were raised in 
    regeneration. There is a body of death cleaves to them, complete in all its 
    members, therefore called the old man, which is the remaining corrupt 
    nature, with the lusts thereof. This makes them groan, and long for 
    delivery, Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from 
    the body of this death?" This also is swallowed up in the pursuit of this 
    victory, by degrees. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is crucified, gets a deadly wound, and its 
    destruction ensured in the conversion of the soul to God; Romans 6:6, 
    "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin 
    might be destroyed." The nails are driven through it, and every member 
    thereof: Galatians 5:24, "And they that are Christ's have crucified the 
    flesh, with the affections and lusts. It is nailed to the cross, and shall 
    never come down until it breathe out its last. Its reigning power is broken, 
    and can no more command with that full sway it did while the soul was under 
    the dominion of death: Romans 6:14, "For sin shall not have the dominion 
    over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is weakened and mortified more and more, in the 
    gradual advances of sanctification: Romans 8:14, "But if you through the 
    Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live." Every new supply 
    of grace weakens corruption more and more. The grace of Christ in the heart 
    is a spring that will never be quite stopped, and therefore will work out 
    corruption by degrees, as the spring does the mud; John 4:14, "But the water 
    that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into 
    everlasting life." They will be like the houses of Saul and David, while the 
    former waxes weaker, the latter stronger.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) At the death of the body, the body of death is 
    utterly destroyed: Hebrews 12:23, "And to the spirits of just men made 
    perfect." There is not the least remains of it to be seen any more then; 
    then there shall not be the least darkness in the mind, corruption in the 
    will, nor disorder of the affections. When they are taken up into the mount, 
    they are stripped of their rags, and clothed with change of clothing, for 
    then Christ says, "Loose him, and let him go."</p>
<p align="justify">4. He dries up all the sorrows of death, wipes away all 
    tears. David was sometimes encompassed with them, but he is now got beyond 
    them all. Death entering the world at the back of sin, has made a universal 
    flood of misery, that covers the face of the whole earth; even the redeemed 
    ones walking to Zion, cannot miss to dip their foot in it, and that often 
    very deep; they are liable to afflictions on their bodies and souls, and all 
    that is theirs; they are distressed with desertions and hidings of God's 
    face; they often go mourning without the sun. And what are all these but the 
    arrows of the foiled enemy, with which he annoys the Mediator's company in 
    this lower world; but Christ will also spoil this part of death's game in 
    his kingdom; he has taken the poison and strength out of these arrows 
    already, that they cannot give a deadly wound; and in a little these 
    Egyptians whom they see today, they shall see no more for ever: Revelation 
    21:4, "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be 
    no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying: neither shall there be any more 
    pain, for the former things are passed away."</p>
<p align="justify">5. He brings all his people safe through the valley of 
    the shadow of death: Psalm 23:4, "Yes, though I walk through the valley of 
    the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for you are with me." Death 
    advances at length to the saint as a king of terrors, to loose the soul from 
    the body. They are ready to be affrighted at the sight, but the waters are 
    dried up where they are to pass. It stands before them like a serpent, but 
    the sting of it is gone, they can get no harm of it, "O death! where is your 
    sting?" may the dying saint say; they tread then upon the serpent, while 
    they pass over to the other side; it casts down the body into the grave, but 
    their more precious part it cannot touch. It is like the storm to Paul; the 
    body, the ship of the soul, is dashed to pieces; but the soul, the 
    passenger, gets safe to land. This is a noble victory got through Jesus 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Now, death has nothing of Christ's but the bodies of 
    the saints, not a foot of ground in his kingdom but the grave; and these he 
    will also wrest out of his hand at the resurrection. So, then, at the last 
    day, by the sound of the trumpet, death shall be summoned, in the 
    conqueror's name, to give up its dead; and immediately it shall fling open 
    its doors, and yield all up to him: Revelation 20:13, "And the sea gave up 
    the dead which were in it, and death and Hell gave up the dead which were in 
    them." "Then this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this 
    mortal shall have put on immortality; then shall be brought to pass the 
    saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory." Death will held 
    fast by them that are his own, even when they are come out of the grave; but 
    then nothing that ever belonged to it shall any more be about those that are 
    Christ's.</p>
<p align="justify">7. In consequence of the absolute victory over death, it 
    shall be shut up, and confined for the ages of eternity to the lower 
    regions, the lake that burns with fire and brimstone: Revelation 20:14, "And 
    death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death." 
    As the waters of the deluge, that overspread the whole face of the earth 
    some time, were, by the voice of God, chased away into, and confined in the 
    deeps; so death, in its whole extent, as comprehending all miseries, greater 
    or lesser, that some time ranged through the earth at liberty, shall be 
    gathered together, and thrown into the place of the damned, there to prey 
    forever upon its proper objects, the enemies of Christ, the great 
    conqueror.—I am,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To make some practical improvement. This doctrine is 
    of manifold use. I shall drop a few words from it to the profane, and to 
    professors.—I shall address,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Profane folk, who are quite careless about their 
    state and conversation, on whose face death is painted, in the eyes of God 
    and all serious persons. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You have neither part nor lot in this victory of 
    Christ's over death, but are yet lying a prey to the devourer. What else 
    means that loathsome conversation of yours? Psalm 14:1–3,—"The fool has said 
    in his heart, There is no God; they are corrupt, they have done abominable 
    works," etc. What else means it, but that you are yet rotting in the grave 
    of your lusts? Do not your profane speeches declare your throat to be an 
    open sepulcher; the full liberty your lusts get without control, says you 
    are not sick of sin, but dead is it; your want of the sense of religion, 
    your not discerning the voice of God in his word, and having no relish for 
    the sweetness of it, all these say you are dead.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Awake, and come forth to Christ, in a holy life, else 
    your lot shall be forever among the congregation of the dead: Galatians 
    5:21, "They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Christ 
    has set up a kingdom among us, but you say, Let us break his bands, and cast 
    his cords from us. Remember, if you continue in this condition, Christ will 
    cast you out of his kingdom, for if death shall be abolished out of his 
    kingdom, be sure such dead souls shall never inherit among the saints, but 
    receive their portion where death bears eternal sway.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Professors, among whom I must reckon communicants. 
    To such,</p>
<p align="justify">1. By way of caution, I would say to you,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Beware of hypocrisy, having a name to live, and yet 
    dead: Revelation 3:1, "I know your works, that you have a name that you 
    live, and are dead." O! how many are there like some dead beasts, whereof 
    there is nothing good but the skin! Except the form of godliness, and their 
    religious duties they go the round of, there remains nothing but a rotten 
    heart quite estranged from the life of God, and a life full of dead works. 
    Beware of this, for, with the abominable, the hypocrite will also be swept 
    away.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Beware of apostasy, Christ will pursue his victory, 
    and therefore whoever draws back, his soul shall have no pleasure in him, 
    Hebrews 10:38; they that draw back leave Christ's camp, and join his 
    enemies, and they will be involved in their ruin with a double destruction, 
    as runaways.</p>
<p align="justify">2. By way of application to your case on the back of this 
    communion, I would ask you,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Have you got nothing at this feast from the 
    conqueror to set you a step forward to the victory, the spiritual victory? 
    Blame whom or what you will for it, a dead state, or at least a dead frame 
    is the true cause; and therefore repent. If you be mourning and humbled 
    under it, it is a sign of some life; pursue under Christ's banner and you 
    shall obtain the victory.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Have you sped, and got some victory over the body of 
    death? be not secure, and sit not down on that you have attained, for death 
    is not yet swallowed up; therefore pursue.—I shall only add,</p>
<p align="justify">3. By way of exhortation to duty from this point.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Be lively Christians, as those that are alive from 
    the dead through Jesus Christ; keep grace in exercise, let not the holy fire 
    go out; watch against deadness creeping in on your souls, yield not to it, 
    for that were to yield to death, that must be swallowed up.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Join issue with the Conqueror, in pursuing the 
    victory in your own souls. There is a noble Captain on your head; under his 
    conduct, then, fight the good fight; let mortification be your daily work; 
    while one lust remains, you must never give over; make no trace with them, 
    or any of theirs, but resolve to pursue these fruits of death, until death 
    be swallowed up in victory.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Join issue with the Conqueror, in pursuing the 
    victory in the world, especially in the places where you live. Do your 
    utmost, by word and example, to awaken a dead world; take care of the young 
    generation; and as you love their souls, remove the stumbling-block of your 
    divisions out of their sight, which threatens the ruin of religion in this 
    parish: when the members of the body are all going asunder, falling off from 
    one another, it is an evidence death is working in that body; and it has 
    made much sad work in the land and country-side already.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Believe this truth with application, in all your 
    endeavors after holiness. That is the true method of sanctification, using 
    the mean appointed of God, and believing the promised success. If you will 
    not believe, you shall not be established.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Be weaned from the world, and long for the day when 
    death shall be swallowed up in victory; Philippians 1:23, "Having a desire 
    to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better. Were we eager in the 
    battle, we would readily long for the day of complete victory.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all be stirred up, and exhorted from this,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To get and make sure their interest in this victory 
    purchased by Christ in this battle. Come to Christ, and make sure your 
    interest in him; alas! what will it avail you that Christ has purchased this 
    victory for you? It would be promising-like in this case, if you be raised 
    up from spiritual death, or if you be wrestling against the remains of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) O love the Lord, come see the field of battle, where 
    the Lord lay, and love him, John 14:13. Whom will you love, if not him that 
    died for us?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Hate sin, and seek the destruction and extirpation 
    of it; set yourselves against the body of death. You have here—what may 
    excite you to it, for it was your sin that gave death its power, and 
    furnished it with weapons against Christ—You may encourage yourselves in the 
    contest, for victory is certain, for death is already vanquished in some 
    sort: Romans 6:6, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Christ." 
    Christ himself is engaged in the pursuit of the victory with you, and for 
    you.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Patiently bear your troubles, weaknesses, and 
    distresses, that hang about you, for these workings of death will be quickly 
    over.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Join not yourselves with the congregation of the dead. 
    Beware,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Of dead company, making them your beloved 
    companions, for "a companion of fools shall be destroyed."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Renounce dead works, as an impiety towards God, and 
    unrighteousness towards men.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Beware of a dead case and frame, that is, to be 
    cold, stiff, motionless, of the color of clay, as men that are in a 
    withered, lifeless, spiritual condition.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Let Heaven and eternal life be the main thing you 
    have in view, and are in quest of, saying, There is my rest, and there must 
    I be.</p>
