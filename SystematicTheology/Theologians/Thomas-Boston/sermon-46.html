<p align="justify">2 CORINTHIANS 8:12, "For if there be first a willing 
    mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that 
    he has not."</p>
<p align="justify">THE Christians in Judea being in much distress and 
    poverty, there was a contribution through the churches of the Gentiles for 
    them. The communion of saints extends not only to spiritual, but temporal 
    things too; that they be ready to help one another out of their substance. 
    And this communication of worldly things to the supply of the saints, is not 
    confined to those of our own church; but is to be extended to strangers on 
    occasion, at the greatest distance. The gospel came from Judea to the 
    Gentiles; and now money must go from the Gentiles for the relief of those of 
    Judea. Hereby God took a trial of the Gentile churches, their love to, and 
    esteem of, the gospel. Many will pretend to great esteem of the gospel, but 
    they must have it for nothing. Any of their money that is desired for any 
    public use, for the furtherance of the gospel, it is all accounted lost.</p>
<p align="justify">This contribution is here recommended to the Corinthians. 
    They readily fell in with the proposal, verse 11. Now they are desired to 
    perform, each according to his ability.</p>
<p align="justify">In the text, an objection of the poorer sort is answered, 
    who might fear that anything they had to give was so little, that it would 
    not be accepted. In answer thereto, they are told that God regards men's 
    works rather by the quality than the quantity; by the mind it is given with, 
    rather than by the thing given.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The case of acceptance is put, "If there be first a 
    willing mind, it is accepted." The acceptance here is of a man's work, not 
    of his person; though the former always presupposes the latter, in the 
    gospel way. And it refers to God, for he only can judge with what mind a 
    thing is done. Now God accepts a man's service, if there be first a willing 
    mind; that is, a readiness and good will to the work of his service. If the 
    heart go before and lead the hand, it is accepted; otherwise it is not.</p>
<p align="justify">2. What regard is had in this acceptance of one's work to 
    the quantity of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That it be according to one's ability, that it be 
    done to his power. Some are able to do more, and be more useful than others; 
    but if men have a willingness to the work, and do what they are able 
    accordingly, it is accepted through Christ; his that can do but little, as 
    well as his that can do much. But this cuts off the pretenses of those who 
    content themselves with lazy wishes, and lay not out themselves to do what 
    they may do.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That want of power to do more, shall not mar the 
    acceptance of what is done according to power with a willing mind, Mark 
    12:43. The Lord will take the little piece of service off his people's hand, 
    when the heart is right; as well as the great service of those of his that 
    have great abilities. Not but that where the inability is brought on by 
    people's own fault, it is their sin that they do not do more; but that sin 
    shall be forgiven them, and what they do be accepted, "if there be first a 
    willing mind."</p>
<p align="justify">The scope and substance of the text may be taken up in 
    the following doctrines.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. Works may be done in service to God, that are 
    not accepted of him.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. It should be our main concern in our works, 
    that they may be accepted of God.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. Where there is a willing mind carrying out 
    a man to do and serve the Lord to his ability, what is so done is accepted 
    of God.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. Want of power to do more, shall not mar the 
    acceptance of what is done from a willing mind according to one's power. In 
    that case, God will accept of his people's will for the deed.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall speak to each of these doctrines in order.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. Works may be done in service to God, that are 
    not accepted of him.</p>
<p align="justify">In treating this point, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Confirm the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Assign the reasons thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make some improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In order to confirm the doctrine, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Oft-times God hides his face from the man and his work 
    too, and people have no communion with God in their services to him; Hosea 
    5:6, "They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord; 
    but they shall not find him, he has withdrawn himself from them." When a 
    master will not look on his servant's work, it is an evidence he is not 
    pleased with him, nor it, Isaiah 1:15. This may be the case of the godly 
    sometimes, and it is the case of the wicked always. O how many lost services 
    are there this way.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Such services may be so far from being accepted, that 
    they are really loathsome to a holy God; Proverbs 15:8, "The sacrifice of 
    the wicked is an abomination to the Lord." He reckons them to be to no 
    purpose, he is full of them, they are vain in his esteem, he cannot endure 
    them, they are a trouble, a burden, and a weariness to him, Isaiah 1:11–14. 
    So it is often fulfilled in this case, "That which is highly esteemed among 
    men, is abomination in the sight of God," Luke 16:15. The man thinks highly 
    of his own work, and others do so too; but in the mean time God abhors it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. God may put such services out of the roll of services 
    to him, and set them down in the roll of sins against him. That is a 
    terrible word, Jeremiah 7:21, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of 
    Israel, put your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh;" that 
    is, Put your sacrifices that should be all burnt on the altar, to your other 
    sacrifices, and eat all together as common flesh to fill your bellies; q.d., 
    Let your prayers, and your common discourse, your hearing of sermons and 
    your idle tales go together; I esteem the one no more than the other. And 
    that is another dreadful word; Amos 4:4, "Come to Bethel and transgress, at 
    Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and 
    your tithes after three years;" q.d., Go to your knees now, and take the 
    name of God in vain; go to the church, and put off a little time of a 
    Sabbath day.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They may bring a curse and a stroke on men, instead of 
    a blessing and token of God's favor; Hosea 8:13, "They sacrifice flesh for 
    the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the Lord accepts them not; 
    now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins." Nadab and Abihu 
    were consumed by a fire that came out from the altar they were serving at; 
    Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead on occasion of selling their land for 
    the service of the church; and men may be smothered with the dung of their 
    sacrifices spread on their faces, Malachi 2:3.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, This may take place while the service stands 
    the man both cost and pains. The Israelites were at cost for spices for the 
    altar, but all was rejected, Jeremiah 6:20; they were at pains in attending 
    ordinances, and endured a stress in fasting, but all to no purpose, Isaiah 
    58:2, 3. Bodily exercise profits little before God, who is a Spirit, and 
    must be worshiped in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I am next to render the reasons of the point, That 
    works may be done in service to God, that are not accepted of him. God is no 
    austere master, but very indulgent to his servants, and will take a very 
    small service kindly off their hands; but men often serve him in a way that 
    is provoking to him, and to his dishonor; and thence are the reasons why 
    their services are not accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Sometimes that is offered for service to God, that is 
    forbidden by him, John 16:2, "They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, 
    the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service." 
    A blinded conscience gets the leading of a man, and leads him out of the way 
    of God; it dictates what is sin to be duty, and what is duty to be sin; so 
    that the man thinks he is serving God, while he is really serving his own 
    corruptions; and so instead of a "Well done, good and faithful servant," he 
    meets with a "Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put 
    darkness for light, and light for darkness," Isaiah 5:20; and "lies down" at 
    length "in sorrow," Isaiah 50.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Sometimes that is offered that is not commanded or 
    required; Matthew 15:9, "In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines 
    the commandments of men." Nothing can be acceptable to God, but what is 
    required by someone or other command of his; "for whatever is not of faith, 
    is sin," Romans 14. See Isaiah 1:12. Horrid idolatry is condemned on that 
    very ground, that it was uncommanded service, Jeremiah 7:31. It is an 
    affront to the sovereignty of God, and his mastership, for men to order his 
    service according to the devices of their own hearts, and not to keep 
    precisely to his orders. Hence are the superstitions of Popery, and the 
    uninstituted ceremonies of the Church of England, which are the product of 
    human device, without any countenance from the Word of God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Often, though the work be commanded of God, yet it is 
    marred in the making. There is something about the person, or the work, that 
    ruins all.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, About the person, that mars the acceptance. As,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He may be in a state of separation from Christ, not 
    united to him by faith, and so not accepted of God, John 15:5. No acceptable 
    work can be done by any man while he is out of Christ; Ephesians 2:10. For a 
    man's person must be accepted, before his work can be accepted, since his 
    work being imperfect, cannot procure the acceptance of his person. Now no 
    sinner's person is accepted but in Christ, Ephesians 1:6, and we come to be 
    in Christ by faith; therefore faith in Christ must go before acceptable 
    obedience, Hebrews 11:6. Faith makes the tree good, before it can bring 
    forth good fruit, Matthew 7:17. And no fruit of obedience is accepted of 
    God, but what grows on a branch of Christ the true vine. The blasting curse 
    lies on all other. See Genesis 6:9.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He may be in a state of enmity with God; and as no 
    man will like the services of his enemies, so God will not accept the 
    services of one not reconciled to him; Amos 3:3, "Can two walk together, 
    except they be agreed?" Every unbeliever is an enemy to God, Romans 8:7, for 
    his sin remains unpardoned, and his nature unchanged; and therefore his best 
    works are but splendid sins, himself but a whited sepulcher; and when he 
    speaks and acts fairest, there are seven abominations in his heart. How then 
    can an all-seeing God accept such services?</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He may be an unregenerate man, and so like Simon "in 
    the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity," Acts 8:23. Whoever are 
    out of Christ, are unregenerate; for it is by being in him, and so partaking 
    of his Spirit and fullness, that we become new creatures, 2 Corinthians 
    5:17; Ephesians 1:13. Now how can the corrupt tree bring forth good fruit? 
    or the old nature acceptable obedience? If the fountain be poisoned, can the 
    streams be wholesome? Could one like the best liquor in a vessel wherein 
    there is no pleasure?</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) He may be habitually unholy or profane in his life, 
    or as to the body of his conversation; Proverbs 28:9, "He who turns away his 
    ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination." So the Lord 
    rejects the sacrifices of the Israelites, Isaiah 1:15, 16 The Psalmist tells 
    us, that "the man who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, and stand in 
    his holy place," must "have clean hands, and a pure heart," Psalm 24:3, 4. 
    The apostle wills to "lift up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;" 1 
    Timothy 2:8, if we would be accepted. Their conversation must be of a piece, 
    whose works will be accepted; for God will never accept the services of men, 
    that for the most part serve the devil, the world, and their lusts. Many are 
    like the harlot; Prov 7:13, 14, as if they thought their duties would purge 
    away their sins. Nay but their sinful courses otherwise will pollute and 
    render abominable their duties, Hag. 2:11–14.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, About the work, that may mar its acceptance.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It may be none of the work of the Spirit of Christ 
    in the man, but proceeding from a man's self allenarly. All good works 
    accepted of God are the product of the Holy Spirit in believers, as the sap 
    which the vine-stock communicates to the branches. Therefore to "the works 
    of the flesh;" Galatians 5:19, are opposed "the fruits of the Spirit;" verse 
    22. And "all goodness is the fruit of the Spirit;" Ephesians 5:9, and a 
    Christian's life is "a walking after the Spirit;" Romans 8:1, as a borrowed 
    life. And as no common hearth-fire could be accepted at the altar, but only 
    the holy fire that came from Heaven; so no work will be offered to the 
    Father for acceptance by the Son, but what is the work of his own Spirit; 
    and no work will be accepted by the Father, but what is offered by the Son 
    as intercessor. See Eph 2:18. See what prayer is accepted, James 5:16. Not 
    the prayer of every one, but of a "righteous man;" not every prayer of a 
    righteous man neither, but "the inwrought" (Gr.) "prayer" of his, namely, 
    that which is inwrought by the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) It may be no work of love to God, or of a willing 
    mind; but done awkwardly and against the grain; 1 Tim 1:5; some 
    bye-considerations moving the man to serve the Lord; and no liking of him or 
    his service. Forced service can never be accepted, that which people are 
    constrained to. It is the obedience of slaves, not of sons, that natural men 
    do perform; and flows from a spirit of fear, more than a spirit of love; 2 
    Timothy 1:7. See Isaiah 64:5.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) It may be not done in faith, and so cannot be 
    accepted; Hebrews 11:6. Acceptable service is done in the faith of the 
    command, having authority on the man's conscience; and in the faith of the 
    promise, the promise of strength to perform, and the faith of the reward of 
    grace, believing the labor shall not be in vain in the Lord, 1 Corinthians 
    15. But instead of that, most of our good works are done without any regard 
    to God's authority, without any dependence on him for strength, and without 
    the true hope of the gratuitous reward of grace won by Christ to be 
    communicated to us.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) It may be done selfishly; men seeking their own 
    profit in them, more than God's honor; seeking to please their own 
    conscience that otherwise will not let them rest, rather than to please God; 
    seeking a name to themselves, rather than to glorify his name; and to save 
    their own souls from Hell by them, rather than to testify their thankfulness 
    to the Savior, who has purchased salvation by his blood. This is to pervert 
    the end of duties, to use them for unhallowed ends; in a word, to serve 
    ourselves, and not God; and therefore no more to be accepted than a 
    servant's working his own instead of his master's work, Hosea 9:4; Zechariah 
    7:6. Yes good things may be done downright to serve a lust, or to satisfy a 
    passion, Matthew 23:14; 2 Samuel 3:9.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) It may be done by chance rather than design; 
    Leviticus 26:21; (Hebrews) There are who are chance-customers to religion, 
    who fall in with a good work, rather because it falls in their way, than 
    because God lays it in their way; as the Danites, Judg. 18:5. God looks to 
    the heart, and undesigned service to him will be reckoned no serving of him, 
    but serving one's own fancy. This is another thing than one's embracing an 
    opportunity which the Lord puts in his hand; Galatians 6:10, wherein one is 
    glad of an occasion of serving God.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) It may be done by the power of custom, rather than 
    of conscience. Custom, fallen into by education, or otherwise, is the spring 
    of many duties done by men; wherein men move, by that, as a clock by the 
    weights; rather than from an inward principle; which can never be acceptable 
    to the heart-searching God, who requires reasonable service.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) It may be done in a slighting manner, dealing 
    scrimpily and grudgingly with God. As when there is no proportion between 
    the work and one's ability, as in the rich men casting in their little piece 
    of brass-money, Mark 12:41; when men offer to God, not the best, but the 
    most worthless they have; so did Cain, Genesis 4:3, 4. Thus men by thinking 
    anything may serve in the service of God, pour contempt on the holy One, and 
    bring on themselves a curse instead of a blessing; Malachi 1:14.</p>
<p align="justify">(8) Lastly, When it is not offered to God for acceptance 
    through Christ. It is God's appointment; Colossians 3:17, "Whatever you do 
    in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus." A young pigeon would 
    have been accepted on the altar of Jerusalem, when a bullock would not have 
    been accepted on the altar of Bethel. If the service of men be never so 
    great and costly, if it is offered to God otherwise, and the acceptance of 
    it looked for because of its own worth, it will be rejected, Revelation 
    7:14. No works savor with God, but as they savor of Christ, 2 Corinthians 
    2:15.</p>
<p align="justify">I now proceed to make some short improvement of what has 
    been said,</p>
<p align="justify">1. People may do much in the service of God, and yet do 
    nothing to purpose, Ecclesiastes 10:15. A man may go many a weary foot, and 
    yet never come to the place he designed, while he wanders from the right 
    way, 2 John 8. Such wanderers in religion are all unregenerate men, who set 
    about duties; they are busy doing nothing. They do many good things like 
    Herod, and yet they never do one thing acceptably. For their persons are not 
    accepted; and so their works cannot be so.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Even among the duties of a godly man, there may be 
    much refuse; many unaccepted duties. A believer's person is always accepted 
    of God, Ephesians 1:6, for the state of justification is perpetual. But such 
    may be the prevalence of faithlessness, selfishness, etc., in some 
    particular works of his, that they may never come to be accepted of God; for 
    sanctification has its ups and downs, being liable to many changes.</p>
<p align="justify">3. How little reason is there to boast of our works! 
    There is nothing we can do, can be accepted for its own worth. If it be 
    accepted, the baseness of it is seen, the soul is humbled, and no acceptance 
    of is looked for, but for the sake of Christ. If we be so conceited of our 
    work, as to boast of it; it is an evidence that God accepts it not; hence 
    said our Lord unto the Pharisees, Luke 16:15, "You are they which justify 
    yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly 
    esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God."</p>
<p align="justify">4. What will come of them that do nothing in the service 
    of God at all; but live in the habitual neglect of known duties, are 
    prayerless, slighters of the means of grace, etc.? 1 Peter 4:18. If they 
    that set off to the heavenly city may miss the way, and never reach it; sure 
    those that sit still, and never move that way, will never see it. Many 
    soothe themselves in the neglect of duties, because some that do them walk 
    so unlike them; but the case of such is very dangerous; for no habitual 
    neglecters of duties can be saved; and it is in vain for men to make the 
    practice of others an excuse for evil doing.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Take heed how you perform duties, and satisfy 
    not yourselves with the bare performance, without being solicitous as to the 
    manner, Luke 8:18. Better is one duty so managed as to be accepted than a 
    hundred otherwise; as one piece of gold is more worth than a hundred 
    counters. But this brings me to</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. It should be our main concern in our works 
    that they may be accepted of God.</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this point, I shall</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is the acceptance of our works with God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Give the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall show what is the acceptance of our works with 
    God. It lies in these two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. His being pleased with them; Colossians 1:10, "That 
    you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing." The accepted work God 
    approves of, and is well pleased with. Though the saints do no works that 
    they are every way pleased with themselves; yet there are some works of 
    theirs that are very pleasing to God. He delights in them, Proverbs 15:8. 
    They are sweet to him, as honey to the mouth, Canticles 5:1. They are sweet 
    as music to the ear, and as beauty to the eye, Canticles 2:14.</p>
<p align="justify">This pre-supposes them to be good, and agreeable to his 
    will. For evil cannot be pleasing to him, Psalm 5:4. He who is goodness 
    itself, can never be pleased but with what is good, Hebrews 13:16. The 
    unregenerate do nothing good, Psalm 14:2, 3, and so nothing they do is 
    accepted, Hebrews 11:6. The saints do some things good, some things evil; 
    the good is accepted, and the refuse is cast away.</p>
<p align="justify">2. His taking them off their hand, as service done to 
    him. God testified his acceptance of the sacrifice by fire, Leviticus 9. for 
    the fire made them go up in flames towards Heaven, Judg. 13:20. See Psalm 
    20:3, Genesis 4:4, 5. So he received them off their hand. He reckons such a 
    work a piece of service done to him, sets it down as it were in his book, in 
    due time to give it a reward of grace, Leviticus 7:18, Malachi 3:16.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence is the after-notice God takes of the good works of 
    his people;—in time, as it fared with Moses, who, refusing to be called the 
    son of Pharaoh's daughter, was afterwards advanced to be king in 
    Jeshurun;—in eternity, as Matthew 25. He will not forget any of them, 
    Hebrews 6:10, but a plentiful sowing of them will have a plentiful reaping. 
    So they are the surest riches, 1 Timothy 6:18. Not that the reward is given 
    for their sake, but for Christ's sake; and such is the covenant connection.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How can any of our works be accepted of a holy 
    God, or he be well pleased with them, etc., since there is so much 
    sinfulness attending the best of them?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER 1. In point of justification they are not, nor 
    cannot be accepted; that is, our persons cannot be accepted as righteous for 
    our works, since they are not legally perfect, perfect in every point. In 
    the way of the covenant of works, the work was first to be accepted for its 
    own sake, as absolutely perfect; and then the person for the works' sake. So 
    that whoever seek by their works to be accepted of God, they go back to the 
    covenant of works; and must either bring works every way perfect, or be 
    rejected; and because they cannot do such works, "therefore by the works of 
    the law shall no flesh be justified," Galatians 2:16.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In point of sanctification the good works of the 
    justified may be accepted; that is, one's person being accepted, his works 
    may be accepted, being evangelically perfect, though not legally; being 
    perfect in parts, though not in degrees. For in the way of the covenant of 
    grace, the person is first accepted in Christ, and then his work though 
    imperfect. Hence it appears,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That to a person's being accepted of God in Christ, 
    there is no working, but believing required; Mark 5:36. For until the person 
    be accepted of God in Christ, he can do no acceptable work. He can yield no 
    savory fruit until he be engrafted by faith in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the way to bring sinners to good works, is to 
    bring them to Christ in the first place by faith, that they may be justified 
    and accepted in him. Men may be made proud legalists otherwise, but not 
    evangelical Christians; whited sepulchers, but still full of rottenness.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That there is very good reason why the good works of 
    unbelievers are rejected, because they are imperfect; and yet the good works 
    of believers are accepted, though they be imperfect. For besides that the 
    principle, motives, and ends of their works are vastly different, there is a 
    great odds between,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Their states. The one is the King's friend, the 
    other an enemy; the one the King's son, the other but his hired servant. If 
    a man is pleased with a little piece of service that his own child does him, 
    can the hired servant expect that as little will be taken off his hand? Can 
    our enemy expect the same acceptance of his service, as our friend?</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] The desired acceptance. The unbeliever desires his 
    work may be accepted for his salvation; but the believer desires his work 
    may be accepted as only a token of his gratitude to his Savior, who has 
    saved him already. Can any man rationally think, that as little can be 
    accepted at his hand, for the price of salvation, as may be accepted for an 
    acknowledgment of salvation received?</p>
<p align="justify">But further to clear this question, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Even the acceptance in point of sanctification, is not 
    for the sake of the work itself, nor for the worker's sake neither; but for 
    Christ's sake, and by the means of his intercession. This is clear from the 
    necessity of Christ's intercession to the acceptance of our works; and that 
    intercession being a pleading of the merit of his own obedience and death; 
    Colossians 3:17; Revelation 7:14, and 8:3. It is for the same merit of 
    Christ, that first the believer himself, and then his imperfect works are 
    accepted of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sinfulness and imperfections that attend the works 
    of the believer, are not, nor cannot be ever accepted. God is displeased and 
    angry with the dross of sin that cleaves to the believer's best 
    performances; and he never is so well pleased with the good in them, as to 
    accept the ill too. Yes, he may write his indignation against these, when he 
    is pleased with the substance of the work.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The main of the accepted work is good, however 
    sinfulness attends it. For the matter of it, it is commanded; for the form 
    of it, it proceeds from a right principle, the love of God; it is done in 
    faith, and to the glory of God. And this is the work of God's own Spirit in 
    the believer; the weaknesses that attend it, proceed from the believer 
    himself. And such works as are good in the main, God will not reject, for 
    the infirmities that attend them. As for those works even of believers that 
    are not thus good in the main, they are not at all accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Christ separates the precious from the vile part, and 
    offers the former perfumed with his merit, unto the Father for acceptance, 
    Hebrews 10:21, 22; Revelation 8:3. In every sacrifice there were two very 
    different things, the flesh and the skin and dung. The former came to the 
    altar, the latter never. So Christ separates in a believer's duties that 
    which is from his own Spirit, and that which is from the believer himself 
    puts away this, and presents that to his Father. This was lively represented 
    in the burning of the incense, where the fire being set to it, the finer 
    part went up in flame and smoke, towards Heaven; and the gross part, the 
    ashes, remained, and a priest came and carried them away in a golden dish. 
    So is the case here,—the finer part in the saints' services, that which is 
    done by the assistance of the Spirit and in faith, ascends to Heaven for 
    acceptance; and the ashes that remain are carried away, in virtue of the 
    free promise, Ezekiel 36:25.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The Father then accepts the precious part for 
    the Son's sake, and for the same sake pardons the guilt of the vile part, 
    the infirmities attending it, Revelation 8:4; Psalm 141:2. The accepted 
    duties go through two hands, first the believer's, then Christ's; their 
    prayers are first said on earth by themselves, then they are repeated in 
    Heaven by the Mediator. It is from the second hand only, and on the 
    repetition only, that they are accepted, 1 Kings 8:32; and in the second 
    hand, and on the repetition, they are not so bulky, but better.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall next give the reasons of the point, That it 
    should be our main concern in our works that they may be accepted of God. 
    Because,</p>
<p align="justify">1. As God is the first cause, so he is the chief end of 
    all things; Romans 11., "For of him, and through him, and to him are all 
    things." So as we are his creatures, our chief end in all our duties should 
    be to please him; as all the waters coming from the sea do return to it 
    again. This was the duty of Adam in the covenant of works, as sure as he was 
    not to have another God, as in the first command; though he was to gain life 
    by his works, which we are not, and therefore it is surely ours much more.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Our duties are a matter of gratitude; we owe them to 
    God, not only in point of justice, but thankfulness, for benefits received, 
    creation, preservation, and redemption; Exodus 20:2, "I am the Lord your 
    God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house 
    bondage." We are in debt to him, and we cannot pay, but only acknowledge by 
    small tokens, Hosea 14:2. If we are to offer to a fellow creature a token of 
    our obligation to him, the first question is, What is it that I can give 
    that will be most acceptable to him? How much more should the first question 
    be, What is it that I can give that will be most acceptable to God?</p>
<p align="justify">3. God looks mainly to the heart with which a duty is 
    done, and knows whether he gets it or not, 1 Chronicles 28:9. Though a 
    servant do well, yet if he has no regard to his master's pleasure in what he 
    does, it is disobliging; and whatever men do, if it is not their main aim to 
    please God, it is provoking. Our aims may be hidden from men; but they are 
    as open to God as our overt actions.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, It is a necessary ingredient in a good work, 
    so that a work cannot be good without it, 1 Corinthians 10:31. For such a 
    work is pointed wrong as to the end of it, Zechariah 7:5. It is a sacrifice 
    wanting the heart, the thing that God mainly requires and delights in, 
    Proverbs 23:26. So whatever we may account it, God will not account it a 
    good work.</p>
<p align="justify">I come now to the practical improvement of this doctrine, 
    which I shall discuss in a twofold use, namely, of conviction, and of 
    exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. This doctrine may serve for conviction, 
    humiliation, and reproof to men, who generally are strangers to it, and at 
    best very defective in it. It may convict men,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In point of ill works. These are fruitful in the 
    world, things that are altogether evil, and cannot be good, Galatians 5:19. 
    In the midst of gospel-light they overflow, and there is no true repentance 
    for them, because there is no reformation. To such workers I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) How far are you from regarding at all God's 
    acceptance of your works, who take the liberty to do against the letter of 
    his law, what you know his soul abhors? The drunkard, swearer, 
    sabbath-breaker, or unclean person, is not so abandoned as to think that 
    these his actions can please God. But the truth is, the pleasing of God is 
    what he is not anxious about, but he is resolved to please himself in his 
    lust, let his Maker take it as he will. What must be the end of these 
    things? Romans 1:18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against 
    all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in 
    unrighteousness."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) You thereby evidence, that it is not the pleasing of 
    God, but yourselves, that you seek in your good works; and that therefore 
    your ill works and your good works will all go one way, being rejected of 
    God; your swearing and your praying, etc. will be reckoned all one. If it 
    were your main design in one thing to please God, it would be so in all, 
    James 2:10, 11; and therefore since you do not endeavor to please him in 
    all, know that you can please him in nothing; Psalm 125., "As for such as 
    turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the 
    workers of iniquity."</p>
<p align="justify">2. In point of good works, namely, those that for the 
    matter of them are good, wherein men may be accepted of God, if they rightly 
    manage them. These are of three sorts—</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Natural good works, such as eating and drinking, 
    sleeping, etc. I call them good works, because they are commanded of God, 
    are necessary to be done, and it would be sin to omit them. They are duties 
    of the sixth command, the neglect whereof is sinful, Colossians 2., and one 
    may be accepted of God in them, Romans 14:3, or rejected of him, Zechariah 
    7:6. Bring these works of ours to this rule, That it should be our main 
    concern in our works, that they may be accepted of God; and how may we stand 
    convicted of,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Regardlessness of God's approbation and acceptance 
    in these things; having no eye to God in them, but going about them as men 
    without God in the world, or as beasts, Matthew 24:38, without any regard to 
    God's command requiring our use of them, dependence on God for the benefit 
    of them, or design to be strengthened by them for serving God in the duties 
    of religion and our particular calling.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Dishonoring of God in them. In the way of purchasing 
    them, many an ill shift is made for the belly; and if men can get it, to 
    satisfy the appetite, they are not anxious about their right to it before 
    God, whether it be with a good conscience their own bread, got with honest 
    labor and industry, 2 Thessalonians 3:12; or whether doing their utmost with 
    their industry, they have a right to it as charitable supply. In the way of 
    using them, without conscientious moderation, by gluttony or drunkenness; a 
    sinful eagerness to satisfy a lust for them; and unfitting themselves for 
    the service of God by them.</p>
<p align="justify">It is but a little the time of eating and drinking will 
    last; there is an eternity to be spent without them. If we endeavor to be 
    accepted of God in them while they last, it will be our comfort when we 
    shall forever lay them aside; if not, the regardlessness and dishonoring of 
    God in them, will be an eternal sting in the conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Civil good works, which are the duties of men's 
    station, in the common affairs of this life; such as the management of 
    family affairs, the duties of service, of a man's lawful trade or 
    employment. These are good works on the matter, being commanded of God, and 
    in which one is to walk with God, 1 Corinthians 7:24; and therein one may be 
    accepted, Ecclesiastes 9:7, or rejected, Proverbs 21:4. Here again men may 
    be convicted of,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Regardlessness of God's acceptance, Luke 17:28. 
    These things mostly are managed without any eye to God, or to be accepted of 
    him in them. His command and call by his providence unto them is not waited 
    for; or if men have it, yet they do not regard it, to go about their 
    business under a sense of God's command, Ephesians 6:7. The Lord is not 
    looked to for direction, but men trust themselves for conduct in these 
    matters, Proverbs 3:5, 6. He is not depended on for success, but men are 
    either flushed with presumptuous confidence, or tormenting anxiety as to 
    events, Psalm 127:1. And not God's word is the rule they act by in them, but 
    their own worldly interest or ease.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Dishonoring God in them. As by pride, passion, and 
    selfishness, which are to be found in people's managing of their family 
    affairs; if they get their business done, there is no concern how their 
    families should serve the Lord. He is dishonored by the unfaithfulness, 
    dishonesty, eye-service, and perverseness of servants; and dishonored by the 
    lying, cheating, and injustice used by men in their dealings in their 
    several employments.</p>
<p align="justify">These things are but time things either; and all the 
    hurry of worldly business will be hushed before long; and death will draw 
    the busiest man out of the throng, as clean as if he had never been in it, 
    Ecclesiastes 9:6. It will be your interest to seek to be accepted of God in 
    them; otherwise you will lay up bitterness from them, that will be lasting 
    when they are gone forever.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Religious good works, the duties whether of the 
    first or second table, which are duties of our Christian calling, such as 
    prayer, giving alms, etc. In them also men may here be convicted of,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Regardlessness of God's acceptance in them. Men 
    proclaim this by their rash approaching to them, without considering what 
    they are to be about, Ecclesiastes 5:1; by their formality in them, 
    satisfying themselves with the doing of the thing, without any anxiety to 
    get their hearts up to the duty, to do it in a right manner, which is mere 
    bodily exercise, 1 Timothy 4:8; and their carelessness after them, 
    unconcernedness as to their success, when once the task is off their hand, 
    Psalm 5:3.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Making other things our main concern in them: As,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] A name for religion, Matthew 6:2. An unholy heart, 
    that is an enemy to religion at bottom, may be very fond of a name for it. 
    And to advance this empty name, many times good gifts are prostituted, and 
    enlargements in duty, and great performances for God; all of them running in 
    that channel of ambition, to be highly esteemed of men as religious.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Some worldly interest, John 6:26, 27. So it was with 
    Jehu. They will please men for their carnal interest, and do religious 
    duties to please men. Often does the fear of men go deeper here than the 
    fear of God; and the loss of some worldly interest deeper than the loss of 
    the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Peace in their own minds. There is a conscience 
    within men that will drive to duty, when there is no love to God drawing; so 
    men by such duties rather seek to please themselves than to please God. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To keep conscience quiet, while it is quiet; so 
    duties are made a bribe to cause conscience hold its tongue. And certain it 
    is, that many could not live so quietly in their sins as they do, were it 
    not for their duties, as appears from the case of the adulterous whore, 
    Proverbs 7:14, 15. This is the reason that publicans and harlots enter into 
    the kingdom of Heaven before Pharisees; and Laodicea's case was the most 
    hopeless of all the seven churches.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To still it again when it is roused, Psalm 78:34. 
    Men may be very anxious for comfort by duty, that have no concern for 
    sanctification thereby.</p>
<p align="justify">[4.] Salvation from Hell and wrath, Matthew 19:16–20. One 
    may follow duties on this account, without any love to God, as appears verse 
    22, "But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for 
    he had great possessions." Self is a strong motive, and Heaven and Hell are 
    strong arguments for duty; but the misery is, they seek not God for himself, 
    but for themselves, and so are rejected, 2 Timothy 1:7.</p>
<p align="justify">In these duties we are now on our trials for Heaven; in a 
    little the sentence will be passed, according to our works. And those who 
    are not now accepted of God in their duties, will then be rejected of God 
    forever.</p>
<p align="justify">USE II. Let it be your main concern in your works, that 
    they may be accepted of God; whether they be natural, civil, or religious. 
    For motives, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This is a distinguishing character of one's state, 
    whereby you will prove yourselves either gracious or graceless. It is a 
    native result of justification and acceptance of one's person with God, to 
    be mainly concerned for God's acceptance of them in their work, 2 
    Corinthians 5:9. So Noah's integrity and uprightness is traced to his 
    justification as the source, Genesis 6:9. For so the love of Christ 
    constrains. Whereas the soul being in a state of enmity with God, natively 
    issues in no concern to please him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God is a great God and King, infinitely above the 
    greatest on earth; he cannot be profited by our services, but requires us to 
    labor to please him in them, Malachi 1:14. He gave us our being, and has put 
    each of us in our station, and carved out our work for us; whence it 
    necessarily follows, that it should be our main concern to please him, 2 
    Timothy 2:4. And would men more narrowly consider this, that it is God that 
    has set them their business and station, and consequently, that he will call 
    for the account of our work, it would stir them up to make it their main 
    care in their works, that they may be accepted of him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a costly provision of an altar on which our 
    sacrifices of praise may be accepted, Hebrews 13:10, 15. There was nothing a 
    sinner could have done, that could have been accepted, had there not been an 
    altar to sanctify the gift. Now it is provided, a crucified Christ is that 
    altar; he by his death has become a proper intercessor for acceptance, both 
    of our persons and our works. How heinous will our sin be, if we seek not to 
    bring our gift to this altar, for acceptance with God?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Whatever good work, natural, civil, or religious, we 
    do, may be accepted of God, as pleasing service to him through Christ, 
    Hebrews 13:15, 16. Men are hugely mistaken to think that it is only works 
    strictly called religious, that God accepts as service to him; nay, whatever 
    God calls for at your hand, as to tend the sheep, as well as to attend his 
    worship, if you act in it to please him, and offer it to him for acceptance 
    through Christ, it will be accepted, Colossians 3:23, 24. It is observable, 
    that the apostle having given that general direction, verse 17, "Whatever 
    you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus," etc. falls 
    immediately on relative duties, verse 18, "Wives, submit yourselves unto 
    your own husbands," etc.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The example of Christ may be very moving here, Romans 
    15:3, "For even Christ pleased not himself." His work was heavy work, but to 
    please his Father he undertook it, set about it, and went through with it, 
    John 8:29, Psalm 40 and John 4:34. And shall not we be concerned to please 
    him in our imperfect works, to please whom Christ laid down his life?</p>
<p align="justify">6. If you be mainly concerned for acceptance with God in 
    your work, you may expect help from the Lord in it. The waters and rivers 
    run all to the sea, and so they are fed again by the sea, that they never 
    run dry. That work that has God's pleasure for its end will get God's hand 
    to it for its help, Philippians 2:12, 13, Proverbs 3:6. The man that slights 
    God in his natural and civil actions, provokes God to leave him in them, 
    Joshua 9:14, and then his own understanding that he leaned to, proves folly. 
    And he who slights God in his religions duties does the same, and his gifts 
    prove a broken reed.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Whatever be the success of your work, you will have 
    solid peace, satisfaction, and comfort, in your having been mainly concerned 
    in your works for God's acceptance, Isaiah 49:4. Men are great fools, to 
    promise themselves success on their own wise management of their natural and 
    civil actions. It has been a truth from the beginning, and will be to the 
    end of the world, that "the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the 
    strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of 
    understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill, Ecclesiastes 9:11. And it is 
    equally foolish to expect the world's thanks for doing them a good turn; for 
    you will be fair to be disappointed, 2 Timothy 3:1, 2, and look blunt on the 
    disappointment. Nay, such an ill-natured world it is, that it is one to a 
    thousand if they be not heavy on you for it. For, says Solomon, Ecclesiastes 
    4:4, "I considered all travel, and every right work, that for this a man is 
    envied of his neighbor." But when this is one's main concern, he has what he 
    looked for; 2 Corinthians 1:12, "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of 
    our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly 
    wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, 
    and more abundantly to you-wards."</p>
<p align="justify">8. If you do not thus, your works will be lost; lost with 
    God, and lost for eternity; and if that be, all that you will find of them 
    in the world, will be little worth, Matthew 6:2. This is our sowing time, 
    good works are the seed; will it not be sad to lose all, so as in the 
    harvest you have nothing to reap? So it will be, if in this your sowing time 
    you do not throw in the seeds of good works, and make it your principal 
    concern to look for acceptance with God in them; all you do will be lost 
    forever, you will have nothing to reap in the harvest at the last day.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Lastly, If you do not, your best works will be turned 
    to sin, Proverbs 15:8, and you will be surprised to find so many actions of 
    yours that you set down in the roll of good works, appear in God's book in 
    the roll of sins; as cockle instead of barley. There is such a thing, Psalm 
    109:7, "Let his prayer become sin."</p>
<p align="justify">For direction in this point, we proceed to,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. Where there is a willing mind carrying out 
    a man to do and serve the Lord, to his ability, what is so done is accepted 
    of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Here I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What sort of works they are that are accepted of God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How or in what respect they are accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why they are so.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show what sort of works they are that are 
    accepted of God.</p>
<p align="justify">FIRST, They are works done with a willing mind. Wherein 
    we are to consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What this willingness relates to.</p>
<p align="justify">2. What it is.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Let us consider what this willingness relates to. 
    This willingness of the soul respects the will of God, as that which the 
    soul is willing to comply with. The will of God is contained in his 
    commands, summed up in a word, 1 Thessalonians 4:3, "This is the will of 
    God, even your sanctification;" and it is the duty of all of us to be 
    willing to that will of God, 1 Chronicles 28:9, and to say as Psalm 40:8, "I 
    delight to do your will, O my God." Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A work accepted of God is a commanded work, required 
    of us by God himself, and not an unrequired work, Revelation 22:14, "Blessed 
    are they that do his commandments." Matthew 15:9, "In vain they do worship 
    me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Nothing in itself sinful can ever be accepted of 
    God; though people may pretend they have no ill in their mind against God in 
    doing it; yes though they may have a good intention in it to serve God by 
    it, John 16:2. Yet how many do, on these pretenses, lie without any check, 
    and do other ill things? Proverbs 26:18, 19, "As a madman who casts 
    firebrands, arrows, and death; so is the man that deceives his neighbor, and 
    says, Am not I in sport?"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Nothing, that is not required of God, though it be 
    not in itself sinful, can be accepted of him, Matthew 15:9. For there can be 
    no obedience, where there is not a command; these are relatives. If God 
    command us not, we cannot be said to obey him, nor be accepted of him. 
    Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Will-worship is false worship, and service to God 
    just of men's own devising is not, nor can be accepted; Colossians 2:21–23, 
    "Devised of one's own heart," is a brand of rejection fixed on a work, that 
    is not in itself evil, 1 Kings 12. And Saul lost the kingdom on such a work, 
    1 Samuel 15:21.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Doing a duty not the duty of one's station cannot be 
    accepted, 1 Corinthians 7:24. It was a duty to sacrifice, and to burn 
    incense; yet Saul provoked the Lord by his doing the one, and Uzziah was 
    smitten with leprosy for doing the other; because though they were duties, 
    yet they belonged not to their stations. In a well-ordered family, one 
    servant must not take his neighbor's work and post.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The command of God requiring the work must be known to 
    the doer; for otherwise men serve the Lord but at a venture, not knowing 
    whether it be his will or no, which can never be accepted, Leviticus 26:21. 
    The acceptable work must be done in faith, faith of the command of God, 
    implying knowledge of it, Romans 14.</p>
<p align="justify">The sum of the whole lies here. If you would have your 
    work accepted of God, you must</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Know it to be a commanded duty.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Commanded to you. The want of either will mar the 
    acceptance, as a duty not proceeding from a willing mind.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Let us consider what this willingness of mind 
    is. It is twofold, habitual and actual.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Habitual; which is a disposition of the soul to comply 
    with the will of God's commands, arising from the new nature given in 
    regeneration or the saving change; Hebrews 8:10, "I will put my laws into 
    their mind, and write them in their hearts." Psalm 110:3, "Your people shall 
    be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the 
    womb of the morning." The carnal unrenewed mind is enmity against God and 
    his law, Romans 8:7. And while that corrupt set abides on the heart 
    predominant, as in all natural men, there can be no true willingness to 
    comply with the will of God. Hence, that any work of ours may be accepted of 
    God, we must be,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) United to Christ by faith, John 15:5. While we 
    continue in our natural state, growing on the old stock of the first Adam, 
    we can bring forth no fruit acceptable to God; for the whole nature is 
    corrupt according to the stock, and so must the fruit be, Romans 7:5. 
    Particularly there is a reigning refractoriness in the will, whereby the 
    soul is as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke of God's will. Whereas the 
    soul being in Christ is changed, according to the nature of the new stock, 
    and made willing, 2 Corinthians 5:17, and gets his image, opposed to Adam's, 
    1 Corinthians 15:49.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We must be regenerated, and have our nature changed. 
    The tree must be made good, before the fruit can be so, Ezekiel 36:26, 27. 
    How can there be a willing mind for duty, while the will is unrenewed? How 
    can there be new obedience, while one is not partaker of the new nature? The 
    dark mind, the perverse will, and disorderly affections, not rectified by 
    regenerating grace, being all of them opposite to good, show the want of a 
    willing mind.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) We must have a predominant love to God, 1 Timothy 
    1:5. This disposes the soul, by a constraining force, to fall in with 
    whatever the Lord requires; and constitutes one's obedience labor of love. 
    And where it is wanting, good things may indeed be done, for some by-ends, 
    and from some by-principles; but there is not first a willing mind.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the habitual willing mind, whereby the soul being 
    in Christ, regenerated, and having the love of God dwelling in it, is in 
    such a disposition to fall in with the will of God, that getting a touch of 
    a particular command, it readily complies therewith in obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Actual; which is an actual compliance of the heart, 
    with such and such a particular duty, laid before one at such a time and in 
    such a place; and arises from the habitual disposition. The one looks to the 
    whole law; the other to particular commands requiring such and such a 
    particular duty, as of the Corinthians to help the poor saints of Judea. And 
    it implies,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) An approbation of the command of God for the duty. 
    What the Lord by his word and providence requires of the man as duty, he has 
    a love and liking of it from the heart, Romans 7:12. The carnal heart rises 
    against this and the other command laying such a duty on the man; and he 
    takes it on as a slave does his burden, because he cannot help it. But the 
    willing mind has a liking of it, 1 John 5:3, as the little child has a 
    liking of being bid do any little piece of service for his father.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A sincere resolution to set to the work in the 
    season thereof, Joshua 24:15; Psalm 119:106. The willing mind goes not about 
    to seek how to shift obedience to the divine call; nor does it seek offputs 
    and delays, until the season of the duty is away; nor does it muster up 
    difficulties, saying, "There is a lion in the way," to palliate 
    disobedience; but resolves to put to hand timely; Psalm 119:60," I made 
    haste, and delayed not to keep your commandments."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A compliance of the heart with the command to the 
    duty, because it is God's command, Psalm 119:4. The authority of God has 
    weight with the man's conscience; and the love of God inclines his heart to 
    obey. So the will of God is the reason, as well as the rule, of his 
    obedience. As he believes the promise, because God has said it; so he obeys 
    the command, because God has bid it. So the man's great aim is to answer the 
    call of God, and please him.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) A delight and cheerfulness in the duty, Isaiah 64:5; 
    2 Corinthians 9:7. Love to the Lord oils the wheels of the soul, and the 
    work goes on, not as of necessity, but as of choice, 1 John 5:3. The 
    awfulness of the command is veiled with prevailing love; take off the 
    threatening of wrath from the command, and the willing soul would not stop 
    for all that; for the love of God in the heart is a law, and a powerful one 
    too, Canticles 8:6. Terror drives to duty, but weakens; love draws to duty, 
    and strengthens, 2 Timothy 1:7. Terror will make men find their hands, but 
    they lose heart; but love gives heart and hand too.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) A design to honor God by the duty. The general 
    direction is plain; 1 Corinthians 10:31, "Whether you eat or drink, or 
    whatever you do, do all to the glory of God;" and thereto the willing mind 
    echoes back, "To me to live is Christ, Philippians 1:21. The willing mind is 
    not obtained but by faith, whereby the conscience is made good, and the soul 
    put in a state of salvation; hence natively follows the design of glorifying 
    God by good works, and by them adorning the doctrine of God our Savior, 1 
    Peter 2:9. The faith of Christ's salvation makes a powerful impression of 
    gratitude on the soul, that it is glad of an occasion to glorify him, and 
    express its love; Psalm 116:12, "What shall I render unto the Lord, for all 
    his benefits towards me?"</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) Lastly, A looking-out for promised help to the duty, 
    by faith, Hebrews 12:1, 2. The willing mind is not blind to its own 
    weakness, but sees that better than others. But what one is really willing 
    and hearty for the doing of, he will use all means for reaching his end. 
    Carnal men say they are willing but they cannot; in that they deceive 
    themselves, for if they were really willing they would go to the fountain of 
    strength for help. So do they with whom is first a willing mind, they set 
    about the duty in the faith of the promise. Hence they will go forward on 
    God's call, however difficult the work be, and get through too; as the women 
    came to the sepulcher, though not knowing how the stone would be rolled 
    away.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, They are works that from a willing mind are 
    done to their ability. We may take up this in these four things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are works which people having ability for, are 
    done; they are not merely wished and woulded to be done, as the sluggard 
    uses to wish well with folded hands, Proverbs 21:25. For where the heart is 
    to a work, the hand will be put to it, so far as in them lies. Men do but 
    deceive themselves, who please themselves with good desires and wishes, 
    without endeavors backing them; Matthew 7:21, "Not every one that says unto 
    me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the 
    will of my Father which is in Heaven." James 1:22, "But be you doers of the 
    word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are done according to the ability they could get 
    in. That is, not only according to the ability in hand, but the man labors 
    to get more ability for the work, whereby he may be fitted for it. We are 
    naturally impotent for any good work; but there is a storehouse of strength 
    opened to us in Christ, to be brought in by faith, Isaiah 45:24. "Wherefore 
    they that are not concerned to fetch in strength for duty, but are unable 
    for duty, and hold themselves so, will not be accepted; for there is no 
    willing mind there.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are not done quite below what they might have 
    done, and was in the power of their hand, Isaiah 32:5. Where there is an 
    utter disproportion between one's ability and service, it cannot be accepted 
    but that service brings a curse instead of a blessing, Proverbs 11:24. Hence 
    a certain quantity of service may be accepted off one's hand that will not 
    be accepted off another's, Luke 12:48. Where God gives much, he requires the 
    greater returns.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, They are works wherein the willingness of the 
    mind carries out the hand to do, as far as it can reach, 2 Corinthians 8:3. 
    The willing mind loves to serve the Lord, and to serve him liberally; and so 
    carries a man to do to his power.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The next general head is to show how or in what 
    respect such a work is accepted. God accepts such works,</p>
<p align="justify">1. As obedience to him and a doing of his will, Matthew 
    25:21. As the willing mind is peculiar to those within the covenant of 
    grace, so it is the privilege of those in that covenant to have their works 
    so done, accepted, though imperfect. There is not one piece of obedience 
    they can do that is perfect, or could be sustained as obedience according to 
    the covenant of works; but God in Christ, in virtue of the covenant of 
    grace, accepts such imperfect works as obedience pleasing to him, Acts 
    13:22.</p>
<p align="justify">2. As a token of their love to God, Hebrews 6:10. A 
    love-token is accepted, though not great, if according to the ability of the 
    giver; especially with God, who looks more to the heart it is given with, 
    than the gift. Some offered gold and precious stones for the service of the 
    tabernacle; some but goats' hair and rams' skins; the latter as well as the 
    former was accepted, where they gave according to their ability with 
    willingness.</p>
<p align="justify">3. So as to be rewarded, 1 Corinthians 15. As believers' 
    good works are tokens of their love to God, so God gives them tokens of his 
    good pleasure with their works, not of debt, but of grace. To those that 
    improve the abilities they have, he oft-times gives more ability, "To him 
    that has shall be given." However, accepted good works are a seed that will 
    never miss a rich harvest sooner or later.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I proceed to show why such works are accepted. It is 
    not for their own worth; for the best works of the saints are attended with 
    such sinfulness, that they could not be accepted in the eye of the law; but 
    have in them more than sufficient matter of condemnation, Isaiah 64:6. But 
    they are accepted through special privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Being sanctified through the Spirit, Romans 15:16. 
    Every work of ours is defiled by us, being in ourselves unclean creatures; 
    but the Spirit works in believers, sanctifying them and their works. And he 
    sanctifies their works, by influencing them to work, and in their work 
    exciting them, giving gracious abilities; particularly working in them that 
    approbation and liking of the command, that resolution to set about the 
    work, that compliance of the heart with it, that delight and cheerfulness in 
    the duty, that design to honor God by it, and that looking out for promised 
    help, which I have spoken of before, and causing them to offer their works 
    to God through Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are presented for acceptance, by the Mediator to 
    the Father. Christ is the believers' resident in the court of Heaven, 
    managing all their matters there by his intercession, Hebrews 7:25. He takes 
    their imperfect works, perfumes them with the merit of his obedience and 
    death, and gains their acceptance with the Father, according to the covenant 
    of grace, Revelation 8:3, 4. The sum of the matter lies here; they are the 
    work of his own Spirit in his children, presented for acceptance by the Son, 
    and so they are accepted of the Father, Ephesians 2:18.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. From what is said, we may draw the two following 
    inferences—</p>
<p align="justify">1. See here of what concern it is to get the heart up to 
    every duty, 1 Chronicles 28:9. The doing of the bare work is of small 
    account with God; and where there is not a heart to it, God regards it not. 
    A good work done grudgingly, whatever use it may be for among men, is an ill 
    work in God's sight.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How may one get up his heart to every duty?</p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Accept of Christ's free salvation by faith, that you 
    may be brought into a state of salvation. We have a spirit of slaves, a 
    backwardness to good, derived from Adam. It is from Christ we must get the 
    spirit of sons, and the willing mind, uniting with him by faith, John 1:16. 
    Faith trusting on Christ for salvation to be received freely, works that 
    willingness of mind.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Exercise faith for every duty anew. Believe the 
    promise,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Of assistance by the Spirit, Ezek 36:26, 27. In the 
    covenant of grace commands are turned to promises, as Deuteronomy 10:16, 
    "Circumcise the foreskin of your heart." Compare Deuteronomy 30:6, "The Lord 
    your God will circumcise your heart." Every call to duty implies a promise 
    of assistance. The belief of this makes willing, Philippians 2:12, 13.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Of acceptance through Christ. The apostles' work was 
    heavy, but that made them willing, 2 Corinthians 2:15, "For we are unto God 
    a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish." 
    It is hard to be willing to a work, which one does not believe will be 
    accepted.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See of what concern it is to put hand to every duty 
    commanded us, and to do in it according to one's power; and not to content 
    ourselves with lazy wishes as some do, and slack and scrimp performances as 
    others, Ecclesiastes 9:10. Neither will to wish and do nothing be accepted; 
    nor to do, but do niggardly. It is not in every case that God will accept 
    the will for the deed.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, God will not accept the natural or unregenerate 
    man's will for the deed, in any case. For such a one is under the covenant 
    of works, and no less than works every way perfect can be accepted off his 
    hand, Galatians 3:10. But this is a privilege of the covenant of grace, 
    which they are not under, not being in Christ. It is the privilege of sons, 
    but they are but at best hired servants, working for hire, nay slaves, as 
    under the curse. Their persons are not accepted; therefore nothing they are, 
    have, or can do, can be accepted. Therefore deceive not yourselves, looking 
    for this benefit, while you are out of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, God will accept no man's will for the deed,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) When they content themselves with wishing only they 
    could do a duty commanded them, but yet never essay it, nor put hand to it, 
    Proverbs 21:25. The sluggard unwilling to obey, makes a cover for his sloth, 
    of the difficulty and his inability for duty, Proverbs 22:13. But God will 
    rend off that cover, and show them in their own, colors, Matthew 25:24–30. 
    Men cannot deny but that such a thing is their duty, and they wish they 
    could, but that is all.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When they do not what is really in their power to 
    do, Romans 1:20, 21. Men's power is indeed little, but their doing is far 
    less. Men are not as stocks and stones, but there are many things acts of 
    moral discipline, that they may and can do, but they will not. But they 
    grasp at the principle, that they can do nothing, and so fold their hands, 
    sitting down contented. They cannot do all, therefore they will do nothing. 
    But will that be accepted? No, Exodus 14:15. The women did not so, Mark 
    16:2, 4.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Lastly, When they do not by faith fetch in grace 
    from the Lord Jesus to strengthen them to duty, 2 Timothy 2:1, compared with 
    John 5:40. Many a good work is laid by, because of inability, and marred 
    because we can carry it no further; but God will take notice what course is 
    taken for getting in strength for duty. There are full promises lying 
    between us and the fall fountain, as the conduit-pipes at which faith is to 
    suck and draw, Isaiah 40:29–31. Assure yourselves that the will will not be 
    accepted for the deed, while this is neglected. And why should it? Is that 
    man willing to pay his debt, who though he has nothing in hand, yet has a 
    gift lying in a rich friend's hand, but he will not lift it? See the 
    decision; Matthew 25:27, "You ought to have put my money to the exchangers, 
    and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now consider in a few words the last doctrine I 
    offered from the text, namely,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. Want of power to do more, shall not mar the 
    acceptance of what is done from a willing mind according to power. In that 
    case, God will accept of his people's will for the deed.</p>
<p align="justify">Here I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. In what particular cases God accepts his people's will 
    for the deed.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Why he does so.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show in what particular cases God accepts his 
    people's will for the deed.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Where there is a sincere will to serve him in a piece 
    of work, requiring some external abilities which are wanting. If it be 
    hindered only by such want, the will is accepted. The disciples would gladly 
    have watched more, but the weak body could not bear up with their mind; and 
    Christ kindly takes notice of it; Matthew 26:41, "Watch and pray, that you 
    enter not into temptation; the Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is 
    weak." Sometimes Satan makes a rack here to God's children; such a duty they 
    would do, but bodily strength will not answer, and hereupon they are 
    disquieted; but that is from Satan, and their own weakness; for God does not 
    require that external duty from us, that we have no bodily strength for. 
    That is a sweet word, 1 Corinthians 6:13, "The body is—for the Lord, and the 
    Lord for the body." Peter would gladly have given to the poor man, but had 
    it not, and it was accepted in the will, Acts 3:6.</p>
<p align="justify">2. When doing the best we can through grace, our work 
    after all is attended with many blemishes; the Lord will not reject it for 
    these blemishes, but accepts the will to do better for the deed, Canticles 
    5:1. There is a broad cover of Christ's righteousness cast over the 
    believer's spots, that they appear not, Canticles 4:7; and the Lord accepts 
    of the will to that perfection they would be at.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Going as far as we have access in a work, but meeting 
    with a providential stop, the will to complete it is accepted for the deed, 
    as if it had been fully done, as in the case of Abraham's offering up Isaac, 
    Hebrews 11:17. There is a great difference between the stops men make in 
    these, and those which God makes; the former argues an unwilling mind, but 
    the latter not so.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Services that one really desires, and gladly would 
    perform for God, but have not opportunity; the will to them is accepted for 
    the deed, as in the case of David's purposing to build a house for the Lord, 
    2 Chronicles 6:8; and the Philippians care about supplying Paul's wants, 
    Philip. 4:10. Some have opportunities of usefulness, but slight them; that 
    is their sin; others may have a heart to be so and so useful, but they 
    cannot have the opportunity; this God accepts.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, In services performed with a real desire of 
    success for God's honor and men's good; the Lord accepts the good will to 
    the success denied, as if it had succeeded according to their wish, Isaiah 
    49:4; 2 Corinthians 2:15. The want of success may mar their present comfort, 
    but neither the acceptance nor reward.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Why does God accept such will for the deed?</p>
<p align="justify">1. The sincere will to a work is present, which God 
    mainly regards. The person sincerely aims at doing such a piece of service. 
    for God, but not attaining what he really desires, his good will thereto 
    being present before the Lord, it is accepted, as if the work had been done.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We have a merciful High Priest to present that will 
    for acceptance, notwithstanding all the weaknesses, blemishes, providential 
    hindrances, want of opportunity, and failure of success, that it may be 
    attended with, Hebrews 4:15, 16.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We have a merciful Father to deal with, Psalm 103:13, 
    14, who pities the weaknesses and infirmities of his people, and graciously 
    accepts of their upright designs to serve and honor him.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. If the Lord accepts the will for the deed in his 
    own people, then men must answer for the ill they had a will to have done, 
    as if they had done it, Numbers 14:42–45. A will and intention to do an evil 
    action, though it be not actually done, is in God's account the same thing 
    with doing it, and will be resented and punished accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God is a gracious master to his servants, taking 
    kindly off their hands through Christ their sincere will to his service, 
    giving them ample testimonies of his regard in all circumstances, and 
    bestowing upon them the special comforts of his grace here, as pledges of 
    the full reward laid up for them in glory hereafter.</p>
