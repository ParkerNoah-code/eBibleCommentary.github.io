          Lamentations 3:39 "Wherefore does a living man complain, a man for the
          punishment of his sins?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THIS world is like an hospital, where every one is groaning under some
          uneasiness or other. It is so filled with complaints, that from the
          king to the beggar, nobody is free; the melancholy sound of them is to
          be heard in the lowest cottage, and the most stately palace is not
          free of them. Sin is that which brings on the ground of complaints and
          sin brings them out; and therefore religion checks them in the text.
          The prophet himself had been complaining in the former part of the
          chapter, he seemed to have represented God as unkind and severe. Here
          he checks himself, and chides himself for doing so, declaring that
          neither he nor others, had any good reason for any such fretting
          disposition. "Wherefore does a living man complain," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In these words it is supposed, that man is apt to complain under
          afflicting dispensations. It is expressed that he ought not to
          complain, but patiently to submit himself under the hand of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observe here 1. The fault taxed, complaining, so the word is used of
          murmurers, Numbers 11:1. "And when the people complained, it
          displeased the Lord." It denotes an action that passes on a man's
          self, and intimates fretting, whereby one torments himself increasing
          his own grief and sorrow, for his affliction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The unjustifiableness of this before the Lord, why does a living
          man complain? Or what does he complain of? What can he say to justify
          his own uneasiness under the frowns of providence. Losers think they
          may have leave to speak; but religion teaches, rather to lay our hands
          on our mouths, and our mouths in the dust before the Lord, who does us
          no wrong.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. On what accounts it is unjustifiable, what are these things that
          may silence all our complaints? We are men that should act more
          rationally. We are living men that might therefore be in a worse
          condition. We are sinful men, whose hardships are the just punishment
          of our sins. We are men that have another thing to do. A man for his
          sin. So the Hebrew. Let each man complain for his sin. So the Dutch
          read it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The words of the text are few but very comprehensive, I shall more
          accurately notice them, and gleau a few things from them. I shall do
          this by raising and illustrating a series of observations founded upon
          the several parts of the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation I. There is a sinful complaining under crosses and
          afflictions. Why does a man complain? It is true, God does not
          absolutely require the afflicted to stop their mouths.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Let them complain of themselves, as the causes of their own woe. So
          they may do. "My soul, says Job, is weary of my life: I will leave my
          complaint upon myself." So men ought to do, for their own sins are the
          procuring causes of all the hardships with which they meet. "Your way
          and your doings have procured these things unto you." And again, says
          the same prophet Jeremiah, "Your iniquities have turned away these
          things, and your sins have withheld good things from you." The sinful
          nature, heart and life, are father, mother, and nurse, to all the
          miseries that come upon us. These are the carcass to which these
          eagles gather together. Remove that, and they would all quickly fly
          away. If the clouds return after the rain, let us blame our own
          misguidance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let them complain to God and welcome, Psalm 102:1–11. When the
          waters of affliction gather in their breasts let them come to a
          gracious God, and open the sluice before him as Hannah did, who in the
          bitterness of her soul prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. He has an
          ear ever ready to hear the complaints of his people, though men may be
          deaf to them. Each of them may say, My God will hear me. He has also a
          heart to sympathize with them. "In all their affliction, he is
          afflicted." A hand to help them. "Behold, the Lord's hand is not
          shortened that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy that it cannot
          hear." And indeed, here would be sufficient ease under all
          afflictions, if people had as much grace as to lay their complaints on
          themselves, and leave them to God and before him. This would make all
          right, even where one's case is farthest wrong: thus Hannah
          disburdened herself, "And her countenance was no more sad." But pride
          of heart and unbelief binds the load on the complainer's own back.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But there are sinful complainings under afflictions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We must not complain of God. It is dangerous to table a complaint
          against the sovereign Ruler of the world, whose sovereignty may
          silence us, and whose infinite purity and holiness may satisfy us,
          that he does us no wrong. When the creature libels his Creator who
          shall sit to judge between them? To whose tribunal is he answerable,
          who does in Heaven and earth according to his own will?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We must not complain of our lot, or murmur because better has not
          fallen to our share. They who do this, "are murmurers and complainers,
          walking after their own lusts." He who blames his lot reproaches him
          that allowed it to him. Every one ought to think. All men sit at God's
          table, and God himself carves every one's part to him. A holy wise
          providence does this, and to complain of the dispensation is sinful
          and hazardous, as reflecting on the wisdom and holiness of the
          sovereign manager.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We must not arrest our complaining eye on the unjust instruments of
          our afflictions, like the dog snarling at the stone, but looking not
          to the hand that casts it. "Shall there be evil in a city, and the
          Lord has not done it?" This is to make a God of the creature and then
          to rise up against it. David was aware of this, and kept from
          splitting on this rock in his affliction. "And the king said, what
          have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse because
          the Lord has said unto him, curse David, who shall then say, Wherefore
          have you done so? The sick man if he be wise, will neither blame the
          physician nor the lancet for his pain; knowing that his disease is the
          procuring cause, though they be instrumental causes of it. To clear
          this farther, men's complaints under affliction are sinful,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When they are accompanied with any the least rising of the heart
          against God, or his holy providence. Discontentment and
          dissatisfaction with what providence has laid to our hands, is
          contrary to faith which says, he does all things well; and to holiness
          which teaches a perfect resignation to the divine will and pleasure,
          saying, "Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Much more are complaints sinful, when they are mingled with hard
          speeches against God and providence. These, says Jude, "are hard
          speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God." These are
          open reflections on God, striking against his honor. When the hearts
          even of the saints are disturbed under pressing afflictions, it is
          hard to get such a clear fire from them, that will be free of this
          smoke. "You are become cruel unto me, says Job, with your strong hand
          you oppose yourself against me." Hence they often choose to say
          nothing, for fear of speaking amiss. Thus Aaron in an awful moment,
          Held his peace. Or they chose to assert in the first place the
          righteousness of God, saying, "Righteous are you O Lord, when I plead
          with you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When the complaining humor raises such a fog and mist as hides
          their mercies from their sight. Thus it did with Rachel, "She envied
          her sister, and said unto Jacob, give me children, or else I die." No
          wonder it did so with Haman, Esther 5:13. It was this the prophet was
          aware of in his complaints; when he said "Your mercies are new every
          morning, and great is your faithfulness." When the voice of men's
          complaints rises so high, as to drown the voice of their praises they
          are certainly sinful. For let men be low as they will in this world,
          their praises for mercies should have the ascendant of their
          complaints. For we are, "In everything to give thanks; for this is the
          will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. When it so discomposes as to unfit a person for the work of his
          ordinary calling. That holds good in many respects. "For the sorrow of
          the world works death." The scripture makes a very honorable mention
          of Abraham's applying himself to his necessary business, when he was
          under the heavy affliction of his wife's death, Genesis 23:3–18. And
          when trouble does so discompose men's minds, as they cannot manage
          their necessary affairs, it is an evidence that it is wrong.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is sinful, especially when it unfits men for the work of
          their Christian calling, and the service of God. "I am so troubled,
          says the Psalmist, that I cannot speak. I complained, and my spirit
          was overwhelmed." Afflictions are in that respect, like the wind to a
          ship at sea; if the wind be kept in measure, it causes the ship to
          sail swift, but if it rise boisterous, it is ready to overwhelm the
          vessel. If afflictions be well managed, they quicken men to the
          service of God; but if the spirit be overwhelmed by them, they quite
          unfit for the service, either causing it to cease, or to drive on
          heavily in it. Thus Aaron said, "such things have befallen me; and if
          I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in
          the sight of the Lord. The Israelites also are said to have covered
          the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping and crying out,
          insomuch that he regarded not the offering any more, or received it
          with good-will at their hand."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation II. Sinful complaining is self-tormenting. The word
          signifies, to make one's self sad, to vex, fret, and disturb himself.
          God makes him sad by his providence, and he makes himself sadder by
          his impatience and distrust. Sinful complaining is a thankless office.
          It is so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To God whose Spirit is grieved with it, and provoked to anger by
          it. "And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord; and the
          Lord heard it; and his anger was kindled: and the fire of the Lord
          burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost part of
          the camp." For it is quite contrary to the great duty of faith in God,
          which leads to the soul's resting in God. "Rest in the Lord, and wait
          patiently for him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To others, as marring the harmony of society, and often when people
          give way to that black passion, God in his just judgment inhibits
          others, that they have no power to help the complainer. "Lover and
          friend have you put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To a person's self it is disagreeable and tormenting. It is a
          breach of the sixth commandment, a sin against one's own life,
          destructive to the body, "A broken spirit tries the bones. And to the
          soul also, for by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken." It is
          agreeable to none but Satan, who was a murderer from the beginning;
          who being a malcontent against the government of Heaven, strives to
          increase that disposition in the world, and uses the fretful and
          complaining passions in a person's own heart; as a sword to pierce
          himself. The sinful complainer puts a load above his own burden. For
          if one's will were submitted to the will of God, how easy would it be
          to bear afflictions; but when the proud heart cannot stoop, the
          apprehension magnifies the cross, and of a molehill makes a mountain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation III. Man, sinful man, is a complaining creature. Why does
          he complain? It supposes he does so. Sinful complaining much abounds
          in the world. There is no reason can be given to justify it, but there
          are several reasons or causes of the unreasonable practice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Men do not entertain due thoughts of the sovereignty of God, and
          his awful majesty, Matthew 20:11–15. God's sovereignty would, if duly
          seen and considered, quell the mutiny of unruly passions, that rise
          within men's breasts, and arraign the great ruler of the world at
          their bar, for mismanagement. We are absolutely his and he may dispose
          of us as he will, and all that is ours, and we are obliged to obey him
          without disputing, and to submit without quarreling.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Men often see not the designs of holy providence, and they are apt
          to suspect the worst, for guilt is a nurse and mother of fears.
          Providence is a mystery, the design of which is sometimes not easily
          discovered. "Your way, O God, is in the sea, and your path in the
          great waters, and your footsteps are not known." And many times when
          the Lord is working for men's good, they strongly suspect an evil
          designed against them, as Jacob did, All these things, said he, are
          against me. Hence they complain of their crosses, as if they were
          curses; and of what providence designs for their good, as if it were
          for their destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Pride of heart is the cause of sinful complaining. Men are
          naturally like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. But a soul truly
          humbled will not dare to quarrel with God, but will rather say, "It is
          of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his
          compassions fail not." When David was in his haste he was ready to
          complain of every one, of the prophet Nathan among others, and of God
          under that covert. "I said in my haste all men are liars." But when
          his soul was humbled in him, he lays his hand on his mouth and lies
          down at God's feet, saying, "Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine
          eyes lofty. My soul is even as a weaned child." An unsubdued spirit
          under a cross makes a heavy burden.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Unmortifled lust, when crossed with afflictions makes a fearful
          mutiny. Rachel's heart was too much set upon the comfort of children,
          and providence disappointing her desire, she complains heavily,
          Genesis 30:1. Jonah with his gourd, chapter 4:6–9. If men were not too
          much addicted to the creature, too closely wedded to the things of
          time, they would not raise such complaints on the loss of them. Our
          over much fondness of the world's smiles, make the frowns of it so
          hard to bear. If our hearts were loosed from the world, we would care
          the less whether it smiled or frowned. We would have a holy
          indifference both of its good and evil. Grasp hard a man's hand that
          has a sore finger, he presently cries out; but if his hand was whole,
          he would take it kindly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Want of a due sense of the evil of sin and of our unworthiness on
          that account. They that see their sins and have a heart to mourn for
          them, will not see occasion to complain of what they are under, but
          rather wonder that their burden is not made heavier, Lamentations
          3:22. And a stroke of the Spirit of grace, at the rocky heart to cause
          the waters of godly sorrow gush out, would finish sinful complaints;
          the stream of dissatisfaction and sorrow would be turned another way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Overlooking our mercies. Did men consider what mercies compass them
          about in their lowest condition in this world; and how all these are
          forfeited by sin, and yet continued by grace and free favor, they
          would not complain. But when men hide their eyes from seeing the many
          obligations they stand under to kind providence, and count all nothing
          that is left them, no wonder they be so unreasonable as to complain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Dwelling and poring upon crosses and difficulties. This is just
          taking an unbelieving lift of our own burden, which will certainly
          increase it. Jacob would not call his son Ben-oni, though Rachel
          desired it. An unmortified fancy is a heavy plague, which cleaves to
          an affliction as the fire does on tinder, and will not suffer it to go
          out of itself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Unbelief is the great cause of all. It was the generation that
          believed not that murmured in the wilderness. Faith brings the soul to
          rest in God in all conditions. It satisfies the soul with a full
          Christ in the want of all things, Habak. 3:17–19. It realizes the
          things of another world, and where they have their due weight, truly
          the value of the things of time will sink very low. Upon the other
          hand unbelief turns the soul out of its rest in God, unto the creature
          where it must needs be restless, and blocking up the soul's sight of
          better things, it magnifies both the good and evil of a present world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation IV. Because we are men we ought not to complain. Why does
          a man complain?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We are men and not brutes. We are endowed with rational faculties,
          by which we may take up such considerations, from the sovereignty of
          God and the demerit of our sins, that might silence our complaints.
          The brutes bear a part of the load laid on the world for sin, and they
          groan under it, Romans 8:22. They complain as they are capable, and no
          wonder, for they know not who has laid the burden on them, nor for
          what it is laid on, nor whether it will be taken off. But we are men
          that may know all these, and why should we complain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We are men and not Gods, creatures and not Creators, subjects and
          not lords, and therefore ought to submit and not to complain. "Let the
          potsherds of the earth strive with one another, but will man strive
          with God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why have
          you made me thus?" Will weak man enter the lists with omnipotence?
          Will we live in God's world and not submit to his government? Is it
          fit that man should be independent and carve out his lot for himself?
          "Should it be according to your mind? He will recompense it whether
          you refuse, or whether you choose." Shall the night owl pick a quarrel
          with the sun, because it cannot bear its light? And will blind man
          pick a quarrel with holy wise providence, because it does not in every
          point answer his foolish desires?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We are men and not angels. We are not inhabitants of the upper
          regions, where no storms blow, where there is an eternal spring and
          uninterrupted peace. But we dwell in the lower region where no such
          thing is to be expected, but the clouds will return after the rain.
          Can we think that the rocks must be removed for us, that God's
          unchangeable purpose in the management of the world must be changed
          for us? If we are men, we must not complain, that what is common to
          men, the greatest of men, the best of men, befalls us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We are men and not devils. We, at our worst, in this world, are not
          in that desperate, hopeless, and helpless state in which they are. But
          have something to comfort us which they have not. They have no Savior,
          "For Christ truly took not on him the nature of angels: but he took on
          him the seed of Abraham." They fell into an abyss of misery in which
          they are sinking to this day, and ever will sink; but no hand was ever
          stretched out to help them. We also fell into an abyss of misery by
          sin, and while we are wet with the least part of it, our Lord
          stretches out his hand to pull us out. And shall we complain that we
          feel some of this misery, and not rather praise, that help is offered
          to pull us out of it, and restore us to happiness?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation V. Because we are living men we ought not to complain.
          "Wherefore does a living man complain?" The force of this lies here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Our life is forfeited yet continued, therefore there is no reason
          to complain. Life is forfeited by sin, which was forbidden unto man
          under the pain of death. We have sinned, and therefore incurred the
          penalty. "In the day you eat thereof you shall surely die," And why
          should living Adam (as it is in the Hebrew) complain, who deserving
          death is but banished or deprived of his wealth? Such an one has
          reason rather to commend the clemency, than to inveigh against the
          severity of his prince. Are we deprived of some comforts of life, we
          might have been deprived of life itself? Are we cast into a cloud of
          cares and perplexities, we might have been buried in a grave?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Living, we are not in Hell, and therefore should we praise and not
          complain, Lamentations 3:22. Would people in their afflictions look to
          the state of the damned, the smoke of whose torment ascends forever
          and ever, and withal remember that God in justice, might have had them
          in that state by this time, they would lay their hands on their mouths
          and not complain of what they meet with in the land of the living. How
          willingly would such exchange their lot with the most afflicted in the
          land of the living, "For the spirit of a man may sustain his
          infirmity: but a wounded spirit who can bear."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Living, we have the means of grace and hopes of glory. So we have
          access to better our estate in the other world, if it should never be
          better in this. Living, time is given to us for working. Life is the
          day, "the night comes when no man can work. Whatever then your hand
          finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work, nor device,
          nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, where you go." If we work out
          our salvation in this time, our happiness shall be such after death,
          as all our afflictions shall never be remembered any more. And the
          more afflicted our lot in the world is, it may the more stir us up to
          mind our great work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Living, it may be worse with us before we go out of the world than
          it is, if we do complain. The heaviest case in which one is here, he
          may still bless God, that it is not worse. It is easy for infinite
          power to punish us still seven times more, and to heat the furnace of
          our affliction hotter and hotter, Leviticus 26. It were good for the
          afflicted, that they would often think how the Lord can, and justly
          may, make their case worse. This would cause them lay their hands upon
          their mouths.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Living, we may live to see our case better. While there is life
          there is hope, "Why then should a living man complain?" We have to do
          with a bountiful God. "He will not always chide; neither will he keep
          his anger forever." They have been very low who have been raised up,
          and they have been enrapt up in a thick cloud, who yet have had a fair
          sunshine after. The rains do not fall, nor the winds blow always. The
          wheel of providence has four sides, and can in a moment take a quite
          contrary course to that which it now keeps. If our troubles be from
          the immediate hand of God. "Then though he cause grief, yet will he
          have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies." If they
          are from the hand of others, their heart is in his hand, and that
          which is crooked will be made straight, when God will, though not when
          we will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. We have no surer hold of our life than of the comforts of life. The
          latter are uncertain, so is the former. Our comforts are slippery, our
          life frail, and liable to a great many more accidents than our
          comforts of life, for the most part are. Is our life then preserved,
          while some of our comforts are lost, let us praise the preserver of
          men and not complain. The stroke that takes away a comfort might have
          taken away our life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. When other comforts are lost, and our life is continued, that which
          is best is preserved to us. Life is better than the outward comforts
          of life. "For the life is more than meat, and the body more than
          clothing. But the favor of God is better than life." If then a man
          were stripped of all his enjoyments, health, wealth, ease, and
          everything, yet while he is living he may recover the lost favor of
          God; but there is no recovering of it when life is gone, as the tree
          falls it lies. And were this only considered, one single breathing
          would be more valuable to us, than all we have in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The time of life is the time for all men's praising, because
          they sit all at the common table of mercy, and therefore not for
          complaining. "The living, he shall praise you." They that will not
          rest on the will of God, will get a long eternity to complain in, but
          here it is both their sin and misery. I know the doctrine would bear
          us in hand, that there should be no sin in Hell after the last
          judgment, and then the damned will not be capable of the least thought
          materially evil. But the scripture tells us, "The wicked are driven
          away in their wickedness;" and they are so far from being cured there,
          that they are filled with blasphemies. While they weep, wail, and
          gnash their teeth, will there not be the least fretful thought against
          God? They are not sanctified there, their natural corruption remains,
          and will it never in the least set up its head? But will they love a
          tormenting God with all their heart? Will they be perfectly contented
          with their lot? This the eternal law of righteousness requires of the
          creature, as a creature, and therefore in every state, if they do it
          not they sin. Because we are living then let us praise, and not
          complain, lest we complain forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation VI. We are sinful men justly punished for our sin, and
          therefore ought not to complain. A man for the punishment of his sins?
          Consider here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Our sins are the procuring causes of all afflictions. "Your way and
          your doings have procured these things unto you." We may thank
          ourselves for all our crosses, and therefore complain of ourselves,
          each saying with Job, "I will leave my complaint upon myself:" but
          will not complain of God; for he does not afflict willingly.
          Affliction rises not out of the dust, but out of a sinful nature,
          heart, and life. God has joined together the evil of sin, and the evil
          of punishment, hence drawing the first link of this chain, we draw the
          other also on ourselves, why then do we complain?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When our afflictions are at the highest pitch in this world, yet
          they are not so great as our sins deserve. "After all, says Ezra, that
          is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing
          that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve.
          And says David, He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded
          us according to our iniquities." How many of our sins does the Lord
          mercifully overlook, not smiting every time we sin against him, but he
          is long-suffering, and when he does, he debates with us in measure,
          otherwise we should have judgment without mercy. What face then can we
          have to complain after all this? We sin with a high hand, and the Lord
          smites softly, and yet we cry out as if we were wronged, and treated
          cruelly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We receive much undeserved good, while at the worst we get but our
          deserved evil. Our cup is a mixture of sweet with bitter; while the
          bitterest cup is put in our hand, let us then rather praise him for
          the undeserved sweet, than complain for the deserved bitterness that
          is in it, saying with Job, "Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
          and shall we not receive evil." It is an evidence of an embittered
          spirit to overlook our mercies, and pore upon our crosses, to deny
          unto our bountiful God the due praise of his free favors, because he
          visits us with some crosses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Our afflictions are necessary for us, wherefore do we complain,
          Lamentations 3:33. Our necessities extort them out of God's hand, for
          he has no pleasure otherwise in the miseries of his creatures. "Have I
          any pleasure at all, says he, that the wicked should die? And not that
          he should return from his ways and live?" A child left to himself and
          a person undisciplined by crosses will go all wrong. "Because they
          have no changes, therefore they fear not God." If we could attain it,
          we would take a bed, in which no thorn of uneasiness would be found;
          but if it were so, we would sleep too sound. Our hearts are hard to
          wean from a frowning world, how would we do if it were smiling on
          every hand. Nay, there are many mercies in your lot, there must be a
          mixture of crosses in it, something crooked, something wanting, to be
          a corrective. Why then should we be so angry with our blessings?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. We might get out from under them, if we would speedily answer the
          design of them, Leviticus 26:41, 42. They are God's medicines which if
          we would suffer to work kindly, we should soon recover. If people
          would answer the design of afflicting dispensations, the Lord would
          remove them, he would cast away the rod, when there were no more use
          for it to the child. But continuing stupid and impenitent under our
          crosses, we wreath the yoke about our own neck faster.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. How often is the sin visibly written on the punishment, that men
          may clearly see the cause of God's contending, and lay their mouths in
          the dust. It is a silencing consideration. "As I have done, so God has
          requited me." How often are we scorched with a fire of our own
          kindling, yes, we nurse the viper that gnaws out our affections, and
          our cross is the native fruit of our own conduct.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Observation VII. Under our afflictions we should turn our complaints
          on our sins. A man for his sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have sins of nature, heart, and life. We have many things wrong in
          our way, something that is in a special manner the cause of the
          controversy, that brings on the stroke. Let us turn the stream of our
          complaints that way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Instead of complaining of God, let us complain of ourselves to God,
          instead of taxing a holy God with severity, let us charge ourselves
          with folly before him. "So foolish was I and ignorant, says Asaph, I
          was as a beast before you. My wounds stink and are corrupt, says
          David, because of my foolishness." If we begin to find fault with the
          work of providence, we will instantly go wrong, and think and speak
          what we ought not; but our own sinful ways and doings, we shall be in
          no hazard readily of making them blacker than they are.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Instead of the heart's bleeding for trouble, let our hearts bleed
          for sin. David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people, and
          he confessed his great sin in doing it. By trouble we are offended and
          our peace is broken; by sin God is offended, and his Spirit grieved.
          And his pleasure is to be preferred to our ease, and therefore the
          main stream of our sorrow should run on sin, not on affliction, which
          should but open the heart to bleed for sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Instead of tossing our cross in our minds to fret ourselves, let us
          toss our sin there to humble ourselves. O! what thoughts are
          unprofitably bestowed on our afflictions, that might be well spent in
          seeking out the cause of the Lord's controversy, in loathing ourselves
          for it, applying to the blood of Christ for pardon of the sins that
          are at the root of our trouble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Instead of laboring to get up our lot to our mind, let us labor to
          get our minds brought down to our lot. Let us lay the axe of
          mortification to the root of these lusts that keep up our minds above
          our lot. This was the lesson Paul had learned, though it is not easy.
          "I have learned, says he, in whatever state I am therewith to be
          content." There is a crook in every man's lot, which he cannot make
          straight, and something wanting which he cannot supply. The best way
          is to bow the mind to the crook, and learn to want that of which
          providence sees fit to refuse the supply. Let us set ourselves to this
          way of managing crosses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It will stop the running issue of sinful complaining. When one
          bleeds excessively at one part of the body, they use to open a vein in
          another part, to turn the stream from that part and so to stop it
          there. And they that are upon the fret, and carried away in the
          complaining humor for their crosses, cannot in that case meet with a
          greater mercy, than to have the heart vein opened to bleed for sin.
          They will find the other will stop presently.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Repenting under a rod is profitable, but repining is hurtful.
          Suppose repentance have a bitterness with it, yet since we must be in
          bitterness, better repent than repine. If we feel the prickles of the
          rose bush, yet there is something pleasant and profitable to be
          gathered of it. But to be scratched with briers, the scratching is
          all, there is nothing worth the pains growing upon them. Repentance
          has joy included in it, but repining all over has nothing desirable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. This is the way to get good of crosses. To get meat of the eater,
          and sweet out of the strong; to make spiritual advantage by temporal
          losses. Hereby every wound we get in an evil world, might be a wound
          to our lusts, and so bring health to our souls. Every stone thrown at
          us by any hand might turn to better account than a precious stone. And
          by these cross winds we might be driven to our harbor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. This is the readiest way to get free of our crosses. When a man is
          brought to this he is prepared for a deliverance. "Lord, you have
          heard the desire of the humble; you will prepare their heart, you will
          cause your ear to hear." When men's complaints are turned this way,
          and people are more careful to get free of sin than of trouble, that
          is a special time for a gracious God's lifting off his hand, who will
          never lay on man more than is meet.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The neglect of this leads into many snares. He who gets not his
          heart to submit to his affliction, either will continue his
          complaints, and so be a tormentor to himself, or otherwise will be in
          hazard of using unlawful endeavors for freeing himself from it. Hence
          when this sits down upon one's spirit, and they go not to God with it,
          they are ready to go to carnal company for their ease, to sensual
          pleasures, which is called diverting, but is really destructive to
          their souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I come now to the application of the whole, and let me address you in
          the words of the text, "Why do we being living men complain, men for
          the punishment of our sins?" Since we are men, living men, justly
          punished for our sins when we are afflicted, why do we sinfully
          complain? Why do we not rather turn our complaints on sin, and repent
          and not repine? Is there any reason to justify sinful complaining and
          murmuring under afflicting dispensations. The complaining humor wants
          not its pretenses; but let us examine them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There is no sorrow like my sorrow, says the complainer, no person
          afflicted at the rate I am. Answer. Every one feels what he himself
          endures, but is no competent judge of the sorrows of others to which
          he is a stranger. "The heart knows his own bitterness; and a stranger
          does not intermeddle with his joy." The world affords many miserable
          objects, who with heart and good-will would exchange lots with any of
          us all; and God is no more obliged to be kind to us than to them. And
          no doubt, were our crosses and those of many others in the world laid
          down together to be exchanged, we would readily take up our own again,
          for fear of a worse. But suppose there were none like them in the
          world; yet you are a living man, and since you are so, and not in
          Hell, you have no reason to complain, since you might justly have been
          in that hopeless condition in which you are not. And if you can see no
          sorrow on the earth like your, look into the state of the damned and
          you will see worse, which may put you to silence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But again, if you were duly sensible of your sin, you would say, There
          is no sin like mine; you like Paul would reckon yourself the chief of
          sinners: you may see more ill in yourself than in others; and
          therefore should not complain, though no sorrow were like your,
          because you would look upon it as the just punishment of your sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. But yet my trouble is very extraordinary, few have met with such a
          one. Answer. Job's trouble was extraordinary, and he was reproached
          with that, "Call now, if there be any that will answer you: and to
          which of the saints will you turn?" Yet he bore them very patiently,
          and when he was out of the hurry of temptation, saw no reason to
          complain of holy providence, Job 2:10. Our acquaintance with the world
          is very narrow, and no doubt it has been the case of many, what we
          think has been the case of very few. But though many have no
          acquaintance with our cross, yet we deserve all we meet with, and that
          should silence us; and though others may deserve it too, yet, shall
          our eye be evil, because the eye of the sovereign Ruler of the world
          is good. Besides these others may have their crosses, which we are as
          little acquainted with, as they are with ours.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I could bear any cross better than that which providence has laid upon
          me. Answer. That is but the product of a deceitful heart, which still
          thwarting with the divine will, prefers anything to the present duty.
          We are in that case like one in sore sickness, who shifts from place
          to place, still thinking he would be better in another place than
          where he is, but when he tries it he obtains no relief and so returns
          to his bed again. But what if it be so that you could bear any trial
          better than the one you are under. Truly if there be one thing lacking
          in you, you may be sure God will try you in that point to discover you
          to yourself, if you will at all see your own case; and what one thing
          you lack. The hardest cross for a man to bear, is that which strikes
          against a man's predominant affection or lust. And that which you find
          to be the affliction you can least bear, may serve to discover where
          your weak side lies. And in the trials made upon, consists the
          greatest trial of one's sincerity. "I was upright before him, and I
          kept myself from mine iniquity."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Others triumph over me, and make my trouble the matter of my
          reproach. Answer. This has been the case of the best of the saints.
          See how it was with Job 30:9–14 and David, Psalm 3:2. as a true type
          of Christ, Psalm 69:12. And did not the Jews mock, scoff, and deride
          Christ himself in his bitter sufferings? But though they complained to
          God, yet not of God for it. Truly those that do so add affliction to
          the afflicted, and speak to the grief of those whom the Lord has
          wounded, have the worst of it themselves. "Whoever mocks the poor,
          reproaches his Maker; and he who is glad at calamities shall not be
          unpunished." And such treatment may well further your deliverance, it
          shall not retard it, if you conductest yourself rightly under it,
          Zechariah 1:15, 16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. My trouble has been of a long continuance, I have looked for a
          deliverance, but it has not come. Answer. This has often been the case
          of the Lord's people, Jeremiah 8:15–23. But they may blame themselves
          when it is so. For the Lord afflicts not willingly. Surely there is a
          cause. Have not you put a stop to your own deliverance? Perhaps you
          are not prepared for it yet. "Lord, you have heard the desire of the
          humble: you will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to
          hear." You have not got your heart brought to an entire submission.
          "Commit your way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and he shall bring
          it to pass." None blame the gardener, because he sows not his seed,
          before the ground, by plowing, be fitted to receive it; and do not you
          blame providence for suspending your deliverance until your heart be
          humbled, your complaints be silenced, and you be as a weaned child.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. My case seems to be hopeless and always the longer the more
          hopeless. Answer. If you cannot believe, and resign yourself entirely
          to the Lord, without complaining, it seems your deliverance is near,
          because man's extremity is God's opportunity. "For the Lord shall
          judge his people, and repent himself for his servants; when he sees
          that their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left." Either
          you shall be delivered from the trouble, as Abraham on the mount, or
          the people at the red sea; or the disciples in the ship, when the wind
          ceased in a moment. Or delivered in trouble, from the evil and sting
          of it, getting strength to bear it, and sufficient comfort under it.
          "My grace is sufficient for you, says God, for my strength is made
          perfect in weakness." Say you then with Paul, "Most gladly therefore
          will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may
          rest upon me." For our gracious God loves to work for his people's
          help, when they are in the most helpless condition.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. My life is one continued train of troubles, and I am every day
          meeting with new ones. Answer. So it has been with the best of God's
          children, Job says "My sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are
          poured out like the waters." Asaph says, "All the day long have I been
          plagued, and chastened every morning." Our Lord himself was a man of
          sorrows. And he has fairly warned us of this, that we must take up our
          cross daily. And since every day has the sin thereof, what wonder that
          it have also the evil thereof, Where is the ground to complain here?
          The root of sin is firmly fixed in us, and there is need of much
          tossing to loose it. We have much dross and it requires our being
          frequently in the furnace. If it be the will of God that you have more
          frequent troubles than others, there is ground to stoop to
          sovereignty, that takes not one method with all, but no ground to
          complain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. I suffer wrongfully even from those, at whose hands I deserved it
          not. Answer. Sin has put the world into confusion, and having set men
          against God, has set them also against one another. We have
          contributed to this disorder, and must not complain that we share the
          bitter effects of it. We have grieved God's Spirit who never did us
          any wrong, and that should silence us, when others mete that measure
          to us, which we have meted to our gracious God. All our fellow
          creatures are in the Lord's hand, and they can be no more comfortable
          to us than he makes them to be; neither can they be more heavy upon
          us, than he permits them for our trial and correction; and therefore
          we should look up to Heaven in this case and forbear to complain. Thus
          David said of Shimei, so let him curse, because the Lord has said unto
          him, curse David. Who shall then say, wherefore have you done so?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, My trouble is in itself exceeding great, I know not how to
          bear it. Answer. As great as it is, it may be greater, since you are a
          living man. As great as it is, it is less than your iniquity deserves.
          Were your trouble and your sin weighed in an even balance, the latter
          would weigh down the former. Why then should a living man complain,
          for such a punishment of his sin? The more resigned you are to the
          will of God, you will bear it the better for the complaining
          disposition, may well make your trouble heavier, it will make it no
          lighter. And so we should conclude, that there is no solid reason why
          man should complain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider the evil of this sinful complaining, and murmuring, and
          impatience under afflicting dispensations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is rebellion against the will of God. To the murmuring
          Israelites, Moses says, Hear you rebels. God governs the world, and
          shall we malcontents, that are not pleased with his government, rise
          in mutiny against it? What pleases God, shall it displease us? And
          what is right in his eyes, shall it be evil in ours? Will nothing
          please us but to have the reins of government out of his hands into
          our own? "Should it be according to your mind? He will recompense it,
          whether you refuse or whether you choose, and not I." If our passion
          did not blind us, we might see how we would quickly fire the little
          world of our own and others' condition, if the reins were in our own
          hands.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a killing sorrow to one's self. "The sorrow of the world
          works death." It melts one's heart within him, and like a vulture
          preys upon his natural spirits to shorten his days. God crosses the
          complainer's will, and therefore he pierces himself through with many
          sorrows; as if a man should wrap up himself in darkness because he
          cannot stop the course of the sun.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a fretting anger against one's lot. "Murmurers and
          complainers walk after their own lusts." Complainers, such as are
          dissatisfied with their lot, and with the distributions of providence,
          complain of the least, and worse falls to their share. They bark at
          the mountains of brass, the immoveable purposes of God, as dogs at the
          moon and with equal success. They disquiet and vex themselves in vain,
          like men dashing their heads against a rock, which still stands
          unmoved, but their heads are wounded. They are like a wild bull in a
          net, the more he stirs, the faster he is caught; so that still the
          complainers return with loss.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is a charging God foolishly. This Job did not. It is an impious
          libeling and accusing the administration of the sovereign Ruler of the
          world, and that of folly, as if he were not wise enough to govern the
          world. The complainer seems to see many flaws in the conduct of
          providence, and pretends to tell how God's work might be corrected. It
          accuses him also of injustice, as if he did us wrong in afflicting us,
          or laid on us more than is meet. The Judge of all the earth cannot be
          biased nor bribed, yet the sinful complainer charges him as an
          acceptor of persons and a rigid governor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. It robs God of his due praise for the manifold mercies in our lot.
          Place a sinful complainer in a paradise, the fruit of that one tree
          which is forbidden him, and about which he is uneasy, will so embitter
          him, that he will not give God thanks for the variety of mercies, with
          which he is otherwise privileged. For all avail him nothing while his
          will is disappointed in that. With Haman he says, all this avails me
          nothing. He dwells so much on his complaints, that he will not and
          cannot value his comforts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Directions for quelling the complaining humor.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Labor by faith to take up your soul's everlasting rest in God
          through Christ. The wise merchant is content to sit down with the loss
          of all, when he finds the one pearl of great price, but not until
          then. The heart of man must have something on which to rest. When he
          goes to rest in the creature, he finds the bed shorter than he can
          stretch himself upon it. Crosses and afflictions prevent his rest
          there. Should he then give up with the creature and take God in Christ
          for his God, his all and instead of all, then shall he find what would
          give ease under all disquietments in the world. Amidst all external
          calamities, he could then with Habbakuk, rejoice in the Lord, and joy
          in the God of his salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider the sovereign authority and infinite wisdom of God. He
          created us and may he not do with his own what he pleases. Shall we go
          about to wrest the uncontrollable scepter out of his hand? Shall not
          his sovereign dominion over us command our submission and absolute
          resignation? His sovereignty who gives not an account of any of his
          ways may silence us. His infinite wisdom may satisfy us. There is no
          chance work in the world, not one stroke at random in all your
          condition; it is not a work huddled up in a haste. The wheel of
          providence is full of eyes. Everything in your condition was from
          eternity in the womb of the wise decree, and brought upon you
          accordingly. "For God works all things after the counsel of his own
          will."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Consider that the crosses with which you meet are necessary for
          you. For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of
          men. If you might want them, you would not have them; for God takes no
          pleasure merely in giving his creatures pain. But he corrects us for
          our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. If you be
          under great afflictions, know that strong diseases must have strong
          remedies. Blame not the physician for it, but the disease. If God
          withdraw a comfort from you, it is to starve a lust that would feed on
          it. If he lay on you what you would not, it is but to bear down a lust
          that would carry you headlong.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Believe there is nothing in this world, in which either your
          happiness or misery is bound up. The world's happiness or misery is
          but a shadow of these things. That only is true happiness in which a
          person wants nothing he can desire, and this is only to be obtained in
          the enjoyment of God; and that is real misery in which a person has
          nothing left to comfort him, and this is not but in being utterly
          rejected by God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Labor to be humble. Humility lets us see our true worth that it is
          nothing, and so fences us against complaining, Genesis 32:10. It makes
          a person wonder that he has any comfort at all left him; and so lets
          him into the mystery of, in everything to give thanks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Do not dwell and pore upon your crosses, for that feeds the
          complaining humor. Turn your eyes on your mercies left you, and be
          thankful for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Learn to unbosom yourself in all your griefs unto the Lord by
          prayer and supplication. This gave Hannah a happy ease. And go to your
          Bibles and get your souls refreshed with the good news from the far
          country, Psalm 119:92.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Exercise yourself always in some honest business. In those that are
          idle, Satan is busy to foster the complaining humor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">9. Resist this humor in its beginnings.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Live by faith. By this your souls will be stayed on the
          promises; in all events have a favorable view of the design of God in
          afflictions, and fix on the things that are not seen, as the object of
          your chief care, and the great spring of your comfort. Amen.
