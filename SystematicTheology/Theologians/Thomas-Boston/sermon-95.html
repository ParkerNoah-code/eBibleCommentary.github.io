    Isaiah 61:1, "And the opening of the prison to them that are bound."</p>
<p align="justify">HERE is another benefit which, in the gospel, is brought 
    by Christ to sinners who are in their natural state, namely, a proclamation 
    as to opening the prison to the prisoners. In this there are two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The misery of a natural state, which is here laid out 
    in its full extent, in three particulars. You have heard that unconverted 
    sinners are Satan's captives; this is a sad case, but it is yet worse; for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are also prisoners. Every captive is not a 
    prisoner, but all natural men, being Satan's captives, are held prisoners, 
    shut up in the prison of their natural state. This is Satan's prison, 
    crammed full of his prisoners of war. But this is not all; for,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are prisoners in chains, they are bound in the 
    prison. Satan has his irons on them, as malefactors under sentence of death, 
    that they may not escape. This is still worse than being a prisoner. But 
    worse than all this is here stated; for,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They are blinded too in their prison. For the word 
    rendered opening, does particularly relate to the opening of the eyes; and 
    therefore the prophet uses it to express the relieving of such prisoners 
    perfectly. This is evident by comparing Luke 4:18, "And recovering of sight 
    to the blind, to set at liberty them who are bruised." It was a custom much 
    used in the eastern nations, and retained among the Turks to this day, to 
    put out the eyes of some of their prisoners, adding this misery to their 
    imprisonment. So the Philistines did with Samson; Judges 16:21; and 
    Nebuchadnezzar with Zedekiah; 2 Kings 25:7. This, in a spiritual sense, is 
    the case of all prisoners in their natural state. To sum up all, O 
    unconverted sinner! you are Satan's captive, a captive in prison, and a 
    prisoner in chains; and withal your eyes are put out, you are in darkness, 
    even darkness itself. In the words there is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A suitable remedy, full help proclaimed by Christ in 
    the gospel. God has seen the misery of the prisoners, his Son has paid the 
    ransom for them, and thereupon he is sent to proclaim the opening of the 
    prison doors to them, opening every way to them; for this expression 
    comprehends the affording full remedy to their case; namely, opening their 
    prison,-—opening their chains,—and opening their eyes. By his word he offers 
    it, by his Spirit he effects it, in all his elect.—From this subject we 
    propose to your consideration the following DOCTRINES—</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. That every unconverted sinner is a bound man 
    in the prison of a natural state, with his eyes put out.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That by open proclamation in the gospel, 
    Christ offers to the prisoners in a natural state, an opening of their eyes, 
    of their bands, and of their prison-doors.</p>
<p align="justify">We begin with</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. That every unconverted sinner is a bound man 
    in the prison of a natural state, with his eyes put out.</p>
<p align="justify">For illustrating this doctrine, we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Speak of the imprisonment in which guilty sinners are.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Mention the bands, chains, and fetters with which 
    they are bound in the prison of a natural state.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Point out the darkness and blindness of the 
    prisoners in their natural state.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We are to consider the imprisonment in which 
    unconverted sinners are.</p>
<p align="justify">This prison is the natural unconverted state; and thus 
    that word, 1 Peter 3:19, "By which also he went and preached to the spirits 
    in prison," is by some understood. However, it is plain that this is meant 
    in our text. Thus Peter said to Simon the sorcerer; Acts 8:23, "For I 
    perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of 
    iniquity." Thus sinners in their natural state are said to be all concluded 
    under sin, and shut up under the law; Galatians 3:22, 23. Concluded or shut 
    up, that is, declared to be so. Let us consider, then, the natural state as 
    a state of imprisonment. Here we shall answer the three following QUESTIONS—</p>
<p align="justify">1. Whose prisoners are they?</p>
<p align="justify">2. What are the causes of this imprisonment? And,</p>
<p align="justify">3. In what condition are natural men, as prisoners in 
    this their natural state? We begin with,</p>
<p align="justify">Question 1. Whose prisoners are they?</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Unconverted sinners are God's prisoners, as the 
    great Judge and party whom they have offended; Romans 11:32, "God has 
    concluded them all in unbelief." There are two things in a natural 
    state.—The sinfulness of it; they can do nothing but sin. Move they cannot 
    without that circle, more than a prisoner out of his prison.—The misery of 
    it. They are under the curse; Galatians 3:10. This last, God, as a just 
    Judge, inflicted on mankind for the breach of the covenant of works; and 
    while this lies upon them, there can be no communion between God and them, 
    and consequently nothing but sin in them; and so they are all concluded 
    under sin.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are Satan's prisoners. He acts as the jailor, 
    and is therefore said to have the power of death, Hebrews 2:14. Man, having 
    freely yielded to Satan, and become his captive, was delivered up into his 
    hand by the Judge. They are under the power of Satan, Acts 26:18. He keeps 
    the keys of this prison, and watchfully marks his prisoners, that none of 
    them escape. Nay, when the commandment is come, to deliver the elect out of 
    his hand, he will not yield them up, until the prison-doors be broke open, 
    and they are forcibly taken out of his hand.</p>
<p align="justify">Question 2. What are the causes of this imprisonment? As 
    to this we observe, that they are in prison,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As debtors to divine justice. Sin is a debt, and the 
    worst of all debts; committing sin is contracting a debt, which sinners are 
    unable to pay, but it must be paid; a satisfaction must be made to justice 
    to the utmost farthing. As to natural men, their debt is not forgiven. All 
    their accounts stand uncancelled. They have as yet no share in the 
    Cautioner's payment. Therefore they are kept in this prison justly for their 
    debt, and they cannot escape. They were laid up there for our father Adam's 
    debt. This debt brought all mankind into the prison, Rom. 5:12, "Wherefore, 
    as by one man sin entered into the world, arid death by sin; and so death 
    passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." The covenant being broken, 
    we became liable to pay the penalty, and, being unable to relieve ourselves, 
    were shut up in prison under the wrath and curse of God. They are also 
    arrested there for their own debt, contracted in their own persons. Every 
    sinful thought, word, or action, is a new item in our accounts. And at the 
    instance of every broken commandment, the law arrests the natural man in the 
    prison, clapping its curse upon the sinner; so that the longer one remains 
    in his natural state, there is always the less hope of his delivery. Nay, 
    his delivery is impossible, until the Cautioner loose all the arrests by 
    paying the whole debt.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are in prison as malefactors condemned in law; 
    John 3:18, "He who believes not is condemned already." There is a sentence 
    of death passed upon all men in a natural state, they are condemned to die 
    eternally; and therefore are committed to the jailor, to keep them in the 
    prison to the day of execution, which they know not how soon it may be 
    appointed, how soon death may lead out the prisoner to have the sentence 
    fully executed upon him. I go on to,</p>
<p align="justify">Question 3. In what condition are natural men as 
    prisoners in this their natural state? Their condition is most dismal; for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are under the wrath of God, as the malefactor 
    put in prison is under the wrath of his judge. Hence it is said, Ephesians 
    2:3, "And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others." A natural 
    state is a state of wrath. God bears a legal enmity against you as long as 
    you are out of Christ. There is a black cloud of wrath which always hovers 
    over the head of the natural man, and never will scatter until he be a new 
    creature. God is ever angry, never pleased with him; Psalm 7:11, "God is 
    angry with the wicked every day." His person is not acceptable to God; Psalm 
    5:5, "The foolish shall not stand in his sight, and he hates all the workers 
    of iniquity." Nor are his performances acceptable to God, Isaiah 66:3. God 
    will have no communion nor fellowship with him; Amos 3:3, "Can two walk 
    together except they be agreed?" There is wrath in his word, his looks, and 
    dispensations towards him.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are both under the dominion of the law, and 
    also under the lash of it; Galatians 3:10, "For as many as are of the works 
    of the law, are under the curse, for it is written, Cursed is every one that 
    continues not in all things written in the book of the law to do them." It 
    has him as fast in its hands as ever a prisoner was. It has him by the neck, 
    saying, Pay what you owe; and will never quit the hold through the ages of 
    eternity, unless he get the Surety that is able to take it off his hand. Its 
    demands are high, quite above his reach; perfect satisfaction for what is 
    past; perfect obedience for what is to come. It is a merciless creditor, and 
    will abate you nothing. As long as you are in its power, (and that is as 
    long as you are in this prison), you must lay your account with the payment 
    of the utmost farthing. What though the sentence is not speedily executed? a 
    reprieve is no pardon; Deuteronomy 32:35.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They are under the power of Satan, as the keeper of 
    the prison, Acts 26:18. He has a commanding and a restraining power over 
    them, 2 Timothy 2:26, "They are in the snare of the devil, and taken captive 
    by him at his will." They cannot move out without the bounds of his 
    jurisdiction, more than the prisoner out of the dungeon. It is true, Satan 
    keeps not all alike close, some have the liberty of the form of godliness, 
    on account of which they reckon themselves secure as to the goodness of 
    their state, and by this delusion they are held the faster in his hands.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) They are in a most uncomfortable condition. If a 
    person was in a palace as a prison, it would be uncomfortable; far more in 
    this case, the pit wherein is no water has nothing to refresh the soul; 
    Zechariah 9:11. It is true, most natural men are stupid, they consider it 
    not; they are blind, and they see not the shadow of death about them. But 
    when once their eyes are opened, there is no more rest for them there; they 
    cry, "What shall we do to be saved?" They see the filthy prison-garments of 
    unmortfied, unmortified sins about them, which they can no longer wear at 
    ease. The scanty allowance of the prisoner's diet, unblessed mercies, which 
    can serve for nothing but to keep in the wretched life until the day of 
    execution.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) They have no security for a moment's safety; but if 
    their eyes were opened, they would see themselves every moment in hazard of 
    dropping into the pit of Hell; see the natural man's case, Psalm 7:11–16. He 
    is ever standing before God's bent bow, and has nothing to secure him for a 
    moment from the drawing of it. He is condemned already, and the sentence is 
    past; no day known for the execution, uncertain but every day the 
    dead-warrant may be given out against him, and he led forth to execution. 
    What can he see to put it off, but long abused patience which will wear out 
    at length?</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) They are so secured, that they can never get away 
    without satisfaction for their debts and crimes. There is no breaking this 
    prison. Sooner may bars of iron and gates of brass be got over, than a 
    prisoner can get out of the state of wrath without satisfying the demands of 
    the law. And therefore the sinner will die in this prison, if he come not to 
    Christ. There is no getting out of this pit but by the blood of the 
    covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">For the improvement of this part of the subject, O! sirs, 
    be concerned to look to the state of sin in this glass, and be you duly 
    affected with it, as the matter requires. Consider, sinner, where you are, 
    and in what condition. Is the state of sin a prison-state? Then who are the 
    men that walk at liberty? Is it not these whose consciences are purged by 
    faith in Christ, whose guilt is removed, who walk after the Spirit, and lead 
    a holy, heavenly, circumspect life? Or is it those who, scorning to be bound 
    up to the rules of a holy walk, can stretch their consciences at their 
    pleasure, and take to themselves a sinful liberty, which others dare not for 
    their souls, who can laugh at those things for which others mourn, and 
    follow their lusts to the ruin of their souls? Truly no. All that sinful 
    liberty which those do take, and all the pleasures which they have in it, is 
    but the rattling of the chains of the devil's prisoners, while they go up 
    and down in their prison. Is the state of sin a state in which you can 
    quietly sleep another night? It is a Sodom on which fire and brimstone will 
    come down. Haste you, and escape for your life. Ah! sinner, can you be at 
    ease in a state of wrath? The world, it may be, smiles upon you; it may be 
    that it frowns; but what of either of these, while God is angry with you 
    every day? You have perhaps something for many years for your body, it may 
    be nothing; but what security have you for your soul, when death shall call 
    you hence, you know not how soon? Is the work of conversion to God a slight 
    business, about which persons are under small necessity to trouble their 
    heads? Surely it is a most weighty business, which, if it be not done, there 
    is nothing at all done for eternity. Let men in an unconverted state put on 
    what appearances of religion they will, perform what duties they will, they 
    are but dead works, wrought in Satan's prison, and leave the worker in a 
    state of death. Turn, turn you, then, from your sins unto God, cry for 
    regenerating sanctifying grace, rest not until you get it. Will you not 
    eagerly embrace the offer made you in the proclamation of opening the prison 
    to those that are bound? Christ is come to your prison door, offering by his 
    blood and Spirit to set you free. Are you willing to come away? or are you 
    so in love with your prison as not to care for deliverance? We are,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To mention the bands, chains, and fetters, with which 
    unconverted sinners are bound in the prison of a natural state. These are 
    twofold, God's and Satan's. There are,</p>
<p align="justify">1. God's bands, for they are his prisoners; and these are 
    heavier than the heaviest irons ever were on prisoners; for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There are bands of guilt and the curse on them all, 
    by which the law binds them over to wrath, Galatians 3:10. Guilt is a bond 
    binding over the sinner to deserved punishment. The curse of the law devotes 
    him to destruction. These, worse than iron fetters, enter into the soul; and 
    while they lie on persons, they cannot stir out of the prison, nor make 
    their escape. No sooner is the soul awakened to feel them, than it feels 
    them heavier than can be borne.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There are the bands of judicial hardness on some. 
    Those with whom the Lord has been long dealing, who will not hear, but 
    harden themselves against calls, warnings, and reproofs; many times the Lord 
    judicially hardens them, makes hardness of heart their punishment, as it is 
    their sin; recalls the motions of his Spirit, Hosea 4:17, "Ephraim is joined 
    to his idols, let him alone." He gives them over, saying, "He who is unjust, 
    let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still," 
    Revelation 22:11; he gives them up to their own lusts, Psalm 81:12, "So I 
    gave them up unto their own hearts' lust; and they walked in their own 
    counsels;" and he gives them up to Satan to harden them, 2 Corinthians 4:4, 
    "He has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the 
    glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them." 
    So that under the most softening means they grow worse and worse, harder and 
    harder, Isaiah 6:9, 10. These are fearful bands: but besides these there 
    are,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The devil's bands, which he puts on his prisoners in 
    their natural state, to secure them, that they may not come out of it to 
    Christ, may not be converted, may not be turned from their sins unto God. 
    These are many; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The band of prejudices. These are so fixed on 
    natural men, that Jesus says, Matthew 11:6, "Blessed is he whoever shall not 
    be offended in me." Satan dresses up religion and true holiness in such a 
    monstrous shape, that they are affrighted at it, they cannot wish it, they 
    can never get a heart to it; and therefore they entertain Christ's message, 
    as Nabal did David's, 1 Samuel 25:11, Shall we, say they, give up with that 
    pleasant or profitable way, in which we are, and betake ourselves to a way 
    that must needs be a continual weariness? This is a strong band, but when 
    the eyes are opened, and God's ways are tried in earnest, it would break 
    like an untwined thread; Proverbs 3:17, "Her ways are ways of pleasantness, 
    and all her paths are peace." Come and see. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The band of ill company. Satan does as the Romans 
    did with some of their prisoners, he binds his prisoners together, so that 
    one helps to hold fast another, to their ruin; Proverbs 13:20, "A companion 
    of fools shall be destroyed." Thus there are bundles of drunkards, swearers, 
    Sabbath profaners, despisers of what is good, worldlings, to whom the world 
    is the chief good; and every one of the bundle is a snare to the soul of 
    another. With an eye to this is the terrible sentence given, Matthew 13:30, 
    "Gather you together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn 
    them." Therefore is the gospel-invitation, Proverbs 9:5, 6, "Come, eat of my 
    bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. Forsake the foolish, and 
    live, and go in the way of understanding." There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The band of earthly-mindedness. This held them fast 
    who were bidden to the gospel-supper, Luke 14:16–20. The wretched world had 
    its bands on every one of them, so that they could not stir to come. They 
    must look to this and the other business, that they do not lose their 
    advantage; and while the devil's servant is thus busy here and there, 
    looking well to this and that, the immortal soul, with the keeping of which 
    God charges him, is lost. The pleasures of the world, like syren songs, 
    arrest them like iron fetters covered with silk; these secure them. The 
    cares of the world, like a thicket, entangle them, they cannot get leisure 
    for them to mind their souls; and the weary earth ever interposing between 
    them and the Sun of Righteousness, they are thus kept in a dark prison. 
    There is,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The band of unbelief. This is such an one as no less 
    than the arm of the Lord can take off; Isaiah 53:1, "Who has believed our 
    report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" Men hear the 
    word, but they do not believe it; they believe not the doctrine of the 
    gospel, they count it foolishness, 1 Corinthians 1:23. The promises they do 
    not believe, they count them but fair words, and will not quit their 
    certainty in a sinful course for the hope of them, Hebrews 4:1, 2, 11. The 
    threatenings they consider as mere scarecrows, and in spite of them promise 
    themselves peace; Deuteronomy 29:19, "And it shall come to pass, when he 
    hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I 
    shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add 
    drunkenness to thirst." They believe not their need of Christ, and therefore 
    they slight and reject him. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">5. The band of slothfulness. This ties down the natural 
    man in his prison-bed, saying, Proverbs 6:10, "Yet a little sleep, yet a 
    little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep." It hangs so heavy 
    upon his legs, that he cannot move them in the way of God; Proverbs 26:13, 
    "The slothful man says, There is a lion in the way." "A lion is in the 
    streets, yet his feet are swift to evil," Isaiah 59:7. This band is so heavy 
    on his head, that he cannot lift up his eyes; and on his hands, that he 
    cannot lift them to his mouth for his soul's behoof; Proverbs 26:15, "The 
    slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to 
    his mouth." This is a hellish gulf on earth, that swallows up convictions, 
    resolutions, motions of good, and the like. They could be content to be 
    better, if God would work with them as with stocks and stones, which are at 
    no pains for their own polishing. They can spend whole days, and even 
    nights, for the world and for their lusts; but to spend a day, or a 
    considerable part of a day, in clearing their accounts, and laying down 
    their measures for eternity, this is what they cannot be troubled with. 
    There is,</p>
<p align="justify">6. The band of delays. This held Felix fast, when the 
    rest of the bands on him were like to give way, Acts 24:25. When trembling 
    under Paul's preaching, he said, "Go your way for this time; when I have a 
    more convenient season, I will call for you." The prisoners, many of them, 
    are not resolved not to come out, only they put it off, resolving to do it 
    afterwards. The young put it off until they be old, the old until death come 
    to their bed-side. Some make one resolution, and some another, to turn to 
    the Lord; and though the time comes which they had set, yet they still put 
    it off again to another time; and so on, until death comes at length, and 
    sweeps them off, before they have power to execute their good purposes. 
    There is,</p>
<p align="justify">7. The band of delusion; Isaiah 44:20, "He feeds on 
    ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his 
    soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?" They are under a 
    fearful delusion as to their state, like Laodicea, Revelation 3:17, "Because 
    you say, I am rich, and increased in goods, and have need of nothing; and 
    know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and 
    naked." As one is refused admission by mistake, so Christ is often kept at 
    the door; for the poor deluded sinner thinks he is in already. They abide 
    fast in the gall of bitterness, because they imagine themselves to be got 
    out of it already. They remain unconverted, because they reckon themselves 
    already converted. This is a most dangerous case, which should stir us all 
    up to an impartial examination of our state; Isaiah 50:11, "Behold, all you 
    that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the 
    light of your fire, and in the sparks which you have kindled. This you shall 
    have of mine hand, you shall lie down in sorrow." There is,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The band of divers lusts; 2 Timothy 3:6, "Laden 
    with sins, led away with divers lusts." They are laden with them, as ever a 
    prisoner was with irons, so that by them Satan holds them fast. Unmortified 
    lusts crawl up and down, preying on their souls, and keeping them in a state 
    of death. They hang about them, crying, Give, give, so that they can get 
    nothing done to purpose for eternity. And so many unmortified lusts as there 
    are about a man, Satan has so many handles to hold him by. A lust of 
    covetousness, of pride, sensuality, and the like, will hold a man fast.</p>
<p align="justify">This part of the subject may be improved in a use of 
    lamentation.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a lamentation, and may be for a lamentation over 
    all the unconverted, as bound men in the prison of a natural state. You are 
    little concerned with it, but the misery of the case deserves tears of 
    blood. For you are laid up in custody at the instance of God's law and 
    justice, as a debtor and criminal. As a debtor, you shall not be let out 
    until you have paid the utmost farthing. But, alas! you have nothing with 
    which to pay; men and angels cannot help you; their united stock is not 
    sufficient to pay off the debt of sin. As a criminal, you can not be let 
    out, until you abide your trial; and terrible will it be whenever God calls 
    you to it; when your indictment is read, and you are tried for your life 
    according to law, what can you say? your crimes are undeniable. You can not 
    get out by force or fraud, slight or might. You are God's prisoner, as the 
    offended party. What can you do or say that is not known to him who sees all 
    things? Where can you flee, where his hand will not find you out. You are 
    Satan's prisoner as your jailor. He has malice enough to prompt him to watch 
    and keep you, power enough to hold you still. His iron-bands and chains are 
    upon you in the prison-house, how can you escape? Look to the bands on you 
    in the prison; look on them and mourn, and lament your case. There are bands 
    on you of God's laying on, and who but he then can take them off? for he 
    shuts, and no man can open, Revelation 3:7. You are bound under the curse of 
    the law, and God has bound you; to whom can you apply to loose you? If men 
    lay on bands, God can loose the prisoner, whether they will or not; "The 
    Lord loosens the prisoners," Psalm 146:7. But if God lay on the bands, the 
    whole creation may stand and commiserate the prisoner. They may drop a tear, 
    but neither angels nor men can loose him. There are bands on you of Satan's 
    laying on; and these must be sad ones which are led on by that hand. He is 
    the strong man; it must be a stronger than he who can loose them; this is 
    beyond your reach. You did not feel God's bands, but walk lightly under 
    them. You entertain and take a pleasure in Satan's chains, in your company, 
    sinful pleasures, and the like. This makes your escape the more hopeless; 
    while you rejoice in your iron fetters, as if they were chains of gold, it 
    is an evidence that you are beside yourself. Finally, These bands will 
    infallibly secure your ruin, if you be not loosed in time; you will die in 
    the prison, if you are not brought out. There is but one step between you 
    and death, eternal death. If you die in the prison of an unconverted state, 
    you will go to the prison of Hell, where the prisoners are kept without hope 
    of any release.</p>
<p align="justify">This being the case, see to yourselves in time, O 
    prisoners of hope! Labor to be loosed from your bands, that you die not in 
    the pit. To such I would offer the following ADVICES—</p>
<p align="justify">1. Awake, and feel the weight of the bands on you; there 
    is no hope of your deliverance while you walk lightly under them. Mourn over 
    your guilt, your unbelief, and long for deliverance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Put your case in the hand of the great Cautioner, who 
    is willing and able to relieve you. Employ the Advocate, who will certainly 
    carry the plea in your favor. He will not do as the butler who forgot 
    Joseph, though employed to use his interest to bring him out of prison; but 
    by the blood of his covenant Jesus will deliver you.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Give in your petition to your Judge: Job 9:15, "I 
    would," says Job, "make my supplication to my Judge." Pray, pray, you 
    prayerless persons; pray every day, pray always, you who pray only now and 
    then; a sign that you have to begin this exercise, to pray to purpose. Pray 
    seriously, fervently, importunately, you that are formal in prayer. Your 
    life lies at stake: there is no time to trifle.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Hasten your trial, that your plea may be heard before 
    a throne of grace; for if you miss that tribunal, it will come before 
    another at death and judgment, when it will be impossible for you to stand. 
    There are two tribunals for such prisoners, the tribunal of mercy and grace, 
    and the tribunal of justice. There is, the tribunal of mercy and grace, to 
    which the sinner is brought in the work of conversion, in time, in this 
    world. Hither the elect prisoner is brought, and stands trembling, while 
    other prisoners lie still in the prison, jovial and easy. Here he is 
    accused, convicted and condemned; he subscribes to the equity of the 
    sentence; but, by the provision made in this court for criminals, he comes 
    off acquitted from the sentence of death, to return to the prison no more. 
    There is the tribunal of justice, to which the sinner is brought at death 
    and the last day. Here the prisoner, in his natural state, is accused, 
    convicted, and condemned without remedy; Matthew 22:13, "Then said the king 
    to the servants, Bind him (that wants the wedding-garment) hand and foot, 
    and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping 
    and gnashing of teeth." And from hence he is sent into the prison of Hell. 
    At the one or the other of these tribunals, all the prisoners must appear 
    for their trial. To the first, I would have you to hasten your cause; for it 
    has advantages which the other has not. In the first, the law is subservient 
    to the gospel, and condemns, to make the sinner flee to the Mediator; 
    Galatians 3:24, "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto 
    Christ, that we might be justified by faith." In the second, the law 
    condemns, to make the sinner's case absolutely hopeless. The one makes the 
    sinner sick unto life and everlasting health, the other to death. At the 
    one, a person may have the advantage of a Surety to undertake for his debt, 
    of an Advocate to plead for him, 1 John 2:1, "If any man sin, we have an 
    Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the atoning 
    sacrifice for our sins." He never fails to bring his client's cause to a 
    comfortable issue. But at the other, there is no Cautioner, no Advocate; the 
    prisoner must act all for himself; yes, the Cautioner and Advocate is judge 
    to condemn him. Finally, at the one, there is a covert of blood for the 
    condemned man to flee under, where the sentence of death cannot take effect. 
    There are horns of an altar, from which justice cannot take him, and a city 
    of refuge, where he shall be safe. But none of these are to be had at the 
    other: therefore haste the trial. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To consider the darkness and blindness of the 
    prisoners in a natural state. Here it will be necessary to attend to three 
    things. First, The nature of this blindness. Secondly, The kinds of it 
    incident to these prisoners. And, Thirdly, The effects of it upon them. Let 
    us attend,</p>
<p align="justify">First, To the nature of this blindness. And here we may 
    observe, that it is a spiritual, and not a bodily defect. Though they have 
    their eyes in their heads, their poor souls are full of darkness; Ephesians 
    5:8, "You were sometimes darkness." Though they may have a natural and 
    literal knowledge of spiritual things, yet they want the spiritual and 
    saving light of life; 1 Corinthians 2:14, "The natural man receives not the 
    things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can 
    he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." How manifestly are 
    these distinguished! Though they have the knowledge of the history of these 
    things, yet they are strangers to the mystery of them. Thus it is said, 
    Deuteronomy 29:4, "Yet the Lord has not given you an heart to perceive, and 
    eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day." Again, it is total blindness. 
    They are not only dark, but darkness itself, Ephesians 5:8. There is not the 
    least gleam of saving light in their souls; they are absolute strangers to, 
    and unacquainted with God in Christ. Their service in religion is to an 
    unknown God. They know not Christ; there is a transcendent glory in him, but 
    they cannot perceive it. They are strangers to themselves; they are wretched 
    and miserable, but know it not, Revelation 3:17. They see not their sins in 
    their own ugly colors, in their natural deformity. Let us,</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Attend to the kinds of blindness incident to 
    these prisoners. There is a natural blindness common to all of them. All 
    'Adam's children are born blind; Romans 3:11, "There is none that 
    understands, there is none that seeks after God." Our minds naturally are 
    void of saying light, we have lost saving knowledge, with other parts of 
    God's image. Hence, whenever grace opens the eyes, people are as it were 
    brought into a new world, seeing things they never saw before, and seeing 
    them in that manner in which they never saw them before. Again, There is an 
    acquired blindness, which they procure to themselves; Ephesians 4:18, 
    "Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God 
    through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their 
    heart." The power and prevalence of lusts blind them more and more to the 
    true interest of their souls. The light shines about them, but they hate it; 
    it glances in their faces from the word and providence, but they shut their 
    eyes and will not let it in; Isaiah 26:11, "Lord, when your hand is lifted 
    up, they will not see." They by this means strengthen their diseases; and 
    the longer they continue in it, there is the less hope. Finally, There is a 
    judicial blindness; Isaiah 6:9, 10, "And he said, Go and tell this people, 
    hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not. 
    Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their 
    eyes." They rebel against the light, they abuse that light which they have, 
    they will not open their eyes to clear light, and God judicially shuts them. 
    He withdraws the common influence of his Spirit from them, and they are 
    infatuated, so that they cannot see their own true interest, but act as 
    fools and madmen in matters of the greatest importance. They are "delivered 
    over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient," 
    Romans 1:28. They are also delivered to Satan, who, as the executioner of 
    justice, binds them more and more; 2 Corinthians 4:4, "He blinds the minds 
    of them that believe not." We are to attend,</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, To the effects of this blindness on the 
    prisoners. These are many; I mention the following—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A situation truly uncomfortable and piteous. They are 
    sitting in darkness, and in the region and shadow of death, Matthew 4:16. 
    What a melancholy case were the Egyptians in during the three days' 
    darkness, while the Israelites had light in all their dwellings! It was 
    among the last and worst of their plagues. Surely light is sweet; and the 
    more excellent the light is, it must be the sadder to be deprived of it. The 
    light of God's grace and favor is the most excellent light, and therefore 
    Heaven is called light, and Hell is darkness, utter darkness; no gleam of 
    comfort in Hell. A natural state is the suburbs of Hell, and no real comfort 
    in this condition, but a possibility of help. Therefore the saints pity 
    them, as in a most piteous condition. Jerusalem's case drew tears from our 
    Savior's eyes, Luke 19:41, 42. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Unacquaintedness with their own state of sinfulness 
    and misery; Revelation 7:17. Their misery; they are blind, they see not the 
    hazard they are in every moment of dropping into the pit. The messengers of 
    death are approaching them, the sword of justice is hanging over their 
    heads, signs of approaching ruin are on them and about them; others see it, 
    but not themselves; Hosea 7:9, "Strangers have devoured his strength, and he 
    knows it not; yes, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knows it 
    not." The prodigal never saw his starving condition, until he came to 
    himself, Luke 15:17. Their sinfulness also; of this they are ignorant; 
    Romans 7:9, "For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment 
    came, sin revived and I died." As in a house, the motes flying thick there 
    are not perceived until the sun-beams enlighten it; so, until the Lord open 
    the eyes of the blinded sinner, he sees not those swarms of living lusts 
    which are preying on his dead soul, the innumerable evils which compass him 
    about, those multiplied pieces of guilt which are binding him over to 
    destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are easily ensnared and deceived in matters of 
    the greatest concern. Our Lord Jesus pronounces a woe to the world because 
    of offences, Matthew 18:7. Because stumbling-blocks laid before the blind 
    cannot but have most pernicious effects. The world is full of snares laid by 
    Satan and his instruments; and the blindness of the mind exposes men to the 
    utmost hazard by them. How easily are they cheated out of their greatest 
    interests for another world, and made to hug a shadow instead of the 
    substance, and embrace a scorpion instead of a fish, and stones instead of 
    bread; because, though they be eagle-eyed in the things of time, they are 
    like bats and owls as to the light of life. Like Esau, for one morsel of 
    meat they sell this birth-right, Hebrews 12:16.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They get no good of the light of the gospel, but 
    stumble at noon-day, as in the dark. They receive this grace in vain. The 
    night and day are alike to the blind, winter and spring to the dead tree. 
    And hence men live under the gospel as loosely, profanely, and carelessly, 
    as if they were living in the dark corners of the earth. The light of the 
    gospel, like a shining sun, has arisen, teaching us, that, "denying 
    ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and 
    godly, in this present world," Titus 2:12. But instead of going like men to 
    their proper work, they like wild beasts go to their dens, and lie at ease, 
    neither working out their own salvation, nor doing any good to others. The 
    light is set up to them, but their works are works of darkness, and so they 
    hate the light.</p>
<p align="justify">5. They are precipitating themselves into the utmost 
    hazard to their souls, without fear; Psalm 36:1, "The transgression of the 
    wicked says within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes." 
    How fearlessly do men venture themselves into the forbidden ground, rush in 
    the way of sin on the sword-point of justice; Jeremiah 8:6, "I hearkened, 
    and heard, but they spoke not aright; no man repented him of his wickedness, 
    saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse 
    rushes into the battle." They drink up iniquity as the ox the water, being 
    in that case as blind men drinking up a cup of poison, which they know not 
    to be such. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">6. Deep security in the most dangerous condition, as not 
    seeing what is before them. They go on in their courses, as the sinners did 
    before the flood, Matthew 24:38. They are exposed every day to the utmost 
    hazard, yet they are secure. They stand before God's bent bow, as a mark to 
    his arrows, yet they are at ease. Wrath is pursuing them, yet they are not 
    concerned to flee from the wrath to come. They are jovial while about the 
    pit's mouth, and even though they are in hazard every moment of falling into 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, To sum up all in a word, this blindness fills the 
    whole man in heart and life with darkness and confusion; Matthew 6:23, "But 
    if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness; if, 
    therefore, the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that 
    darkness!" A person can do nothing which is good in this case, he lies open 
    to all evil both of sin and misery. And this darkness, unremoved, will make 
    way for eternal darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">Having, as we proceeded, made some practical improvement, 
    in conclusion, we shall only exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To be convinced, of this your natural darkness; 
    believe it from the Lord's word, and believe your hazard from it, though 
    otherwise you do not see it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See your need of Christ to open your eyes. Pray for 
    the Spirit; say, with the blind man," Lord, that mine eyes may be opened."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, From what has been said on the several parts of 
    Christ's commission with respect to natural men, unconverted sinners may get 
    a broad view of their misery. You are Satan's captives, yes, prisoners, 
    God's prisoners, the devil's prisoners, prisoners in bands, and blinded 
    prisoners. Be deeply affected with your condition, and be persuaded, as 
    prisoners of hope, to return to your strong-holds, while you have access to 
    them. While it is called today, harden not your hearts, but hearken to his 
    voice, proclaiming that he is "anointed to open the prison to them that are 
    bound."</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING attended to the first doctrinal point on this 
    subject, we now go on to</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That, by open proclamation in the gospel, 
    Jesus offers to prisoners in a natural state, an opening of their eyes, a 
    loosing of their bands, and a bringing them out of their prisons.</p>
<p align="justify">We shall illustrate the different parts of this doctrine, 
    under the following heads—</p>
<p align="justify">I. We shall show, that Christ offers to such an opening 
    of their eyes, the recovery of their spiritual sight, and to bring them from 
    darkness unto light.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We shall show how Christ takes off the devil's bands 
    from these prisoners.</p>
<p align="justify">III. We shall show, that Christ offers to prisoners in a 
    natural state, an opening of their prisons, and a bringing them out of 
    these.</p>
<p align="justify">The improvement of each will be added as we proceed. We 
    are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show, that Christ offers to prisoners in a natural 
    state, an opening of their eyes, the recovery of their spiritual sight, and 
    so to bring them from darkness unto light.</p>
<p align="justify">What, do such say, is in this offer! Certain it is that 
    saving illumination is hereby offered to you; Revelation 3:18, "I counsel 
    you," says he, "to anoint your eyes with eye-salve, that you may see." This 
    is a glorious and most necessary benefit, a thousand times more necessary 
    than light to those who are naturally blind. The unrenewed world lie in 
    darkness, they will not, they cannot see. There is a long and dark night 
    upon them. Christ offers to bring a morning unto their souls, to make the 
    day-star arise there; yes, the Sun of righteousness to shine there. There is 
    a thick mist about you, so that you cannot see your way, but spend your life 
    in endless wanderings among deep pits. He will, by the spirit of his mouth, 
    dispel it, and make light to arise up, that you may see clearly about you. 
    Your eyes are clouded and blinded; he will make the scales to fall off from 
    them; and this will give you a threefold sight. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A sad and melancholy sight, the saddest ever you saw, 
    which will make the lightest heart among us all heavy; and this is a sight 
    of yourselves in your universal sinfulness and defilement. This pricked 
    Peter's hearers to the heart, Acts 2:37. It struck Paul with the paleness of 
    death; for "I was alive," said he, "without the law once; but when the 
    commandment came, sin revived, and I died," Romans 7:9. Men naturally are 
    strangers to themselves, but when the prisoner's eyes are opened, he gets a 
    broad view of his sinful self. He sees a corrupt nature, from which no good 
    can come; averse to good, and prone to evil; not to be changed, but by a 
    miracle of grace; Romans 8:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver 
    me from the body of this death?" He sees a corrupt, desperately wicked 
    heart: "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who 
    can know it?" Jeremiah 17:9. There is an emptiness of all good; a fullness 
    of all evil, the seed and root of all abominations which are done in the 
    world, living lusts of all kinds, like so many vermin in their nest, Mark 
    7:21; a continual steam of actual sinning and lusting, arising from hence on 
    the steam of a dunghill. Further, he sees a sinful life and conversation, 
    woven into one continued piece of sin, where the parts sometime thought good 
    will appear even black as Hell, like the rest; unclean lips, all over 
    defiled with vanity or vileness; an unclean life, which is unfruitful and 
    unprofitable for God and for themselves; full of sins against the holy law 
    of God, committed against much light and love, as well as checks by word and 
    providence, etc. When the Lord comes to the prisoner, and opens his eyes, he 
    takes him and leads him through his heart and life; then what a sad sight 
    does he get! then will he cry, as in Job, 40:4, "Behold, I am vile; what 
    shall I answer you? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth." Then is 
    accomplished these words, "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your 
    backslidings shall reprove you; know therefore, and see that it is an evil 
    thing and a bitter that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and that my 
    fear is not in you, says the Lord of hosts," Jeremiah 2:19. There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A terrible and frightful sight, which will make the 
    stoutest heart to tremble, so that they shall say, as Moses did at the 
    burning mount, "I exceedingly fear and quake." And this sight is threefold. 
    There is a sight of an absolute God, in the glory of his holiness and 
    justice, Leviticus 10:3. Men's eyes are naturally withheld, so that they see 
    not what a God they have to do with, Psalm 50:21. They think he is 
    altogether such an one as themselves; but says he, "I will reprove you, and 
    set them (your sins) in order before you." When their eyes are opened, they 
    are cured of their fatal mistake; Habakkuk 1:13, "You are of purer eyes than 
    to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity." They see him on a throne of 
    justice, angry with the wicked every day; a hater of every sin, a severe 
    avenger of sin from the least to the greatest, with whom no sin is accounted 
    a small thing. There is a fiery stream issuing out of his mouth, to devour 
    his adversaries, as engaged, by his word and nature, to magnify the law and 
    make it honorable. This terrible sight will give the sinner experience of 
    the psalmist's case, Psalm 73:3, "I remembered God, and was troubled; I 
    complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed;" and hence make his heart cry out 
    within him, as in Isaiah 33:14, "Who among us shall dwell with devouring 
    fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" Again, he gets a 
    sight of the fiery law in its absolute purity, extensiveness, and severity; 
    Romans 7:9, "For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment 
    came, sin revived, and I died." The law, to the blinded sinner, is like a 
    looking glass covered over with dust, in which the man never sees the true 
    shadow of himself. But when the sinner's eyes are opened, the glass is 
    rubbed clean, and shines bright, to his terror and astonishment. Then it 
    discovers the damnable nature of some things he thought good, the 
    heinousness of what he reckoned small faults, and makes all his sins greater 
    than ever he thought them. He sees the threats and curses of the law, no 
    more as scarecrows, or as the shadows of the mountains, but more sure than 
    Heaven or earth to have their effect. And then one word of it will go deeper 
    with him than a thousand used to do. Further, he gets a sight of himself, in 
    his miserable, lost, and undone estate. Like the prodigal, he comes to 
    himself, and sees that he is perishing with hunger. He sees himself to be 
    ruined, to be a self-destroyer; a dead man in law, devoted to destruction by 
    the curse of the law; under sentence of eternal death, pronounced by the 
    Judge of all, and registered in the Bible; bound with the threatenings of 
    the law, as so many cords of death; and withal, utterly unable to extricate 
    himself out of this gulf of sin and misery; Romans 5:6, "For when we were 
    yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."</p>
<p align="justify">3. They get a comforting and heart-reviving sight, the 
    most comfortable they ever saw, which will make the most heavy heart joyful. 
    And this is a sight of Christ in the glory of his mediatory office; Isaiah 
    33:17, "Your eyes shall see the King in his beauty, they shall behold the 
    land that is very far off." They see Jesus standing as a Prophet, 
    discovering those thoughts of love, which were from eternity in the breast 
    of Christ's Father, toward these prisoners. Standing as a priest as he had 
    been slain, at the Father's right hand, making intercession for the 
    prisoner's freedom. And as a King, having the sovereign command of life and 
    death, and having the keys of the prison in his hand, to take out the 
    prisoner when he will. O glorious sight for the prisoners! when their eyes 
    are opened. It is a threefold sight. It is a sight of the transcendent 
    excellency and loveliness of Jesus, Isaiah 33:17, (quoted above.) While the 
    prisoner lay in darkness, he was ready to say to every lover of Christ, 
    "What is your beloved more than another beloved?" Canticles 5:9. There was 
    then to him more glory in a vain world, in the lust of the eye and the pride 
    of life, than in Christ. But now that his eyes are opened, he sees a glory 
    in him, which darkens all created excellency, as the rising sun makes the 
    stars to hide their heads. He appears now as the pearl of great price, 
    Matthew 13:46. All the perfections of the divine glory shine forth in him; 
    these appear in the face of Christ, as in a glass, of which the prisoner now 
    gets a view. And then none but Christ for him; Psalm 73:25, "Whom have I in 
    Heaven but you? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside you." 
    Again, he gets a sight of his fullness for, and suitableness to, the case of 
    the prisoner. Like the prodigal, Luke 15:17, he sees that in his father's 
    house there is bread enough and to spare. He sees then that he needs look to 
    no other quarter for help; that there is an all-sufficient fullness of it in 
    Christ. Does the prisoner consider his vast debts? Christ is a cautioner, a 
    mighty one. Does he consider his crimes? Christ died to satisfy for them. He 
    has power over the jailor, and can bind the strong man, loose and bring out 
    the prisoner. Is he defiled in his prison-garments? Christ has white 
    clothing to put on him, in exchange for these. Are there iron gates in the 
    way? yes, irons on the prisoner's legs? He breaks the bars of iron, and 
    brings out the prisoner. Once more, he gets a sight of the willingness and 
    readiness of Christ to communicate of his fullness; Hebrews 4:15, 16, "For 
    we have not an high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our 
    infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. 
    Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain 
    mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." He now sees the truth and 
    reality of gospel invitations and promises, that they are not only fair 
    words, as he sometime thought them, but sure and tried words; Psalm 12:6, 
    "The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of 
    earth, purified seven times." This revives the fainting heart, is the great 
    cordial for a soul ready to perish; so that the prisoner resolves to venture 
    himself, and lay his whole weight on the glorious Deliverer.</p>
<p align="justify">Before leaving this head, it may be of importance to 
    inquire, what ground the blinded prisoner has to rest upon and embrace this 
    offer in the proclamation of the gospel? As to this we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That there is nothing offered but what our Lord can 
    perform and make good; Numb, 23:19, "God is not a man that he should lie; 
    neither the son of man that he should repent; has he said, and shall he not 
    do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?" Jesus is the true 
    light, the light of the world; the star that came out of Jacob, Numbers 
    24:17; the bright and morning star, which puts an end to the dark night in 
    the soul, Revelation 22:16, the sun of righteousness, Malachi 4:2. He has a 
    fullness of the spirit of light in him, to communicate to dark souls, 
    Revelation 3:1. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That there is nothing offered but what he has already 
    performed in the experience of thousands, who have been Satan's close 
    prisoners as well as you; Isaiah 35:4, 5, 6, "He will come and save you. 
    Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall 
    be unstopped; then the lame man shall leap as an deer, and the tongue of the 
    dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams 
    in the desert." Paul was a blind Pharisee, but O how wonderfully were his 
    eyes opened! There have been many who were as stupid, secure, and blind as 
    any, whom the day-spring from on high has visited; who sat in darkness, but 
    are now turned from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto 
    God. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is nothing proposed to us but what he has his 
    Father's commission to offer and make good; Isaiah 49:6, "And he said, Is it 
    a light thing that you should be my servant, to raise up the tribes of 
    Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will also give you for a 
    light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the ends of the 
    earth." Verse 9, "That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth? to them that 
    are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in their ways, and their 
    pastures shall be in all high places." Again, to the same purpose, see 
    Isaiah 42:6, 7. And therefore his coming into the world is compared to the 
    day-spring, Luke 1:78, which comes at its appointed time. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That what is offered is offered unto you. You are all 
    comprehended in the proclamation; Isaiah 55:1, "Ho! every one that thirsts, 
    come you to the waters." Whatever be your case, though you be in the 
    innermost room of Satan's prison in the world, you are men, you are sons of 
    men: Proverbs 8:4, "Unto you, O men! do I call, and my voice is to the sons 
    of men." And the offer is very particular, Ephesians 5:14, "Awake, you that 
    sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light." We 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That there is the greatest reality, truth, and 
    sincerity in the offer; Revelation 3:14, "These things says the Amen, the 
    faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God." Never one 
    embraced this offer who was refused. It grieves his Spirit that sinners do 
    not fall in with it. He wept over Jerusalem for this; and he has lost no 
    affections of compassion by going to Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">This part of the subject we would improve, by urging you 
    to embrace the offered light, the saving illumination proclaimed in the 
    gospel; and to come to Christ with this errand, That your eyes may be 
    opened. And here I would exhort you to the following things—</p>
<p align="justify">Be convinced of your natural darkness and blindness in 
    the things of God. Say not, with the Pharisees, Are we blind also? The less 
    you see of this darkness about you, the greater is the darkness upon you. 
    The best see but in part, and most men see none at all in a saving manner. 
    Love darkness; John 3:19, "And this is the condemnation, that light is come 
    into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their 
    deeds are evil." As the owl loves not the shining sun, so men wedded to 
    their lusts hate the light, and love to be in darkness. They do not know 
    God, nor his law, nor his Son, nor themselves, and they care not for the 
    knowledge of them; Job 21:14, "Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; 
    for we desire not the knowledge of your ways." They are at little pains with 
    their Bibles, and far less with their hearts and lives, to make them 
    agreeable to the light of the word. Do not resist and rebel against the 
    light, Job 24:13, "They are of those who rebel against the light; they know 
    not the way thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof." Let not your lusts 
    carry you over the belly of what light you have, lest you be judicially 
    blinded. What light God offers you by his word, by providences, or by inward 
    motions and convictions within your breasts, beware of fighting against it, 
    beware of resisting and putting it out. Sometimes the Spirit of the Lord 
    begins to throw in beams of light into the soul, at a sermon, under a rod, 
    or some rebuke of providence. But the sinner cannot be easy until this be 
    again darkened. Be satisfied with no light, which has not a sanctifying and 
    a purifying heat with it. The true light is called the light of life, John 
    8:12. When the Spirit of the Lord fell on the disciples, Acts 2, there 
    appeared tongues of fire, enlightening and warming. Dangerous is the case of 
    men who keep truth a prisoner; Romans 1:18, "For the wrath of God is 
    revealed from Heaven, against all ungodliness of men, who hold the truth in 
    unrighteousness." Lastly, Go to the Lord for the Spirit of illumination. 
    Pray, search for the same as for hidden treasures, and believe for it in the 
    Lord Jesus. Look to him that you may be enlightened with this saving 
    illumination of his word and Spirit. To prevail with you in all these 
    points, I would mention the following MOTIVES—</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 1. This illumination is absolutely necessary for 
    salvation. A sinner will never prize Christ, nor come to him, until his eyes 
    are opened to see his sin and misery, what a just God and a strict law he 
    has to deal with, what a precious and suitable Savior Christ is; John 4:10, 
    "Jesus answered, and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it 
    is that says unto you, give me to drink, you would have asked of him, and he 
    would have given you living water." While Satan keeps his prisoner bound, he 
    will hold him fast. That which the eye sees not, the heart receives not. The 
    danger may be very great, but when unknown the sinner is secure.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 2. Blindness under the gospel is most inexcusable; 
    John 9:41, "Jesus said unto them, If you were blind, you should have no sin; 
    but now you say we see; therefore your sin remains." It is willful 
    blindness. Those who live in the dark corners of the earth, where the light 
    of the gospel is not known, what wonder is it that they walk on in darkness? 
    But the light of the gospel shines about us. Christ offers to enlighten us 
    by his Spirit, Ephesians 5:14. If we choose darkness rather than light, we 
    must lay our account with our choice being our ruin, John 3:19.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 3. Saving illumination is the only way to true 
    comfort, and the want of it the way to utter misery; Colossians 1:12, 13, 
    "Giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of 
    the inheritance of the saints in light, who has delivered us from the power 
    of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son." At the 
    binding of the soul, Satan completes the security of the prisoner; and at 
    the enlightening of him, Christ begins his deliverance. In them who are 
    saved, the light is carried on to the light of glory. In them who are lost, 
    the darkness is continued, until they come to endless and utter darkness. We 
    are now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show, that Christ offers to the prisoners a 
    loosing of those bands with which they are bound.</p>
<p align="justify">Here it will be necessary to show,—1. How he looses God's 
    bands from off the prisoners. And, 2. How he takes off the devil's bands 
    from them. Let us then,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Show how he looses God's bands from off the prisoners. 
    The unconverted sinner is God's prisoner under the bands of guilt, and of 
    the curse of the law, which bind him over to destruction. These he looses 
    and takes off the sinner by the application of his own blood; Zechariah 
    9:11, "As for you also, by the blood of your covenant, I have sent forth 
    your prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water."</p>
<p align="justify">Here we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That Jesus purchased their freedom from these bands 
    by his death and sufferings. Guilt is a strong tie, the curse is a heavy 
    chain on the prisoner; in these the power of spiritual death lay. But Jesus, 
    by his death, procured the sinner's relaxation; Galatians 3:13, "Christ has 
    redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us." His 
    compassion for the prisoners made him pay for them a ransom of his own 
    blood. He took their bands of guilt and the curse upon himself, that he 
    might loose them from off them. Now he has ransomed the prisoners, who will 
    accept of his delivery, and has a right to loose them from their bands; 
    justice and the law having nothing to object. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That Jesus comes in the gospel to the prison door, 
    proclaims and makes offer of liberty to the prisoners. This he does in the 
    text. In his name the offer is made by his messengers; his authority to 
    loose the prisoners is asserted, Matthew 28:18, "Jesus came and said unto 
    them, All power is given unto me in Heaven and in earth." His ability and 
    willingness to do it is confirmed, Hebrews 7:25, "Wherefore he is able to 
    save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives 
    to make intercession for them." They are pressed to consent to the offer; 
    charged upon their peril to comply with it; and all this to make them 
    willing to come away out of the prison with the deliverer. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That though the most part give a deaf ear to the 
    gospel-call, will not believe their danger, but sit at ease in their 
    fetters, yet some are made a willing people in a day of power; Psalm 110:3. 
    By the word, faith is wrought in their hearts; Romans 10:17; even that faith 
    whereby the soul lays hold upon, and unites with Christ, flees in under the 
    covert of his blood, lays over the weight of all its guilt upon Jesus, 
    believing his blood to be sufficient to take it all away, and, renouncing 
    all other pleas, betakes itself to this; Romans 3:25, "Whom God has set 
    forth to be a atoning sacrifice through faith in his blood, to declare his 
    righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the 
    forbearance of God." Thus this blood is applied. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) That when this blood is thus applied, the chains are 
    ordered to be taken off the prisoner; Job 33:24, "Deliver him from going 
    down to the pit, I have found a ransom." Yes, the chains fall off of course, 
    since, as in Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them 
    that are in Christ Jesus." The Cautioner's payment is pled for the debtor, 
    and he is discharged; the criminal's cause is carried by the Surety and 
    Advocate, and he is absolved. He is under the covert of blood, therefore 
    neither law nor justice can reach him. He is brought into the bond of the 
    covenant of grace, and so the guilt of eternal wrath, which is the bond of 
    the first covenant, can hold him no longer; guilt and the curse being 
    removed, judicial hardness has no place.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let us show how Christ looses and takes off the 
    devil's bands from the prisoners. The unconverted sinner is also the devil's 
    prisoner; he likewise lays bands on the sinner. These are in themselves 
    sinful lusts and practices, etc. by which he holds them as by bands. Christ 
    looses from these by the powerful workings of his Spirit, giving them grace, 
    which breaks their bands asunder. He gives them,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Awakening grace, which rouses them up, and bursts 
    the bands of sloth, with which they were held, Ephesians 5:14, (quoted 
    above), and cures them of the fatal delusion which they were under as to 
    their state. Like the prodigal, they come to themselves, Luke 15:17. The 
    sinner sleeps securely in his sins and in his chains; but the Spirit of God 
    gives him a sound awakening, so that his rest in sin is disturbed, and he 
    can no longer get lived at ease in his former courses. His conscience sets 
    upon him, and sounds a terrible alarm of wrath in his ears, which ceases not 
    until he has fled to Christ for refuge, and he flees without delay. Jesus 
    gives them,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Enlightening grace, Ephesians 5:14, by which the 
    sinner gets a discovery of himself, and a discovery of God and Christ. He is 
    brought, as it were, into a new world, in which every thing appears in other 
    colors than it did before. The mask which Satan put upon the ways of God and 
    the ways of sin, is pulled off, and he sees the beauty, and the excellence 
    of religion. Thus the band of prejudice is broken, the evil and danger of 
    the ways of sin are exposed to them, so that the sinful company he before 
    delighted in becomes a terror to him, and he says, "Depart from me, all you 
    workers of iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping," Psalm 
    6:8. He sees the vanity and emptiness of all time's things, so that Satan 
    can hold him no longer by this pitiful handle. Jesus gives them,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Quickening and regenerating grace, by which they 
    receive a new principle of spiritual life; 2 Peter 1:4, "Whereby are given 
    unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be 
    made partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is 
    in the world through lust." So that the bands of death in which they were 
    held give way, and they become new creatures; 2 Corinthians 5:17, 
    "Therefore, if any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature; old things 
    are passed away, behold all things are become new." They are endowed with a 
    new nature, having new motions and inclinations heaven-ward; so that the 
    band of earthly-mindedness is broken; their will is renewed; Christ becomes 
    their choice above all, and they lay hold upon him with heart and good will, 
    so as that the bands of unbelief give way; their hearts are softened; they 
    get the heart of stone removed, and a heart of flesh given unto them; their 
    affections are changed, so that they now love the things which they before 
    hated, and now hate those lusts and sinful courses which they formerly 
    loved. Jesus gives them,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Sanctifying grace, by which the power of sin is more 
    and more weakened in them, and the divers lusts with which they were held 
    are mortified, so that lusts cannot command them as they were accustomed to 
    do. Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but 
    under grace. The new principle stirs in them to the practice of holiness in 
    all manner of life and conversation. Thus Christ, entering into the soul, 
    strikes off the devil's bands, and sets the sinner at liberty.</p>
<p align="justify">As an improvement of this part of our subject, it may 
    just be observed,</p>
<p align="justify">That this lets us see that none are so fast bound under 
    guilt, or the power of sin and Satan, but they may be loosed. And therefore 
    we have ground of hope in the most hopeless case. A sight of guilt is ready 
    to make the awakened sinner despond; but the blood of Christ is sufficient 
    to remove it, whatever it be; "This blood cleanses from all sin," 1 John 
    1:7. Though the cords of guilt be manifold, which cannot be loosed from off 
    the conscience by floods of tears, the most bitter mournings; yes, though 
    above the power of men and angels; yet the blood of Christ is of infinite 
    value and efficacy; Isaiah 1:18, "Come now and let us reason together, says 
    the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; 
    though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." In like manner as 
    to the power of sin. The awakened sinner shall see that it is as easy for 
    the leopard to change his spots, and the Ethiopian his color, as for him to 
    change his heart, or free himself from the power of sin. He will see that it 
    is hard to get out from under the power of Satan and his own lusts. But 
    remember, Christ is the stronger man, he can bind Satan and spoil him of his 
    goods. There is nothing too hard for him to do. Grace is powerful, and will 
    always be victorious where it once begins; it converted Paul from a 
    persecutor into a preacher; Manasseh, who was like a lion, was changed into 
    a lamb. Therefore look to him that you may be loosed.</p>
<p align="justify">We proceed now, with the:</p>
<p align="justify">III. General head, to show that Christ offers to the 
    prisoners, in a natural state, an opening of their prisons, and to bring 
    them out.</p>
<p align="justify">Here I shall show what is in this offer, 1. More 
    generally; and then, 2. More particularly.</p>
<p align="justify">1. More generally, it is the bringing the sinner into a 
    state of grace. There are two things in it. The Lord Jesus opening the 
    sinner's prison brings him,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Out of the state of condemnation, in which he lay 
    from his birth until that happy hour; Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no 
    condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." The sentence of the law 
    condemning him to eternal death is annulled, is taken off, and can affect 
    him no more. He is made a free man, delivered from the curse by him who was 
    made a curse. He is brought out from under the law as a covenant of works: 
    Romans 6:14, "You are not under the law, but under grace." Though it 
    continues to be a rule to him, yet he is neither left to seek life by his 
    obedience to it, nor can he any more be doomed by it to eternal death for 
    his disobedience; the law being dead to him, and he to it, in this respect. 
    Jesus brings him,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Out of that state of sin in which he lay all his 
    days before, incapable of doing anything truly good, capable of nothing but 
    sinning. But now the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made him 
    free from the law of sin and death, Romans 8:2. The prisoner in his natural 
    state, with the rest of the world, lies in wickedness, 1 John 5:19; like a 
    dead man in his grave, rotting and consuming. Christ quickens the sinners, 
    opens their graves, and brings them out from under the reigning power of 
    sin. In the day of conversion, Christ comes to the prison door as to the 
    grave of Lazarus, and says, as he did to him, Come forth. So the dead man 
    lives, the prisoner comes out of the dungeon, out of a state of sin into a 
    state of grace.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let us consider what is in this offer more 
    particularly. There are several great benefits which it proposes to us; such 
    as,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The prisoner's debts are discharged, even to the 
    last farthing; Colossians 2:13, "And you being dead in your sins, and in the 
    uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having 
    forgiven you all trespasses." They were God's prisoners, and could never 
    come out without payment of that debt for which they were imprisoned. But 
    the Deliverer takes all the debt on himself; he says to his father, as in 
    Philem. 18, "If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on mine 
    account." And so it is accounted as if they had paid it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The prisoner's crimes are forgiven, which otherwise 
    would have taken away his life; Isaiah 33:24, "And the inhabitant shall not 
    say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their 
    iniquity." The prisoner's pardon is written in the blood of his Redeemer, 
    "This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." Hebrews 
    8:12, "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and 
    their iniquities will I remember no more." The King's seal is appended to 
    it, so that neither law nor justice can quarrel it; Ephesians 1:13, "In whom 
    also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of 
    promise." This is the white stone given to him that overcomes, of which none 
    knows the sweetness but those who have it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The prisoner is delivered from the power of Satan, 
    Acts 26:18, they are turned from the power of Satan unto God." The jailor 
    has no more power to keep the prisoner, nay, nor ever to bring him back; 
    because he is not delivered by fraud, but in a legal way, by the sovereign 
    authority of the King's Son, who has all power in Heaven and earth. The 
    demands which law and justice had on the prisoner have all been satisfied by 
    the deliverer, therefore he can be no longer held. As to the prisoner,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) His prison-garments are taken away, and he is 
    clothed with change of clothing. The rags of his own righteousness are 
    thrown away, and he is clothed with the fair white clothing of Christ's 
    righteousness put on by the hand of faith, "I counsel you," says Jesus, as 
    in Revelation 3:18, "to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be 
    rich, and white clothing that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your 
    nakedness do not appear." The old man, with his deeds is put off, the body 
    of sin is destroyed, and the new man is put on. The prisoner stands before 
    his deliverer, like Joshua before the angel; Zechariah 3:3, 4, "Now Joshua 
    was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel; and he 
    answered and spoke to them that stood before him, Take away the filthy 
    garments from him; and unto him he said, Behold I have caused your iniquity 
    to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of clothing."</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) The prisoner is brought forth into the light of 
    God's countenance, Isaiah 49:9, "That you may say to the prisoners, Go 
    forth; to them that are in darkness, show yourselves. They shall feed in the 
    ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places." God is in Christ 
    reconciled to him. He is no more his enemy, but the sinner's friend, his 
    confederate in the covenant of peace. The peace is made up through the great 
    Peace-maker, Romans 5:1, "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God 
    through our Lord Jesus Christ." Though the world henceforth may hate him, 
    and become his enemy, he has friendship with Heaven, which may support him 
    under all their hatred.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) The prisoner is restored to all his forfeited 
    privileges; Ephesians 2:17, "Now therefore you are no more strangers and 
    foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of 
    God." As Joseph, being a slave, was brought out of the dungeon to Pharaoh's 
    court, and made the ruler over Egypt; so in that day in which the soul is 
    brought to the state of grace, he is freed from his slavery, brought out of 
    prison, and advanced in the court of Heaven. Like the poor and wise child 
    out of prison, he comes to reign, as in Ecclesiastes 4:13, 14, for they are 
    all made kings who are delivered by Christ. We shall shut up this subject 
    with a practical improvement of the whole.—And this,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In a use of instruction.</p>
<p align="justify">This subject affords some lessons to us all; as,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To be living in a state of sin is the most miserable 
    life in the world, the most miserable life out of Hell. Why are all those 
    similitudes used, of a captivity, an imprisonment, and this of the worst 
    kind, but because no captivity, no imprisonment is sufficient to express the 
    misery of this captivity? Therefore these similitudes are multiplied, that 
    what is wanting in one may be made up by another. And whenever the sinner's 
    eyes are opened to see his misery, he will see that the worst case of 
    captives and prisoners on earth comes infinitely short of the miserable 
    state he is in, so soon as eternity succeeds time. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Of all persons in the world, an unconverted person 
    has the least ground to be joyful: John 3:36, "And he who believes not the 
    Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him." Some think 
    they are young and in their bloom, and therefore they may be allowed a 
    pleasant jovial life. Some think like him who said to his soul, "Soul, you 
    have goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be 
    merry." Every one who is not held down with worldly cares or crosses, is 
    ready to take his ease, though a stranger to Christ and a state of grace. 
    But I would say to you as Jehu did to Joram, 2 Kings 9:18, "What have you to 
    do with peace?" Let them live joyfully, whose prison doors have been opened; 
    they are set free, to whom God is a friend, and who are beyond the hazard of 
    eternal condemnation. But what reason have you to live joyfully, who are 
    captives, prisoners, condemned criminals, and know not but this day you may 
    be led out to the execution? If there were a drawn sword hanging over your 
    heads wherever you went, would it not mar your mirth and jollity? The sword 
    of God's justice is thus suspended over all those who are out of Christ!</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It would be impossible for one to live at ease in an 
    unconverted state, if they were not blind to their own hazard and misery; 
    Luke 19:41–43. You may as well bid a malefactor be easy under the sentence 
    of death, and the sight of the gibbet, or a man hanging over a deep gulf by 
    a slender twig, as to bid an awakened sinner be easy in his case, before he 
    get out of it. But many are posting to destruction down the hill, and yet 
    are very easy, because they see not the frightful case they are in. And why 
    do they not see it, but because they shut their eyes? It is told them, but 
    they will not believe it; so after all they are as easy as if they had been 
    hearing an idle tale. We are instructed,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the delivery of the sinner out of the state of 
    nature into a state of grace, from under the guilt and reigning power of 
    sin, is no easy business, but business of the greatest weight and 
    difficulty, which ever the world was witness to. Consider the ransom which 
    had to be paid for the captives and prisoners; the greatest ransom ever 
    given by men is not once to be named with it. Silver and gold crowns and 
    kingdoms, would not do here, but blood, even the precious blood of Christ, 1 
    Peter 1:18, 19; angels nor men could not furnish it. Consider the power by 
    which the deliverance is to be effected, no less than an infinite power can 
    do it. What is the storming of towns, the breaking down of iron gates, and 
    the recovering the prey from a lion, to the recovering a sinner from the 
    power of the devil? No less than an omnipotent power can do this, Isaiah 
    49:24, 25. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) What way can men think ever to be delivered in that 
    careless thoughtless way with which most part satisfy themselves? Luke 
    13:24, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many, I say unto you, 
    will seek to enter in, and shall not be able." Will drowsy wishes and 
    sluggish desires, unaccompanied with suitable endeavors, do it? Will the 
    leading of a careless life, and then begging mercy from God when they come 
    to die, be sufficient? Will these things serve instead of the work of grace, 
    to pluck the prey out of Satan's month, to knock the devil's chains off the 
    prisoners, and set them free? By no means.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) With what face can sinners delay the work of 
    conversion to God? Is it not work hard enough to get out of Satan's grips, 
    begin as soon as we will? Will men venture to stay until he has loaded them 
    with heavier chains, until stronger fetters of guilt be wreathed about their 
    necks? Up, and be doing, lose no time, you will find the work already hard 
    enough. Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. We are 
    instructed,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That there is no deliverance out of the state of sin 
    and wrath but through Jesus Christ, Acts 4:12, "Neither is there salvation 
    in any other; for there is none other name under Heaven, given among men, 
    whereby we must be saved." Had there been another name, another person, 
    Jesus had not been employed in this work. There was none but he who could do 
    it; and we may add, that the worst of sinners may be delivered in and by 
    him. There is no guilt above the efficacy of his blood, no power of sin 
    above the efficacy of his Spirit. At the same time, without him the most 
    blameless person who lives will be ruined forever; John 14:6, "I am the 
    way," said Jesus, "no man comes unto the Father but by me." Death will prey 
    upon them in time, though insensibly, and devour them forever, to their 
    everlasting misery. This subject instructs us,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That none are delivered by Christ, but those who 
    are made willing to come away with the deliverer out of their sins, and who, 
    with the most solemn seriousness, embrace the covenant. He does not say that 
    he will break open the prison-doors, and bring away the prisoners, sleeping 
    or waking, willing or unwilling, careless or careful to be away. No; he 
    deals with them in a rational way, proclaims the liberty; if they accept of 
    it as he offers it, well and good; if they will not have it but on terms of 
    their own making, they must remain in prison, and perish; John 5:40, "And 
    you will not come unto me, that you might have life." Then,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) If any be careless as to their getting out of this 
    state, Satan is in no danger of losing them. Though the liberty be 
    proclaimed, they trouble not themselves about the matter, further than to 
    hear it. Satan keeps his prisoners, and Christ will never bring them away 
    who are not made desirous to come. Having the offer of liberty, Jesus will 
    leave the soul still in bonds, if there be not a compliance with it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It concerns all who would be saved, deliberately to 
    consider the gospel-offer and their own case, and make the most solemn, 
    serious work of closing with Christ, of entering into the covenant, and 
    transacting with the Deliverer, as upon a matter of the utmost importance. 
    Here eternity lies at stake; if they manage it to purpose, they are happy 
    forever; if they mismanage it, they are undone. If the prisoner manages his 
    business right with this Deliverer, he will be got out of prison; if he 
    altogether miss this opportunity, he must lie still there for ever.</p>
<p align="justify">This subject instructs particularly those who are under 
    bonds of which they would gladly be rid, what course they are to take.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those who have sometimes walked at liberty, having had 
    their souls brought out of prison by the Redeemer's blood and Spirit; but 
    seem to themselves now to be carried back into Satan's prison again, and 
    feel his chains heavy upon them. The Lord sometimes suffers his own people 
    to fall into this case, because of their careless walking, their grieving 
    and vexing his Holy Spirit, whereby the Spirit is quenched, corruption is 
    strengthened, and Satan gets advantage; Isaiah 57:17, "For the iniquity of 
    his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hidden me, and was wroth, and 
    he went on frowardly in the way of his heart." What should they do in this 
    case, but own the justice of the stroke, apply themselves to the Deliverer, 
    who alone can loose spiritual bonds? This is the design of the dispensation; 
    Hosea 5:15, "I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their 
    offence, and seek my face; in their affliction they will seek me early." 
    Make new application of this blood by faith, and breathe after the 
    communications of his Holy Spirit; Isaiah 57:18, "I have seen his ways, and 
    will heal him; I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and his 
    mourners." He delivered them out of a miserable state, and will also deliver 
    them out of their present uncomfortable condition.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those who feel the bands of guilt strong upon their 
    souls, and are ready to despond under them as bands which can never be 
    loosed. Such should consider, that there is no exception of bands from which 
    Christ is sent to loose; be they weak, be they strong bands, with which the 
    sinner is bound, Christ proclaims liberty from them; and it is an 
    intolerable affront to the Mediator's dignity, to entertain a thought of 
    bands from which the infinite merit of his blood, and the all-powerful 
    efficacy of his Spirit, cannot loose. The dead corpse cast into the 
    prophet's grave was restored to life; and shall not the soul bound with the 
    strongest fetters of death, be set free so soon as quickening virtue comes 
    from a crucified Christ. Such, then, should labor to believe, that they may 
    thus see the glory of God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Those who feel the bands of raging and unruly lusts so 
    strengthened by Satan and their own corruptions, that they are ready to 
    think that there is no breaking of them. Such should consider, that our Lord 
    often singles out those in the most hopeless condition, to make them 
    monuments of his rich grace. Such was the case of the Corinthians, 1. 
    Corinthians 6:9, 10, 11. In the text, those who are blinded in the prison 
    have opening proclaimed to them. Though the heart may be agitated like a 
    raging sea with temptations and corruptions, it will cost Jesus but a word 
    to still them all in a moment; Isaiah 57:19, "I create the fruit of the 
    lips; peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, says 
    the Lord, and I will heal him." The strongest lusts shall yield to the power 
    of his grace, and the strong man flee at the rebuke of the stronger. We 
    shall only add,</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, A use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">You who are delivered, and have been made partakers of 
    the liberty proclaimed in the gospel, we exhort you to walk suitably to the 
    great deliverance. If you be thus distinguished, you will prize the 
    Deliverer above all; 1. Peter 2:7, "Unto you, therefore, which believe, he 
    is precious." You will say, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is 
    none in all the earth that I desire beside you." And the more you look back 
    on the hazard to which you were exposed, you will love him the more. You 
    will prize the deliverance above all which you ever met with, or can meet 
    with in this world; "Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss, for the 
    excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord." Look on this time as 
    the time of love. You will long for the perfecting of this deliverance, and 
    be endeavoring to get it advanced and carried on, until you be completely 
    freed from indwelling sin; Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall 
    deliver me from the body of this death?" If thus distinguished, it is your 
    duty to walk humbly and thankfully, to the praise of your Deliverer; to 
    carry yourselves as children of light, in a holy and heavenly conversation, 
    and to have no fellowship with the works of darkness. In short, it is your 
    duty to be concerned for those who are still prisoners, to pity them, to 
    pray for them, and help forward their deliverance.</p>
<p align="justify">As to you who are yet Satan's captives and prisoners, 
    hasten to be loosed; while the proclamation of liberty sounds in your ears, 
    accept of deliverance. Consider that now is the accepted time, now is the 
    day of salvation. Now liberty is in your offer, but it will not always be 
    so; the day comes for transporting the prisoners into another prison, where 
    there are no offers nor possibility of escape; and how soon this may be, you 
    know not. Refuse the liberty today, delay it but until tomorrow, and you may 
    be beyond hope. But now the captives may be loosed, the prisoners enlarged, 
    and thus be blessed with an eternal freedom, Kiss, therefore, the Son, lest 
    he be angry, and you perish from the way; when his wrath is kindled but a 
    little, blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
