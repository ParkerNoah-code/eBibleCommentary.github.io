          1 Samuel 7:12 "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and
          Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto has the
          Lord helped us."

          IF we look back to the former chapter, we find Israel brought to a
          very low state. By the sword of the Philistines, chapter 4:10, thirty
          thousand footmen were slain; and by the sword of the Lord, chapter
          6:19, "Fifty thousand and threescore and ten men were smitten." After
          this the ark was brought to Kirjath jearim, a city of the Levites in
          the tribe of Judah. There it remained until David brought it up, 2
          Samuel 6 Psalm 132. Only it was twenty years there, before the
          children of Israel lamented after the Lord, chapter 7:2. Now Israel
          was in a great strait; the Philistines were strong and could not be
          resisted; God angry and would not be entreated; they lamented after
          him but found him not. In this sad case Samuel advises them to deep
          humiliation and a complete reformation, verses 3–5. They fall in with
          his advice in some measure, verses 4–6. They gather for humiliation
          and fasting in Mizpah, a city on the borders of Benjamin and Judah,
          lying in the heart of the country, and so proper for such a meeting.
          The Philistines are alarmed at this, looking upon it as a rendezvous
          of rebellion, and so bring an army against Israel. It is well they
          were found at their duty, which was a good pledge of the Lord's help.
          While Samuel is sacrificing and praying, the Philistines draw near to
          battle, and God himself takes the cause in hand, thunders against the
          enemy, so that Israel had nothing more to do but to pursue, verse 10,
          11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The text gives us an account of the setting up of a monument of this
          great victory and glorious deliverance. The monument itself is a stone
          set up. A stone is a most durable substance, and very proper to
          perpetuate the memory of this glorious victory. The person who set it
          up was Samuel, that is, it was set up by his order and direction. He
          was their Prophet and their Judge. By his means especially was the
          victory procured; and he is careful to set up this monument of
          thankfulness. The place where it was set up was between Mizpah and
          Shen, a rock over against Mizpah. It is set up there where they got
          the deliverance and near to the place where they prayed for it. We
          have also the name which was put upon the monument, Ebenezer. We read
          of it before, chapter 4:1. The place is called in the history,
          Ebenezer, by way of anticipation. In that very place they got a sore
          disaster before, but now a signal deliverance. Ebenezer, that is, the
          stone of help, including a respect to God, and bearing not only a
          remembrance of the victory, but that it was obtained not by them but
          by the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have the reason of the name. Hitherto has the Lord helped us. It is
          a grateful ackowledgment of the Lord's help for the time past, to
          raise their confidence in him for the time to come. He has helped us,
          and shown himself on our side; not only helped us to bear our burdens,
          but he has taken them off our shoulders and wrought for us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE—It is the duty of the Lord's people to keep the memorial of
          the experience which they have of the Lord's helping them. I shall
          discuss this point under two general heads.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall speak of the Lord's helping his people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I will speak to the keeping up of the memorial of the experiences
          which they had of his helping them. I am then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To speak of the Lord's helping his people. Here I shall answer two
          questions. 1. How does the Lord help his people; and, 2. Why does he
          help his people?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, How does the Lord help his people? Here I reply,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sometimes the Lord helps his people, by working all for them, they
          themselves contributing nothing to their deliverance. Moses said unto
          the people, "Fear you not, stand still, and see the salvation of the
          Lord, which he will show you today; for the Egyptians whom you have
          seen today, you shall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall
          fight for you, and you shall hold your peace." Many times the children
          of God may be brought to that, that they can do nothing for
          themselves, but commit their cause to God, and depend upon him, but
          even then their case is not despair. "Commit your way unto the Lord;
          trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass," Psalm 142:4–7. Your
          Lord can do all things, said Luther to a person solicitous about a
          future event.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sometimes the Lord assists his people in working. They endeavor
          their own deliverance in God's way, and he fits them to act, and
          blesses their exertions crowning them with success. Like Paul, "they
          labor, yet not they, but the grace of God who is with them." In this
          God's help is to be acknowledged, for all depends on him. "For except
          the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it." We must
          be at our work, and look to God for his assistance. Pray and labor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Sometimes God helps his people by appointing means. Thus in the
          case of Hezekiah, Isaiah said, "Let them take a lump of figs, and lay
          it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover." When God
          intends to help his people and to make use of means and instruments
          for it, he can easily bring them about and raise them up. Sometimes no
          way appears for their help, but the Lord brings them about
          unexpectedly, so that "when the Lord turned again the captivity of
          Zion, we were like them that dream." If he intends to have his people
          brought out of Babylon, he raises up Cyrus for that purpose. If Elijah
          must be fed in his hiding place, the ravens shall be employed rather
          than he suffer want. And often their help comes by such unexpected
          means that they must say as Jacob did of his son's venison. "How is it
          that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, because the
          Lord your God brought it unto me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Sometimes without means. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my
          spirit, says the Lord of Hosts. God is not bound to means, as he can
          work without them. A word from the Lord will bring about his people's
          help. He can speak peace to them, and so create it. And often when he
          has tried his people's patience, by frustrating of means, he will
          bring about their help without them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Sometimes by contrary means, as our Lord cured the blind man by
          laying clay upon his eyes. God does not only bring light after, but
          out of darkness. The troubling of the waters of Bethesda made them
          healing waters; and the whale that swallowed up Jonah was the ship in
          which he came ashore. Christ's going away filled the disciples' hearts
          with sorrow. "Nevertheless," said he, "I tell you the truth, it is
          expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the comforter
          will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."
          The promise guides the ship of providence, and will make a cross wind
          drive them to the harbor. "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out
          of the strong came forth sweetness. For all things shall work together
          for good to them that love God, and are the called according to his
          purpose."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Let us inquire why the Lord helps his people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because they are in covenant with him. There is a league offensive
          and defensive between Christ and his people. They have common friends,
          and common enemies. Hence all the attributes of God are engaged for
          them, and their help. The promise is made; He shall call upon me, and
          I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him
          and honor him. Thus the power of God is made the ground of Abraham's
          comfort by virtue of the covenant, Genesis 17:1, 2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because of their special relation to him. Christ is the believer's
          head. Hence if the foot be hurt, the head in Heaven cries out, Acts
          9:4. He who is their maker, is their husband, their father, and elder
          brother; in a word they are one with him, one spirit. This is the
          ground of sympathy between Christ and his people, and secures their
          help. "For he who touches them touches the apple of his eye."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because they look to him and trust in him for their help. The 91st
          psalm has in it a great many blessed promises, but see to whom they
          belong. "The Lord is a buckler to all those that trust in him." The
          Lord gives this for the reason why he would help and deliver
          Ebed-melech the Ethiopian; "because you have put your trust in me,
          says the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It lies upon the honor of God to help those who trust in him. Trust on
          a sincere man will engage him to answer the trust put in him; and God
          will see to those that trust in him, that they shall not be ashamed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because the Lord brings his people into straits for this very end,
          that he may have the glory of helping them; and they may get the
          greater experience of his kindness. A good friend is best known in
          adversity: and the Lord will let his people's case grow darker until
          it be near past hope, and then he will arise. "For the Lord shall
          judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees
          that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left." For the
          lower they are, the greater is the glory of God in delivering them.
          "For great is your mercy toward me, says David, and you have delivered
          my soul from the lowest Hell." And none have such rich experience of
          the Lord's goodness as they that are most in straits, Hosea 2:14. We
          now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To speak of the keeping up of the memorial of the experiences
          which they have had of the Lord's helping them. Here three things
          demand our attention. First, What it is to keep up this memorial.
          Secondly, What of these experiences of the Lord's helping should be
          recorded and kept in memory. And, Thirdly, why should we keep up such
          a memorial.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, What it is to keep up the memorial of the Lord's helping us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It implies an observing of the dispensations we meet with, for our
          help in the course of our life. If the thing itself be not observed,
          we cannot keep up the memorial of it. "Who is wise and will observe
          these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the
          Lord." Many times the Lord helps, when we are sleeping and do not
          observe it. And this makes us like the unjust steward in recounting
          our mercies, setting down fifty for a hundred.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A discerning of the Lord's hand in the help we receive. Alas! men
          are ready to sacrifice to their own net, and burn incense to their
          drag: it requires wisdom to see the hand of the Lord in the good
          things we meet with. "For she did not know, says the Lord, that I gave
          her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which
          they prepared for Baal."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Laying up these experiences and recording them, if not in a book
          yet in a faithful memory. "And all they that heard them, (the things
          said of John Baptist at his birth) laid them up in their hearts,
          saying, what manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord
          was with him." Many instead of laying such things up, lay them down in
          the grave of forgetfulness, and instead of setting up a stone, lay a
          stone upon them, burying them out of sight. They forget that God
          remembered them in their low estate. "My people," says God, "have
          forgotten me, days without number." But if these experiences were
          carefully laid up, the former part of our life would help the latter,
          and the longer we live the richer we would grow. As in wars former
          success encourages to future exertions, so is it with the Christian
          warfare. "Your servant," said David, "slew both the lion and the bear;
          and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
          has defied the armies of the living God." Let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Inquire what of these experiences of the Lord's helping
          should be recorded and kept in memory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We should record the timing or seasonableness of them. There is
          often a weight lies on this very circumstance; that the help came at
          such a time and not another is worthy to be remembered. Many instances
          of this kind occur in scripture, Genesis 25:4–5; Judges 7:13. The
          church remembers the time of her deliverance, Psalm 126:1. The Lord's
          help comes always seasonably, though not at our time, yet at his time
          which is the best. This will let us see the frame of spirit in which
          the help did overtake us, sometimes when we were looking for it,
          sometimes when we were not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The effects of them on our spirits. How we are affected with them
          when they come. "Then," says the church, "was our mouth filled with
          laughter and our tongue with singing." Many times the Lord helps his
          people in such a manner that the experience of his goodness fills them
          with shame, looks their doubts and fears out of countenance, proves
          their unbelief to be a false prophet, and makes them resolve never to
          distrust God again and fills them with thankfulness. Isaiah 38:10, 12;
          Psalm 73:22, 23; and 116:11, 12. O how useful would this be afterwards
          to the Christian.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Their harmony and agreement with the promise. If help come not by
          virtue of a promise, little use can be made of it this way, and for
          want of recording this, many of the Lord's people do often question
          their experiences. Experiences are the bread which the saints have to
          feed upon in their mournful hours; but the promise is the staff and
          stay of this bread without which there will be no nourishment in it.
          Now as face answers to face in a glass, so God's works answer his
          words. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of
          Hosts. Thus David records his experience, saying, "You have dealt well
          with your servant, O Lord, according to your word. The promises in the
          Bible are all written over in the experiences of the saints. "There
          failed not ought, said Joshua, of any good thing which the Lord had
          spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Their agreement with their prayers. Genesis 24:45. What are the
          Christian's experiences but returns of prayers. Such was that in the
          text. This seems to be the ground of that conclusion; "By this I know
          that you favor me, because mine enemy does not triumph over me." It is
          of great importance to notice this, for a mercy that is an answer of
          prayer is a double mercy; and mercies are certainly obtained by
          prayer, are enjoyed with thankfulness, as in the text. Only there is
          need of wisdom here, for sometimes God answers prayer not with the
          blessing itself that was desired but with as good: as instead of
          removing Paul's thorn in the flesh, he said to him, "my grace is
          sufficient for you:" and sometimes experiences of the Lord's helping
          us with our expression in prayer, though not with the pressure of our
          own spirits, Romans 8:26, 27.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Even the very place of our experiences should be recorded. The
          stone was set up where the victory was obtained. There are some golden
          spots on earth, where the Lord has entertained his people, whereof the
          very remembrance has been refreshful to them afterwards. "I will
          remember you," says David, "from the land of Jordan and of the
          Hermonites, from the hill Mizar;" Genesis 28:11–19. And the Lord loves
          to have his people remember these blessed places, Genesis 31:13; and
          35:1. Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, Inquire why we should keep up the memorial of these things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We owe this to God: In point, of obedience, when we meet with
          experiences of his goodness he calls us to set up our Ebenezer. "We
          are to remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and
          the judgments of his month." It is very grieving to the Spirit of God
          to let these things slip; and God complains of his people for it,
          Jeremiah 2:31, 32. We owe it to him in point of gratitude;
          acknowledgment, and the remembrance of the benefit, is the tribute we
          owe to God for his goodness. They called the stone Ebenezer; thereby
          to make acknowledgment that it was not they that got the victory, but
          God for them. O monstrous ingratitude to forget experiences.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We owe it to him also, in point of compliance with his design in
          giving experience of his help to his people. God intends his people
          more comfort by a mercy, than the mercy itself singly considered. He
          intends it as a ground to hope for more. He gives the valley of Achor
          for a door of hope. But how can they comply with this design unless
          they remember them. "You broke, says Asaph, the head of the leviathan
          in pieces, and gave him to be meat to the people inhabiting the
          wilderness." The heads of the leviathan are the princes of Pharaoh.
          God in that help which he gave to his people at the Red Sea, would
          have them not only feast themselves on it for the present, but
          carefully lay it up in their memories, that their faith might not want
          support in the wilderness.

          2. We owe this to ourselves in point of interest. If we would consult
          our own advantage, we would not let them slip. For for-former
          experiences of the Lord's help are very supporting to the soul in a
          dark night. Sometimes a Christian's spiritual rest is broken, then it
          is useful to read the records of his experiences. Sometimes a little
          writing is found in a man's study that saves his estate and keeps him
          out of prison. In such times "we should remember the years of the
          right hand of the most high." This may revive our hopes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These experiences are pledges of further mercies. Some promises have
          their day of payment here, others after this life. The performing of
          the former, is an earnest given to faith to look for the other. "You
          shall guide me with your counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory."
          Every mercy a child of God receives, may be called Joseph, for the
          Lord shall add another to it. It is not so with others, and the two
          reasons shall be found in these words: "O continue your
          loving-kindness to them that know you, and your righteousness to the
          upright in heart." The mercies bestowed on the Lord's people flow from
          solid love, and love knows not an enemy. The son abides in the house,
          the servant goes away at the term. The saint's mercies are made over
          to him by promise. It is remarkable, 2 Samuel 5:12, that David gathers
          his establishment in the kingdom, by his prospering to that time. Saul
          too prospered at first, but was not established; the reason was,
          David's establishment was a special promise. The word of promise gives
          not only bread to the eater, but seed to the sower. These experiences
          then, are good arguments in prayer. We find the saints often pleading
          with God upon former experience. "Your vows are upon me, O God: I will
          render praises unto you. For you have delivered my soul from death."
          It is not the way to plead with men, but it is a notable way to plead
          with God, for he is unchangeable, "whom he loves, he loves to the
          end."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We owe this to others. It is a duty to communicate our experiences
          of the Lord's goodness to our fellow Christians. "Come and hear, all
          you that fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul."
          But how can we do this, unless we record them, and keep up the memory
          of them. It must be very encouraging to distressed Christians, to hear
          that others have been plunged in the same or similar depths, and yet
          have been delivered. "For this shall every one that is godly pray unto
          you, in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great
          waters, they shall not come near unto him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. To Christians, whose work it is to look to the Lord for his
          help, being sensible of their own weakness. We say to you,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Record your experiences, keep up the memory of them. It is a soul
          enriching trade to gather experiences. It makes a strong Christian. It
          makes one ready to suffer for Christ, and to venture for him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Improve your experiences for strengthening your faith and hope for
          time to come, in the promises of God. And to help you to this, take
          these notes. The same God that helped you formerly still lives: His
          arm and power are as strong as ever. Doubting of the Lord's
          willingness to help, is a sad leak, but the ship will never sink,
          until faith let go its hold of the power of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Though awful distempers break out in the people of God in time of
          affliction, yet he will still perform his word to them. He will save
          his people notwithstanding, Psalm 116:11, 12. If it were not so, we
          could not have been out of Hell until this time. The Psalmist makes
          this a ground of hope to others. Psalm 31:22–24. If you be a
          Christian, God has delivered you from greater straits than any in
          which you now are. "He has delivered your soul from death." OBJECTION,
          But though God deliver in one, yet he lets a man fall in another
          strait. ANSWER, Even affliction itself, a valley of Achor, may be a
          door of hope, a door by which a great mercy may enter; so was Joseph's
          prison, and Daniel's den. A debt may be paid either with money, or
          something equal in value. If God do not take away the trouble, but
          give strength to bear it; if he remove not sickness, but remove the
          sick saint to Heaven, he is no loser.

          USE 2. A word to all. Go to God for your help in all cases. Let God be
          your helper. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You have many and strong enemies. You are not able to grapple with
          Satan, the world, and the flesh. These will ruin you, if God help you
          not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He is a present help. He is not far off. He is within hearing of
          your cry. Men may perish when help is far away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">3. He is willing.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. He is able to help you in all cases, and at all times. When friends
          can do nothing but close the eyes, and prepare the funeral rites,
          Christ can take your soul to his Father's glory, and present it there
          with exceeding joy. Amen.
