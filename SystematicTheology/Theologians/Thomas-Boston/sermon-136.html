          Ephesians 4:11, 12 "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
          and some evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the
          perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
          edifying of the body of Christ."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE apostle having pressed unity among church members, even from the
          consideration of the diversity of gifts among them, seeing they all
          come from one and the same head; namely, from Christ their common Lord
          and store-house; and having confirmed this from Psalm 68:18, he does
          in the text instance these divers gifts, all bestowed by that one
          blessed head for the very same ends. "And he gave," etc., this is the
          connection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But lest we stumble in the threshold, there is one difficulty to be
          removed, before we enter on a particular explanation of the words.
          This is, in the text there is nothing of gifts, but only of offices
          and office-bearers instituted by Christ in his church. He speaks not
          of gifts necessary for the apostleship, but of apostles; he says not
          of the gift of prophecy, but prophets. To this it is answered, that
          saying the latter, he supposes the former; the diversity of offices
          including the diversity of the respective gifts, seeing Christ never
          calls any to an office, but he always endues them with gifts in some
          measure suitable. He thrust out no laborers to his vineyard, without
          instruments for labor; nor does he send out any naked and unarmed, to
          pull down the kingdom of Satan. Thus the anointing in use of old, did
          signify both the call and furniture for the office.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In these words we have two things—</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A remarkable instance of our exalted Lord's liberty to his church,
          in bestowing divers gifts upon her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. The end for which he has given these.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          As to the first of these, for the right understanding of it, four
          things are to be considered: 1. The gifts. 2. The giver. 3. The act of
          donation. 4. The time to which it relates.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As to the gifts, they are various, and this variety is held forth two
          ways:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By the distributive particle some, often repeated; which seems to
          hold forth two things: 1. A distinction between the church and her
          officers, and teachers, against the confusion introduced by Socinians,
          Anabaptists, and others, who impugn the necessity of a call to the
          work of the ministry, and transgress the sacred boundaries set by the
          Lord of the vineyard; who gave some, not all, to be apostles, pastors,
          and teachers. All may indeed prophecy, as says the apostle, 1
          Corinthians 14:31, that is, all who have the gift of prophecy; but as
          the apostle says, 1 Corinthians 12:29, "Are all apostles, are all
          prophets." 2. A distinction among the offices which Christ has
          instituted; he made not all church officers apostles; but some
          apostles. He has given the several office-bearers in his house their
          distinct provinces; some to be employed one way, some another, though
          all for the good of the church. Even as in the building of a house,
          divers artificers must be employed, every one in their proper work;
          but all for one and the same end, to make a convenient habitation.
          Howbeit, these office-bearers are not co-ordinate but subordinate; and
          the superior office includes the inferior, so as the apostle could do
          what the prophet, evangelist, pastor, or teacher might do; but not
          contrariwise. We acknowledge a beautiful subordination of officers and
          courts, in church government; but among officers of the same kind,
          there is by divine institution a parity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. This variety is held forth by a distinct enumeration of several
          orders of the ministry in the church. We must particularly inquire
          what these are:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. As for apostles. The word in general signifies any messenger sent
          in affairs, whether of the church or commonwealth, John 13:16. Thus
          Epaphroditus, is in Philip. 2:25, called the apostle of the
          Philippians, ìùí äå áðïóôïëïí, or messenger; as being sent by them to
          Paul, to carry their benevolence to him; not as having the name and
          office of an apostle derived to him, as some fondly imagine; which
          absurd conceit the antitheses in the text at first view baffles. "Yet
          I supposed," says Paul, "it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
          brother and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your
          messenger, and he who ministers to my wants." Now this resolved,
          according to that notion, will scarcely make good sense. But the word
          in Scripture is usually taken in a more restrained sense; and denotes
          those extraordinary officers whom Christ set in his church, as master
          builders, who are commonly reckoned twelve; Matthias being added to
          the eleven, in room of Judas, and afterwards Paul was added. These
          were a kind of office-bearers in the church whose commission was
          universal and unconfined; whose great work was to plant and found
          churches through the world, Matthew 28:19; being endued with an
          infallibility in teaching, according to John 16:13. They had power to
          work miracles, and to confer the visible gifts of the Holy Spirit, by
          imposition of their hands, and were eye witnesses of Christ. Hence
          Paul proving his apostleship, urges this, 1 Corinthians 9:1; and
          pleads it for himself with the rest, 1 Corinthians 15:7, 8. That they
          were immediately called, is generally the opinion of orthodox divines,
          from which we see no reason to depart, seeing the evangelists witness
          this of all of them but Matthias and Paul. As for Paul's immediate
          call, it is no less clear from Acts 26:16; Galatians 1:1.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A late writer asserts that Matthias was not immediately called, but by
          the apostles. But it is plain from the history of Matthias' call,
          recorded Acts 1, that he was by God's immediate choice and declaration
          by a lot, set apart for his office; and though the apostles presented
          the two to the Lord, yet he made the choice, and gave the call by that
          lot, after prayer made to him for that effect. A late writer of our
          own, to whose labors our church owes very much, does in this point go
          something out of the ordinary road, asserting it to be most evident
          that God called Matthias mediately, partly by the suffrages of the
          people, partly by their lots; yet withal, he grants that Matthias'
          call was extraordinary in that God directed the lots by an
          extraordinary providence, as in the case of Achan. For ought I know,
          the discovery of Achan has hitherto been looked upon as immediately
          from God, and the text seems to sound it so, Joshua 7:14. And if
          Paul's call was immediate, being by a voice from Heaven, so was
          Matthias' call; God discovering his mind in this case by the lot, as
          much as by a voice in the other. "Wherefore," the apostles in their
          prayer before the lots say, Acts 1:24, "Show whether of these two you
          have chosen." The call and choice then was the Lord's, by himself, not
          by the people; and the lot was an infallible discovery of his mind, as
          it was in that case used. For although God does not guide elections
          performed by lots so as they shall always fall right, when the choice
          is referred to a lot, without a call from the Lord to make use of the
          lot, as in the case of choosing magistrates by lot, which became
          unnecessary is therefore unlawful; yet the apostles having been called
          to the use of lots in this case, and having a promise of the discovery
          of God's mind in this case thereby, this being necessarily
          pre-supposed to their prayer in faith, it plainly follows this lot
          could not but fall right, and consequently that the call thereby was
          God's immediate call, as much as if it had been by a voice from
          Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          After all, that the people there, being only one hundred and twenty,
          should have a power to call a man to be an immediate officer of the
          universal church, by an approved deed, as the apostles were, seems to
          be a principle that can hardly be defended; unless, with a certain set
          of men, it be maintained that the number of the brethren then was no
          more than an hundred and twenty, which with little difficulty might be
          disproved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. There are prophets. The word signifies one that foretells things
          to come. The New Testament prophets spoken of in the text, were those
          who were endued with singular wisdom and knowledge of divine things,
          not by human industry, but by inspiration of the Holy Spirit. They did
          by immediate inspiration interpret the Scriptures, open up the Old
          Testament prophecies, confirming and proving the doctrines of the
          gospel by these. Hence revelation is made the matter of prophecy, 1
          Corinthians 14:6. God did also by his Spirit reveal to them things to
          come, which they foretold for the confirming the faith of the people
          of God, and rendering the wicked inexcusable, Acts 11:27, 28; and
          21:10. The nature of their office shows their call to have been
          immediate. The church of the Jews had prophets raised up to them for a
          long time, but prophecy ceased with them when Malachi died; and their
          church having been thereby planted, nourished, and maintained, its
          failing was a token their church was about to expire. They themselves
          acknowledge that the gift of prophecy was not bestowed under the
          second temple, on any after the days of Malachi, so they reckon it
          among the five things wanting in the second house; but they expected
          the restoration of it under the Messiah, and that warrantably, as Joel
          2:28, 29. Wherefore the setting up of prophets under the New Testament
          is a conclusive argument against them, that the Messiah is come.
          Unless they admit of the New Testament prophets, prophecy has left
          them about double the time that their church, as constituted by Moses,
          had it; which nothing but judicial blindness can make Haggai's little
          while, chapter 2:6, 7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. There are evangelists. Not those who wrote the gospel, for two of
          these were apostles, namely, Matthew and John; but a kind of preachers
          of the gospel, who were companions of the apostles in their travels,
          assisting them in the work of the gospel; being sent out by them to
          settle and water such churches as the apostles had planted, 1
          Corinthians 3:6; 1 Timothy 1:3. They were not fixed pastors of any
          particular church, but remained in these places where the apostles
          sent them, until they were by them recalled, 2 Timothy 4:9. Such were
          Tychicus, Silvanus, and others, and particularly Timothy and Titus,
          whom some will needs have to be bishops, the one at Ephesus, the other
          at Crete, though Timothy is expressly called an evangelist, 2 Timothy
          4:5. Besides the occasional transient employment of Timothy at
          Ephesus, and of Titus in Crete, is sufficiently intimated by the
          apostle, while he tells us, that he besought Timothy to abide at
          Ephesus, and that he left Titus, both of them upon a special business,
          1 Timothy 1:3; Titus 1:5; and they are both recalled in the very
          epistles sent to them. That they are called bishops in the postscripts
          of the epistles sent to them is no argument; these postscripts being
          neither canonical nor true. They were not subjoined to the epistles,
          until some hundreds of years after they were written. In the
          postscript of the first epistle to Timothy, Phrygia is called
          Pacatian, which was not the name of it, until it was conquered by
          Pacatius, a Roman general, three hundred years after Christ. The
          postscript of that to Titus says it was written to Nicopolis, which
          agrees not with Titus, 3:2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. There are pastors, feeders of the flock of God, and the word
          denotes both preaching and ruling. Their office is to pray with, and
          for the flock; to read the Scriptures publicly; to Catechize, bless
          the people, and rule them; all which, and more belonging to their
          office, is asserted by the Westminster Assembly, in the propositions
          concerning church government. These are our ministers of
          congregations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, There are teachers or doctors, whose work it is to teach the
          doctrines of religion, and confute the contrary errors. Though the
          particle some is not here added between the pastors and teachers, yet
          they are distinct church officers. The pastor being gifted with a word
          of wisdom, by which, besides his ability in some measure to open the
          Scripture, he is fitted wisely and powerfully to apply the word for
          working on people's affections, and for advancing practical godliness.
          The teacher being gifted with a word of knowledge for opening up the
          Scripture, establishing truth, and confuting error. This difference
          the apostle holds forth, 1 Corinthians 12:8; Romans 12:7, 8, where the
          difference of their functions is clearly intimated by the different
          concerns which they are to wait upon.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The apostle does not here enumerate all the office-bearers in the
          church. We will find others reckoned up by him elsewhere, and
          therefore silence here as to ruling elders and deacons is no argument
          against their offices; the scope of the apostle here being only to
          enumerate preaching officers, whose various gifts are most conspicuous
          in the edifying of the church; who are appointed for the work of the
          ministry, to bring us to unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
          the Son of God, verses 12–14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But no satisfactory reason can be given for omitting pope or prelate
          here, had they been any of Christ's creatures in his church. When they
          shall show the signs of their apostleship, then, and not until then,
          may we allow them to be the successors of the apostles, in another
          sense than ordinary ministers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The apostles, prophets, and evangelists, were extraordinary officers,
          and their offices ceased with themselves, having been appointed for
          that particular state of the church. Now the house is built up and
          finished; and pastors and teachers, and other ordinary officers, are
          sufficient to hold it up, though they were not so for erecting it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The giver is Christ. The apostle elsewhere ascribes the giving of
          gifts to the Spirit, 1 Corinthians 12:11; and the giving of these
          offices he ascribes to the Father; but this being an external work of
          God, is common to all the three persons. The Father is the fountain of
          all gifts, the Son the distributor of them by the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The act of donation, he gave. It denotes the excellency and
          usefulness of these offices, which Christ has given to supply the want
          of his bodily presence. And withal, his sending out these officers, as
          well ordinary as extraordinary, for both are said to be given by him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. The time to which this relates; "when Christ had ascended up on
          high." OBJECTION. Christ gave the apostles their commission before he
          ascended.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Until Christ ascended, they had not the fullness of apostolic
          gifts necessary for the discharge of their office in its full extent.
          Therefore Jesus, being assembled together with them after his
          resurrection, commanded them that they should not depart from
          Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, says he, you
          have heard of me. Consequently, after Christ's ascension, they were
          solemnly inaugurated and installed in their office, by the visible
          outpouring of the Spirit upon them. "And there appeared unto them
          cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them." They
          had their commission before this; but the actual sending of them
          through the world was not until this time. We are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To attend to the end or design of this gift, which is threefold:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In respect of the saints, these who are in Christ already, the
          ministry is to perfect them, ðñïò ôïí êáôáñôéóìïí. The word signifies
          the restoring and setting dislocated members again in their proper
          place; it is borrowed from surgeons, with whom êáôáñôéóìïò is ìåôáãùãç
          ôùí ïóôåùí åê ôïõ ðñïò öõåéí ôïðïí, åéò ôïí êáôá öõóéí. The reducing
          of bones from a preternatural, to their natural place and situation.
          It signifies also, the perfecting and establishing them in the
          restored state. So the Corinthians, who by their factions and
          divisions were rent asunder, and as a disjointed body, are exhorted to
          be êáôáñôéóìåíïé, perfectly joined together, as a joint well knit, 1
          Corinthians 1:10. The saints being, by reason of remaining corruption,
          so ready to turn aside both from Christ the head, and from their
          brethren fellow-members. God gave ministers to be spiritual surgeons
          to set them right again, and to fix them in nearer union to Christ by
          faith, and to their brethren in love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In regard of themselves, for the work of the ministry. It is for
          work that they are appointed. This work for the kind of it is
          äéáêïíéá, a ministry or service. The first excluding idleness, the
          second excluding a lordly dominion. The word comes from êïíéó dust,
          and denotes a painful and laborious service, in which men are
          serviceable, as those that make haste in travel, raising the dust
          about them by their speed. So that they are neither to be loiterers,
          nor lords over God's heritage; but to serve them in the concerns of
          their souls, by the dispensing of the word publicly and privately, by
          dispensing the sacraments, and the censures of the church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In respect of the body of Christ; it is to edify it, namely, the
          mystical body of Christ. There is a double metaphor here; one taken
          from the natural body to which the church is compared, in respect of
          its union with Christ the head by faith, and that union that is among
          the saints by love; and the vital influences received from Christ by
          the church. The other metaphor is taken from masons, whose work it is
          to build a house. Thus they are to build the body of Christ; and so
          they do, when they are instruments in Christ's hand to lay new stones
          in the building; that is, to convert the elect, and to fix and raise
          up others that are already laid; being instruments of the growth of
          converts in knowledge, faith, and holiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The Holy Spirit casts in that of the work of the ministry between the
          other two ends. The two great ends not being to be obtained by naked
          gifts, or the honor of the office, but by a painful and laborious
          discharge of the trust committed to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The sum of all is, Christ Jesus having ascended up on high, gave
          various gifts to the church, in that he gave various officers to it
          suitably qualified; he gave some, not all, to be extraordinary,
          namely, apostles, prophets, and evangelists; some to be ordinary
          officers, pastors, and teachers; and whatever differences be among
          them, they were all given for one common end, to labor in dispensing
          gospel ordinances, for restoring and perfecting saints, who are so
          often out of frame, and for gathering in the elect, and increase of
          grace in those that are converted.

          EPHESIANS 4:13, "Until we all come in the unity of the faith, and of
          the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
          of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. That the office and work of the ministry is to continue
          until all the elect of God be fully perfected, and the church arrive
          at its full growth. This is the principal doctrine of the text. We
          shall first confirm this doctrine, and then give the reasons of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. To confirm the truth of this, consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That Christ's presence is promised to the ministry always, even to
          the end of the world, Matthew 28:20; now this supposes the existence
          of the ministry until then. Ministers are the stars which Christ holds
          in his right hand, that will always shine more or less while the stars
          are in the firmament; and wicked men may as well attempt the divesting
          of the heavens of these glorious lights, as the church of Christ of a
          ministry, for they shall never be able to effect the one any more than
          the other. Even when the church is into the wilderness, some are
          commanded to feed her there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The sacraments are to continue until then, and consequently a
          ministry by which they may be dispensed. As to baptism, it is plain
          from that, Matthew 28:20. Though the blasphemous Socinians account it
          only a temporary right, used by the apostles towards those, whether
          Jews or Gentiles, of whom the gospel church was first made up. But
          there is a command universal in respect of persons to be baptized; in
          respect of places, and in respect of times, to the end of the world.
          As circumcision lasted in the church until Christ's first coming, so
          must baptism until he come again. And as for the sacrament of the
          supper, it must continue until the Lord come again. For by it we do
          show the Lord's death until he come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The Scripture holds forth public ordinances, in which the Lord
          keeps communion with his people, never to be laid aside until they
          come to glory. It is one of the singularities of the upper house, that
          there is no temple there, Revelation 21:22. Here they look through the
          lattices of ordinances, until they come to see face to face in Heaven.
          It is when the day of glory breaks, that these shadows will flee away;
          but until that time, Christ has promised to be in the mountain of
          myrrh—the public ordinances; so called in allusion to the temple,
          which was on a mountain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Reasons of the doctrine. It must continue.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because the ministry is a mean of the salvation of the elect. "It
          has pleased God by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that
          believe." They are these by whom the Lord gathers his elect; the means
          must continue until the end be obtained, Romans 10:14, 15. While there
          is a lost sinner to seek, the Lord will not blow out the candle; and
          while the night remains, and until the sun arise, these less lights
          are necessary to be continued in the church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The ministry is appointed of Christ, in some measure to supply the
          want of his bodily presence in the world. He spoke in the prophets
          before he came, as the word is, Hebrews 1:1; yes to the old world, by
          his Spirit in Noah a preacher of righteousness, he preached. Now when
          he is ascended up on high, he has given a ministry; and now God does
          beseech sinners by them; and in Christ's stead, we pray sinners to be
          reconciled to God. They must then continue until the Lord come again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because their work which they have to do, will continue until then.
          They are ambassadors for Christ, and while he has a peace to negociate
          with sinners, he will still employ his ambassadors. While Christ keeps
          house in the lower world, stewards must be maintained to give his
          servants meat in due season. While weeds grow in the vineyard, the
          laborers must be continued; and until the house be fully built, and
          every stone laid in the building, it is not time to dismiss the
          builders.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. What society can be preserved without government and governors.
          Every society has its governors, and so the church must have hers
          also. While corruption remains in church members, there will be
          out-breakings among them. That company that is terrible as an army
          with banners, how mean would it be if there were not a set of men
          appointed by the Lord to order and govern them; they would soon turn
          into a mass of confusion. In the best constituted church how often is
          the beauty of it marred; how often does the enemy break in, though the
          watchmen keep their posts, and stand to give warning to the city; how
          much more, if there were no watchmen at all. These then must be
          continued, until they all be within the gates of that city, where the
          gates are never shut, because no enemy can make an attempt to break
          in, and these that are within have no inclination to go out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Of information. It lets us see that the church shall never fail
          altogether. The continuance of the ministry argues the continuance of
          the church. When the Lord has done his work, he will doubtless call in
          his servants, and will not have watchmen where there is no city to
          watch. The church and her ministry also, may be driven into the
          wilderness, and they may both be reduced to a very small number, but
          neither of them shall altogether fail. There may be seven thousand in
          Israel, when Elijah thinks he is left alone; and the witnesses of the
          truth may be seen so far gone as if they were dead, and yet there are
          still some in the darkest time, who afterwards appear as if they had
          risen from the dead.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, this shows that Christ has a special care of, and providence
          watching over the ministry. Ministers are the great butt of the
          world's malice, the thorns in their eyes of which they would gladly be
          freed; and readily, when a storm arises, it blows most violently on
          their faces. Papists cry for miracles; if they were not blinded, they
          might see it in the continual preservation of these earthen vessels,
          for all the opposition they meet with in the world. But Christ holds
          the stars in his right hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We see also the dignity of the office. The greatest officers in
          earthly kingdoms, yes kings themselves, hold not their offices by such
          a tenor. Their work is to carry on God's work in the church until the
          church be perfected, a noble work, and a long term indeed for the
          continuance of their office; which is never to cease until God be all
          in all, and all the elect be in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We then to those that are above teaching, and despise the ministry as
          that which they might well want. Has Christ set a ministry in the
          church as an useless burden upon the people. It speaks a profane
          spirit, and a growth indeed, but not towards that in the text; a
          growth in wickedness and self-conceit. Let us therefore prize the
          preaching of the word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. The diversity of gifts bestowed on ministers has a
          tendency to, and is designed for advancing of unity among God's elect
          people, for unity is the center of all these divers gifts. These are
          as the strings of a viol, some sounding higher, others lower; yet
          altogether making a pleasing harmony. "Your watchmen shall lift up the
          voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye
          to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion." There are many things
          necessary to make a compact building, such as the church is. Some must
          procure the stones, some lay them; some smooth and join the wood, and
          altogether make a compact uniform house. Round about the throne are
          the four beasts; some eminent for lion-like boldness; some for the
          patience and laboriousness of the ox; some for prudence, and some for
          quick-sightedness in the mysteries of godliness. The church can want
          none of them. "The eye cannot say to the foot I have no need of you."
          Some brought blue, purple, scarlet, goat's hair, to the tabernacle.
          Some of these things were more necessary than others, but none of them
          could be wanted. All our Lord's gifts to his servants, tend to unite
          his servants with God, and among themselves, by faith and love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1. For information. This lets us see what a desirable thing unity
          in the Lord is. It is that which is the great end of all these divers
          gifts that Christ has bestowed. It is lovely in the eyes of the Lord,
          and so should it be in ours. By Adam's fall his whole posterity were
          broken and shattered, rent from God and from one another. To cure
          this, God has appointed Christ a new head, under whom they might all
          meet again in unity; and Christ has appointed ministers adorned with a
          diversity of gifts, in order to accomplish this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It may also let us see what is that government of the church that
          looks most like divine institution; whether prelacy that gives the
          keys unto one, or presbytery that gives them to the unity of ruling
          church officers. Which of them is most adapted to the end of the
          ministry; whether one gift, or diversity of gifts. The text determines
          the question, and consequently determines that several presbyteries
          diversely gifted, are the subjects of church power, and not a single
          prelate. Prelacy looks nothing like Christ's economy, and his way of
          managing his house; therefore prelacy brought in for the remedy of
          schism, was a step very far out of Christ's way. And this church was
          for many years preserved from heresy and schism also, by means of
          presbyterian government; and though of late our schisms have
          increased, it remains still, that it is the government most adapted to
          unity, according to the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Of reproof. It reproves those people who make the divers gifts
          of ministers occasions of schism and faction. "One saying I am of
          Paul, and another, I am of Apollos." It is a great weakness that
          people cannot value one gift, but they must undervalue another. Many
          cannot build up one in their esteem, but they must needs have the
          ruins of others for a foundation for it. How contradictory are their
          desires, to what Christ would have in the church. Christ would have
          diverse gifts, and they would have but one, and that all might be just
          of a piece with what they fancy. These that say they can get no good
          of such and such a gift, had need to take heed, that when they get
          good, it be not rather a tickling of their fancy, than solid
          edification.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But much more are these ministers to be reproved, who improve their
          gifts to the rending of the church, and breeding in people a contempt
          of others. "Some, indeed, preach Christ, even of envy and strife: and
          some also of good will. The one preach Christ of contention, not
          sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds." This is a
          dreadful perverting of the end of these gifts, and says that such are
          devoted more to their own honor than to the good of souls.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. Whatever differences are now among the godly, yet a
          perfect unity is abiding them, in which they shall all have the same
          apprehensions and views of spiritual things. To confirm this,
          consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The perfect unity of the elect of God, is that which is purchased
          by the blood of Christ, and therefore must needs take effect. He died,
          "that he might gather together in one, the children of God that were
          scattered abroad." Sin has built up a partition wall between God and
          the elect, as well as others, and a partition dividing them among
          themselves. The sufferings of Christ, has meritoriously thrown it
          down; upon which it must needs follow, that it will be actually thrown
          down by the Spirit of Christ beginning the work here, and afterwards
          perfecting it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. This unity is prayed for, by the great Mediator, whom the Father
          hears always, and whose intercession must needs be effectual, John
          17:21–23. He came into the world, to make up that rent which sin had
          made; and he is now at the Father's right hand pursuing the same
          design, never to leave it until it be perfected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The same Spirit dwells in the head and in all the members, though
          not in the same measure; the same ointment poured on the high priest's
          own head, runs down to the skirts of his garments, and anoints all the
          members of Christ. Hence the apostle presses unity from the fellowship
          of the Spirit, they being joint partakers of the one Spirit of God,
          Philippians 2:1, 2. This Spirit has begun that union, and is still at
          the uniting work; and it consists not with the honor of God, not to
          perfect that which he has begun. For which cause the church may
          confidently say as David, "The Lord will perfect that which concerns
          me: your mercy, O Lord, endures forever: forsake not the works of your
          own hands."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The occasion of the disordant judgments that are among the people
          of God, will at length be taken away. There is great darkness now, in
          those that have the greatest share of light and knowledge. The time we
          are in this world, is a night in comparison of the day of eternity
          that is approaching. No wonder we have every one our own mistakes; but
          where we are going, there is no night there. Now the most knowing,
          know but in part; but that which is perfect will come, and then that
          which is in part will be done away. Now we are but children, and
          therefore want not our childish conceptions of heavenly things; but
          when we come to a perfect man, these childish things will be put away.
          Now we see but through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now we
          know but in part, but then shall know as we are known, most clearly
          and distinctly, as it is said, 1 Corinthians 13:9–12. So truth being
          but one, our conceptions of it will be the same, when we shall be
          perfectly cast into the mold of truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. This lets us see that the people of God will at length arrive
          at unity of affections, lay aside all their jarrings, animosities,
          factions and divisions, and cordially embrace each other in the arms
          of perfect love. For the fountain being stopped, the streams must
          needs become dry; difference of judgment being that which occasions
          such discord and alienation of affections. This may comfort the godly,
          oppressed now with grief, because of these differences that are among
          the Lord's people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It may let us see the odious nature of divisions and discords among
          professors. These tell us we are yet abroad, not at home. They look
          like the earth, and very unlike Heaven. "Therefore," says Paul, "while
          one says I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos, are you not
          carnal." When we are better Christians, we will be more peaceable, and
          leave off to devour one another were we once in the ark above.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Of exhortation. This serves to urge us to several duties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To labor for unity, and "to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
          bond of peace." "It is a pleasant thing for brethren to dwell in
          unity. It makes the church strong and terrible to enemies; whereas
          divisions do exceedingly weaken her, and make her a prey to the enemy.
          Blessed be the Lord for that unity which is yet among the ministers of
          this church; and long may it last, for be it broken when it will, the
          success of the gospel which is little now, will be less then. Men will
          be readily converted to a party, but few will be converted to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let us bear with one another in love; knowing we are yet in the
          body, and have need of compassion. Let us pursue the quarrel against
          an ungodly world, enemies to God and godliness, because there is no
          hope of meeting in Heaven to compose the difference; but see we any
          with their faces towards the heavenly Canaan, O let us not fall out by
          the way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Let us long for Heaven as the place where we will be happy. For
          motive hereto, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. IV. That the church of Christ shall at length arrive at its
          full growth in glory, as a man come to perfect age. Then shall it be
          perfect in parts, every member being brought in, and in degrees every
          member being at its full growth. How does the heir long until the time
          of his minority be over and past, that he may get the inheritance in
          his hands. There is an eternal weight of glory abiding a state of
          perfection, when we shall know no more clouds of darkness and
          ignorance, no more weakness; but the weakest shall be as David, and
          David as the angel of God. When no corruption shall be in our mind,
          will, or affections; when faith shall be turned to sight, hope to
          enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE V. Then, and not until then, comes the church to perfection,
          when every member thereof, is brought to a perfect conformity with
          Christ, bearing a just proportion to him, as members proportioned to
          the head. This will certainly come to pass. Mystical Christ is yet
          growing; the head is at perfection, but the members some of them are
          yet wanting: none of them that are here below, are grown up to the
          just proportion, but until that be, mystical Christ is not perfect.
          This is a certain argument that it shall be. Christ will not always
          have his body so disproportioned to the head. An infinitely holy head,
          will at length have perfectly holy members. The head that has now got
          above all temptations, will certainly draw the feet out of the reach
          of Satan and corruption. The head that has got above the waters of the
          shadow of death and corruption, will certainly make our vile bodies
          like his glorious body; and as he arose from death, and now it has no
          more dominion over him, so will he confirm our souls and bodies in a
          glorious state of immortality. All which may make believers long for
          that blessed day, and endeavor to antedate heaven's happiness as far
          as they can, in the pursuit of conformity to Christ, and growing up to
          that blessed head; remembering that all their backslidings and decays
          dishonor him egregiously, in so disfiguring his body and
          disproportioning his members. For direction how to go on to this
          perfection, take

          DOCTRINE VI. As is our faith and knowledge of Christ, so is our growth
          and perfection. It is the knowledge of Christ, that introduces us to
          the blessed state of perfection. The more we believe in, and know
          Christ, the nearer are we to perfection; and when these are come to
          their perfection, then are we at our full growth.

          Let us then, that are ministers, make this our great work, to get
          people to close with Christ, and get acquainted with him. O! if we
          could preach Christ, live Christ, and make him the scope of our life
          and doctrine, it would be well. Let all of us study to know him. The
          nearest way to perfection is knowledge; and all things else necessary
          to salvation is to know Christ, who is that body of divinity which the
          Spirit of God teaches his scholars, "for God who commanded the light
          to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light
          of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face Jesus Christ."
          Amen.-
