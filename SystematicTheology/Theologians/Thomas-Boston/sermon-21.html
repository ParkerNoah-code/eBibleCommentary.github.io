 </p>
<p align="justify">1 Timothy 4:7, "Exercise yourself rather unto godliness"</p>
<p align="justify">EXERCISE unto godliness is now almost worn out of the 
    world. Many casting off the very bodily exercise in religion; few, very few, 
    keeping up the heart exercise of it; and it is our work to strive against 
    the stream. This is all the apology I shall make to you, for preaching upon 
    a text that several of you heard me upon, elsewhere, not long ago. There it 
    was my business, to stir up myself, and my brethren in the ministry, to the 
    exercise of godliness, in order to make us good ministers; and now I am to 
    stir you up to it, in order to make you good Christians.</p>
<p align="justify">The apostle gives us here a short, but substantial 
    description of the Christian life. It is an exercise, it is not a name. 
    People must not think to take on a profession of religion, as men set their 
    foot in a boat, and sit there at their own ease, until they be set ashore. 
    Persons may reach Hell in this way, but they will not arrive at Heaven. For 
    time runs with a rapid course, and sleep we, or wake we, carries us swiftly 
    down the stream to eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Christianity is not an easy exercise, but such as 
    wrestlers or runners used, exerting all their might and skill to gain the 
    victory. We are not to expect two summers in one year, or rest here, and in 
    Heaven also. We are also reminded, that Christianity is heart-soul-exercise, 
    for it is opposed to bodily exercise. It is not the saying of a prayer, 
    reading a chapter, hearing a sermon, giving every one their due, and the 
    like. Though the tongue cry to God, as if it would rend the clouds, and the 
    eyes should help it forward with a flood of tears, the hands should deal 
    among the poor all that a man has, and his mouth should keep shut to 
    macerate his body with fasting, the knees should become hard as horns with 
    praying, and after all this, the feet should carry away the skeleton to be 
    burned for religion: yet if there be no more, and that of another kind, it 
    is all but vile bodily exercise, that will leave the soul ruined and undone 
    at the latter end. "For," says Paul, "though I bestow all my goods to feed 
    the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it 
    profits me nothing." As if he had said, if my soul within me, burn not as 
    clear in sincere love to God, as my body in the flame, I will but go out of 
    one fire here, into another in Hell. So then true religion is an inward 
    thing.</p>
<p align="justify">Once more, the Christian life is a heart exercise to the 
    most noble end, even to godliness. It is not to get a name; nay, it is not 
    to get just as much grace as may keep people out of Hell, which is the 
    utmost bounds of the ambition of some; and by this they declare that 
    godliness has never yet touched them at the heart. But it is godliness, a 
    conformity to God in the whole man. This is the scope of their exercise; 
    this only will satisfy the holy ambition, with which the Spirit of the Lord 
    has fired their hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. The true Christian life is heart exercise to 
    godliness. For illustrating this, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show some weighty truths imported in this.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Some things in which the exercise to godliness 
    consists. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show some weighty truths imported in this.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Habitual godliness is absolutely necessary to 
    salvation. For as a man cannot wrestle, that wants the power of his arms; so 
    neither can a man lead the Christian life, who is not a Christian indeed. 
    "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." There must 
    be a new nature, before there be a new life pleasing to God; for a new life 
    with an old heart, is but superficial, and mere bodily exercise. One dead in 
    sin will never exercise himself to godliness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. No person goes to Heaven sleeping. The Christian life 
    is an exercise. They have much to do, the Christian race is to run, there 
    are many enemies to wrestle with, and the kingdom of Heaven to be taken by 
    violence. Most men look as if they expected Heaven would drop into their 
    mouth, while lying on the bed of sloth. It is not our exercise, indeed, that 
    procures Heaven, but it is a rest procured not for loiterers but laborers.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They must have true courage that shall come to Heaven. 
    "He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he 
    shall be my son. But the fearful and unbelieving shall have their part in 
    the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." 
    True Christians must be like Caleb and Joshua among the spies, having their 
    foreheads steeled to encounter difficulties. It is only overcomers that 
    carry away the crown. The Christian may have sharp exercise in wrestling. 
    Like Jacob, he may have to wrestle with God himself, Genesis 32:24–30. The 
    soul has hard exercise in the field of divine trials, as in the case of a 
    call to some more than ordinary work, as when Abraham was called to offer up 
    his son Isaac. In such cases, armies of discouragements and carnal 
    reasonings will attack the man. These overcame Jonah for a time, but Abraham 
    went actively through. In the case of desertions from the Lord; here the 
    Christian is often wrapped up in a cloud of darkness, and left without 
    light: armies of doubts and fears attack him, dragging him sometimes to the 
    very borders of blasphemy, Psalm, 77:7–10. He is carried captive from Zion 
    to Sinai. "For you write bitter things against me" says Job, "and make me to 
    possess the iniquities of my youth." Job had hard work, when he said, 
    "though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." They have also to wrestle with 
    the devil, even "against principalities and powers, against spiritual 
    wickedness in high places." Some people find no difficulty here; they are 
    Satan's sleeping children, whom he will be very unwilling to awaken or 
    disturb; but if any have a mind for Heaven, they will get a black band of 
    hellish temptations to wrestle through.</p>
<p align="justify">They have to wrestle also with the world. No man can go 
    through it to Heaven, but he will find it a place filled with snares, and 
    that will require courage to face the difficulties in it. "Whatever is born 
    of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the 
    world, even our faith." They must also wrestle with their own lusts. They 
    will have a war within, as well as without. "For the flesh lusts against the 
    spirit, and the spirit against the flesh." But of these more afterwards.</p>
<p align="justify">4. People must either give up the name of Christians, or 
    else abandon their old exercise to sin and ungodliness. There is no 
    consistency between the two. "For whoever is born of God does not commit 
    sin; for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of 
    God." Every one has some exercise. The soul is never idle. A watch 
    frequently goes faster when wrong, than when right; so that we call you not 
    to more but to other exercise. If there be a principle of godliness within, 
    however low it be, it will break forth into action at length, and act like 
    itself. Grace in the heart, like a spring, though stopped with mud, will 
    seek a vent one way or another.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The Christian life, is a spiritual life. "That 
    which is born of the spirit is spirit." What avails a carcass of duties, 
    without the life and power of godliness. In the sacrifices of the heathens, 
    the priest used to look to the heart, to see if it was sound. God looks to 
    that chiefly. The Christian is the spiritual man, 1 Corinthians 2:15. and 
    his worship is spiritual. "He worships God in spirit and in truth." We now 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show some things, in which the exercise to 
    godliness consists.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In carrying on a constant trade with Heaven, through 
    our Lord Jesus Christ. They say our "conversation is in Heaven, from whence 
    also, we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ." They keep up communion 
    with God, through the Mediator. "Their fellowship is with the Father, and 
    with his Son Jesus Christ." This trade consists in import and export. I may 
    well put them in that order; for all the traders with Heaven, go there 
    empty-handed at first, and have never anything to export that is worthy, but 
    what is the product of Immanuel's land. The soul exercised is taken up, 1. 
    In exporting all its guilt, and importing pardons daily. The exercised soul 
    finds guilt a heavy load to the conscience, yet its weakness is such, that 
    it is still contracting new guilt, therefore takes it, lays it before the 
    Lord, and sues out for pardon, and this only through Christ. The soul dares 
    not, like the vile hypocrite in his bodily exercise, lay down a confession, 
    a resolution to mend, drop a tear, and then snatch up a pardon; but he goes 
    by faith to Christ, dips in that blood that is the blood of God, and comes 
    away clean. He dares not for his very soul touch a pardon, but what is 
    written in blood. "We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of 
    sins, according to the riches of his grace."</p>
<p align="justify">Again, the exercised soul is employed in exporting his 
    weakness, poverty and wants, and importing strength and fullness from God. 
    "They that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength." They receive 
    also light and life. "Cast your burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain 
    you." He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. The soul comes before 
    the Lord shaken out of itself, holding out its empty vessel, that the oil of 
    grace may run into it; but in the meantime applies immediately to Christ as 
    the golden pipe, through which alone the golden oil is conveyed. "And of his 
    fullness have all we received, and grace for grace." The exercised soul 
    knows that there are no saving influences but through him, no streams of 
    light but what shines through the veil of the flesh of Christ, and no life 
    but what comes through him "that was dead and is alive," and no strength but 
    comes from him "that has the seven Spirits of God."</p>
<p align="justify">The soul is also employed in exporting particular 
    petitions, and importing answers of prayer, and returning praises. "Praise 
    waits for you, O God, in Zion: and unto you shall the vow be paid. O you 
    that hear prayer, unto you shall all flesh come." What are the prayers of 
    many but just bodily exercise. They neither come from the heart, nor does 
    the heart go with them, nor after them, to see what success they have at the 
    throne. The exercised soul will have particular suits before the Lord, and 
    will be waiting on while the suit is in dependence, that a gracious return 
    may at length come. "My voice shall you hear in the morning, O Lord; in the 
    morning will I direct my prayer unto you, and will look up." And this will 
    be returned again, in the voice of praise. And all through Christ, "in whom 
    we have boldness, and access with confidence, by the faith of him." It was 
    the custom of the Molossrans, when they were to seek a favor of their 
    prince, to take up his son in their arms.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In a spiritual performance of duties. Christians 
    "exercise themselves to have a conscience void of offence towards God, and 
    towards man." Leaving the corpse of duties, which of itself is but bodily 
    exercise, I shall touch at the life and soul of duties, in which the 
    exercise to godliness consists. The exercise to godliness in this point, 
    consists in these six things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. In getting the soul fixed in that point, what is sin 
    and what is duty in particular cases, before we put hand to it. "Trust in 
    the Lord with all your heart; and lean not to your own understanding. In all 
    your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths." It is surely 
    gross religion, when people find a thing in itself lawful, they make no more 
    questions about it, and ask not counsel at the mouth of the Lord. Remarkable 
    is that word, "ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be 
    established." That is, though a thing seem very easy to us at first, as to 
    sin or duty, yet examine it accurately as in a pair of balances. Here is 
    matter of exercise, in which the soul will find much need of careful 
    noticing of the word of the Lord, that is a lamp to the feet, looking to the 
    law and to the testimony. There is need also, of a wise observation of 
    Providence, which in subserviency to the word, is the Lord's eye set on his 
    people to guide them. This is an eminent part of the exercise of godliness. 
    "For whoever is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall 
    understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. This must be attended with an 
    humble dependence on the Lord for light. "The meek will he guide in 
    judgment, and the meek will he teach his way." This dependence is the union 
    of faith and self-denial, by which the soul is laid before the Lord in any 
    matter, as a sheet of clean paper, that he may write on it what his own mind 
    is, keeping the soul in suspense, until the Lord himself cast the balance; 
    not like those who dissembled in their hearts, when they sent Jeremiah to 
    pray for them to the Lord, "saying declare unto us, and we will do it;" but 
    when he declared the answer, "they did not obey the voice of the Lord their 
    God." Jeremiah 42:20, 21.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In doing the duty because it is the will of God, which 
    must be not only the rule, but also the reason of your duties, otherwise 
    they are but bodily exercise. "I seek not mine own will," said Jesus, "but 
    the will of him that sent me." As the belief of a truth is not faith, unless 
    a man believe because God has said it; so a duty is not a part of godliness, 
    unless it be done because God has commanded it. "I will keep," says David, 
    "the commandments of my God." Now if a person does a thing because God 
    commands it, he will not stick at anything, where he sees the will of God 
    plain, Genesis 22. The Christian course is a walk unto all well-pleasing, 
    not of men's selves, but of God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In doing our duty to the glory of God. "Whether, 
    therefore, you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of 
    God." The end in all things is a principal thing, and a perverting of this, 
    perverts the whole work. Seeing God is the first principle of all goodness, 
    natural or moral, he must be the chief end of it also, to whom all must be 
    referred, as the waters being lifted up from the sea to the clouds, return 
    to it again. And men may even as lawfully make themselves their God, as 
    their chief end in their actions, Zechariah 7:5, 6. God will never be the 
    rewarder of that duty, of which he is not the end. What though a servant 
    work very busily, if he be working for himself will the master own it? Let a 
    man pray, mourn, watch, and do every duty, all that is not enough! if God be 
    not your chief end in all these, they are but a costly sacrifice to the idol 
    self: for we know "that skin for skin, yes all that a man has will he give 
    for his life." Alas! is not all turned upside down with the most part. God 
    is made the mean, ourselves the end; so that the good works of many, are but 
    a serving themselves of God, not a serving of God. The Jewish doctors called 
    God Place, intimating that the godly soul dwells not in the barren region of 
    self, but in God; even as the needle in the compass, touched with a good 
    loadstone, turns still to the north, whatever winds blow.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In doing our duties in the strength of Christ. 
    "Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, 
    giving thanks to God and the Father by him." "Even the devils," said the 
    disciples to their Lord, "are subject to us through your name." You have no 
    more warrant to act in duty from your own strength, than to depend upon your 
    own righteousness. you can only say, "I will go in the strength of the Lord 
    God: I will make mention of your righteousness, even of your only." Men must 
    act as they live, now the godly soul lives by Christ. "He that eats my 
    flesh, and drinks my blood," says Jesus, "dwells in me, and I in him. He who 
    eats me, even he shall live by me." The Christian then must act by him. Do 
    you think that any fruit will relish in Heaven, but that which grows upon 
    the true vine. The hypocrite is a tree that has its own root in the ground, 
    hence he turns into himself, summoning together all his natural powers for 
    duty. "Thus says the Lord, Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes 
    flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the Lord; for he shall be like 
    the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes." But the godly 
    person is a branch, whose fruit depends upon influence from the stock to 
    which it is united; hence he dares not trust to his natural powers, gifts, 
    nor inherent graces, seeing these depend on Christ, as light on the sun, and 
    are but rays, not the fountain of light. But he goes out of himself, in the 
    way of believing, for duties, saying, "I can do all things, through Christ 
    which strengthened me." Let men in their bodily exercise, like common 
    boatmen, serve themselves with their oars; the soul exercised to godliness, 
    will depend on Christ, for the influences of his Spirit, saying, "Awake, O 
    north wind; and come you south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof 
    may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant 
    fruits." Isaac was born of a barren woman.</p>
<p align="justify">5. In doing it out of love to God in Christ. I say in 
    Christ; for whatever deluded enthusiasts say; whatever Christless hypocrites 
    and moralists, who know not God, think; it is impossible for a guilty 
    creature to love God but in Christ, seeing God out of Christ is a consuming 
    fire. "We love him, because he first loved us." Our love to God is but the 
    reflex of God's love to us. God's love darts its beams to us no way but 
    through the veil of the flesh of Christ; and it is through the same veil our 
    love returns to him. Now the Christian labor is a work and labor of love. 
    What comes not to God out of love he regards not; for in that case he gets 
    the hand, but not the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In directing all our duties to God, through 
    Christ. As grace for duties comes from the Lord, so duty rightly managed, is 
    the returning of that grace to God, in duty; as the men that got the 
    talents, improved them for their master. Now as there is no saving receipts 
    from Heaven, but through Christ; so no acceptable returns but through him. 
    God will not hear praise but through him, and the exercised soul will not 
    dare offer it to him; but through Christ. "Blessed be the God and Father of 
    our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in 
    heavenly places in Christ." Nor a prayer but what comes through his mouth, 1 
    Kings 8:39; nor a good work will he receive, but what is dipped in his 
    blood, though it were a sacrifice of our own blood for his cause. The 
    martyrs "have all washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of 
    the Lamb." The Holy One of Israel will not touch an offering, but what comes 
    through the hands of the holy Jesus. Alas! many if they get some victory 
    over a lust, some steps walked cleanly, they will go even forward to God 
    with them, because they know not God. Bullocks offered on the altar at 
    Bethel were abominable, when turtles were accepted on the altar at 
    Jerusalem.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The exercise of godliness consists in an habitual and 
    actual mortification of lusts. They that are Christ's, have crucified the 
    flesh, with the affections and lusts.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In resisting temptations from the devil. Above all, 
    taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the 
    fiery darts of the wicked one.</p>
<p align="justify">5. In keeping ourselves unspotted from the world, the 
    things of the world, and the men of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In rightly managing the cross, and extracting the 
    sweet of it.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In the proper management of divine trials. The 
    length of the preceding part of the discourse, prevents me from illustrating 
    these particulars. I can only add for the use of what has been said,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It may strike terror on the profane world, who are 
    exercised to nothing but wickedness. "An heart they have exercised with 
    covetous practices; cursed children." Many will not so much as meddle with 
    the bodily exercise of religion, but soul and body, both are devoted to the 
    service of the devil. Tour exercise is coming when you will neither rest day 
    nor night. "For if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly, 
    and the sinner appear."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It may strike terror on formal hypocrites, who know 
    nothing of religion but bodily exercise, as if they were serving an idol 
    that had eyes, but saw not; ears, but heard not: or they were mere lumps of 
    spiritless clay, and the soul were for no use in the body, but to keep it a 
    while from rotting. Ah sirs! if this be religion that we have been speaking 
    of, then there is little religion in the world. Some that have been of long 
    standing in a profession, may even begin again. Consider where you are and 
    in what this will end.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It may fill the faces of sleeping Christians with 
    shame. These things have been their exercise, but they are not much engaged 
    that way now. Arise, and go to your work again. God will awaken you at 
    length, it may be in a very terrible manner; that though you may be saved, 
    yet it may be so as by fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Let me exhort all to godliness, and to the 
    exercise of godliness. It is the most pleasant life, even a Heaven on earth. 
    "For wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." 
    It is the most profitable exercise: "for godliness is profitable unto all 
    things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to 
    come." Go to Christ for it, for the residue of the Spirit is with him. He 
    has the seven Spirits of God for dead souls. Amen.</p>
