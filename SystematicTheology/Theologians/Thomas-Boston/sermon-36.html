          Lamentations 3:49, 50 "My eye trickles down, and ceases not, without
          any intermission, until the Lord look down and behold from Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          WONDER not, that upon this occasion, we have read a mournful text to
          you; for I suppose if every one of us were taking liberty to express
          the affections and present frame of our hearts, it would be as Ezra
          3:12, 13, "when some wept with a loud voice, and many shouted aloud
          for joy: so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout
          of joy, from the noise of the weeping of the people." So among us,
          some would weep, and some rejoice; and in the meantime, others would
          stand as unconcerned spectators, who have not found Christ, and
          therefore cannot rejoice; and do not feel the want of him, and
          therefore cannot lament after him. Yes, perhaps, some would be found,
          who with one eye would look joyfully, because they have got so much;
          and with the other weep, because they have not got more. But alas! it
          is the misery of many that they are too soon pleased. They may begin
          in the course of mourning with the church here, but cannot hold up
          with her, but stand still, long before "the Lord look down and behold
          from Heaven," and so lose the things which they have wrought. In the
          text we have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The church's present exercise, and that is mourning. The ground of
          her mourning was guilt and heavy affliction, chapter 5:16. Her grief
          was great, "mine eye trickles down." Her sorrow was such as if her eye
          had been turned into a fountain of tears, and her head into waters. It
          was lasting, it ceased not: It was not for a fit and away again, and
          so ended; but it was without intermission, a continual sorrow.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The term of the continuance of this exercise. "Until the Lord look
          down, and behold from Heaven." She would take no comfort until the
          Lord should give it to her. She was seeking the Lord sorrowing, and
          her eyes cannot dry until she find him. It was the light of his
          countenance only, that could restore her joy. She was resolved her cry
          should be continually going to the throne, until he who sits upon it,
          should look in mercy on her, and deliver her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE.—As it is the duty, so it is the disposition of the godly,
          exercised under the hidings of the Lord's face, not to give over, nor
          to sit down contented, until such time as the Lord be pleased to give
          them a favorable look. We see it thus with Jacob. He said to God, "I
          will not let you go, except you bless me." Genesis 32:26; Hosea 12:4.
          And the woman of Canaan. Matthew 15:22–28. I shall here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. Show what this imports.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Give reasons why they are thus disposed. I am then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. To show what is imported in this. It imports,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That a child of God may be under the hidings of God's face. When it
          is said. "until the Lord look," this imports that the Lord refused to
          look on them for the time. "You did hide your face," says David, "and
          I was troubled." God will have a difference between the upper and
          lower houses. When the saints are above, all the shadows flee away,
          but now clouds may intercept the light of his countenance. This
          implies that a controversy is apprehended between Christ and the soul.
          The soul conceives the Lord is angry, for the turning way of the face
          is the way how we signify our displeasure. When the Lord turns his
          back, conscience turns its face to the soul, and tells that the Lord
          is displeased. And O! how bitter must God's anger be to that soul that
          knows him. Is his favor sweet as life, then his anger must be bitter
          as death. It implies also an apprehension of the Lord's laying aside
          any special concern about them. I do not say but it is a mistaken
          apprehension, but sure such a thing is here implied; for the wife will
          be ready to think that her husband has forgot her, when he locks up
          himself in his chamber, and does not give her a look through door or
          window. This was David's exercise when he said, "How long will you
          forget me, O Lord? forever? how long will you hide your face from me?"
          This was Zion's conclusion, though she was mistaken, Isaiah 49:14, 15.
          The children of God may be under that apprehension, that their high
          priest has let them out of his mind, though he remembers them still,
          and does them many good offices, which they know not, until
          afterwards. But it is so long between visits, that they think he has
          forgotten them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It imports that the hidings of the Lord's face, may continue long
          with a child of God. The tears for his absence, may trickle down long,
          before he come and wipe them away. "I am afflicted," says Heman, "and
          ready to die from my youth up." Sovereignty has the disposal of the
          time, and sometimes may prolong it, so as it may appear a kind of
          eternity. Hence such complaints as, "the harvest is past, the summer
          is ended, and we are not saved." God will have his people's faith and
          patience tried, and therefore makes their clouds return after the
          rain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A holy dissatisfaction with all things, while Christ hides his
          face. The soul is difficult to please when the Lord is gone. Nothing
          will stop the fountain of tears here, until the Lord look down from
          Heaven. The word will not please them, and ordinances will not please
          them, without him, Psalm 6:6, 7, and 27:4. An angel's presence could
          not satisfy Moses, Exodus 33:15; nor dry Mary's cheeks, while her Lord
          was taken away. Their life is bound up in his favorable looks, and as
          Rachel weeping for her children, refuses to be comforted, because they
          are not, so they cannot be comforted until he return:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A wearisome longing after the Lord, Job 7:2, 3; and 23:3, 4. The
          soul is looking for his appearance, as the traveler in the night longs
          for the day-breaking. Most of the causes of weariness concur here, as
          solitude. The wife lives but a solitary life, when the husband is from
          home, though the house be thronged with servants; so does the child of
          God, while the Lord hides his face. Darkness also causes weariness. It
          is a pleasant thing to behold the sun; but now the Sun of
          Righteousness hides his face, and it is a dark hour with the soul, Job
          29:2, 3. Here also there is some toil. A time of desertion, is a
          toilsome time to the people of God. "I am weary with my groaning,"
          says David. Duties are hard work, when Christ withdraws. Labor in vain
          much more causes weariness. Hope deferred makes the heart sick.
          Sometimes they no sooner call but God hears, then they need not weary.
          O but to be standing alone, in the dark hour of the night, trying to
          break up heaven's gates, to get corruptions mortified, and temptations
          overcome, and all without felt success, how wearisome must that be? A
          man's not seeing the end of his work, makes weary work. It refreshes
          the laborer, to think that when the sun goes down, he will go to his
          rest; but the people of God, in this case, see not their signs, nor
          know the time how long. They know not what hour of the night it is,
          and how long it will be until day-break. Finally, continued
          disappointments from every quarter, from which the soul expects ease,
          makes weariness in full measure. Job. 23:8, 9; Jeremiah 8:15.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Some hope that the Lord will yet look down, and behold from Heaven,
          Psalm 43:5. Should they lose all hope, they lose all. It is true their
          hope may be very low: yet likely they will be able to say, who knows
          but he may return and leave a blessing behind. Sometimes they may draw
          hasty and heavy conclusions against themselves, but hope will yet set
          up its head, and make them say with Jonah, "yet I will look again
          towards God's holy temple;" though it may be sometimes sunk, but all
          is not lost that is in hazard, Lamentations 3:18–21. Hope feeds those
          weary laborers, and God never allows his people to sink so low, but
          everlasting arms are still beneath them, to keep them from falling to
          the bottom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, A resolute persisting in duty until the Lord return: The soul
          resolves never to give over, and so holds on, until the Lord look down
          and behold from Heaven. Sense may often bring bad news, and tell them
          they have already got the last look of him, but the soul is resolute,
          and will not give over. If it must die, it resolves to die in the bed
          of honor, even at the Lord's footstool, and to dig its grave at his
          door. We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To give some reasons why they are thus disposed. I shall offer
          only these few.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Felt need of Christ engages them to this course. You know what
          determined the lepers that sat at the gate of Samaria. Many see a want
          of Christ, that feel not their need of him; hence a few cold wishes,
          and if that will do, well and good; but if not, they must even live
          without him. But the gracious soul cannot live without him. They say
          with Peter, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal
          life. Now, necessity has no law, and hunger will dig through stone
          walls. And if it cannot dig through them, it will leap over them. The
          soul still cries, Lord help me.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Superlative love to him, engages them to this, Song 8:6, 7. Love
          can endure anything but absence, or the loss of the beloved party.
          Christ has appeared in his beauty to the gracious soul, and has
          captivated his heart, and it is so fixed with the sight of his
          transcendent excellency and fullness, that he cannot take it back
          again. The eyes of the soul are opened, and can see no happiness in
          any other. But in the meantime, the soul cannot cease to desire to be
          happy, and therefore can never rest, until the Lord look down, and
          behold from Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Hence we may see why so many professors fall short of Christ.
          They are utter strangers to this disposition of the godly. There are
          many who have not so much sense as to complain of the Lord's distance
          from them, because their consciences were never so much touched with
          any notable common work of the Spirit of God on them. There are
          others, whose character may be that, "ever learning, and never coming
          to the knowledge of the truth," they have some movings upon their
          souls, and they complain; but their complaints are dead, heavy, and
          inactive. They may at a communion or so, have something like mourning
          after the Lord, but all their exercise is like a slight shower, that
          wets only the surface of the earth, which a little wind presently
          dries up, before it can do any good. The concern of their souls for
          Christ does not last until, but is gone, before the Lord look down,
          and behold from Heaven. Reasons of this are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They have not the living spirit of Christ in them, and so they
          cannot follow the Lord fully. Numbers 14:24; John 4:14. It is but
          awakening, and not changing grace they have; therefore it decays by
          little and little, as the light after sunset, until it grow to perfect
          darkness. Their reigning sloth being only covered, not subdued, rises
          again, and overspreads the soul, as weeds do in the spring. Take a
          branch and engraft it, it will keep green a while; but if it do not
          take with the stock, and unite with it, it withers. "If a man," says
          Jesus, "abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
          withered."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There are difficulties in the way to Heaven, which their hearts
          cannot digest. Few see Heaven; and why? ease is sweet, and the gate is
          strait. They love gold, but they cannot exert themselves to dig for
          it. "The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to
          labor." They see Heaven afar off, and would gladly be there. But there
          is a great gulf between them and it, that they dare not venture to
          swim. Heaven will not drop down into their mouths, hence finding the
          fruitlessness of their attempts, they despair of mending their case,
          and then sit down to contrive ways to smooth their consciences.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The world and their lusts were never made sapless to them, but
          still have the chief room in their hearts. Hence, when Christ will not
          answer, they have another door to go to. They are unlike those who
          said to Jesus, "Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of
          eternal life." They find rest is sweet, so sit down, and fall short of
          Christ. They are like a wife called to go forth and meet her husband;
          but her children, in whom she delights, cry after her, and hold her
          still. And thus many part with Christ, as Orpah with Naomi.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. You are in earnest for Christ, yet under the hidings of his
          face, and all things else insipid to you without him, you see here how
          you are to behave; you must hold on seeking until the Lord look down
          from Heaven. Take up with no comfort in the world, until you get it
          from himself, and from his blood; and be resolute that you will never
          give over until he look down from Heaven, and be sure you shall get a
          healing look from the Lord. "Shall not God avenge his own elect, which
          cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?" Have you
          missed him, have you come short of what God promises to his people; of
          what is necessary to your case; of what you desired of him? then go
          from this place, resolved to hang about his hand, and to cry for it
          until you obtain it; protesting that nothing shall satify you, until
          the Lord look down and behold from Heaven; and be sure you shall get
          your communion yet, though the table be drawn, and no more bread and
          wine on it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 1. I dare seek him no more, guilt so stares me in the face,
          that prayer is a terror to me. ANSWER, This is a fit of indisposition
          you are under, and sometimes Christians are carried away with it. But
          if you belong to Christ, you will even take up with prayer again,
          seeing yourself the greater fool, that ever you laid it aside, if it
          were ever so short a while. But O hear what Christ himself says to
          you. Song 2:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 2. But I am burdened with a hard heart, I cannot mourn after
          the Lord; could I seek him to purpose, I would have hope that he would
          look down, and behold from Heaven. I fear he has nothing to do with
          me. I see I am all wrong, but I can do nothing to help it. ANSWER I
          suppose you may find three hopeful things, even in that case. 1.
          Self-dissatisfaction. There is a secret discontent with yourselves in
          you. Weak grace is frowning on corruption, though it is not able to
          master it. 2. Self-condemnation. The man is the vilest creature in his
          own eyes. He has nothing to commend him to Christ, and he would wonder
          if he would cast him a crumb; saying, "it is of the Lord's mercies,
          that I am not consumed, and because his compassions fail not. But to
          this man, says the Lord, will I look, even to him that is poor, and of
          a broken and a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word." 3. There is
          a spark of kindness to Christ in the heart, though the soul has
          written the bill of divorce, and put it in Christ's hand, yet the soul
          would not sign it for thousands of worlds. Well then, if you cannot
          mourn, will you sigh and groan after him. Romans 8:26, 27. If you
          cannot sigh, will you give him an earnest look. "I am cast out of your
          sight," said Jonah, "yet I will look again toward your holy temple."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 3. The Lord has let me fall into such a gross sin as has
          wounded my conscience, and I fear he has shaken me off, by letting me
          fall into it. And whenever that comes in my mind, I cannot think that
          the Lord will ever look more to me. ANSWER Have you fled to Christ for
          refuge. If you have, then your greatest sins may hide God's face, but
          shall never part God and you. Psalm 89:30–34, "The blood of Jesus
          Christ cleanses from all sin." The Lord has designs of good, even in
          permitting his people to fall. He raises profit to them out of it.
          Thus God left Hezekiah, in the business of the Babylonian ambassadors,
          "to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart." It also
          brings a revenue of glory to himself, by his having mercy upon them.
          And for your continual disquiet, look that you have not trusted more
          to your repentance for your sin, than to the blood of Christ, which
          "alone can purge the conscience from dead works to serve the living
          God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION. 4. I have met with so many disappointments, that I can
          scarcely think but I must give it over. ANSWER. You are not the first
          that have met with them. Job 23 Song 3. Disappointments are needful
          for us in several respects. But if you should meet with one on the
          back of another until your dying hour, if Christ come at last, you
          have no reason to repent your waiting on; and come he will, to them
          that will not want him. There are three signs when your
          disappointments may be near an end. 1. When your heart is duly
          humbled, and you are as a weaned child; when you leave off limiting
          God; resolving to wait on God, but to prescribe no time to him. "Lord
          you have heard the desire of the humble; you will prepare their heart,
          you will cause your ear to hear." 2. When you get your case touched,
          and laid open in the public ordinances. "The watchmen that go about
          the city, found me," says the spouse, "and after this she soon found
          her beloved." 3. When you are carried above means, to look over them
          all to Christ himself; even passing on from the watchmen, until you
          find him whom your soul loves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, My case grows worse and worse, heavier and heavier, and always
          the longer the more hopeless. ANSWER. Wait on until the Lord look
          down. There is hope in Israel, concerning this thing. Men's extremity
          is God's opportunity, Isaiah 41:17, 18. "For the Lord shall judge his
          people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees their power
          is gone, and there is none shut up or left." Christ usually times his
          visits, so that he may be the more welcome when he comes. It is as
          with Hagar, who never saw the well, until she gave over the child for
          death. The darkest hour is readily before day-break. Amen.
