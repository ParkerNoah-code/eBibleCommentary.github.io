          MATTHEW 11:6 "Blessed is he who shall not be offended in me."

          <br />
          THESE words are the conclusion of our Lord's answer to the question
          upon which John's disciples came to him. John himself had no doubt of
          Christ's being the Messiah, for he was his forerunner to point him out
          to the world; he had baptized him, seen the Spirit descending, and had
          given testimony to him as the Lamb of God, John 1:29–35. But it seems
          his disciples were not so firm in the faith, and therefore he sends
          them to Christ to be from himself fully satisfied in that grand point.
          And indeed, nothing less than a divine power can silence the clamors
          of unbelief going about to rase foundations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our Lord gives them answer by referring them to his works compared
          with the word, Isaiah 35:4–6. and 61:1–3. The things which were
          prophesied concerning the Messiah, they heard and saw to be fulfilled
          in him, and therefore behooved to conclude him to be the Messiah.
          Divine power can cast such a beam of light over the works and Word of
          God, as will stare the strongest unbelief out of countenance, and make
          that raging lust fall down unable to create more trouble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But because his outward mean appearance was a veil, through which most
          of the world could not see, he declares them happy whose faith carries
          them over those things in him over which the graceless world, the
          despisers of the gospel, stumble and fall to their own utter
          destruction. "And blessed is he, whoever shall not be offended in me."
          In which words, there is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A fatal stumble in the way to happiness, which many of the hearers
          of the gospel make. They are offended in Christ. They stumble at him.
          Observe here, the object of their offence, Jesus Christ. It is at him
          the world is offended. The God that made and guides the world, the
          Savior that redeemed them, does not please the world. What wonder then
          that others cannot do it. There is something in the mystery of Christ,
          with which the unbeliever will always be finding fault. The Jews were
          offended at the baseness of his life, and in this the disciples of
          John seem to have joined them. The Gentiles were offended at the
          ignominy of his death. Some at one thing, some at another, and every
          unbeliever at something in him. This is surely a great mistake in
          them. Jesus Christ is holy, and there is nothing in him to give
          offence. The world is unholy, and takes offence at him. He is the
          brightness of his Father's glory: and they like owls and bats are
          blinded at the shining sun, and therefore carefully keep at a distance
          from him. They are offended. In the Greek, scandalized. The word
          scandal, in a natural sense, signifies,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            1. Some obstacle in one's way, by which he is stopped in his
          passage; particularly a sharp stake, which soldiers put in the field
          in time of war, to wound the feet and legs of the enemy that were to
          follow them that way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            2. A stone or block in the way, over which men are apt to fall. A
          trap or snare to catch beasts. This shows what a dreadful sin, and
          soul destroying evil, an offence given is; and withal, what a soul
          ruining the taking offence is, and the stumbling over real stumbling
          blocks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now the blind world by reason of their own corruption, are thus
          offended or scandalized in Christ. "And he shall be for a sanctuary;
          but for a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, to both the
          houses of Israel; for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of
          Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,
          and be snared, and be taken." He is the way to the Father, but they
          see something in him which they cannot digest, and therefore they
          stop, or go off the way. They stumble at him, looking for matters in
          him, according to their carnal wish, they are disappointed, and they
          cannot get over that. Thus eventually, he is a trap and a snare to
          them, by which their ruin is more secured than ever. Their disease
          gathers strength from the remedy abused.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In the text there is the happiness of those who escape this fatal
          stumble. He who is not offended in Christ, who sees nothing in Christ
          that offends him, nothing in him to turn him away from him, nor to
          stop his going forward to him, and to the Father through him; he is a
          happy man, blessed here and shall be blessed hereafter. The party is
          described negatively, to show us that there can be no neutrality among
          the hearers of the gospel. He who is not offended in Christ is one
          that is well pleased with him, with everything in him, or about him;
          and he who is not so is offended in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine. Stumbling at someone thing or another in Christ abounds so
          much in the world that they are happy persons who are preserved from
          falling along with the rest. In prosecuting this subject, I shall
          show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. What it is to stumble at Christ and be offended in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. That stumbling at Christ abounds very much in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. That they are happy indeed who are kept from being offended in
          him. And then add some improvement.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show what it is to stumble at Christ, and be offended in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is a very awful matter. For a man to die of his disease, when he
          might have been cured, is sad; but it is a double death for one to
          destroy himself by the abuse of a remedy prescribed that would have
          cured him infallibly. It has reference to four things in the general.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To the grand device of salvation through Jesus Christ, laid in the
          infinite wisdom of God, and fixed by the divine counsel. This is the
          foundation on which the Father has laid the weight of the elect's
          salvation, and on which he requires all to lay their weight for
          eternity. And at this the unbelieving world ever stumbles, and their
          hearts can never fall in with it. We preach, says the apostle, Christ
          crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks
          foolishness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To the offer of Christ made in the gospel. There he is offered to
          sinners, to be the Captain of their salvation. To be the sinner's
          head, Lord, and husband. To be their Prophet, Priest, and King, their
          all and instead of all. But sinners love not the offer, they stumble
          at his offices; there is something in them at which they perpetually
          stand, and so they cannot come forward. You will not, says he, come
          unto me that you might have life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To the making use of Christ for all the purposes for which the
          Father has given him. Here they stand again. They are obstinate
          patients that will not receive the remedy, though they should die of
          their disease. If their own way will do with them, good and well; but
          as for the Lord's way they are offended at it, and cannot fall in with
          it. "But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has
          not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they
          sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for
          they stumbled at that stumbling stone."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. To the practical understanding of sinners. They ever form a wrong
          judgment of Christ, and nothing less than overpowering grace will
          rectify their apprehensions of him. They still say what is your
          beloved more than another beloved, O you fairest among women? What is
          your beloved more than another beloved, that you do so charge us? It
          is true they may please themselves and others, with fine speculations
          about Christ. If they be Ministers they may preach him, or professors
          may talk of him and recommend him to others. But in this they are like
          the mountebank, who recommends his drugs to others, yet perhaps in the
          meantime he himself abhors them and makes no use of them. I find no
          fault in him, says Pilate, yet he condemned him. So the unrenewed
          world constantly stumble in their views of Christ with respect to
          practice. "If they knew the gift of God, and who Christ is, they would
          ask of him and he would give them living water." "They that know your
          name will put their trust in you; for you Lord have not forsaken them
          that seek you." This stumbling at Christ, lies in these four things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The blind soul ever finds some fault in the mystery of Christ.
          There is always something in or about Christ, that disgusts the
          sinner, is quite disagreeable and shocking to him. The Son of God is
          not a match suitable to those, whose minds are not savingly
          enlightened. "To them he has no form nor loveliness, and when they see
          him, there is no beauty that they should desire him." Though his
          Father is well pleased with him, and he has the hearts and praises of
          all the saints, yet they are not pleased with him. If they would speak
          their minds, they would tell you, they see not how they could be happy
          in him for all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That which disgusts them, is what they cannot get over. There is
          something not to be found in him, which they cannot want, and
          something in him which they cannot endure. And by no are can they
          reconcile their hearts to it. It is with many as with the young man,
          "who was sad at what Jesus said to him, and went away grieved: for he
          had great possessions." Many a time they are aiming at the bargain
          between Christ and their souls, but they can never finish it. For
          there is always one thing that stands between Christ and them. His
          holiness will not allow him to yield it to them, and their corruption
          will not allow them to yield it to him. And so in the end the soul
          parts with Christ, perhaps with grief and tears, because it will do
          their way, and they cannot do otherwise, Mark 10:21, 22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because they cannot get over that one thing, it keeps Christ and
          the soul asunder effectually. Could the Jews have got over the offence
          of the mean appearance of Christ, and reconciled it to their own
          notion of the Messiah, they would have been fond of him, as they were
          while he was not come. "He was then the Lord whom they sought." But
          the bargain must needs be marred, where the parties cannot agree. And
          there can be no uniting with Christ by faith, while there is any one
          objection against him reigning in the heart. We must be all his, or
          none at all. We must receive whole Christ, or want him altogether.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, This keeping Christ and the soul asunder, the soul is at
          length thereby ruined, and brought into a worse case, than if Christ
          had never come in the way. "If I had not come, says he, and spoken
          unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their
          sin." For then the remedy for sin is despised, and while that
          continues the disease must needs be desperate. And none can think that
          their debt will be so severely exacted as those who have refused a
          cautioner. And as the sourest vinegar comes of the most generous wine,
          so the vengeance that comes on the despisers of the gospel will be the
          most terrible. No fire will burn so keenly, as that which comes from
          the altar. We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show that stumbling at Christ abounds very much in the world.
          Let us view the heaps upon heaps that are lying broken, snared and
          taken.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Let us take a view of those that are lying rotting above the ground
          in open profanity; they are kept away from Christ, even by the very
          far off sight of him and his way. "There are many at this day, who
          cry, let us break their bands asunder and cast their cords from us. We
          will not have this man to reign over us." These are the profane
          persons, and such as will not take on so much as a form of godliness.
          They are terrified at the holiness of his way, and therefore they run
          far from him. They keep at such a distance from him, they will not set
          their foot on the holy ground. They are so far from covenanting with
          God, that it is evident, they will engage to be anything sooner than
          to be the Lord's. Our holy Redeemer does not please these people more
          than a palace would please swine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let us take a view of those who are lying dead upon their murdered
          convictions. Our Lord has taken some persons in hand to cure them, and
          by the Spirit of conviction, he has begun to let blood of the heart
          vein of their beloved lusts. But the pain of this operation has made
          them disagree with the Physician, start up and break the lancet, and
          stifle their convictions. And now their wound is whole, their
          convictions are gone, and their conscience, which was so uneasy
          before, is now as dead as stone. Go where they please, they are not
          troubled. Darts are as stubble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Those that are lying broken and pining away, having stumbled over
          the cross of Christ. Like the stony ground hearers, "not having root
          in themselves but endures for a while; for when tribulation or
          persecution arises because of the word, by and by they are offended."
          Many have made a good appearance in a fair day, when in the time of a
          storm, have soon turned their backs upon Christ. It is now long since
          the times of persecution, and yet there is no doubt, but the wounds
          then received are lasting with many to this day. But I fear that
          private crosses in the time of the Church's peace, have made greater
          havoc in the case of many professors, than ever public ones did. And
          O! but it is much to wait upon the Lord, in all the turns of
          providence, which may be in our lots and not to be offended in the
          great manager of all. They may follow Christ far, time and
          circumstances may at length cause to draw back.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Those that are fallen away from the lusts of Christ's consolation,
          to the fulsome breasts of the world and their own lusts. In every age
          there are many like the mixed multitude that came out of Egypt, who
          for a time kept up in the wilderness, but afterwards lost hopes of
          Canaan, and fell a "lusting, and even the children of Israel also wept
          again, and said, who shall give us flesh to eat?" We remember the fish
          which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and
          the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick. Such persons keep steady
          and flourishing a while, so long as religion is new to them. But the
          grace which they receive being awakening only, and not changing, and
          their souls never truly uniting with Christ; their comfort and
          satisfaction from that quarter dry up, when once the novelty is away:
          so they do not find that in Christ which they expected, and therefore
          they are offended, and even fall away to their former courses, having
          entirely lost their taste and relish for spiritual things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, Look at those whose soul exercises have issued in putting
          their case in the hands of a Physician of no value. There are many who
          being awakened by a spirit of conviction, and are really exercised
          about their souls' condition, put their case to Christ for healing.
          But not being able or willing to wait his time, until the wound be
          sufficiently searched, but being for peace at any rate, they are
          offended in him, and so put themselves in the hand of the law that
          wounded them. Thus they make themselves whole, not by the believing
          application of the blood of Christ, but by their prayers, tears, and
          external reformation. And so they settle down upon their lees farther
          from Christ than ever. It now remains,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To show that they are happy indeed who are kept from being
          offended in him. What this attainment is, you may know from what is
          here said of it. It consists in this. This happy soul is well pleased
          with Christ, and has no objections against him. The soul says of him,
          "His mouth is most sweet; yes, he is altogether lovely." The heart of
          this person now corresponds in all respects to the covenant of peace,
          and says that it is well ordered in all things and sure. There is
          nothing in the mystery of Christ which they desire to have out, and
          there is nothing out which they desire to have in it. They are pleased
          with the gospel offer, they love Christ in his person, natures,
          offices, relations, all that is in him or about him is welcome to
          them. And are all such blessed ones? They are. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Their eyes are opened to see that superlative glory in Christ, that
          all the unbelieving world cannot discover. And therefore I may say,
          Blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. And
          indeed in this case the hidden glory of the Mediator is taken up,
          darkening all created excellency. Whereas the most piercing eyes of
          nature can never see through the veil. "He was in the world, and the
          world was made by him, and the world knew him not." But they who are
          pleased with him can say, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the
          only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Their hearts are new formed, cast into a new mold, otherwise they
          could never be pleased with him. "But as many as received him, to them
          gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them who believe on
          his name: which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
          nor of the will of man, but of God." Adam's covenant is engraved in
          our nature, and the way of believing is the very reverse of nature's
          way. "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about
          to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the
          righteousness of God." Sin is our natural element, and though it be
          our disease, yet we naturally love it, and cannot but love it so as to
          loathe the physician. If then the heart be pleased with Christ, it is
          turned and changed, and made willing in a day of power. The natural
          enmity is cured, and the heart of stone is become a heart of flesh.

          3. That soul cannot fail to embrace Christ, to receive him by faith
          and unite with him. For to be well pleased with Christ, is in effect
          to say amen to the great bargain. And the cause is won when the sinner
          is pleased with the gospel offer. Now he is the person, "who having
          found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and
          bought it."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Hence all the blessings of the covenant fall to the share of
          him who is well pleased with Christ, as to his having a right to them,
          as a believer through Jesus Christ.

          1. Be convinced then of this bias of the heart, this disposition of
          the soul to stumble at Jesus Christ. O, says the poor fool, would
          anything in Jesus Christ offend me? Pleased with Christ! who would not
          be well pleased with him? Alas! you know not what spirits you are of!
          you are little acquainted with the natural enmity of your souls
          against the Lord, and particularly with that corruption of your
          nature, by which it is strongly averse to the gospel plan of
          salvation. If it be not so, how can it be an evidence of the grace of
          God in the text, to be well pleased with him. "While Christ crucified
          is to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness, he is
          to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of
          God, and the wisdom of God. For we are the circumcision, which worship
          God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
          in the flesh."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I tell you many are pleased with Christ, as Jacob was with Leah, while
          he thought she had been Rachel. It is a mistaken Christ whom they
          love, even as sure as they love their lusts. No man can serve two
          masters. And if a new light would spring up in their dark hearts, they
          would see it to be so. Many love Christ very well, to be a rest to
          their consciences, while they can get the world and their lusts to be
          a rest to their hearts. And thus they can do very well between the
          two. But take away these from them, and their hearts can rest no more
          than a fish drawn out of the water until it be in it again. Their
          souls can never truly say as the Psalmist, "Whom have I in Heaven but
          you, and there is none upon earth that I desire besides you." Now was
          ever Christ a covering for the eyes to them. Nor did they ever find
          such sweetness in Christ as they have in following their lusts.

          2. I exhort one and all of you, that have a mind for any share of
          eternal happiness, and particularly communicants, that you would try
          yourselves this night, whether you be well pleased with Christ or not;
          that so if there be anything which you have stumbled at in Christ in
          time past, you would now come over it, as ever you would see the face
          of God in mercy, and would not have it part between Christ and you.
          And for this purpose let your consciences put the following questions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Is there anything in Christ's salvation offered in the gospel that
          offends you? Salvation from the wrath of God, is but the half of
          Christ's salvation. I doubt not but you are pleased with this part of
          it. But are you pleased with the part which is salvation from sin? "He
          saves his people from their sins?" What say you, sinner? Christ is
          saying to you, will you be made whole? Will you be made clean?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Will you be made content, that the Physician not only remove death,
          but the disease also? Not only take away the guilt, but break the
          power, and also at last destroy the very existence of sin in you? Will
          you be content to hold out the right eye to him that he may pluck it
          out, and the offending right hand that he may cut it off? If not, you
          are offended in Christ, his salvation does not please you. But if you
          come forward to him, he is pleased and you are welcome.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Is there anything in Christ's offices that offends you? Anything in
          his prophetic office that offends? Our Lord has the Father's
          commission to guide poor sinners through the wilderness of this world
          to Immanuel's land. "He has given him to be a witness unto the people,
          a leader and commander to the people." He leads them by his word and
          Spirit, for it is not his will that they be trusted with the guiding
          of themselves. What think you of this commission. Will you take Christ
          this day for your guide forever, or will you hold the reins still in
          your own hands, though you should lead yourselves to destruction? Will
          you then renounce your own wisdom, and take him for your sole oracle?
          I am sure you may know that your willfulness has many a time shaken
          off this yoke. What say you of it now? If you have nothing to object
          against our Lord's command as a prophet, then I hope you will endeavor
          to shake off self-conceit, and lean no more to your own understanding.
          You will also resolve not to be such strangers as you have been, to
          seeking and depending on the Lord's light, in all matter of sin and
          duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You will allow the light of the Lord's word freely to turn you from
          your prejudices and preconceived opinions. And that a little child
          shall lead you, if he can but hold out the Lord's word, pointing you
          the way. You will prize his ordinances, and not make the Lord's work a
          sinking burden to the messenger, by despising his message. Seeing the
          ministry of the word is one thing by which Christ executes his
          peophetical office, therefore, "He says, he who hears you, hears me,
          and he who despises you, despises me." Again,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Is there anything in his priestly office that offends you? Man is
          fallen. Justice is offended. God's device for the salvation of sinners
          is, that the Redeemer Christ be both priest and sacrifice, that he
          build the fallen temple of the Lord, and bear the glory, being the
          alone way to the Father. Will you venture your salvation on this
          foundation, renounce your own righteousness, all your doings and
          sufferings, and lay the whole weight of your acceptance with God on
          the merits of Christ's blood? and take him for your only intercessor
          and way to the Father. If you have nothing to object; here then you
          will humbly and heartily acknowledge, that you deserve nothing at
          God's hand, but that he would be just, if he should cast you off
          forever. You will confess that you have nothing to recommend you to
          God, and dare trust nothing to anything that is yours: and that if you
          be received of the Lord, there is nothing in or about you to engage
          him to you. You will look for the acceptance of your duties, not from
          any value in themselves, but through the merits of Christ. And that
          you will look for the acceptance of your persons and for all the
          favors from the Lord, only through the wounds of a Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Is there anything in his kingly office that offends you? He has
          got the kingdom by his Father's gift, and it is his Father's decree
          that he rule sinners according to his own will and pleasure, and his
          holy laws? Are you content with this? Will you give up yourselves to
          him without reserve? Alas! will you say the armies of Hell in my
          breast are not so easily dispossessed. True, but I hope you are not so
          closely blocked up, but there may be intelligence got between Zion's
          King and you; and though you cannot subdue the rebels, will you be
          content to make an offer of the kingdom to him over your whole man? If
          so, then you will renounce and heartily give up with all your lusts
          without exception of one. You will also look on Jesus Christ as your
          head of influences, for sanctification; and go no more out against
          temptations and to duties in your own strength, but in his strength
          who is mighty in battle. The long debate that has been between
          providence and you, who should carve out your lot in the world, will
          be at an end. You will say, "He shall choose our inheritance for us,
          the excellency of Jacob whom he loved."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Is there anything in his covenant that offends you? Is there
          anything in it that is not well ordered in your eyes? Does the taking
          up of the cross offend you? Or are you content to take him to follow
          him wherever he goes, and nothing shall part between him and you?
          Blessed is he, whoever is not offended in him. If nothing in Christ
          offends you, nothing in you will so far offend him, as to keep him at
          a distance from you. Nay if you be really offended and grieved at
          yourselves for that there is anything in you so apt to be offended in
          Christ, it shall not mar your communion with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But, O brethren, search your hearts this night, for they are
          deceitful, and put yourselves to an impartial trial. And where you
          find your heart offended at Christ, put it into his own hand to remove
          the offence, and to reconcile the heart and gain it entirely to
          himself. Amen.
