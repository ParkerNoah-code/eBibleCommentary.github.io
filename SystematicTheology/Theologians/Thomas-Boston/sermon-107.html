        </p>
        <p align="justify">Thomas Boston, 1676–1732</p>
        <p align="justify"></p>
        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          2 Timothy 3:1, "This know also, that in the last days perilous times
          shall come."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IN these words we have three things.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The notification of an event as future; "perilous times shall
          come." Not that there are any times in themselves perilous, or unlucky
          days, as the superstitions imagine; but they are perilous in respect
          of the evil that is a going in them among men, verse 2, etc. The word
          properly signifies difficult; times wherein it will be hard for people
          to keep their feet, to know how to carry themselves, to keep out of
          danger, and keep a good conscience; and these are perilous times.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Of these it is said, they "shall come," [Gr. shall be on.] They will
          be on men, in the course of providence, to try what metal they are of;
          as darkness comes on after light, and adversity after prosperity, in
          their turn.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The time of that event; "in the last days." These are, in
          scripture-style, the days of the Messiah, the days of the gospel, even
          that whole period, according to Acts 2:17, "And it shall come to pass
          in the last days, (says God), I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
          flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young
          men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams." Hebrews
          1:1, 2, "God who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spoke in time
          past unto the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken
          unto us by his Son." It is an Old Testament expression, which sounds
          "the last of the days;" and days being used absolutely, these days are
          the days of the world, running from the creation to the end. Now, the
          days of the gospel are the last part of these days, the concluding
          period of time. In these last days are several particular periods; the
          first of which was the last time of the Jewish state, beginning from
          the time of our Savior, to the destruction of Jerusalem; and more
          periods followed, and some are yet to come; but from the time of our
          Savior to the end of the world, is "the last days."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The notice to be taken of that event; "This know also;" rather,
          "Now know this;" be informed of this, consider it duly, and lay it to
          heart, that being forewarned, you may be armed against the "perilous
          times."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. As the days of the gospel are the last days, so men should
          know there are in the course of providence difficult and perilous
          times that come on in these days.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, we shall consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. The days of the gospel as the last days.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The difficult and perilous times that come on in gospel-days.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. We shall consider "the days of the gospel as the last days." And so
          we may take them up in a threefold view.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As the last days of the world, the latter end of time. With
          relation to them that oath is made; Revelation 10:6, "That there
          should be time no longer." The world has lasted long now, it most have
          an end; and the last part of its time is began, and far on. The
          morning and forenoon of the world are over; it is afternoon with it
          now, and drawing toward the evening.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. As the days of the last dispensation of grace towards the world,
          with which God's dealing with sinners for reconciliation shall be
          closed; according to Revelation 10:7, "In the days of the voice of the
          seventh angel, the mystery of God shall be finished." There have been
          three dispensations of grace in the world; the Patriarchal
          dispensation in the first days; the Mosaic dispensation in the middle
          days; and now the Christian dispensation in the last days. The first
          two are now off the stage, and shall never come on again; the third
          now is; and after it there shall never be another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. As the best days of the world in respect of the greatest advantages
          attending them. The last works of God are always the greatest, as you
          may see in the account of the creation; Genesis 1; so the
          circumstances of the world to come, are greater than those of this.
          The gospel-dispensation far excels the other two, in clearness,
          extensiveness, and efficacy, through a larger measure of the Spirit.
          One may say, Have there not been perilous times in all the days?
          Noah's times in the first; the Egyptian bondage, Babylonish captivity,
          Antiochus's persecution, etc., in the middle days; what wonder there
          be so in the last days? So indeed we say now; but consider the Old
          Testament prophecies of the last days, and the big expectations that
          behooved to be raised thereupon; and you will see need for this
          caution, frequent among the apostles, that even in the "last days,"
          for as great days as they were to be, there were "perilous times to be
          on."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE of this point.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Take heed how you improve the gospel. Delay not to comply with the
          call thereof; for before long an account will be required of it. The
          days of it are the last days of the world, wherein time comes to an
          end, and the world most make their account for the entertainment they
          have given it. Behold he comes "from Heaven, with his mighty angels,
          in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that
          obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;" 2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You must be saved by falling in with the gospel call and method of
          salvation, or else perish; for it is the last dispensation of grace.
          It is God's last method with a sinful lost world; after which they are
          not to expect a new one. It is the last ship going off for Immanuel's
          land; if you slight it, you will have no more opportunity forever;
          Hebrews 10:26, "For if we sin willfully after that we have received
          the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The contempt of the gospel is the most dangerous adventure ever the
          world made, and will have the most terrible issue; gospel-days being
          the last and best; and the better are the days, the contempt will be
          the more dangerous. The contempt of the Patriarchal dispensation was
          punished by the flood; of the Mosaic, by the Babylonish captivity, and
          other heavy plagues; 2 Chronicles 36:21 How terrible must the
          punishment be of the contempt of the gospel dispensation? The
          destruction of Jerusalem was the first swatch of it, the conflagration
          of the world will be the issue.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, There may be great and good things in days which yet are
          dangerous days; "in the last days shall be perilous times." The best
          days that ever Judea saw, were in the days that went before the
          destruction of Jerusalem; the Spirit was poured out in such a measure
          as never took place before nor since; Acts 2:17, forfeited; but there
          came after a pouring out of "wrath to the uttermost;" 1 Thessalonians
          2:16. In these days of ours there are great things not to be
          overlooked. Learning, and the art of civil management in improving of
          ground and manufactures, are carried to a pitch they were not at
          before; which sometimes brings in mind the case of the Cainites, among
          whom arts flourished while piety went to wreck, as you may read,
          Genesis 4:20–22. Nay there are good things done in these our days,
          great good things, the like to which were never done before in our
          nation; particularly the erecting of schools for propagating Christian
          knowledge in the highlands and islands, the erecting of the Infirmary
          in Edinburgh. Nay, some glorious gospel-truths have been in our days
          set in an uncommon light. And yet for all they are certainly most
          perilous days. Which brings me to consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The difficult and perilous times that come on in gospel-days. Even
          in the days of the gospel, in which sometimes there are sweet and
          glorious times, yet at other times there come difficult and perilous
          times.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We must inquire what makes these perilous times.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, An old controversy lying over untaken up. They that are in debt,
          are always in danger. The Jews were a bloody generation, from
          generation to generation they were murderers of their prophets; that
          was an old debt on the head of the generation in our Savior's time;
          Matthew 23:31, and made their time a perilous time, for it was like a
          train lying within their affections, which at last came to blow them
          up, verse 35. So good Josiah's days were perilous times, by reason of
          an old controversy laid in the days of Manasseh his grandfather; 2
          Kings 23:26.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our times are so, by reason of the iniquity of the late times, which
          is like that of Baal-peor, that brought "a plague on the congregation
          of the Lord: Joshua 22:17. The avowed breach of covenants made with
          God for reformation; the blood of the Lord's people shed in fields and
          scaffolds, for adhering to the oath of God; the sinning, confining,
          imprisoning, banishing of them, and other barbarous usage of them,
          whereby for many years these nations carried on a war with Heaven;
          these, I say, are an old debt lying on the head of Scotland, England,
          and Ireland, for which God will pursue them, and pursue so as it will
          appear to be both for principle and interest during the time it has
          Iain over. These things are forgotten, or laughed at now as what we
          have no concern in; a stone is rolled to the mouth of that sepulcher.
          But God will readily arise, if the stone were sealed, and they forgot
          quite and clean; 1 Thessalonians 5:3, "For when they shall say, Peace
          and safety: then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a
          woman with child; they shall not escape."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Error or corruption of principles spreading. This was foretold
          to happen in the latter days; 1 Timothy 4:1, "Now the Spirit speaks
          expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
          giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils." Then the
          fountains men drink at, are poisoned; the faith once delivered to the
          saints, is exchanged for strong delusions, to believe lies; and many
          are in hazard of following their pernicious ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are three dangerous engines of this kind that the gates of Hell
          are directing this day against the foundation of the church built on
          the rock.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. LEGALISM; An attempt against the grace of Christ, bringing in a
          scheme of religion that has no relation to Jesus Christ and his
          Spirit, putting virtue or a virtuous life in the room of Christ's
          righteousness for acceptance with God, and the exerting of our natural
          powers in room of the influences of his Spirit. By which means the
          corruption of nature, and the necessity of regeneration, are buried in
          deep silence; and living by faith, attending the Spirit's influences,
          and communion with God, are branded as enthusiasm; and desertion is
          accounted the product of a crazy imagination. Thus a refined
          Heathenism is palmed on us for Christianity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. ARIANISM; An attempt against the person of Christ, bringing in a
          Christ that is not of the Father's equal, not the most high God,
          independent, and self-existent; but an inferior God, an arbitrary,
          dependent being; thus striking at the foundation of our salvation,
          taking away the infinite dignity of his person, which gives the
          sufficient value to his sacrifice. And it is to be feared, that when
          Christ arises to vindicate his own glory, it will be found, that the
          Church of Scotland has not given sufficient testimony of their
          indignation against this blasphemy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. DEISM; An attempt against all revealed religion, casting off the
          whole gospel and Bible by the lump, with the whole way of salvation by
          Jesus Christ; leaving us nothing, but that there is a God, and that
          this God is to be served as our reason directs. Such a stroke was not
          given against Christianity in the time of Prelacy, no, not in the
          times of Popery. Scotland may, and shall say, Alas! for the union with
          England; we were going to ruin before, but we have run to ruin since
          that fatal time, as to our most valuable concerns.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Immoralities abounding. That this is the case in the last days,
          we may consult the text and context, "This know also, that in the last
          days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own
          selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to
          parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection,
          truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of
          those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures
          more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the
          power thereof." The opening of the sluice of impiety and wickedness,
          and the spreading and prevailing of scandalous practices, make
          perilous times.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If those make perilous times, ours are very perilous. I doubt if ever
          contempt of God, his Gospel, and all that is sacred, was ever at a
          greater height. The first table and second table are trampled on with
          a witness, so that we may say, Hosea 4:1–3, "Hear the word of the
          Lord, you children of Israel, for the Lord has a controversy with the
          inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor
          knowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and
          stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood touches
          blood. Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwells
          therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the
          birds of Heaven, yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
          God's worship is contemned and slighted, his name abased and
          blasphemed, and his Sabbaths profaned. Unfaithfulness prevails in all
          relations; murders, impurity, marriage-vows never more lightly
          treated, injustice and fraud in dealing, lying, covetousness, etc.
          What can be found among a people professing the name of Christ, to
          bring on wrath, that is not to be found in our land at this day?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here let us view the scandalous outbreakings among us. Many such we
          see, opening the mouths of enemies to blaspheme the way of God. But
          how few do we see truly humbled, but almost always more concerned for
          their own blasted honor and reputation, than for the honor of God! And
          unless it be in those things which by use require public satisfaction,
          people cannot endure to be touched or checked with their faults told
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many other things there are that make perilous times, and which make
          ours so; such as the hiding of the Lord's face, threatenings and
          symptoms of wrath; among which may be reckoned the terrible thunders
          by which so many were killed on the last day of July this year; the
          shock which the fruits of the earth endured in the harvest, though
          Providence seasonably interposed, yet in a way that gives occasion to
          sing of mercy and judgment; and the murrain that in some places has
          appeared among the cattle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But one thing deserves particular notice, as rendering our time
          perilous, namely, the church joining with the state in robbing the
          people of the Lord of their just right to choose their own ministers,
          and thrusting in ministers, on congregations violently, and over their
          bellies. This is a most ready way to fill the church with naughty men,
          to ruin religion, and quite mar the interest and success of the
          Gospel, which are already very low.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I might here show in what respects such times are perilous, that they
          are perilous to the present and succeeding generations, to their
          souls, and to their bodies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And how they come in the course of providence to fall out by its
          permission, namely, for proving and trying men; 1 Corinthians 11:19,
          "For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
          approved may be made manifest among you,"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But I will conclude, exhorting you therefore to know and lay to heart,
          that our times are perilous times, and therefore to bestir yourselves
          for your own safety, and be on your guard. Let the peril of the times
          cause you to join yourself to God in Christ, and keep near him; beware
          of worldly-mindedness, instability and wavering; pride and
          self-conceit, Revelation 7:3. Strive against the stream, if you would
          not be carried away with it.
