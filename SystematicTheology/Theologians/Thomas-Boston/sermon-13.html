    The Right Improvement of a Time of Sickness and Mortality</p>
<p align="justify">TWO sermons preached on a congregational fast-day, at 
    Ettrick, April 27, 1720, on occasion of the great sickness and mortality 
    then prevailing.</p>
<p align="justify">Psalm 90:12. "So teach us to number our days, that we may 
    apply our hearts unto wisdom."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>THE SERMON IN THE FORENOON</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">THIS text is a prayer suitable to the dispensation of 
    this day. While we stand and see so much sickness and mortality prevailing 
    among us, they have stout hearts indeed, who look not up to the Lord with 
    this or the like petition in their hearts, So teach us, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">This psalm was calculated for a dying time, being 
    supposed to be penned upon the occasion of that sentence passed in the 
    wilderness, Numbers 14:28, etc. concerning the death of those from twenty 
    years old and upward who came out of the land of Egypt, so as none of them 
    should enter Canaan, but Caleb and Joshua. It was penned, I say, by Moses, 
    who saw, in the space of forty years, six hundred thousand men swept off by 
    death, besides women and children.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three things insisted on in the body of this 
    psalm, and summed up together, verse 10, 11. A short life, a sure death, and 
    a severe judgment. And here is the use of them, O to consider these so as to 
    be wise for our souls, O for a sanctified use of the sad dispensation. In 
    the words there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A lesson desired to be learned,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The lesson itself, of counting or numbering of our 
    days; that is, of considering them duly and seriously, as he who tells 
    anything before him, looks to every one of the number, and makes a just 
    reckoning.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The teacher of whom only we can learn this is God 
    himself. It is a difficult lesson to learn to purpose. Many good counters, 
    who can dextrously count great sums, are quite out in the calculation of 
    their days, Luke 12:19, 20. There is a necessity of the teaching of the 
    Spirit, in order to learn this divine arithmetic.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The standard of proficiency in this lesson, That we 
    may apply our hearts unto wisdom; that is, that we learn it so as we apply 
    ourselves to serious godliness, which is the only wisdom: Hebrews that we 
    may bring in; a heart of wisdom, that is, a wise heart. We have naturally 
    light and foolish hearts; but he, and only he, learns this lesson well that 
    brings in a serious, religious, and wise heart, from the school of the word 
    and providence, where that lesson is taught. All under this standard are but 
    bunglers at the lesson, they have not yet learned it truly: though they can 
    talk of it, namely, the shortness and vanity of life, they are never a whit 
    the wiser for all that, in respect of their souls; they have not yet got it 
    by heart, but only by head; and therefore they are still the carnal, 
    careless men they were before.</p>
<p align="justify">The words being thus explained, I shall, as the subject 
    of this forenoon's discourse, observe the following doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. 'A time of mortality is a special call to all 
    rightly to number their days.'</p>
<p align="justify">Sin brought in mortality into the world, Genesis 2:17 
    compare chapter 5. And it has never gone out of it since; at all times some 
    are here and there stepping off: but there are some times by way of eminency 
    to be called 'times of mortality,' as that in the wilderness, and as now 
    among us in this land. This has a special call.</p>
<p align="justify">Here I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What it is to number our days.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That a time of mortality is a special call to this 
    work.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show what it is to number our days. It 
    imports,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Our days had a beginning, and we must reflect on that, 
    Psalm 22:9. Everything that is numbered must have a beginning; and therefore 
    God's duration is not liable to numbering. But we may goon perceive our 
    beginning to be in the world; and thence learn and observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That it is by divine appointment, and not by 
    necessity of our nature, that we continue to be. The latter is proper to God 
    only; by the former, angels and men, and all creatures, are continued in 
    being. For he who once had no being, can never claim a natural necessity of 
    continuing to be.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That every moment of our life hangs on the divine 
    will and pleasure, Revelation 4 ult. There is no necessary connection 
    between your living this moment and living the next. The only bond between 
    them is God's word of appointment, Hebrews 1:3. Loose that, and remove it, 
    our life goes, and our eyes shall never see the next moment. No food, no 
    physic, can prevent it, Matthew 4:4. There is no outliving that word, Psalm 
    90:3. 'You turn man to destruction; and say, Return, you children of men,' 
    so much as for one moment.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That we must go the way of all flesh; for many of 
    those we found in the world at our coming into it, are now gone, Zechariah 
    1:5. This world is always like a fair near the height, where some are coming 
    in, others going out, and those within in confusion, Ecclesiastes 1:4. I 
    doubt not but there may be some in this house this day, who, if they will 
    consider, shall not find one of all those that filled it at their first 
    coming into it. But these are gone, and others have come into the room of 
    them all. And shall not others reckon so of us in a little time?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Our days will have an end, and we must seriously 
    consider that. Hence says the Psalmist, Psalm 39:4. 'Lord, make me to know 
    mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is.' Every thing that is 
    numerable has an end; and therefore eternity cannot be numbered, since it 
    has no end. But we may soon come to the end of our count, when we are 
    counting our days; and thence may learn and observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That the shored tree will be cut down at length. 'I 
    know that you will bring me to death,' says Job, 'and to the house appointed 
    for all living,' Job 30:23. When we were first planted in this world, the 
    axe was laid down at the root of the tree, and we have grown up beside it. 
    There is never a pain nor stitch, but it is a stroke of that axe, a pledge 
    of a greater. Sometimes it has almost struck through, but in a little time 
    it will go through altogether. So that man shall lie down, and not rise 
    until the heavens be no more.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We will need nothing for this life before long. Dip 
    not so deep in the cares of this world as most do, to the ruin of their 
    souls. Many have been anxious to provide for the day which they never saw, 
    as the rich man in the parable did, Luke 12:17–20. The clods of earth will 
    serve for back and belly before long, and we will have no portion in what is 
    done under the sun; others will possess the houses, land, etc. which we now 
    occupy.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) See now how you will begin eternity. It will begin 
    with us when our days are come to an end; and as we begin it, so we will 
    continue in it, Hebrews 9:27. Our state now is alterable, but then it is 
    unalterable forever. Therefore now or never let us secure a happy eternity. 
    Learn your duty from the unjust steward, the serious consideration of which 
    I recommend to you, Luke 14:3–8.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Working time for eternity will not last. It closes 
    with the end of our days: Therefore 'whatever your hand finds to do, do it 
    with your might: for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom 
    in the grave, where you go,' Ecclesiastes 9:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Use. Be not idle spectators of the dispensation of this 
    day. Number your days, so as you may apply your hearts unto wisdom. If you 
    will not take warning to prepare for eternity, by the removal of others, 
    take heed lest God make you a warning to others. Let the aged and young hear 
    the voice of the rod, and seriously improve it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Our days are few, and we must consider, that they are 
    the number of a man, they may be counted. There are some things not 
    innumerable in themselves, yet cannot be numbered for their multitude. But 
    there is no such multitude of the days of our life.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Consider the counters the scripture affords us to 
    count our days by. A web, Isaiah 38; it is such a web as one is still 
    working at without intermission, and therefore will soon be cut out—grass, 
    and a flower soon withered, Isaiah 40:6, 7;—green at morn, and cut down at 
    night, Psalm 90:6—a vapor that vanishes away, frail, uncertain, and of short 
    continuance, Jam. 4:14—smoke, Psalm 102:3—a wind, a blast, or puff, Job 
    7:7—a sleep, Psalm 90:5—a dream, Job 20:8—a hand-breadth, Psalm 
    39:5—nothing, ibid. compare Ecclesiastes 3:2. Count with these counters, and 
    the reckoning will be very small, which the scripture also has cast up to 
    our hands.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Consider the scripture-reckoning of man's life. The 
    highest reckoning is by years, now brought down to a few scores, Psalm 
    90:10. Nay, as we count the age of infants by months, so is man's age 
    reckoned, Job 19:5. As if months were too big a word, it is brought down to 
    days, and a few days, Job 14:1; yes, to one day, wherein there is but a 
    morning, noon, and evening, Job 14:6; and yet lower, to an hour, 1 John 
    2:18; yes, to a moment, that is past before one is aware, 2 Corinthians 
    5:17. Proverbs 12:19. So the sum of our days is very small.</p>
<p align="justify">From both you may find that our days are few; and thence 
    learn and observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is no safe counting to count many years to come, 
    whatever you be, lest you be out in your account, as the rich man was, Luke 
    12:19, 20. Many whose youth and strength seemed to give them ground for 
    counting so, have been forced to see their mistake, and count again, little 
    to their comfort, death coming before it was looked for.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Our days will soon be at an end. We will quickly be 
    over our hand-breadth. They fly like a shadow, Job 14:2. And though a 
    weaver's shuttle is very swift, in going from one side of the web to the 
    other, our days are swifter than it is, Job 7:6. See what Job says, chapter 
    9:25, 26. 'Now my days are swifter than a post; they flee away, they see no 
    good. They are passed away as the swift ships; as the eagle that hastens to 
    the prey.'</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) We have no time to be idle. Our work for eternity is 
    great, for it is long, and our time is short. They who have much work, 
    little time to do it in, little strength to do it with, and much opposition 
    to wrestle against, had need to lose no time, John 9:4. The shadows of the 
    evening are stretched out; we have made but little way; let us therefore 
    mend our pace.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, We must make the considering of our days, a 
    serious business. The counting of them to purpose will not do otherwise. It 
    deserves it, for eternity lies upon it; a mistake in that may be fatal; and 
    we are very ready to miscount our days. And,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Make it a work by itself. If one have but a few 
    threads to count, they will let other work alone until that be done; for it 
    is of that nature that it will not mix with other pieces of work. Surely at 
    any time, and much more at this time, God calls us to take some particular 
    time for this work, Hag. 1:5.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Hold to it, until you have done it to purpose. 
    Counting is not a work to be done by fits and starts. If it be broken off, 
    readily all that is counted is lost, and one must just begin again, having 
    lost his count. Fleeting thoughts of the shortness and uncertainty of time 
    are to little purpose. The impression they make is soon worn off.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Dip into the business, and be not overly in it. One 
    thing that is counting will be loath to hear or answer a word spoken to him, 
    lest he miss his count. Satan and our ill hearts are apt to cast in 
    diversions to those employed in counting their days; and by that means many 
    times mar the work. But you must stop your ears, and mind your business.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I proceed to show, that a time of mortality is a 
    special call to this work.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It sets death and eternity in a particular manner 
    before the eyes of mortals, as appears from this psalm wherein our text 
    lies. It is a looking-glass wherein every one may see his own frailty; for 
    the strength of the hale is no more the strength of stones, nor their bones 
    brass, more than others whom death has cut down. What is the lot of one 
    mortal today, may be the lot of another tomorrow; and that calls to consider 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God, by laying his hand on some, speaks unto others, 
    as appears from what our Lord says, Luke 13:1 and downwards, and warns them. 
    And they that are wise will take warning, Micah 6:9. And it is a sad 
    evidence when people will not hear it. They look like those marked for 
    destruction, who, in the face of God's judgments going abroad in a place 
    still do wickedly, Isaiah 26:11.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is an evidence of the Lord's anger against a land 
    or country-side where it prevails, Amos 3:8. And not laying it to heart is a 
    contempt of God, that he will surely avenge, Psalm 28:5. It speaks God to be 
    risen up from his place to punish; and who knows who may fall before God's 
    sword, once drawn, be returned into its sheath?</p>
<p align="justify">Use. Let old and young comply with the call of God by the 
    present sickness and mortality: let every one be stirred up thereby so to 
    count their days, as they may apply their hearts unto wisdom. For motives, 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We will be most inexcusable, if after all these 
    warnings death find us unprovided. The dispensation of the day is such, that 
    no body needs to pretend to be surprised with death's coming to their own 
    door, since it is carrying off so many, both young and old.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a piece of that duty we owe to an angry God, as 
    we would not inflame his anger more against us, Psalm 28:5. Amos 3:8. It is 
    not true courage, but stupidity and obstinacy, not to be deeply affected 
    with the hand of God gone out against us. Let creatures despise, if they 
    will, the stroke of their fellow worms, but let them not despise the stroke 
    of God, Hebrews 12:5. It becomes saints of the highest pitch to fear God 
    smiting, Luke 12:4, 5.</p>
<p align="justify">3. This would be the way to get the stroke removed, or at 
    least to get it sanctified, Habakkuk 3:16. The design of Providence in the 
    stroke is to stir us up to this duty, and the answering of the call of the 
    rod bids fairest for the removal of it, Leviticus 26:41, 42. If not, the 
    venom will be taken out of it; and if one be taken away being fitted for it, 
    he will exchange this life for a better.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, If this be misimproved, it lays us open to a 
    worse, Amos 4:11, 12. In a land so fall of sin, so often threatened with 
    desolating strokes, and so often delivered, but nothing bettered by 
    deliverances, this stroke looks rather like the beginning than the end of 
    sorrows, rather like an earnest than the round sum, that might clear the 
    accounts between God and a sinful nation.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>THE SERMON IN THE AFTERNOON</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">WE are again met this day to humble ourselves under the 
    hand of God, gone out against the congregation and country-side, in great 
    sickness and mortality, and to deprecate the Lord's anger. I know no such 
    expedient in our case, nor anything that will bid so fair for the removal of 
    the stroke, as our coming up to the standard of proficiency in the lesson in 
    our text, which falls now to be spoken of, and which I shall cast into this 
    doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. 'The right and necessary improvement of a time 
    of bodily sickness and mortality, is to become wise for our souls.'</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord is putting particular persons and families among 
    us, yes, all of us, to the school of affliction, since the hand of God gone 
    out against some concerns all; and it is necessary we learn our lesson 
    aright, and become wise thereby.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing from this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is that wisdom we must learn thereby.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Condescend on some particulars of wisdom which such a 
    time calls us to apply our hearts to.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show, what is that wisdom we are to learn by a 
    time of bodily sickness and mortality. It is serious godliness, or true 
    religion. When one becomes seriously godly, leaving the way of sin, and 
    entering on the way of faith and holiness, then he has learned the lesson 
    that God is teaching us this day, Job 28 'Unto man he said, Behold the fear 
    of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil, is understanding.' 
    This is the only true wisdom; and they continue arrant fools who do not 
    arrive at it, whatever other wisdom they be masters of. This is the wisdom 
    taught at God's school of affliction, Hebrews 12:10. The voice of the rod 
    is, Be wise for your souls. That this is the true wisdom, appears in that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is practical wisdom, wisdom for regulating a man's 
    life in the way to happiness, Hosea 14 ult. How many are there accounted 
    wise, who betray their folly in quite shooting by the mark, in the way of 
    life they chose, Jeremiah 22:13–16. Surely that is wisdom which sets men in 
    the true way to happiness, which is faith and holiness, Mark 16:16. Hebrews 
    12:14. What avail carnal worldly wit, the profound speculations of natural 
    men in the learned sciences, and the dry and sapless notions of religion in 
    formal professors? All these are but laborious trifling, and making a noise, 
    doing nothing, while they never make them better men, though more knowing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is wisdom for one's self, Proverbs 9:12. There is a 
    set of men, whose wisdom is noted to be for others, but not for themselves, 
    resembled by boatmen, who ferry others over, but, during the whole time of 
    their rowing, have their eyes fixed on the place whence they came, and, 
    immediately after landing their passengers, return to where they set out. 
    Such is the wisdom of all ungodly men: their wisdom may profit other men's 
    souls or bodies; but, alas! it profits not themselves, 1 Corinthians 9 ult. 
    Matthew 6:19, 20. But this is the excellency of real godliness, that 'it 
    gives life to them that have it,' Ecclesiastes 7:12. It casts the soul into 
    the mold of truth, sanctifies the heart and life in conformity to the divine 
    nature and will; and so perfects human nature, raising up a glorious fabric 
    out of the ruins in which it was laid by the fall.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is wisdom for one's latter end, Deuteronomy 32:29. 
    The fool in the gospel had wit enough to provide for many years' life. But 
    here lay his folly, he had nothing provided for his latter end, for a dying 
    hour, Luke 12:20. Many such fools are among us. It was one of the dying 
    expressions of a learned man of the last age (Grotius), Ah! vitam perdidi, 
    operose nihil agendo.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is wisdom for the better part, Luke 10:41, 42. The 
    wisdom of the world is but for the baser part of man, the body; it makes him 
    useful in business and civil conversation. But this reaches only the 
    outworks, while in the mean time the soul's concerns lie by neglected. But 
    this wisdom advances the life and interests of the soul, insures one's title 
    to Heaven, and sets him on the way to eternal happiness, Proverbs 8:35.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, It is wisdom for the better world, Hebrews 
    11:14, 16. Our projects for this world, as to ourselves, must die with 
    ourselves, Psalm 146:4 but they who are wise for that better world, by being 
    religious indeed, will find their measures wisely laid in time, to take and 
    have their effect happily in eternity, Revelation 14:13. What they now sow, 
    they shall then joyfully reap.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I proceed to condescend on some particulars of 
    wisdom which such a time calls us to apply our hearts to.</p>
<p align="justify">1. To inquire seriously into the causes of the Lord's 
    controversy with us, Job 10:2. When God's hand is stretched out, it will be 
    our wisdom to search wherefore it is so, Lamentations 3:39. Surely there is 
    a cause; he does not smite without good reason: and unless our eyes see it, 
    our hearts cannot rue it.</p>
<p align="justify">God has a controversy with the congregation and 
    country-side; it were good we could lay it to heart. Two things seem to have 
    the main hand in it.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Abuse and misimprovement of spiritual mercies and 
    privileges. Thus the Lord threatened the Old-Testament church, Deuteronomy 
    28:58, 59. 'If you will not observe to do all the words of this law, that 
    are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, 
    The Lord Your God; then the Lord will make your plagues wonderful, and the 
    plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance and sore 
    sicknesses, and of long continuance.' This brought a sore sickness upon the 
    church of Corinth, 1 Corinthians 11:30. The noted divisions, and deserting 
    of ordinances, in the country, are the judgment and the sin of the corner, 
    whereby contempt is poured on precious gospel-ordinances, the success of the 
    gospel marred by so many hindrances laid in the way of souls getting good of 
    it; and thus gnats are strained at, and camels swallowed down, in respect of 
    the deep-dyed guilt in what it does to hinder the spiritual good of 
    perishing souls. Men will not see it, but they shall see. And alas! how 
    evident is our unfruitfulness under means of grace? How few are bettered now 
    by a preached gospel? God's word is slighted, and ineffectual for our 
    reformation, his holy name is profaned, his Sabbaths are violated, 
    sacraments are neglected by some, and profaned by others with their unholy 
    and untender lives. What wonder that for this cause 'many are weak and 
    sickly among us, and many sleep?' 1 Corinthians 11:30. Warnings and reproofs 
    prevail not, conviction is rare, and conversion is more rare. Many have not 
    a form of godliness left them; and few have anything but a form of it. Many 
    are crying out against the sins of others, while the visible blots in their 
    own lives do not make them smite on their own breasts and say 'What have I 
    done!' God grant that the contempt and abuse of gospel-privileges bring not 
    a removal of the kingdom of God from us.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Abuse and misimprovement of temporal mercies. It is 
    observable, that with the promise of plenty to the church, using their 
    plenty in a holy becoming manner, the promise of the taking away of sickness 
    is joined, Exodus 23:25. Deuteronomy 7:12–14. This says that God punishes 
    abuse of plenty with sickness. God has given the country plenteous years; 
    and what has been the issue of it, but contempt of God and the rules of 
    righteousness, increase of pride and vanity, and drunkenness, with an 
    unordinary abuse of that fiery liquor, never ordained for ordinary drinking; 
    masters breaking the yoke, undermining and undergoing one another through 
    the country; servants bursting all bonds, and turned quite unmanageable and 
    undutiful? The last year, a little before this time, I gave warning from the 
    Lord's word against these things particularly: but I think there was never 
    more of them in my time, than followed upon the back of it. No wonder then, 
    that God has shaped us out another piece of work this year.</p>
<p align="justify">Let these things be weighed in an even balance, as in the 
    sight of God, by us all. And let particular persons and families, especially 
    those who have been or are under the rod, inquire into the causes of God's 
    quarrel with them, that they may see why the Lord contends.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To be humbled under the causes of the Lord's anger, 
    and to turn to a smiting God in Christ. This would be our wisdom, Leviticus 
    26:41, 42. Micah 6:9. It is not time to stand in the way of sinners, when 
    God is risen up to plead; it is high time to fall down before him in 
    humiliation, and to fall off from God-provoking courses by reformation. Hear 
    the voice of the rod. It is crying two things loudly this day.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Improve a season of the gospel. Some sermons have of 
    late been the last to them that heard them. Some heard the sermon on the 
    Lord's day in health, that were in eternity before the next Sabbath. This 
    says, Hear you every day as if it were to be your last.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Improve temporal mercies, lest God be provoked to 
    take them from you. Health and strength, and other temporal conveniences, 
    are to be wisely managed, for you see we have no tack of them, Ecclesiastes 
    9:10.</p>
<p align="justify">3. To be upon your guard, and make sure for eternity, 
    while you live. Remember the parable of the wise and foolish builder, and 
    how apt you are to play the fool in these matters, while health and strength 
    last.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Beware you be not cheated out of your most valuable 
    interests, by a deceitful heart, a treacherous world, and a wily devil. 
    Satan goes about many a poor simple one, until they are tricked of their 
    souls, their part of Christ and Heaven, and all the happiness of another 
    world, Matthew 16:26. And wherefore do they part with them, but for the 
    gratifying of a lust, which is a practice more foolish than if one should 
    part with an estate for a childish toy. So did Esau. Wherefore be wise in 
    time.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Beware the best bargain slip not through your 
    fingers, while you are pursuing vanities, Proverbs 17:16. Alas! there are 
    not a few, who, being busied with vanities of this world, which pass away 
    with the using, miss the opportunity of making the treasure hidden in the 
    field of the gospel their own. Therefore be wise.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Beware of feeding yourselves with dreams and 
    fancies, where in there is no reality. There are many foolish virgins with 
    lamps without oil, and foolish builders on the sand. There are many whose 
    life is but one continued dream, wherein they judge aright of nothing, 
    neither God, Heaven, Hell, nor the world. So that their awakening cannot he 
    but terrible. But be you wise.</p>
<p align="justify">4. To prepare timeously for death and judgment, Matthew 
    24:44. It is certain that naturally we are quite out of case for that great 
    change: and, alas! we are naturally unwilling to think of it, or provide for 
    it. But necessity has no law. We must die; and we must either he provided 
    for death, or we are ruined: and if we be not timely provided, our candle 
    may he put out before our work be done.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Get habitual preparation for death, in a gracious 
    state, Romans 8:1. Be sure to get out of the state of nature into the state 
    of grace. And then come death when it will, it will but transport you into 
    the state of glory. And there are two things here to be secured.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Get your title to Heaven fixed. None will get 
    thither but those who have a right to it, Matthew 25:34. 2 Corinthians 5:1. 
    To others the door will be cast in their face. But, you may say, how may we 
    get a title to Heaven? Ans. Marry the Heir, and Heaven will he your dowry. 
    The everlasting covenant is offered to you in the gospel, God to be your God 
    in Christ, and Christ to be yours in all his offices. Therefore make a 
    solemn deliberate transaction with God this night, embracing Christ in the 
    covenant, and consenting to it, with an eye to death and eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Get a fitness for Heaven wrought in you, Colossians 
    1:12. For you cannot be meet for it, until your nature be changed. How may 
    we get that fitness? may you say. </p>
<p align="justify">Answer, Believe and embrace Jesus Christ, for his spirit 
    of sanctification, 1 Corinthians 1:30. There is a fullness of the Spirit in 
    him to be communicated, and faith must eye Christ for his sanctifying 
    Spirit. Put off the old man, and put on the new man: be new creatures, and 
    let old things pass away, and all things become new. In vain do men pretend 
    to faith without this, 2 Corinthians 5:17 and in vain will men look for 
    Heaven without it, John 3:3.</p>
<p align="justify">This is habitual preparation, which whoever have, if they 
    should be struck dead in a moment, or immediately seized with deliriousness, 
    and die raving, yet they are safe; 'for there is no condemnation to them 
    which are in Christ Jesus,' Romans 8:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Get actual preparation for death, in a gracious 
    frame for dying, that you may die comfortably.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Make speed with the work given you to do. Whatever 
    piece of work is put into your hand, for God's honor, dispatch it with all 
    expedition, Matthew 24:46 for if you delay it, you may lose the opportunity 
    forever.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Be habitually tender in your life, Acts 24:16. And 
    beware of any standing controversy between God and you: for if there be any 
    such, it will readily stare you in a dying hour.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Be weaned from the world, and hold a loose grip of 
    all you have in it, that it might drop like Joseph's mantle.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Keep waking and watchful, Luke 12:36. Be much in the 
    thoughts of death, and the life to come, that you be not surprised.</p>
<p align="justify">[5.] Lastly, To prepare for more public and general 
    trials and calamities. This is a piece of wisdom to be learned from such a 
    dispensation. For lesser strokes are usually the forerunners of greater 
    ones. Sodom and Gomorrah were tried with a lesser stroke, before they were 
    destroyed by fire from Heaven, Genesis 14:10. And our Lord told the Jews, 
    that unless they repented, they should perish, Luke 13:5; which threatening 
    was accomplished in the destruction of Jerusalem. The day may yet come, 
    wherein men shall praise the dead, that are already dead; and they may miss 
    this stroke, who are reserved for a worse, and shall meet with it before all 
    be done. In a time when the cup of God's anger is going through a land, they 
    that drink first usually fare best. How are we to prepare? may you say. Ans. 
    Keep your garments clean from the sins and snares of the day, and place 
    where you live, and take up your lodging in the sure and unalterable 
    covenant of grace, and then no evil shall befall you.</p>
