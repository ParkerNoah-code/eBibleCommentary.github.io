 </p>
<p align="justify">Colossians 3:3 "For you are dead."</p>
<p align="justify">THESE words are a reason of the preceding exhortation, to 
    set our affections on things above, not on things upon the earth. We must 
    not set our hearts on, nor by any means seek the things on earth as our 
    happiness; for we are dead, and the dead have laid down all their worldly 
    care in the grave, and have no more to do with this world. Now all that are 
    in Christ are dead, yes buried with him and risen again, chapter 2:12. and 
    3:1. And of these only the text speaks, as for others they are yet alive.</p>
<p align="justify">Question. In what sense are believers said to be dead?</p>
<p align="justify">There is a natural death consisting in the separation of 
    the soul from the body; of this the apostle speaks not. A moral death 
    consisting in a separation of certain qualities from the soul, which are the 
    principles of action according to their kind, which being removed, the soul 
    acts no more in that way, than a man morally dead moves and acts. There is a 
    twofold moral life competent to man. One in Adam, another in Christ; the 
    former our natural stock, the latter the supernatural one. In these, all 
    men, as branches, live a life agreeable to the nature of the stock to which 
    they are united. In the former all natural men are living, in the latter all 
    believers. Those who are in Christ are cut out of the natural stock, and so 
    they are dead to it; engrafted to Christ, and so they are alive to him. This 
    death of which the apostle speaks, is the dying of the soul to the natural 
    stock, whereby it comes to pass that the communication is stopped between 
    that stock and them, as by natural death the communication between the soul 
    and the body is stopped. This death is fourfold:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Believers are dead to the law as a covenant of works. 
    This is the doctrine of the scriptures. "Wherefore, says Paul, my brethren, 
    you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should 
    be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead that we 
    should bring forth fruit unto God." This is also the doctrine of our 
    confession of faith, chapter 19 article 6. So that as the law is a covenant, 
    believers have no more to do with it, than a dead wife has with the husband, 
    to whom she was sometime married. Christ by his death, has removed the 
    obligation of it as a covenant from those that are his, and as it were 
    grinded to powder the stones on which it was written. In the mean time, he 
    gives the same law to believers, as the will of their new husband.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are dead to themselves. "For none of us, says 
    Paul, lives to himself." Believers live to him that loved them and died for 
    them. "For me, says Paul, to live is Christ." Natural men being in the old 
    stock, the covenant of works is the covenant by which they are influenced. 
    Self is the principle and end of their actions. When one comes to Christ, he 
    dies to the first covenant, he dies to the old principle, for behold the law 
    of the new marriage: "And I said unto her, you shall abide for me many days, 
    you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man; so will 
    I also be for you." And so among the first lessons learned at Christ's 
    school is self-denial, by which one dies to his natural, moral, and 
    religious self.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are dead to sin. "How shall we who are dead to 
    sin, says Paul, live any longer therein." The dominion or reigning power of 
    it in them is broken. "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are 
    not under the law, but under grace." It is no more their trade and course of 
    life which they choose. "He who is born of God does not commit sin." The 
    firm hold which their heart and affections had of it is loosed, and it lies 
    on them as a burden of which their souls are weary.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They are dead to the world. "But God forbid that I 
    should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world 
    is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." There they sought their 
    happiness before they came to Christ; there they always sought a resting 
    place, and satisfaction to their hearts. Their affections lay in them dead 
    to God and the things of another world; but living and lively to the things 
    of a present life. But now the glass is turned, and they are dead to that 
    world, which they valued so much before.</p>
<p align="justify">All these are comprehended in the death here meant; but 
    the death to the world is the thing chiefly aimed at. So the doctrine is,</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine.—Those that are in Christ are dead to the world: 
    I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show in what respect they are dead to the world.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What way this dying to the world is brought about: we 
    are then,<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">I. To show in what respects they are dead to the world:</p>
<p align="justify">1. In their head Jesus Christ, hence they are said to be 
    buried with him in baptism. He lived in the world for a time, at length he 
    left it by death, not to return to live any more in it as formerly. He died 
    as a public person, in name of all those that are his; rose again, and 
    ascended into Heaven, and they also are risen with him, v. 1 of this 
    chapter, "Yes, they are raised up together, and are made to sit together in 
    heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Hence, the believer, whatever he be in 
    himself, looking to himself as in Christ, must needs conclude himself to be 
    dead to the world, unless he will either renounce his union with Christ, or 
    think that though the head be dead to it, the members have no interest in 
    that death.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In their own persons, by virtue of the death of 
    Christ, so they are said to be planted in the likeness of his death. The 
    power of his death having deadened their affections to this earth; that as 
    the world crucified Christ, so Christ crucified has crucified them to the 
    world. They are dead to it sacramentally, Colossians 2:12. The sacrament of 
    baptism signifies them to be dead to it, binds and obliges them to die to it 
    more and more. They are also dead to it inceptively. The death is not 
    complete, but it is begun, Galatians 6:14. Another spirit than the spirit of 
    the world, is put into them, and the death will certainly be completed. They 
    are dead to it comparatively, in comparison with the men of the world, and 
    with themselves in their unrenewed state: We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what way this dying to the world is brought 
    about.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the day the Lord begins to deal with the soul, he 
    finds it living and lively to the world. The man's heart and affections are 
    set upon it. He loves it, lives to it, and longs for it, more than anything 
    else. Their constant cry is, who will show us any good. His life is enrapt 
    up in it. If it smiles he is well; if it frowns he is broken. He knows 
    nothing better, he desires nothing better. From it he seeks his 
    satisfaction, and without it he can have none.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God blasts the creature to the man. He comes to the 
    world's springs, but behold they are dry, the broken cisterns have no water 
    in them. The bed is shorter than he can stretch himself upon it, and the 
    covering narrower than he can wrap himself in it. These disappointments make 
    a sick heart, and are by a gracious God blessed to be the forerunners of his 
    dying to it. He struggles as one in sickness, being anxious to preserve his 
    life, but all in vain. Thus the prodigal "would gladly have filled his belly 
    with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The Lord holds out to him, and by the power of 
    his grace brings him to, and sets him upon the breasts of his own 
    consolation. We see all this exemplified in the parable of the prodigal son, 
    Luke 15:17–24. The Lord effectually discovers to him on the one hand the 
    vanity of the world, and makes the man say there is no hope; on the other 
    his own fullness, and brings the soul to Christ for all. "Thus the kingdom 
    of Heaven is like unto treasure hidden in a field; the which when a man has 
    found, he hides, and for joy thereof, goes and sells all that he has, and 
    buys that field." So the soul dies to the world. This death to the world, is 
    the dying of the heart and affections to it. The grace of God deadens the 
    man's affections to the things on earth, looses the lively firm hold which 
    the heart took of these things, so the heart falls off from them to God 
    himself, and the things above.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 1. This may serve for a trial of our state, whether 
    we be in Christ or not. Are you dead to the world? This is the trying point 
    in our text. And it will be a trying point to us all. It is certain we 
    cannot serve two masters. "Love not the world, neither the things that are 
    in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in 
    him." If we be living to Christ, we are dead to the world; and if we be 
    living to the world we are dead to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Question, What are the characters of one dead to the 
    world?</p>
<p align="justify">Before I answer this question, I premise four things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. This death is but imperfect in the best while here, 
    and is never perfected until death comes and separates the soul from the 
    body. Hence though the Apostle tells them in the text that they were dead, 
    yet in verse 5 he exhorts them "to mortify their members which are upon the 
    earth, fornication, impurity, and the like." Still there is flesh as well as 
    spirit in the regenerate, and that flesh, though dying, yet has its 
    lustings. Hence, it is compared to crucifying, which is a lingering death, 
    Galatians 6:15.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This death is a matter of great difficulty to 
    accomplish. Any death whatever is difficult. A death-bed though a down bed 
    will be hard. It is one of the hardest kinds of death, a crucifying. The 
    difficulty of it is also held out, under the notion of the weaning of a 
    child from the breasts, Psalm 131:2.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The case being thus, our gracious God for Christ's 
    sake, looks upon the habitual fixed bent of the soul towards himself and 
    away from the world as dying to it, though the remains of corruption do 
    cause it to make sallies another way. He looks to the soul's deliberative 
    choice, sincere aims, and endeavors to be quite dead to the world, as a 
    dying to it, and the longings of the Spirit to be free of it. Romans 7:24, 
    25. 2 Corinthians 7:12. Galatians 5:17.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Wherefore the characters of this death are more or 
    less to be found in one, as he is more or less dead to the world. Sometimes 
    a gracious soul may, in a triumphant manner, have the moon so under his 
    feet, that he values it no more than a handful of dust, Galatians 6:14. At 
    other times the enemy may rise and drag him at his heels, as he did with 
    Peter in the high priest's hall. However they have a constant war with him, 
    in which they sometimes lose and sometimes win a particular battle; but they 
    will always be overcomers in the war. "For whatever is born of God, 
    overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even 
    our faith."</p>
<p align="justify">These things being premised, I now, in answer to the 
    question, observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That he who is dead to the world is a resigned man, 
    resigned to the disposal of divine providence. "If any man, said Jesus, will 
    come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. 
    The Lord, say the saints, shall choose our inheritance for us." When once a 
    man is dead, his friends may do with him what they will. He opposes them 
    not, let them set him up on high, or lay him as low as they please. So is he 
    who is dead to the world laid at the Lord's feet. With David they say, 
    "Behold here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him." If that which is 
    crooked in their lot cannot be made straight, they yield to it as it is. If 
    their lot be not brought up to their mind, they endeavor to bring down their 
    mind to their lot; studying "in whatever state they are therewith to be 
    content."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The world's joys and smiles do not go deep with him, 
    his heart does not sink in them, but uses them passingly with a holy 
    carelessness, 1 Corinthians 7:29–31. As the dogs of Egypt lap their water 
    out of the Nile cautiously, for fear of the crocodiles, so does the godly 
    man taste the joys of the world. Lay a dead man before a fire, he will 
    gather some warmth, but it will soon be gone, for it goes not far in. But 
    when a living man is in that posture, it will go through him and abide with 
    him. So worldly men's worldly joys go deeper, and make deeper and more 
    lasting impressions upon them; than the worldly joys of godly men do.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The world's sorrows and frowns do not much pain him, 
    they go not so deep into the heart as other sorrows do. They weep as though 
    they wept not. One can bear an incision into a mortified member without much 
    trouble, while the cutting in a sound place will bring a terrible anguish. 
    The truth is, the grace of God suffers neither the worldly joys, nor sorrows 
    of the saints to come to that perfection which they attain in others. But 
    the more piercing any sorrow is on account of any worldly cross, it speaks 
    the affections to the world, to have been, and to be still too lively. And 
    nothing makes one's sorrows for the want of anything in the world too deep, 
    but that their affection and desires of it were too high.</p>
<p align="justify">4. His heart is going after the better things of another 
    world, even while he is compassed about with the good things of this. Though 
    created streams be running smoothly, and the world gives him a soft seat, 
    yet these are not his chief comforts, and his heart says within him, this is 
    not my rest. With Hannah he says, my heart rejoices in the Lord. And with 
    David, the Lord lives; and blessed be my rock. While all the preparations 
    are making for a dead man's corpse, he with his soul is gone to another 
    world, and is minding other things. Those who are dead to the world, may 
    love its good things as a friend, but are not wedded to them as a husband. 
    They may use them as a staff, but not build on them as a pillar. Christ 
    himself being the support of their souls.</p>
<p align="justify">5. He will stand without them when they are gone, for 
    they were not the pillar on which his house stood. Therefore when all of 
    them are removed, he will say with Habakkuk, "yet I will rejoice in the 
    Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation." One may strip a man when he is 
    dead, and offer a thousand injuries to his dead body. He regards them not, 
    he is gone to another world. The saints take joyfully the spoiling of their 
    goods, "knowing in themselves that they have in Heaven a better and an 
    enduring substance." Alas! that soul is in a sad state, whose comfort waxes 
    and wanes according as his created comforts do so; is hungry, or starved, or 
    full, just as the breasts of worldly things are full or empty. If we were 
    dead to the world as we ought to be, these things might come to us, or go 
    from us, without changing our temper of spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of exhortation. Be exhorted to be dead to the 
    world, and thereby evidence yourselves to be true Christians. This should be 
    a Christian's constant exercise to be dying to it. That death is one of the 
    greatest employments of our life. Labor to be dead, 1. To the world's 
    comforts. "They that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not: and they that 
    buy, as though they bought not." Learn to be content without them as well as 
    with them, and never launch forth so far into the deep of them, but that you 
    may be ready to come ashore on God's call. Our happiness consists not in 
    them but in God. Therefore if he shall see it meet to deny us even our 
    lawful desires of comfort in created things, mingle our drink with gall, and 
    make us of those who never eat with pleasure; let us be ready to part with 
    what he sees meet to withhold from us.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the world's hardships. We should know both how to 
    be abased, and know how to abound. Paul who knew this, was so dead to the 
    worst things which the world could do to him, "that none of these things 
    could move him." All the advantage which the world can get of us, by the ill 
    treatment we meet with in it, comes by our unmortified affections to it. If 
    we could get these deadened, the devil and the world would have a cold coal 
    to blow at, and could never be able to burn us thereby. A lively faith in 
    God, and of the vanity of the world, and all that is in it, its good and its 
    evil, would make us go through the world's fire, and not be burned. But more 
    particularly, labor to be dead,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To your relations in the world. "If any man, says 
    Jesus, come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and 
    children, and brethren and sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be 
    my disciple." True we are to love them as ourselves, but not as our God; 
    therefore we are to be ready to part with them, and our comfort in them at 
    the call of Providence. It was the commendation of Levi, "that in the cause 
    of God he regarded none of these," Deuteronomy 33:9. Much of the world's 
    comfort is placed in these, but we had need to be dead to them, when we 
    consider that sin and misery broke into the world by that door. And now that 
    sin has spread like poison in a cup, one is not to wonder that his greatest 
    cross start up out of that from which he looked for his greatest comfort, 
    like a leopard out of the pleasant Lebanon. Father and mother are kindly 
    names, but in effect they are often found cruel as the ostrich in the 
    wilderness. Husbands and wives made one flesh, designed for meet helps, yet 
    are often rottenness in the bones. Sons of youth are as arrows, but often 
    are the arrows turned, and shot through the hearts of those for whose hands 
    they were prepared. Daughters are like corner stones; but these corner 
    stones often fall down on the heads of the builders and crush them. So great 
    need have we to be dead to relations.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the substance of the world. Some have it and it has 
    their hearts, and parts between Christ and them. This was the case with the 
    young man, Mark 10:22. For no man can serve two masters. Some have it not, 
    but it has a firm hold of their hearts, and they constantly cry, who will 
    show us any good. The first are hugged to death by its embraces, the second 
    frowned to death by its flying from them, while they follow it. And what is 
    it for which both have such a fondness, but a load of thick clay; a fair 
    beautiful nothing even that which is not. Yet this is it, for which the 
    great and the small strive each with his competitor. And when it is got, 
    though it fill the hand, it cannot fill the heart. And when it is obtained 
    or lost, pierces the heart with many sorrows, 1 Timothy 6:10. Oh! then be 
    dead to it. Live above it, whether you have or want it. Take it as the 
    traveler does foul or fair weather, even as he finds it, because he must be 
    forward.</p>
<p align="justify">3. To credit and esteem in the world. A mercy it is in 
    itself, but it is often a great idol that parts between men and God. Few but 
    suffer an eclipse in it some time or other. It is a precious ointment, but 
    often providence orders a dead fly to fall into it. The lively lust of pride 
    in the heart, must have it, cannot want it. But O! what a miserable case is 
    that man in, whose comfort depends upon the esteem of others, which in 
    itself is not capable to make him either better or worse; upon that which 
    may be ruined with the blast of a foul mouth; that lies like chaff to be 
    tossed up and down, as the wind blows in the world. Be dead to it then, that 
    if God will make a stepping stone to your credit and reputation to his own 
    glory, he may have it cheerfully. That if he will have you to lie among the 
    pots, you may silently creep down and lie there until he bring you out again 
    as did Christ himself and his apostles. Be ready to be a fool to the world, 
    that you may be wise.</p>
<p align="justify">4. To your ease and liberty. Paul was ready "not only to 
    be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." The 
    flesh would always gladly be easy, Master spare yourself. And when the 
    trouble rises without, then the storm begins within, raised by the 
    unmortified desire of ease. This world is a valley of tears and misery. 
    Therefore if we be wise, we must learn to lie still in the bed which 
    providence makes to us, though there be a thorn of uneasiness in it. "For 
    that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting 
    cannot be numbered." This is not our rest. Who frets himself because the sea 
    is still in motion, that the winds blow on the earth, the clouds return 
    after the fair blink, and the rain falls? We cannot expect that it should be 
    otherwise in the lower regions. And we should be content to undergo troubles 
    in this world, thinking ourselves happy if we can attain ease in another 
    world.</p>
<p align="justify">5. To your own will with respect to the world. "Our souls 
    should be even as a weaned child." Your desires must be to your spiritual 
    husband; to grant them or refuse them as seems good in his sight, saying 
    with David, Let him do to me as seems good in his sight. A will of our own, 
    not subordinated to the will of God, is a sinful rebellious bent of spirit, 
    and the fountain of all our miseries with respect to things of this life. In 
    the day the soul takes Christ it gives up its own will and resigns itself to 
    his will, saying from henceforth, Your will be done. And much of this death 
    consists in holding by and renewing that resignation. It makes one's will 
    yield to the will of the Lord, as the wax to the seal.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, To your life in the world, Luke 14:26. Your 
    bodies must be the Lord's, not only for service, but a sacrifice too, if he 
    pleases. None go to Heaven but martyrs, if not in action, yet in affection. 
    Perhaps the Lord may have use for your health, strength, a leg or limb of 
    your body, yes, for your blood. Be dead to them all, that they may be at his 
    service. What a vain thing is the life of man on earth? It is a stage of 
    miseries, a thing of which one may be quickly made weary and sick, and long 
    to be made free of; an inordinate affection to it is a dangerous thing, in 
    this ensnaring world.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. Consider the vanity of the world, and all that 
    is in it, Ecclesiastes 1:2. It is but a heap of vanities, which deserves not 
    lively affections, and they who are most dead to it are the most happy.</p>
<p align="justify">There is an insufficiency in all things under the sun, 
    there can be no dependence upon them, without being deceived. They are all 
    greater in expectation than in fruition, fairest afar off, and the more one 
    has expected them, the more piercing is the disappointment. They can never 
    fill the soul. You shall as soon fill your hands with wind, grasp your arms 
    full of dreams and shadows, as fill your hearts with the world's dry 
    breasts, Isaiah 55:2.—There is an unsuitableness between the soul and them. 
    The soul is spiritual, they are carnal earthly things. The soul is immortal, 
    they are perishing, so that your hearts can no more feed on them and 
    prosper, than the fishes on meadows, or dry ground. There is also an 
    uncertainty in them. Nothing is constant here but inconstancy and change. 
    One may be stripped of them in life. "For riches certainly make themselves 
    wings; they fly away, as an eagle toward Heaven." This world is a wheel 
    where the spoak now uppermost turns presently lowest: one day saw Job rich 
    and poor to a proverb. You may have comfortable relations, which may quickly 
    be taken from you, or your comfort in them lost. The most untainted 
    reputation may be killed with the bite of a malicious mouth. And our very 
    life hangs on a thousand uncertainties.</p>
<p align="justify">Death will surely strip us of them at length, and at what 
    time it comes we know not. We carry nothing hence but a coffin and a winding 
    sheet; and we are not sure even of these. Sometimes many fair bodies have 
    but served to fill up a ditch, or to be a feast to the fishes of the sea. It 
    were our wisdom then to sit loose to that which we must necessarily part 
    with.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 2. Deadness to the world would make you very easy, 
    in all the changes with which we may meet in the world; he who has attained 
    it cannot be miserable, meet with what he may. The smiles of the world he 
    would not much value, and the frowns of it, he would little regard. The 
    heaviest cross would be but light, if it wanted the overweight which a man 
    alive to the world lays upon it. What is the rise of so much uneasy walking 
    under the cross, but that we are wedded to this and the other thing, and so 
    being exceedingly glad of our gourd while we have it, we are exceedingly 
    sorry and fretful when it is withered. As ever then you would be easy 
    whatever weather blow in the world, strive to be dead to it.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 3. Consider what this world is; a right view of it 
    might stir us up to die to it: men are deceived with the fair show which it 
    makes. O! to see it in its true colors.</p>
<p align="justify">It is Satan's bait, by which he draws men in shoals down 
    the stream into the sea of God's wrath. They run after it, and gaping for 
    the bait are caught with the hook. Judas was ruined with the thirty pieces. 
    Demas turned apostate for the present world. The profits and pleasures of it 
    are in the two horns, with which it pushes many to their wound, and most 
    part to death. The devil attacked the second Adam with it, Matthew 4:9. For 
    by that means he had prevailed with our first parents.</p>
<p align="justify">It is the wicked's portion, Psalm 17:14. The most part of 
    it is dealt among them who are to expect no portion in the glory to be 
    revealed. It was a sad memorandum given to the rich man in Hell, "Son, 
    remember that you in your life time received your good things." Alas! that 
    men should be so found of that upon which God puts such contempt as that he 
    makes it the portion of those whom he hates.</p>
<p align="justify">It is the snare of the godly, in which their feet are apt 
    to be entangled. While they walk through it, they are as among lions' dens, 
    where they are often alarmed, wounded and almost rent in pieces, pierced 
    through with many sorrows. How often does that mist rise from it, which 
    hides their sun at noon day? And therefore they are often longing to be 
    beyond the reach of it; its smiles and its frowns. And it is a victory 
    glorious in their eyes, when they overcome it. The world is a passing show. 
    The fashion of it passes away. A gaudy vanity that lasts for a little time, 
    and draws the eyes of foolish men after it; but it will quickly be gone. The 
    stage of vanity will be taken down. This bewitching world will go all to the 
    flames at length, 2 Peter 3:7. The sweet of that intoxicating cup will soon 
    be drunk out, but the dregs of it will taste forever to those who set their 
    hearts upon it.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 4. Consider the great advantages of deadness to 
    the world. It would be the very life of the soul. It would fit you to act 
    for God and to be useful to men. Consider who they are that in all ages have 
    been most useful for God in their day, acting for his honor, cause, and 
    interest among men. And you will find they were men dead to the world. 
    "Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ, greater riches than the treasures of 
    Egypt; for he had respect to the recompense of reward." Says Paul, "God 
    forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by 
    whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." The world is a 
    mighty clog, and often so entangles many good men that they become very 
    restless, and often sit under a cloud. Therefore we are exhorted "to lay 
    aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and to run 
    with patience, the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus, the 
    author and finisher of our faith."</p>
<p align="justify">This deadness would also fit you to suffer for God, Acts 
    20:24. He who is dead to the world, is in a proper state to take up Christ's 
    cross, and follow him, however heavy it be. This will keep you safe in a 
    time of trial, when others whose hearts are glued to the world will be ready 
    to make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">It will fit you for communion with God here, Psalm 4:6–8. 
    This earth interposes between us and the sun of righteousness makes an 
    eclipse of the light of the Lord's countenance to us. But were it rolled 
    away out of the heart, and the affections to it deadened, our sky from above 
    would clear up; even as the manna fell after the provision brought from 
    Egypt was done. The Lord's people had much sweet communion with him in the 
    duties of religion, during the times of persecution, for then they were in a 
    great measure dead to the world. But since they have become more alive to 
    the world, they have grown more dead to God.</p>
<p align="justify">It would also make you fit for Heaven. "Who is this that 
    comes up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved?" He who is dead to 
    the world his heart is in Heaven, and his treasures there, and that makes 
    Heaven home to a man. When death comes, it would make a man fall like ripe 
    fruit from a tree; whereas a heart unweaned from the world, makes a person 
    unfit for death and for another world.</p>
<p align="justify">Directions 1. Pray, and look to the Lord for the light of 
    his Spirit, to discover to you the vanity of the world. This alone can make 
    you see to purpose an end of all perfection. Men by considering this world, 
    and by their own experience of it, cannot fail to make a rational discovery 
    of the vanity of it. But alas! that can no more deaden their hearts, than 
    painted fire can burn off one's bonds. But the light of the Spirit is the 
    light of life, powerful and efficacious, and will give one the world under 
    his feet. John Baptist said, "Jesus shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, 
    and with fire."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Believe and live in the exercise of faith. "For 
    whoever is born of God, overcomes the world; and this is the victory that 
    overcomes the world, even our faith." Close then with Christ in the gospel 
    offer, "taking him in whom all fullness dwells," for your all. Thus the 
    heart going out after Christ will drop the vain world. Faith's discoveries 
    of Christ mortify men to the world, Matthew 13:45, 46. The heart of man is 
    an empty thing, and must be filled from without itself; and there is no way 
    to take it off the world, but to place them on Christ the better portion.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Look off from the world. Look not at the things which 
    are seen. Dwell not on the thoughts of the world but turn away your eyes 
    from its deceitful allurements and beg grace for that purpose, saying, "Turn 
    away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken you me in your way." The 
    first sin began at looking, and if man was brought down from his perfect 
    innocence, by that means; how difficult is it for the corrupt heart not to 
    be fired with temptation, while a person thus courts it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Look much at the other world where glory dwells. Look 
    at the things which are not seen and which are eternal. The more you think 
    of that world and the happiness there, the more you will prize it. And the 
    more you prize it, the more you will undervalue the present world. They will 
    be dead to the world, who have their conversation in Heaven, as from the 
    stars this earth would appear a small thing.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Meditate much on the sufferings of Christ, and by 
    faith make application of them to yourselves, Galatians 6:14. Often think 
    how the world treated Christ, how he became poor that we might be made rich; 
    how he was put to death; and consider all this as for you, so shall virtue 
    come from his cross to make you dead to the world. Then you will say, "I am 
    crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in 
    me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the 
    Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." Amen.</p>
