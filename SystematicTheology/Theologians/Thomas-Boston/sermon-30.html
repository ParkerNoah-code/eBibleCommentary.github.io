    Psalm 4:6 "Lord lift you up the light of your countenance upon us."</p>
<p align="justify">HOWEVER all men have the same common nature, yet grace 
    makes a vast difference among them. As it makes difference in their 
    understandings, so, in their wills. Their choice is not the same, but very 
    different as in the text.</p>
<p align="justify">In this verse we have the world divided into two parties. 
    On the one side which is the worst, there are many, on the other side not 
    many. Many is a word of comparison, and properly signifies a great number, 
    and because there are degrees in a great number, sometimes it signifies all, 
    Romans 5:19. Sometimes the most part, Matthew 7:13. so here. Wherefore those 
    on the other side must be few. So that if it were put to the vote in the 
    world, whether God or the world should have men's hearts, God should be 
    voted out of the world. We have also in the verse something supposed in 
    which the parties agree, and that is in two things. </p>
<p align="justify">1. They agree in their sense of defects. Every man godly 
    and ungodly is sensible he labors under some wants. The wicked man in the 
    fullness of his sufficiency is in straits, there is still a void in his 
    heart, even after he has glutted himself with all he can find in the world. 
    His heart is like the grave, or the barren womb, that never say it is 
    enough. The godly also while here, are still craving, being compassed with 
    wants. </p>
<p align="justify">2. They agree in their desire of supplies. The mouths of 
    both are opened, they gape for satisfaction as the parched ground for the 
    rain. The desire of happiness is interwoven with man's nature, and that 
    desire is fresh, even when desire fails in old age.</p>
<p align="justify">But there are also some things in which they differ, and 
    these are,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The object of their desires. The wicked's desire is 
    creeping, the godly's desire soars aloft; the one desires any good, that is 
    worldly good things, verse 7. like the wild beasts that seek their meat 
    among their feet: but the godly desires the light of God's countenance, that 
    is the favor and sense thereof. The reason of the metaphor is, because the 
    affections of the heart appear in the countenance. The weary traveler does 
    not so much desire the rising of the sun, as the gracious soul does the 
    light of God's countenance, Psalm 67:1.</p>
<p align="justify">5. They differ in the way which they take to the 
    accomplishing of their desires. The wicked are at a great uncertainty here, 
    who will show us? That is, make us to enjoy. The godly are at a point, they 
    go straight to God with their desires. Carnal men know not what quarter to 
    go to, but try all, like the hungry infant that sucks wherever it comes, and 
    finding no milk in one thing, goes to another, and so on. But the child of 
    God immediately fixes on the breasts of divine consolation. "Lord lift you 
    up the light of your countenance upon us."</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the success of their desires. The carnal man gets 
    not his desire satisfied. He is still saying, who will show us any good, for 
    he is always at the wrong door; but the gracious soul gets its rest taken up 
    in the bosom of the great God. Here it lays itself down and goes no farther. 
    The carnal man is like a traveler that has lost his way in a misty day, when 
    he sees a bush he takes it for a house and promises himself rest, but 
    finding he is disappointed there, gets up again and falls into the same 
    mistake, and is disappointed without end. Whereas the godly come to the 
    right door, and continue there until it be opened.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine. It is the great desire of gracious souls to 
    have the light of the Lord's countenance lifted up upon them. I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Speak to the case that is here supposed.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Consider this desire of the gracious soul.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give the reasons, why it is the great desire of the 
    gracious soul. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To speak to the case that is here supposed, which is, 
    that the the saint, the child of light, may sometimes sit in darkness. Hence 
    says Isaiah, "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of 
    his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light." The sun may go down 
    upon the saint in his way to Immanuel's land, a black cloud may overshadow 
    him, and set him down in the valley of the shadow of death, where he may be 
    left to cry for the light to arise upon him. Here I shall first show how far 
    this darkness may proceed with them. And secondly, How can these things be.</p>
<p align="justify">First then, How far may this darkness proceed with them.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It may go so far with them, that they cannot see to 
    read their evidences for Heaven. Sometimes the believer can say My Beloved 
    is mine, and I am his. But when the light of God's countenance goes down on 
    them, they may cry out, "My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord." 
    So that the harps employed formerly to sing the songs of the Redeemer are 
    hanged upon the willows, because they are now by the rivers of Babel and 
    cannot sing the songs of Zion.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That they cannot see above them, nor look up to 
    Heaven. Thus the publican would not so much as lift up his eyes to Heaven, 
    but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. They may 
    lose their confidence with God, who sometimes could by an eye of faith 
    pierce the clouds, and come boldly before the throne of grace. They may go 
    to God, but they are under the feet of a diffidence, discouragement and 
    heartlessness.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The very thing that was their light before may be as 
    darkness unto them. The Word of God that was their lamp, the joy and 
    rejoicing of their heart before, may become gloomy and dark; yes, and be 
    turned into terror to them. "I remembered God, says Asaph, and was troubled, 
    I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed." Men are very liable to 
    misapprehensions in the dark, hence an angel with a flaming sword seems to 
    them to guard the tree of life. On its fruit they have sometimes sweetly 
    feasted, but the door of Christ's banqueting house seems now closed; the 
    blunted edge of the threatenings now appears sharp and piercing. Bid them 
    lay hold on a promise, that is to them, like God's commanding Moses to take 
    the serpent by the tail, though sometimes it has been the rod of God in 
    their hands.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They may be unable to discern their best friend from 
    their foe: even as the disciples, when they saw Jesus walking on the sea, 
    they were troubled, saying, it is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 
    Sometimes the Lord is coming to cure them, and they think he is coming to 
    kill them. Hence the soul is filled with fears, and doubts, and jealousies 
    of Christ, why it is dark, the sun is gone down, and they can see nothing 
    but blood through a dark cloud.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The darkness may be such that they may lose sight of 
    their guide; and what a weary case must this be. Sometimes a child of God 
    may be within view of Christ, and a cloud may come and take him out of their 
    sight. Hence Zion is heard to complain, "The Lord has forsaken me, and my 
    Lord has forgotten me." Like Heman they think they are remembered by him no 
    more, and are cut off from his hand. Hence they are left sometimes to spend 
    a little time saying, "How long will you forget me, O Lord? Forever? How 
    long will you hide your face from me?"</p>
<p align="justify">6. They may lose sight of their way-marks, and be filled 
    with such confusion and perplexity, that they know not what to do or what 
    way to direct their course, and thus be shut up, that they cannot come 
    forth. Former experiences are the believers way-marks in a dark hour, and 
    sometimes they serve to guide their feet in a dark place. They remember the 
    years of the right hand of the Most High. But sometimes the darkness is so 
    great, that they can get no help of them, Psalm 143:5–8.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The darkness may be such that they may quite sit up 
    for a time, and give over duty, as in the thick darkness of Egypt, Exodus 
    10:23. The darkness may fetter their tongues, Psalm 77:4. and restrain 
    prayer, Song 2:14. Either they cannot pray though they would, or they may 
    think it is vain to seek the Lord any more, or that they will but bring more 
    wrath upon themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">8. It may be so thick that no ray of light can pierce it, 
    until the sun arise and dispel the cloud. "In the day of my trouble I sought 
    the Lord; my sore ran by night, and ceased not; my soul refused to be 
    comforted." Discouragement beats back as a brazen wall, all comfort offered 
    to the soul, being like Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be 
    comforted, because they were not. The disease may be so violent, that 
    ministers and Christians may apply suitable remedies, but all the world 
    cannot cause them take effect, until the Lord himself put to his hand.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They may be weary of their very lives. "My soul, 
    says Job, is weary of my life: I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will 
    speak in the bitterness of my soul." Hence their very bodies may be 
    neglected and the necessary comforts of life refused. "My heart is smitten, 
    and withered like grass, so that I forget to eat my bread," like Paul's 
    company in the ship, Acts 27:20, 21. And hence a longing for death, Job 
    3:20, 21. Sometimes this darkness comes on suddenly, Jeremiah 20:13, 14. 
    Sometimes it creeps on by degrees as on Samson. Let us, secondly,</p>
<p align="justify">Show how can these things be.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It arises from our corruptions, these cast up mists 
    that intercept the light, the light of the Lord's countenance, they grieve 
    the Spirit of Christ, Ephesians 4:30. When we are well we cannot keep 
    ourselves so. It is difficult to carry a full cup even. Our unwatchfulness, 
    quenching the Spirit, slighting occasions of communion with God, and 
    neglecting means of improvement, bring us into darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. God will have a difference between the place of the 
    believer's pilgrimage and his eternal home. It is peculiar to Immanuel's 
    land to have no night there, Revelation 21:25. And sovereignty challenges a 
    latitude, and will have some in darkness, while others are in light. We are 
    now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To speak of this desire of the gracious soul. And 
    First, What is it to have the light of the Lord's countenance.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It implies a state of reconciliation with God. There 
    is an enmity between God and every man by nature. Hence angry words and 
    angry looks, that sometimes look the stoutest sinners out of countenance, 
    spoils their mirth, and makes the wheels of their hearts drive heavily. This 
    enmity is taken away, and the soul enjoys peace with God through Christ, 
    Ephesians 2:14. The flames of wrath are extinguished by the blood of the 
    Lamb. Thus the darkness of a natural state is over, and the true light is 
    come. The sun of righteousness is risen to the believer. They who were 
    sometimes darkness are now light in the Lord. They are all the children of 
    the light and of the day.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It implies something more, and that is the Lord's 
    laying aside any special controversy with the soul. Though there is never a 
    breach between God and a gracious soul in respect of its state, yet often in 
    respect of the frame of the soul. Though the sun be up, yet a cloud may 
    overshadow it. Now the Lord may frown on his own people, and sin is that 
    cloud. "I have blotted out as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and as a 
    thick cloud your sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed you." Now when 
    the light of the Lord's countenance is lifted, the soul may say, "The voice 
    of my Beloved! behold he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the 
    hills."</p>
<p align="justify">3. It implies a communication of gracious influences and 
    an intimation of God's love to the soul. Then the soul is lifted up when the 
    Lord's favor is discerned, and the soul can say with Paul, "I live by the 
    faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." Sometimes 
    Christ says to the gracious soul, "I have loved you with an everlasting 
    love, therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you." It is his voice and 
    they doubt not of it; for this light when it shines so brightly dispels 
    doubts and fears, and like the sun is seen by its own light. The Spirit 
    attests the truth of the word and of the work of grace in the soul. And by 
    this light of the Lord's countenance, the soul can look far back to that 
    blessed hour when the Father and the Son were engaged in making the covenant 
    of redemption, and see itself given to Christ by the Father, and its 
    redemption undertaken by the Son, this in the fullness of time performed and 
    in the time of love begun.</p>
<p align="justify">It can also look forward "even to the land that is afar 
    off, to the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens." This light 
    will let them see through the clouds, and behold the many mansions in the 
    Father's house. It will let them see how far eternity of blessedness goes, 
    when the saints shall be ever with the Lord. And though mountains of sin be 
    in their way home, this light will let them see over them. "Iniquities 
    prevail against me, as for our transgressions, you shall purge them away. 
    The blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from all sin." This light 
    lets them see a fullness of merit in him to take away the guilt of sin, and 
    a fullness of the Spirit, to take away the stains, dominion and indwelling 
    power of sin. Let us now,</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Show they desire it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They desire it above all. This is the chief desire of 
    their souls. "Whom have I in Heaven but you, and there is none upon earth 
    that I desire besides you." All other things are in their esteem but loss 
    and dung, in comparison of this. The world is but a bulky vanity and fair 
    nothing in their eyes. If they had but one choice to make, one petition to 
    put up, it would be this.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They desire it so as they would be content with it, 
    instead of all. Carnal men may desire the favor of God, and the love of 
    Christ; but they see not such fullness in Christ, as to be content with him 
    alone. But the gracious soul longing for this, would think itself happy in 
    the enjoyment of it, though it should be stripped naked of all other 
    comforts, and all the world should look down upon it, Matthew 13:45, 46.</p>
<p align="justify">They have good reasons for thus desiring the light of the 
    Lord's countenance. Their life lies in his favor. "For his anger endures but 
    for a moment; in his favor is life." Their comfort depends on the light of 
    his countenance. What a melancholy life would the world have without the 
    light of the sun? So would the Christian be without the light of his 
    Father's countenance. His frowns are bitter as death to the gracious soul.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Of Exhortation. Let this be the desire of your 
    souls, that the Lord may lift up the light of his countenance upon you. Seek 
    this and make it your choice.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. You cannot otherwise give evidence that you are 
    in a gracious state. If this be not the great desire of your souls, you are 
    on the same side with the world. If God be your Father, you will prize the 
    light of his countenance. Can a child be satisfied though he had the 
    countenance of all the servants about the house, if he have not his 
    father's?</p>
<p align="justify">2. It will be but a heavy communion you will have of it, 
    if the Lord lift not up the light of his countenance upon you; if you be not 
    in a state of favor with God, you will but wound your own souls more; if 
    there be a standing controversy still between God and you, yon can have no 
    communion with him. "Can two walk together except they be agreed?" It is sad 
    to be at Jerusalem and not see the King's face.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Lord will not refuse it, if you be heartily 
    concerned for it. He offers yon his favor and grace, Jeremiah 3:1–22.</p>
<p align="justify">Direction 1. Lay hold upon the Lord Jesus Christ, Isaiah 
    27:5. Wash in his blood, Hebrews 9:14. Look to God through the veil of the 
    flesh of Christ. God is a consuming fire. There is fire in his countenance 
    against sinners as they are in themselves, but Christ is as a crystal wall 
    between God and the sinner, through him the light of the fire may come to 
    refresh, but not the flame to burn.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Turn from your sins that have provoked him to turn his 
    face from you, Isaiah 59:2. See that there be no unrepented of lust to stand 
    between God and your souls, Psalm 66:18. If you would have his favor, let 
    these go away. Break your league with your sins, and say with Ephraim, "What 
    have I to do any more with idols?" Amen.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">[The same subject continued.]</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>THE GREAT DESIRE OF THE SAINTS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">Monday's Sermon, June, 1707.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">PSALM 4:7 "Lord lift you up the light of your countenance 
    upon us."</p>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of reproof to, and lamentation over those who sit 
    in woeful darkness, and have not had the light of the Lord's countenance in 
    any measure lifted up on them, and yet are not affected with it, they are 
    not earnestly desiring it, and pressing after it. If they would speak their 
    minds, they dare not say the great desire of their soul is this, "Lord lift 
    you up the light of your countenance upon us."</p>
<p align="justify">In managing this, I shall</p>
<p align="justify">First, Show you how that this is not the great desire of 
    the souls of many. Secondly, How it comes to pass, that this is not their 
    great desire; and Thirdly, The lamentable nature of this case. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show you that this is not the great desire of the 
    souls of many. It appears if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That ardent desire that there is in many after the 
    world, and their lusts. "Who, say they, will show us any good?" They are mad 
    upon their idols. This desire is natural to us, and also it has never been 
    quenched in many to this day. How then can this be the great desire of their 
    souls. They may as easily bring together the two poles as reconcile these. 
    "If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The peaceable life that many have without the favor of 
    God, or the least true ground of hope of it. Are there not many of whom it 
    is true, God is not in all their thoughts. "They reign as kings without 
    him," Jeremiah 2:31. While others are looking heavenwards, they do 
    contentedly look still downwards to the earth. Many can sleep in a sound 
    skin, and never once examine whether they be in a state of friendship with 
    God or not.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The easy life that many professors have of it, their 
    rest being never interrupted, but when at any time they fall into gross and 
    scandalous sins. There are many who, like children, can with pleasure wallow 
    among the sand as long as it holds out of their eyes. They are not concerned 
    for the light of the Lord's countenance. It is a light easily overclouded, 
    and so will require great watchfulness to keep it up, and when iniquity 
    prevails to take it away it will disturb the quiet of the gracious soul. You 
    did hide your face and I was troubled.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Persons contenting themselves with the bare 
    performance of duties without finding God in them. Many go with Mary to an 
    empty sepulcher, but few with her come away weeping. They are narrow souls, 
    they seek little and get as little; bread and wine, but no Christ. They 
    never come into the inner court of duties, where they would see the beauty 
    of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Persons not following their desires with suitable 
    endeavors. Many have languishing desires and faint wishes after the light of 
    God's countenance. They may occasionally say, "Lord, evermore give us this 
    bread." But it is not their great desire, their hearts are not in good 
    earnest set on it, else they would add suitable endeavors to their desires, 
    that is, they would seek it resolutely, as Jacob, "I will not let you go 
    except you bless me," Psalm 27:7, 8. But it is with them as Solomon says, 
    "The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labor." We 
    are now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show how it comes to pass, that this is not their 
    great desire.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because they are not sensible of their need of it. Why 
    is not Christ prized, but because the whole need not a physician. Many are 
    in Laodicea's case, they think they are rich, increased in goods and stand 
    in need of nothing. If a man's house were all in flames, if he knew it not, 
    it would give him no concern. "The full soul loathes the honey comb;" but 
    felt need breaks through every obstacle.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because they have not seen the light. What the eye 
    sees not, the heart receives not. A man that never saw the sun, mid-night 
    and mid-day are alike to him; but the man that has seen the light, darkness 
    is wearisome to him, and he longs until the day break.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The world and their lusts were never made tasteless or 
    bitter to them. The gracious soul desires the light of God's countenance, 
    because gall and wormwood have been laid on the breasts of their lusts; and 
    so they cannot draw comfort from them. But as for others if the Lord do not 
    hear them, they know of another, to whom they can go. Hence they sit down 
    and take their rest.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because their hearts were never changed, and the 
    natural bent of their souls, go another way than to God. In the time of a 
    great flood, a river may have several streams, but still the great stream is 
    in the ordinary channel. So grace makes the affections run in a new channel, 
    and the great desire of the soul is after God, though there may be inferior 
    desires after the creatures in time of temptation, but when it ceases all go 
    right again in one channel. Most men have too many pursuits, and so some of 
    them must be neglected; when a wife has none but her husband, then all her 
    desire is towards him; but when she has a great many weeping hungry babes, 
    crying out after her, these arrest her affections and care. Let us now 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To consider the lamentable nature of this case. It 
    deserves to be lamented with tears of blood, that there should be such a 
    generation whose great desire is not after the light of the Lord's 
    countenance. It is lamentable if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is a sign they are of the multitude that go to 
    destruction, not of the few that are saved: that when the world is to be 
    divided they must quit their place among the gracious, and stand upon the 
    other side with the graceless.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That they have never seen the beauty of the Lord, and 
    the transcendent excellency of Christ. Had they seen this they could not 
    have so slighted him. His beautiful face, seen by the eye of faith, attracts 
    the heart, Song 1:3.</p>
<p align="justify">That they live unacquainted with themselves, with their 
    own heart's state and case. O what a silly empty thing is man without God! 
    Did they see the evil of sin, and the danger of their state while under it, 
    the favor of God would be their desire.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They are busy catching at shadows and let the 
    substance go. The soul of man will always be taken up about something. If it 
    be not going out after God it is going after the creature; and behold what 
    they are doing. "For my people have committed two evils, they have forsaken 
    me, the fountain of living waters, and hewn them out cisterns, broken 
    cisterns, that can hold no water." All these things are uncertain and 
    insufficient, greater in expectation than fruition.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, This will land them in everlasting darkness, 
    where the worm never dies, and where the fire shall not be quenched. Where 
    the light shall be down on them irrecoverably through all eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 3. Of comfort to those whose desire is the light of 
    the Lord's countenance above all and instead of all, and yet they are in 
    darkness and distressed with it. Their souls are vexed and disquieted 
    because the Lord hides his face from them. They have been seeking Christ, 
    but they found an empty grave. To which I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">I. It is well that you are sensible of your case, that 
    you are not like Samson, who knew not that the Lord was departed from him. 
    The knowledge of the disease is the first step to the cure. Now there is 
    another thing I would have you to know, and then you will be in a fair way 
    of recovery, and that is the cause of the distemper and darkness, why God 
    has withheld the light of his countenance from you. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider whether or not there has been a defect in 
    your preparation to meet the Lord. Perhaps you have not been at pains to 
    prepare yourselves, and so you may wonder more that the Lord has not made a 
    breach upon you, than that he has hidden his face from you, Song 3:1.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Look that there has been no sin unrepented of, no 
    guilt lying on your souls, some bosom lust, some of the old leaven, some 
    Achan in the camp, and if so, begin now and remove it, cast it out.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Look that you have not sat down on your preparation. 
    When we are secure, we are ever ready to fall. O it is hard for us to do 
    anything, and not to think much of it. And thus the soul, like the bee, may 
    drown itself in its own work. If so, mourn over it, and go to Christ for 
    pardon.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I would say to you, perhaps you complain more than 
    you have reason. The sun does not shine always equally clear, and there are 
    different degrees of light of the Lord's countenance, and if you have had 
    but a fainter light be thankful for it and wait for more. Then shall you 
    know, if you follow on to know the Lord; "his going forth is prepared as the 
    morning; and he shall come unto you, as the latter and former rain unto the 
    earth." Sometimes it is with the Christian as with Jocob, when he said, 
    "surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not." And this mistake may 
    arise from two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because they may feel the storm is not yet entirely 
    blown over, they may be still assaulted with doubts, fears and temptations. 
    The light may be only so strong as to keep them from being overcome, though 
    it do not presently dispel all their darkness, 2 Corinthians 12:7–9. This is 
    a mistake indeed for the light does put away the darkness only by degrees.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because it does not answer their expectations, or 
    comes not in the way they looked for it, Matthew 14:26. O how hard is it for 
    us to keep from setting limits to God. If God gives not all our asking, we 
    will not give him a receipt for what we receive. If he comes not the way we 
    looked for, we will not acknowledge that he comes at all. But if any 
    glimmerings of the light of his countenance have come through the cloud into 
    your souls, you will know it by these marks, 1. Where there are any new 
    discoveries made, there is light there. If a man see the motes in his room, 
    he knows the sun is up, though he see not the body of the sun. If you see 
    more of your own vileness, and are more humbled under a sense of the evils 
    of your hearts, that is a sign the light of the Lord has arisen upon you. 2. 
    Where there is heat it is a good sign. Do you feel your souls enamored with 
    Christ, that is a good sign. Do you hate sin more and love Christ more?</p>
<p align="justify">And though it is not noon day with you as with some 
    others, yet I would have you to be thankful. Because perhaps, it has not 
    been so dark night with you as with them. If you be not lifted up so high as 
    others, perhaps neither have you been plunged so deep as they were. That 
    which will lift up one will not be sufficient for another.</p>
<p align="justify">Be thankful also, because it is like you have not such 
    hard work to begin to as they have. God's children will not be permitted to 
    eat idle bread. There is commonly hard work for them that get a large meal. 
    It is observable that they that get the brightest manifestations, get also 
    the hardest services. Remember that sovereignty challenges a latitude. May 
    he not do with his own what he pleases. Sovereignty takes one piece of clay 
    and sets it on the throne, dandles one child on the knee, and leads another 
    to Heaven by the brink of Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall say this to you, that the desire of your 
    soul shall be satisfied. Fear not, for you shall see the salvation of the 
    Lord, and this I say, on these three grounds.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because that desire has the promise of God. "Open your 
    mouth wide, says he, and I will fill it." He will fill the hungry. God will 
    not leave his children always in the dark, seeing he has promised to return. 
    Do you then plead the promise of God. Faith in the promise is the hand 
    turning about the key that opens Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That desire is of God's own implanting. It is not a 
    flower that grows in nature's garden, and since he has given it, he will 
    accomplish it; for he has not given it in vain, nor only to torment the 
    creature. Nay it is a great mercy in itself, and so is a pledge of further 
    mercy, Hosea 2:14.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Lord never altogether frustrated such desires. 
    They will be importunate and resolute, and the Lord refuses none such, Luke 
    18:1–8.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 4. Then they are richly privileged on whom the Lord 
    has lift up the light of his countenance. I hope there may be some who came 
    sorrowing, and are going away rejoicing. The Lord has lifted up the light of 
    his countenance upon them, and the wounds of their souls are healed. "But 
    unto you that fear my name, says the Lord, shall the sun of righteousness 
    arise with healing in his wings, and you shall go forth, and grow up as 
    calves of the stall." Orders have been given and the prisoner is set at 
    liberty, by a broad view of the righteousness of the Mediator, Job 33:23, 
    24. Now sirs, many have desired to see the things which you see, and have 
    not seen them, therefore be thankful to the Lord, and acknowledge his 
    goodness. Let the high praises of God be in your mouth all the day long.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Walk humbly. Keep low sails. Though you be adorned 
    like the dove, with shining feathers, yet look to your black feet, your 
    black heart, and walk softly.</p>
<p align="justify">See also that you walk watchfully. Satan will attack you, 
    to rob you. A rash word, and a vain thought, a carnal laughter may be a door 
    to admit the tempter to rob you of your enjoyment.</p>
<p align="justify">Be making constant application to Christ, and glory more 
    in himself, than in his gifts.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Walk as a child of light, walk tenderly, and do 
    good to others. Walk prudently and tell your experiences, especially to the 
    indolent Christian, "for as iron sharpens iron, so does the countenance of a 
    man his friend." Tell them also to the distressed Christian. "When you are 
    converted strengthen your brethren. For this shall every one that is godly, 
    pray unto you in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great 
    waters, they shall not come near unto him." Tell them also to those weak 
    ones who withdraw from our communion. If they would believe that Christ 
    keeps communion with us, they would be tender of separating from us. "Thus 
    says the Lord of hosts, in those days it shall come to pass, that ten men 
    shall take hold, out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold 
    of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, we will go with you; for we have 
    heard, that God is with you." Amen.</p>
