    Jeremiah 14:7, "O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do you it 
    for your name's sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against 
    you."</p>
<p align="justify">IN the preceding part of the chapter, there is mournful 
    narration of a sad state in which the land was, by reason of a famine. 
    National sins bring on national judgments. In the words of the text, the 
    prophet prays for the removal of the judgment. In the text we have four 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A concession. "Though our iniquities testify against 
    us." He grants that their iniquities, which brought on the judgment and kept 
    it on, did testify against them; or, as the Hebrew, answered against them. 
    We have the same phrase, Isaiah 3:9, and 59:12. It is a metaphor taken from 
    judicatories, in which witnesses being in a process, and questions being put 
    to them, they answer, and testify against the guilty. Sin, as the devil, 
    first tempts, then accuses. When they came to make their address to God, 
    they found their sins at their right, witnessing against them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A petition. "Do you it." Take pity upon us, and 
    relieve us; arise for our help and our relief. They do not condescend upon 
    the particular thing which they would have him to do for their relief, He 
    knew many ways to bring it about; the prophet, therefore, would limit him to 
    no particular way, for beggars should not be choosers, and sovereignty must 
    be allowed a latitude.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We have their plea for mercy. "For your name's sake." 
    By this they acknowledge the truth of the testimony given in against them by 
    their sins, and justify God in his proceeding against them. They acknowledge 
    their own unworthiness of his favor. By the name of God, is understood God 
    himself. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runs into 
    it, and is safe." "I, even I, am he who blots out your transgression for 
    mine own sake, and will not remember your sins." "Help us," says the 
    Psalmist, "O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; and deliver 
    us and purge away our sins, for your name's sake." These last words, you 
    see, superadds this, namely, as he has manifested himself to his people. The 
    phrase seems to include a respect to a final cause, and that with respect to 
    his attributes, Exodus 34:5–7, and so they plead for the manifestation of 
    his own glory, the glory of his grace and mercy, that he would do it for 
    them. Joshua pleads thus, when their enemies were like to overcome them, 
    "And what will you do unto your great name?" And this is the advantage of 
    the people of God, that his glory is joined with their interests; and 
    particularly as to the judgment of famine. See Ezekiel 36:30, compared with 
    verse 32, where it appears that the glory of God suffered through their 
    reproach. There is in this plea, also, a respect to a meritorious cause, 
    which is none else but Messiah, Christ; of whom the Lord says his name is in 
    him, Exodus 23:21, and in whom his glory shines, 2 Corinthians 4:6. We must 
    not think the prophet here addresses himself to God, absolutely considered; 
    for his majesty would dazzle and confound the eyes of the holiest on earth; 
    but, even under the Old Testament, they directed their prayers towards the 
    temple as a type of Christ, Psalm 5:7; and they very well knew that the 
    glory of his name, which they urged in prayer, behooved to shine through the 
    Messiah.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A confession. The prophet confesses, in the name of 
    the church, backsliding; a grievous sin, a returning to sin after vows, 
    engagements, and resolutions against it; and after beginnings of a 
    reformation. Yes, that these backslidings were many. They had often gone 
    back in many points; and, adds he, "have sinned against you," where the 
    emphasis lies on the word you. As when David says, "against you; you only, 
    have I sinned." They had lifted up themselves against the sovereign Lord of 
    Heaven; even against you, to whom we must now come for help in our 
    affliction. It comes in as a reason, "for we have sinned against you;" 
    intimating that they had no hope but in his name; and if that would not do, 
    their case was desperate. But withal, it lays out before the Lord their deep 
    sinfulness, as that whereby his name might be rendered illustrious, in 
    coming over all their many backslidings.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That though the iniquities of the people of 
    God, when they are awakened, do testify against them; yet it is their duty 
    and disposition to hold on in their suit, pleading with him for a gracious 
    answer for his own name's sake. Or,</p>
<p align="justify">Though the people of God find their iniquities testify 
    against them in their addresses to God; yet they must and will hold on their 
    suit, improving God's own name's sake as their only plea for a favorable 
    answer. Here I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what it is for a man to find his iniquities 
    testify against him in his addresses to God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Why it is that sin is found thus testifying against 
    men.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I will speak a little to the plea, "For your name's 
    sake." We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what it is for a man to find his iniquities 
    testify against him in his addresses to God. Take these reflections upon it—</p>
<p align="justify">1. Sin is not dead when it is committed. Though it may be 
    buried and out of mind for a time, yet it is buried quick, and lives to be a 
    witness before the Lord, against the sinner. The act is transient, but the 
    guilt is of a permanent nature. "If you do not well," said God to Cain, "sin 
    lies at the door." Lies as a sleeping mastiff at the door, which will, 
    before long, awaken. "I will reprove you," says God to the sinner, "and set 
    them, (your sins,) in order before your eyes."</p>
<p align="justify">2. When the man draws near to God in the exercise of his 
    worship, sin meets him there; appears to him as a terrible Spirit. So it is 
    in the text, Isaiah 59:11–13. Many times the Christian's sin, which was 
    before out of his sight, meets with him before the throne of grace. When the 
    soul draws near to God, the brightness of his glory makes their spots to 
    appear. "Woe is me!" said Isaiah, "for I am undone; because I am a man of 
    unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine 
    eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts." Former sins then come to mind, 
    which makes David say, "Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my 
    transgressions." Present sinfulness is then also ready to stare the man in 
    the face.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Sin testifies two things for God against the man. 
    First, their sins witness their unworthiness of any favor from the Lord, and 
    makes them say, with the centurion, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should 
    come under my roof." And with Jacob, "I am not worthy of the least of all 
    the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed unto your servant." 
    Sins also testify against men their liableness to punishment, yes, to a 
    curse instead of a blessing, so that the soul is often made to fear some 
    remarkable judgment; for a guilty conscience is a terrible companion in the 
    presence of a holy God. When sin gives in such a testimony, no wonder they 
    stand trembling, fearing to hear the doom pronounced next.</p>
<p align="justify">4. This witness is convincing. So, in the text, we find 
    the panel denies not the testimony, but pleads for mercy. Sin, testifying 
    against the man before the Lord, stops the sinner's mouth. "I acknowledge my 
    transgressions," says David, "and my sin is ever before me." A man may shift 
    the conviction of others, and deny their testimony; but here, himself is 
    both the guilty person, the accuser, and the witness.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Upon this, the gracious soul is filled with holy 
    shame, and self-loathing. The person says, with Ezra, "O my God, I am 
    ashamed, and blush to lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are 
    increased over our head, and our trespass grown up unto the heavens." So the 
    publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to 
    Heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, "God be merciful to me a sinner." 
    Now his sin has found him out; and as a thief is ashamed when his crime is 
    discovered, so is that soul; and this holy shame is vented by confession, 
    self-judging, self-condemning, and self-abhorring. Then he has a difficulty 
    to get a name to express sufficiently his own vileness, and then he is the 
    chief of sinners in his own esteem.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, He is damped, and his confidence before the Lord 
    is marred as to any access to him, or obtaining favor at his hand. "For if 
    our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 
    Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God." 
    When the man lived near God, he had boldness and access with confidence unto 
    the Father; but now his backslidings stare him in the face, and it is much 
    if he be not quite overcome, and made to say, "my hope and strength is 
    perished from the Lord." Then faith has difficulties indeed to grapple with, 
    which may make it stagger; but then the soul must fall to the plea, "for his 
    own name's sake." I now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">11. To show how comes it, that sin is found thus 
    testifying against men.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It flows from the nature of sin and guilt upon an 
    enlightened conscience. God has said, "But if you will not do so, behold you 
    have sinned against the Lord; and be sure your sin will find you out." 
    Conscience is a tender part, and when it has light it cannot but testify 
    against the man, when he appears in the presence of an offended God. The 
    conscience of some is seared, and so they find nothing of this testimony; 
    but sin will lie down in the grave with them; and awake when they awake.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a punishment from the Lord for former 
    backslidings and miscarriages. Sin that is sweet in the mouth, is hereby 
    often made bitter in the belly Confidence with God is no small mercy, and 
    the want of it can be no small judgment to them that know the happiness of 
    such a case.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, God so orders it, that it may be a mean to humble 
    them, and make them more watchful against sin for the time to come. Then the 
    Lord says to them, "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your 
    backslidings shall reprove you: know, therefore, and see that it is an evil 
    thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and that my fear 
    is not in you, says the Lord God of Hosts." "What fruit had you then in 
    those things, whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is 
    death." By these, the soul is brought to repenting Israel's resolution. "I 
    will go and return to my first husband; for then it was better with me than 
    now." And the bankrupts resolve, in the Lord's strength, that if they had 
    their stock recovered again, they will look better to it.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall speak a little to the plea. "For your name's 
    sake."</p>
<p align="justify">I told you in the explanation, that it imports two 
    things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. That we must plead with him for his Christ's sake; and 
    when guilt stares us in the face, we must look to God through the veil of 
    Christ's flesh. A guilty conscience presents to the sinner a God armed with 
    vengeance. It is then the wisdom of the sinner to desire, Exodus 20:18, 19. 
    When the avenger of blood pursues, let us flee to the city of refuge; and 
    when we are to appear before the Lord, we must embrace Christ in the arms of 
    faith. It was the custom of the Molossians, when they were to seek a favor 
    of their prince, they took up his son in their arms. This is the way in the 
    court of Heaven. This is a safe and sure way, for in him the father is well 
    pleased, and we shall be accepted in the beloved.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must plead with him for his glory's sake. Punishing 
    of sin glorifies God much, but pardoning of sin glorifies him more. He is 
    tender of his own glory, and so should we. So our Lord teaches us to pray, 
    "for your is the glory." When God hears, the benefit redounds to us, the 
    glory to him; and so we are to make use of it as a plea for a hearing; and 
    this way of pleading empties a soul of all confidence in itself, and gives 
    glory to God.</p>
<p align="justify">For APPLICATION. We, especially such of us as are to sit 
    down at the table of the Lord, may here see our case and our cure (as for 
    those who will not seek God, their sins cannot testify against them before 
    the throne of grace, seeing they come not there; but before the tribunal 
    they shall testify, and there they must come) when we are thinking on this 
    solemn address unto God. If we look a little into our consciences, we will 
    be fair to see a tribunal erected there, and our sins giving in a testimony 
    against us; and what else means that terror and dejectedness of spirit that 
    sometimes seizes professors upon the news of such an occasion approaching? 
    What is the matter, but that they hear the bridegroom comes, and they are 
    not ready to go out to meet him. The people of God have been filled with joy 
    at such a time, and it is a guilty conscience, surely, that makes it 
    otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, what else means that fear of not attaining to 
    communion with God in the ordinance. The soul is afraid that all go wrong; 
    that the Lord turn to them the back and not the face, and that they meet a 
    judgment instead of a blessing. What guilt creates those fears? Now I shall 
    condescend upon some particular iniquities that will readily stare us in the 
    face, while we are making this address to God.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Our former unworthy communicating. Have we not handled 
    the holy things of God with unclean hands, and profaned the ordinance by 
    rash approaches to it? No wonder this testifies against us now, and mars our 
    confidence before the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Our living at a distance from God, and not endeavoring 
    to keep up communion with God in our ordinary walk. This, in our approaches 
    to God on solemn occasions, may meet us with that entertainment which God 
    gave the Israelites, when he said to them, "Go and cry unto the gods which 
    you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation." They 
    that are habitually prepared have less to do than others, to get actual 
    preparation. But O! it is a sad reflection for the soul to think, now I am 
    to seek access to God in this solemn duty; but ah! I have slighted it when I 
    might have had it; and will the Lord give it me now, will he answer me when 
    I call.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The sins by which religion has been wounded, and by 
    which we have given occasion to the enemy to blaspheme. Thus David's sin was 
    ever before him. No wonder the soul in this case be afraid to sit down at 
    the Lord's table with his people, lest the Lord be provoked to send some 
    judgment upon him, by which his glory, bespattered with the sinner's folly, 
    may be vindicated.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Our returning to these sins which we have sometimes 
    renounced, against which we have resolved and vowed. Conscience may tell 
    some of us we have returned with the dog to our vomit. Backslidings stared 
    them in the face in the text, and marred their confidence with the Lord. 
    Backsliding is very provoking in the sight of God; and no wonder that the 
    sense of it make the soul to tremble in approaching to God.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Our not improving access to God, when we had it. 
    Sometimes people are at great pains to get communion with God, and nearness 
    to him; and when they get it, how easily do they let it go. "The slothful 
    man roasts not that which he takes in hunting;" and therefore no wonder that 
    they meet with that challenge which may make them stagger, "Have I been a 
    wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? Wherefore say my people we are 
    Lords; we will come no more unto you?"</p>
<p align="justify">6. Present indisposition of soul for the work to which we 
    are called. Solemn ordinances require solemn preparation. When the 
    bridegroom is coming our lamps should be trimmed, but it is to be feared 
    many of us are far from it. How can a dead and stupid frame of spirit fail 
    to bring us heavy tidings, and prophecy evil things concerning us?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The sin of our nature, the spring and source of 
    all these. The evil heart, "the heart deceitful above all things, and 
    desperately wicked." That corrupt bent and inclination of the soul to evil, 
    and evil continually. That body of sin, which makes us so unmeat for the 
    communion of the body of Christ, and for all duties. This is that which 
    often stares them in the face, so as it looks them out of countenance before 
    the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">But what shall a sinner do, who has these or the like 
    testifying against him, and marring his confidence before God?</p>
<p align="justify">1. You must not give over, you must plead in opposition 
    to them all. Satan sometimes gets advantage here. But pray consider your 
    need. Mercy you must have, God's favor you cannot want. Therefore you must 
    reason with yourselves as the lepers at the gate of Samaria, and lay down 
    Esther's noble resolution, "that you will go in unto the king, and if you 
    perish, you perish."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Betake yourselves to this plea in the text, and plead 
    with God for his own name's sake. He will yet be gracious unto you. 
    Acknowledge that you are unworthy of any favor, that you deserve to be made 
    a monument of his vengeance; but this plea, for God's own name's sake, being 
    left, you must improve it in your addresses to God. Give away yourselves to 
    the Lord Jesus Christ, receive him as he has offered himself to you. And 
    then,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Plead the sufferings of Christ, and his satisfaction 
    to justice. Plead the sufficiency of his merit, whereby he is able to save 
    to the uttermost; the design of his sufferings to save sinners, and even the 
    chief of sinners; the fruit of his sufferings; and cast yourself on Christ, 
    resolved, if you perish, to perish at his footstool, and there will be no 
    fear. Here you will get an answer to all the objections that conscience and 
    the law can form against you.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Plead free grace and mercy, Exodus 34:6, 7. The sun 
    shines without hire, and God is gracious to sinners, because he will be 
    gracious. Are our sins great, grace will be the more magnified in pardoning 
    them. Wherefore is free grace manifested, but to be communicated? Depth of 
    misery is the most fit object for exceeding riches of grace. This pleading 
    is very acceptable to God. "The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, 
    in those that hope in his mercy."</p>
<p align="justify">Plead the glory of his name in the world, Joshua 7:9. you 
    are called by his name. Without his help you cannot stand; and if you fall, 
    his name will be dishonored. If you get access to him, and communion with 
    him, you shall live. If he send down the influences of his Spirit, you shall 
    bring forth much fruit, and this will tend to his glory, John 15:8. If he 
    deny his influences, you will be withered creatures, and so God will be 
    dishonored.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Plead his word. Say, "Lord, you have magnified 
    your word above all your name." All men are liars, but he is faithful and 
    cannot deny himself. Get hold of a promise, and in time of need bring it 
    forth, as Tamar did Judah's signet, etc., Genesis 38:25. This was Jacob's 
    way, "And you said, I will surely do you good." O! but I fear the promises 
    belong not to me. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Lay you hold on Christ as he is freely offered, 
    and then be sure all the promises are your, for they all meet in him. Amen.</p>
