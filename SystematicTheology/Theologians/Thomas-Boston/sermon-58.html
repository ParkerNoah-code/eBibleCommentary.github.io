        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          1 Kings 16:21, "And Elijah said, How long halt you between two
          opinions?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          AMONG the crowds of irreligious men in the visible church, there are
          few, if any, so positively determined against God and religion, as
          never to have a thought of repentance and reformation. Reason and
          interest appear so much on the side of religion, that where conscience
          possesses any power at all, one can hardly fail in having sometimes
          favorable thoughts on that side. But indecision and unsettledness in
          that weighty matter ruins men. It is so long before they come to a
          point, that death often overtakes them before they have got the matter
          fixed; and they are set beyond the possibility of doing anything for
          their souls, before ever they have resolved firmly what to do for
          them. The text is Elijah's expostulation with a great assembly in that
          dangerous case. The worship of Baal was set up, and authorised in
          Israel by Ahab, and patronized by his courtiers. Thence the body of
          the people, though they did not utterly renounce the worship of
          Jehovah, yet they were greatly corrupted with that idolatry. God had
          on this account sent a famine on them, and, though it had continued
          three years and a half, it had not reformed them. But Ahab lays the
          blame of this calamity on Elijah; Elijah retorts it boldly on him.
          They agree that all Israel be gathered with Baal's priests, who were
          dispersed over all the country, and the priests of the groves, who
          were Jezebel's chaplains, that the whole matter between God and Baal,
          Elijah and Ahab, might be decided. The assembly being convened, Elijah
          comes to them, and, without observing any ceremony, or beginning to
          intercede with God for rain to them, he falls a-pleading God's cause
          with them, expostulating with them on God's behalf, as in the text:
          "How long (said he) halt you between two opinions?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In which expostulation, we have,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The matter of it; their halting between two opinions. Here he
          attacks them on two points, and charges them with a grievous fault, an
          unaccountable weakness in the most weighty concerns of their souls.—He
          charges them,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) With weak and wavering heads. They had two opinions; by the one
          they had a value for Baal, by the other for Jehovah. Not only did some
          of that people in their judgment declare for Baal, others for Jehovah,
          but the same persons at one time thought it best to follow Baal, at
          another time Jehovah; they were undetermined in this matter of the
          greatest importance. Their thoughts in this case were wavering, going
          hither and thither, like top-branches of trees going with the wind,
          which is the Holy Ghost's own metaphor in the original word of the
          text.—They were chargeable,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) With unsteady feet. They halted between these two, and they went
          from Baal to the Lord, and from the Lord to Baal again. Thus, passing
          from side to side, they were poor lame souls, (this is the Holy
          Ghost's own metaphor), they did not only limp, like men lame of one
          leg, (the best Christians carry such a halt with them, until they come
          to the grave), but they were like men lame of both legs, for this is
          the import of the original word, 2 Samuel 4:4. They crooked to both
          sides, they went wavering from side to side, never straight, one time
          they were for Baal, another time for Jehovah, they were never steadily
          fixed.—In the expostulation, there is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The manner of it: "How long will you halt?" etc. They had been
          several years in that case, and yet were not come to a point. One
          might think the case was not so very difficult, whether Jehovah or
          Baal should be their choice; but wonder not at it, for the case is
          even as plain between the Lord and your lusts and idols, yet year
          after year you cannot come to a point. The phrase is urgent; it
          imports,—the shamefulness, the baseness of their conduct, that they
          should be so long in deciding in a matter so very clear, stumbling at
          that rate in broad day-light;—its grievousness to the Spirit of God;
          he was so weary with bearing with them, that he would gladly have them
          come to a point, and therefore rouses them up to it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From the expostulation thus explained, I would observe the following
          doctrines, namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. That to be still wavering and undecided in the absolute
          and final choice between the Lord and idols, is most abominable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. That an unequal and unsteady walk, here-away,
          there-away, between the Lord and idols, is an unaccountable and
          abominable way of walking through the world.—These I shall shortly
          consider in their order.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. That to be still wavering and undecided in the absolute
          and final choice between the Lord and idols, is most abominable.—In
          speaking to this I shall only drop a few things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. For explication of the point.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. For confirmation of it. And then,</p>
        <p align="justify">III. Make some application.—I am,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To explain the point.—In order to this, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the Lord and idols are suitors for the heart of every man and
          woman that hears the gospel; and because that idols have the first
          love, they strive to retain it, and the Lord comes to recover it.
          Lusts court it, and therefore the gospel teaches to deny them, Titus
          2:12, "denying ungodliness and worldly lasts, and while it thus
          teaches, it brings a better offer. The devil, the world, and the
          corrupt nature, are proxies to agent for our lusts: the Lord's Spirit,
          his ministers, and conscience, act for the Lord.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That the sinner's heart is urged with offers and arguments on both
          hands. God makes his offers, and urges them with the strongest
          arguments, taken from the certainty of eternal happiness, or misery,
          of enjoying his unspeakable love, or incurring his dread displeasure:
          Isaiah 55:2, "Wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not
          bread, and your labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken diligently
          unto me, and eat you that which is good, and let your souls delight
          themselves in fatness." Satan is not behind hand in pains to urge his
          offers, he plies them with allurements of present profit and pleasure,
          most suited to the corrupt heart, which naturally gapes for
          them.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That there can be no enjoying of both together: Matthew 6:24, "No
          man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love
          the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You
          cannot serve God and mammon." The Lord will not deal shares with lusts
          and idols, the offer is peremptory on other terms, "If you take me,
          let these go." If the matter could be agreed between the Lord and his
          rival idols, the wavering soul would soon be at a point, and would
          embrace both. But that cannot be: if the Lord be received, he must
          have the crown, and the most beloved lusts must be nailed to the
          cross: Galatians 5:24, "And they that are Christ's have crucified the
          flesh, with the affections and lusts."—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That the matter must be determined by the sinner's free choice:
          Joshua 24:15, "Choose you this day whom you will serve." The Lord will
          not take possession without the sinner's consent, for it is the heart
          he seeks, and if that be wanting, there is no bargain. And the choice
          must be an absolute and a final one; there must be a final deciding of
          this cause, so that thereafter the soul may cleave to the one, with
          full purpose of heart, and altogether abandon the other.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That the Lord requires the sinner's decided answer. But here
          the sinner wavers; he is neither determined to give up altogether with
          the Lord, nor to give up wholly with his lusts; sometimes he is almost
          persuaded, but never altogether. So there comes still one off-put on
          the back of another; and when the sinner has been at the advising and
          deciding this business days and years, he is as far from a point the
          last day as the first.—I am now to propose some considerations,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. For confirmation of this point.—Consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That there is no competition here in point of real value. What is
          the dead idol Baal, in comparison with Jehovah, the living God? What
          are our filthy lusts, in comparison with Christ? Jeremiah 23:28, "The
          prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my
          word, let him speak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the
          wheat? says the Lord." It is a disgrace on our reason, to put them in
          the balance together, and argues a fearful blindness with which
          mankind are seized, once to entertain a doubt which to
          choose.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That it is ingratitude of the deepest dye, not readily to fall in
          with the offer. When the potter is making suit to his own clay, the
          mighty God to his own creature worm man, to put off his offer, because
          of the craving of the heart after filthy lusts, these brats of Hell,
          and spawn of the old serpent, is certainly ungrateful. The Lord might
          have left us with them, to have made the best of them we could, which
          would have been no better than death; for what else could have
          resulted from our drinking that cup of poison? But now, when he comes
          to offer us life, how horrible is it to be wavering and undetermined,
          whether we will accept of the Lord and life, or not!—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That this warning is on a matter of the utmost weight, and
          what we have not one tomorrow allowed us to advise upon. Our souls lie
          at stake, eternal salvation or damnation depend on our choice; if we
          make the Lord our choice, we are happy forever; if you do not, we are
          ruined forever; it is, "Today, if you will hear his voice," Psalm
          95:7; so that, if death carry you off undetermined, your eternal
          destruction is unalterably fixed; and what an abominable thing is it,
          then, to be still wavering?—I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To make some application of the subject. And with this design, I
          would expostulate with you halters and undetermined sinners, who are
          not yet come to a point in the matter of your choice between Christ
          and your lusts, in the words of the text, "How long halt you between
          two opinions?" How long will it be before you come to a point how to
          dispose of that heart of yours? You have had many rich gospel-calls
          from the Lord, and many communion-calls, and yet you have not freely
          abandoned your idols, and made choice of the Lord, to this day. Still
          you are halting, undetermined, and wavering. How long shall it be
          thus?—In managing this expostulation, I would ask,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Who are the wavering, undetermined halters between the Lord and
          their lasts?—I answer,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) You who to this day never found the time to break your covenant
          with your lusts, and to enter into covenant with God, either in
          pretense or reality. Are there not some here, who never gave their
          personal consent to the baptismal covenant, who are utter strangers to
          personal covenanting with God in Christ? they have not even expressly
          in words renewed the covenant made for them in baptism, much less have
          they ratified it with their own solemn consent before the Lord: they
          are woeful halters, but without making this choice they can never see
          Heaven: Ephesians 2:12, "Strangers from the covenants of promise,
          having no hope, and without God in the world."—You are the wavering,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Who time after time slight the sacrament of the Lord's supper,
          not preparing yourselves to partake of it. What makes you always and
          constantly mere spectators and onlookers of the seal of the covenant,
          and that solemn engagement to be the Lord's, but that you are halters
          between the Lord and your lusts? Were there a bargain in your offer,
          of which all the partners were obliged to strike hands with the party
          that makes it with them, and you stood by, and would not give your
          hand; would not that prove you not to be determined as yet for the
          bargain? You would be glad to have the bargain ratified between God
          and you, if you were really for it; Psalm 68:31, "Ethiopia shall soon
          stretch out her hands to God."—To this some may object,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We would gladly take the sacrament, but they will not give us tokens
          of admission.—To this I answer,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What hinders your receiving them, but your gross ignorance, or your
          ungodly and scandalous life, which certainly ought to do it: Matthew
          7:6, "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs." But why do not you
          get the knowledge of God and religion, and reform your lives, that you
          may sit down at the Lord's table? And here lies the matter, you are
          not so far determined yet as to quit your lusts, for all the communion
          with God that is to be had in the sacrament.—Such of you are halting,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Who have had your convictions of sin, and are in so far
          satisfied, that you should have given up with it, but your hearts were
          never brought to part with it to this day. Are there not many who are
          standing undetermined this day on the carcases of their murdered
          convictions? Acts 24:25, "Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way
          for this time, when I have a more convenient season, I will call for
          you." They have been lashed by their consciences, to drive them to the
          Lord from their lusts; nay, they had much ado to resist these
          lashings; but, after all, these impressions are worn off, and they are
          not yet determined.—Such are wavering,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) Who have (often perhaps) been aiming at the covenant, but always
          stuck at one thing. you have been brought to a point in many things,
          but one thing you could never yet get over. O miserable halter between
          God and the idol of jealousy! shall that one thing mar the winning of
          your soul? If you be not content with all the articles of the
          covenant, without exception, you have your choice to make, yet you are
          not determined; Mark 10:21, "Jesus said unto him, One thing you lack,"
          &amp;c.—Such are halting,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) Who are still at fast-and-loose with God, and whom nothing can
          bind, who do with their vows, as the dog with his collar, that slips
          it off and on as he pleases: Psalm 78:36, 37, "Nevertheless, they did
          flatter him with their month, and they lied onto him with their
          tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
          steadfast in his covenant." There are many of our communicants of this
          sort, who come under the vows of God very lightly, and as lightly soon
          after slip out from under the tie; the truth is, they never consider
          the matter with due seriousness. They make choice of the Lord, but, in
          very deed, their hearts were never in earnest determined.—Such of you
          are wavering,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, And in a word, who have not expressly embraced God and Christ,
          but cleave to your lusts. Our Lord has often come to you in the
          gospel, requiring your last answer, but you have neither yet given it,
          nor will you either plainly say you will betake yourselves to your
          lusts and idols for altogether, nor are you come the length of an
          honest resolve to give over with them for altogether. You are
          undoubtedly woeful undetermined halters.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. I must ask at you, How long will you halt, and be undetermined?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Have you not halted long enough already between God and your
          lusts? 1 Peter 4:3, "For the time past of our life may suffice us to
          have wrought the will of the Gentiles." Have you not often enough sent
          away the Lord in his messengers groaning from you, because you could
          not be won yet?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Young halters, may not you, after ten, fifteen, and twenty years,
          or more, be at a point whether you will be the Lord's or not? I assure
          you, God has been at a point with many one in that time, who never got
          your length, but their states are determined in another world already,
          without possibility of alteration. Every seven years you have been in
          the world, you have had an year of Sabbaths, in these Sabbaths many,
          many a call. And will you yet be undetermined?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Old halters, may not you be at a point, after thirty, forty,
          fifty, or sixty years you have taken to advise in? will you halt on,
          until you slip into a grave, into Hell, undetermined. All the sermons
          you have heard, the communions you have waited on, even all the rods
          and the mercies you have met with, have left you where they found you,
          as undetermined as ever, and will you still go away this day as
          undetermined as you came?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, How can you be at ease as long as such a weighty matter is
          undetermined? Poor soul! while you are halting, you are standing on
          the brink of the pit, and whether death or life shall be your lot,
          whether Heaven or Hell, is still as to you undetermined. Until you
          determine the point to be the Lord's, and to renounce all your idols,
          Satan has the hold of you, and there is nothing between death and you
          but one step, you hang over the pit by the long-worn thread of divine
          patience; and whenever that gives way, you are lost forever: John
          3:36, "He who believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath
          of God abides on him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Do you not wonder, that God has waited so long upon you, that he
          has not taken your slights and scorns for your final answer? Is it not
          surprising, that he has not recalled his ambassadors, and denounced
          war against you, to be carried on forever? You must needs wonder that
          it is not so, when you consider the infinite greatness of him who
          makes suit to you, the baseness and vileness of those whom he courts,
          and the abominable competitors which you prefer to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) Are you not afraid lest the Lord halt, and proceed no farther in
          seeking after you? that this may be the last call that ever you may
          get? Luke 14:24, "For I say unto you, that none of these men which
          were bidden, shall taste of my supper." Sit this call, and who knows
          but the Lord may from this time leave you to your lusts? Psalm 81:11,
          12, "But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would
          none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts and they
          walked in their own counsels." Hosea 4:17, "Ephraim is joined to
          idols, let him alone." Saying, Cease my Spirit, cease conscience,
          ministers, ordinances, judgments, mercies; give that man no more
          disturbance in the embraces of his lusts, let them hang by him, and he
          by them, until they sink him into Hell, and lie there as a mountain of
          lead on him forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) Do you not know, the longer you halt, it will be the harder to
          come to a point for God? the longer you hold off from the Lord, you
          will be the more reluctant to come away; Proverbs 6:10, "Yet a little
          sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep." He
          who is not fit this day, will be unfitter tomorrow; for lusts, through
          continuance, grow more and more strong, and the devil, that comes at
          first alone, afterwards his name is Legion, for they are many. I aver,
          that it had been telling many of us, that they had struck the iron
          many years ago, when it was hotter than it is now.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Halt as long as you will, you must not only be determined for
          the Lord, and against all your lusts, but also you must be joined to
          the Lord, and separated from them actually, else you are ruined
          forever. The case is plain, Mark 16:16, "He who believes not shall be
          damned."—Ezekiel 18:30, "Repent, and turn from all your
          transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin."—Matthew 18:3,
          "Except you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not
          enter into the kingdom of Heaven." So, if you have any mind to be free
          from the wrath to come, unless you have a mind to take your hazard
          with your lusts through all eternity, while God is God, to pursue the
          quarrel for the slight you put on him, you must come to a point, and
          be determined for God, and give up with all your lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, Sirs, there are two things lying before you this day, of one of
          which you are to take your choice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You must either give up with God, Christ, Heaven, and glory, quit
          all your part in the covenant of grace, the purchase of Christ, and
          his death, freely, and betake yourselves to your lusts, idols, and
          sinful courses, and make the best of them you can to live and die with
          them. Satan is fond of your making this choice. Or,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You must give up with your lusts, idols, and sinful courses, freely
          quit your part in them, not excepting your darling lust, and betake
          yourselves to the Lord in his covenant, taking this day God the Father
          for your Father, God the Son for your Savior, God the Holy Spirit for
          your Sanctifier, Christ for your Prophet, to be led by his word and
          Spirit; Christ for your Priest, to be saved by his obedience and death
          only; Christ for your King, to be ruled and governed by him according
          to his will absolutely. The Lord is willing that you make this your
          choice, and kindly invites the worst of you to it; Revelation 3:20,
          "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and
          open the door, I will come in to him, and I will sup with him, and he
          with me." And ch. 22:17, "And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and
          let him that hears say, Come: and let him that is athirst come; and
          whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Nay, he commands
          you to make this choice: 1 John 3:23, "And this is his commandment,
          that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ." And so
          earnest is he in this invitation, that he will pass all your former
          slights, if you will but now fall in with this offer: Ezekiel 18:22,
          "All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be
          mentioned; in his righteousness that he has done he shall live." Now,
          there is the choice in both parts, what say you to it? Joshua 24:15,
          "Choose you this day whom you will serve."—I demand your answer. What
          answer shall I return?—your final answer, for I cannot say that ever
          our Master will send me again to you on this errand.—Are there any
          here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Who will give that answer, Jeremiah 2:25, "There is no hope; no;
          for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go." O Sirs! take
          your word again, we are reluctant to carry back that word; why will
          you die? why will you destroy yourselves? If we saw a cup of poison in
          your hand, which you would not part with, but would drink, we would
          flee to you, mix our blood with yours, before you should get it drunk;
          but what can we do in this case, but cry, O do yourselves no harm! and
          protest before God, angels, men, and your own selves, that your blood
          is on your own head.—Are there any here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Who will give that answer, Jeremiah 3:22, "Behold, we come unto
          you, for you are the Lord our God."—Job 34:32, "If I have done
          iniquity, I will do so no more." Then, I call Heaven and earth to
          record, you are at a point for our Lord never to go back; that it is
          an everlasting bargain between God in Christ and you; that he is
          yours, and you are his; that although this bargain between our Lord
          and you has been many times back and fore, it is now fully and finally
          concluded, you are married now, and there is no room for any other
          suitors. O come, then, to your Lord's table with a holy boldness, and
          get the covenant sealed!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Is that your answer, Acts 24:25, "Go your way for this time,
          when I have a convenient season, I will call for you?" You say you
          will advise upon it. I declare we cannot take that answer: our
          commission does not bear us to indulge you even until tomorrow, in
          advising upon a matter of such importance: Hebrews 4:7, "Today, if you
          will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." Nay, we cannot allow you
          even another hour or half-hour in hesitation: 2 Corinthians 6:2,
          "Behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation." Give
          your answer, therefore, instantly, I peremptorily claim it; if you
          delay longer, you may be in Hell before tomorrow, nay, next hour, it
          may be, next moment. What do you hesitate upon?—whether you will obey
          God or the devil?—whether you will cast the kindled coals of Hell out
          of your bosom, or not?—whether you will travel in that narrow road
          which leads to life, or in that broad road which will land you in
          destruction?—in short, whether you will live forever, or perish
          eternally? Oh! Sirs, be wise before it be too late, halt no longer, I
          beseech you, between these two opinions: "Today if you will hear his
          voice; harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, the day of
          temptation in the wilderness." When a gracious God is now calling you,
          "Turn you, turn you, why will you die, O house of Israel?" let the
          echo of your souls, and the answer of your tongues be, "Behold, we
          come unto you, for you are the Lord our God."

        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</b></p>
        <p align="justify">
          IN the ordinance of the Lord's supper, there is to be seen Jacob's
          ladder, with its foot set on the earth, and the top thereof reaching
          unto Heaven, Genesis 28:12. We trust you have been essaying to mount
          it, though perhaps you are yet not far from the ground. O that you may
          have freely entered upon the first step! I must, however, warn you,
          whoever you be, that are looking upwards towards the place to which
          the top reaches, namely, Heaven, that there is such a voice to you
          from Heaven in our text, as came to David from the castle of Zion,
          when he set himself to win it, 2 Samuel 5:6, "Except you take away the
          blind and the lame, you shall not come in hither." 1st, Unless the
          blind mind and heart that is still wavering in the choice between the
          Lord and idols be taken away, and you can be determined absolutely and
          finally for the Lord, you cannot come in hither. Of this we have
          discoursed already.—There is a second voice. Except the lame feet
          whereby one is still going from side to side in practice, between the
          Lord and idols, be taken away, you cannot come in hither. To this we
          are now to attend, in considering,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. That an unequal and an unsteady walk, here-away
          there-away, between the Lord and idols, is an unaccountable and
          abominable way of walking through the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing from this, it is proposed to show,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. What is to be accounted such a walking.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. The evil of this way of walking.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The causes of this unsteady walking; when we shall also point out
          some remedies against it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Make some improvement.—I am,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show what is to be accounted such a walking.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Random-walking is such a walking: Leviticus 26:21, "And if you walk
          contrary to me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times
          more plagues upon you, according to your sins." The original word,
          "contrary," may be rendered, as by accident, at random, at all
          adventures. There is a generation that are at best but
          random-customers to religion, who take no more of it than they readily
          meet with. Their religion sits so light on them, that in their way
          through the world they take it as it comes to them. As the fashion of
          the time turns, they face as the stream runs about. They conform
          themselves to the taste and humor of whatever company they fall in
          with: they become a prey to every temptation, and are picked up like
          straying beasts by the first finder. Beware of this: that day you get
          to Heaven in this way, God and Baal shall be reconciled. Set up your
          mark in religion, and press unto it. Lay down a principle for God, and
          hold by it, however times, companies, or temptations may seduce you:
          Philippians 3:15, "I press towards the mark for the prize of the high
          calling of God in Christ Jesus." Acts 11:23, "And exhorted them all,
          that with purpose of heart they should cleave unto the Lord;" that is,
          abide by his side with full purpose, laid down and determined
          beforehand.—I observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Wavering-walking is such a walking: Hebrews 10:23, "Let us hold
          fast the profession of our faith, without wavering." When men are
          still unsettled in their way, hither and thither, are wavering in
          their purposes and practice, one day for God, another for the devil,
          and their lusts like men in an ague, with their hot and cold fits by
          turns, at one time destroying what at another time they were building
          up, they are never fixed. Hence they will be one day at the table of
          the Lord, another at the table of drunkards. Like water-birds,
          sometimes they will be soaring aloft towards Heaven in the exercises
          of religion, and quickly again swimming in their lusts, and over head
          and ears in the cares, profits, pleasures, and vanities of the world.
          Sometimes they will appear so serious in religion, that one would
          think they would never go back again to their sinful courses: anon,
          they give themselves the swing in their sinful courses, as they would
          never look back again to religion. Take heed of this; waverers will
          never get up the hill to Zion: James 1:6, 7, 8, "But let him ask in
          faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavers is like a wave of the sea,
          driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he
          shall receive anything of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in
          all his ways." Go straight forward in the Lord's way, as one that is
          resolute for God and his way: Proverbs 4:25, 26, 27, "Let your eyes
          look right on, and let your eye-lids look straight before you. Ponder
          the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established. Turn not
          to the right hand nor to the left, remove your foot from evil."—I
          observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Unequal walking is such a walking: Proverbs 26:7, "The legs of the
          lame are not equal." The parts of the conversation of many answer no
          better than a long leg and a short one do. In the church they are
          saints, at home they are devils; in their profession they are fair, in
          their practice they are foul and false; in their words the world is
          nothing, but in their affection it is their all. Their practice is
          made up of contradictions. They agree not with themselves, how can
          they with God? They pretend piety towards God, yet make no conscience
          of duty, mercy, and justice towards man: Matthew 23:23, "Woe to you,
          Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay tithe of mint, anise,
          and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law,
          judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not left
          the others undone." A wide conscience in substantials, and narrow in
          circumstantials of religion, is a conscience of a profane make. Beware
          of this; see the emblem of these folk, Proverbs 26:23, "Burning lips,
          and a wicked heart, are like a potsherd covered with silver dross."
          The potsherd will be broken in pieces at length. Labor to have your
          whole conversation of a piece, if ever you would see Heaven: James
          3:10, "Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My
          brethren, these things ought not to be so."—I observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Partial and divided walking is such a walking: Hosea 10:2, "Their
          heart is divided." They keep not with one master, but in some things
          serve the Lord, in other things their own lusts. They would make void
          the commands of God; some they will comply with, others they will not
          regard. They will strain at a gnat in some things, and in others
          swallow a camel. At a communion, or under a conviction, they say, as
          in Deuteronomy 5:27, "Speak you unto us all that the Lord our God
          shall speak unto you, and we will hear it, and do it." But when it
          comes to a laboring in their work, they will resolve to do, but they
          cannot: Proverbs 20:4, "The sluggard will not plough, by reason of the
          cold." They have their particular idols of jealousy, which they can by
          no means part with. Beware of this; be universal in your respect to
          God's commandments, otherwise you will be clothed with shame at
          length: Psalm 119:6, "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect
          unto all your commandments." The straight soul says, as in verse 128,
          "I esteem all your precepts concerning all things to be right, and I
          hate every false way."—I shall now go on to show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The evil of this way of walking. I shall sum up this in these four
          things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a walking highly dishonorable and offensive to God:
          Revelation 3:15, 16, "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor
          hot; I would you were cold or hot. So than, because you are lukewarm,
          and neither cold nor hot, I will spue you out of my mouth." How could
          an affectionate husband take it, to have his wife gadding after other
          lovers? And, O how dishonorable is it to God, that those who have
          given themselves away to him should be found hanging about the doors
          of the world, and their lusts? Friends' wounds pierce deepest; and
          therefore many do more dishonor God, and disgrace religion, by their
          uneven walk, their halting between two opinions, than if they should
          go over entirely to the devil's side in the world: Ezekiel 20:39, "As
          for you, O house of Israel! thus says the Lord God, Go you, serve you
          every one his idols, but pollute you my holy name no more with your
          gifts and with your idols."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It a walking which is most grievous and offensive to the serious
          and godly. With what concern does Elijah complain of it here! They are
          a heavy burden in the ship of the church of God; and the lighter they
          are in their fleeting and flowing, the heavier their case lies on
          serious souls: Psalm 55:12, 13, 14, "For it was not an enemy that
          reproached me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he who hated
          me, that did magnify himself against me, then I would have hidden
          myself from him. But it was you, a man, mine equal, ray guide, and
          mine acquaintance. We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the
          house of God in company." And no wonder, considering that the name of
          God is blasphemed by reason of such walkers; and they are the worst
          enemies religion has: Philippians 3:18, "For many walk, of whom I have
          told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the
          enemies of the cross of Christ; whose end is destruction, whose God is
          their belly, and who mind earthly things." When two armies are in the
          field, as is the case between Christ and the devil, absolute deserters
          are dangerous; but such as remain in the camp, yet keep up a
          correspondence with the enemy, are still more so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a walking which is hardening to the wicked: Proverbs 28:4,
          "They that forsake the law, praise the wicked." They betray the cause
          of religion to them, and open their mouths to blaspheme and reproach
          the way of God: Romans 2:23, 24, "You that make your boast of the law,
          through breaking the law dishonor you God? For the name of God is
          blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written." Do you
          think that your coming to a communion table, your waiting on
          ordinances, public, private, or secret, will ever commend the way of
          the Lord to onlookers, while you make not conscience of tender walking
          in the whole of your conversation, even in your natural and civil
          actions? Nay, truly, the sinful liberty you take to yourselves, even
          as others, will make your religion loathsome to them. I have found
          some have been restrained from the table of the Lord by observing the
          unsuitable walk of others after a communion; but woe to that man by
          whom the Son of man is betrayed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is a walking which is ruining to one's own soul. The
          generation that wandered in the wilderness died there; and waverers
          between the Lord and their idols fall into the mire at length: Hosea
          6:4, 5, "What shall I do unto you, O Judah? for your goodness is as a
          morning cloud, and as the early dew, it goes away. Therefore have I
          hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my
          mouth; and my judgments are as the light that goes forth." It is to
          those that are faithful unto the death only that the crown of life is
          promised, Revelation 2:10. Instability in the good ways of the Lord
          vexes the Holy Spirit; whereupon he departs, then the soul withers,
          and is cast over the hedge at length. Many walk in a round between
          their lusts and their duties while they live; and when they go out of
          the world they are just where they were when they came into it. As
          they were born in sin, so they die in it, and so tumble down into the
          pit.—I shall now point out,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The causes of this unsteady walking, going from side to side
          between the Lord and idols; together with the remedies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The want of a right set of the heart at first, is one cause: Psalm
          78:37, "For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
          steadfast in his covenant." While these in the text had two opinions,
          and were not determined to one of them, they could not but halt
          between the two. The heart that is never once freely separate from
          sin, so as to see it to be an evil, and the greatest evil, and to hate
          it for itself, that is, for its contrariety to God's holy nature and
          law, will make at best but a halting professor. If the duties of
          religion be desirable to them for one reason, the enjoyment of their
          lusts is so for another; and thus the heart being divided, the life is
          so too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this case the remedy is, to come once freely away to the Lord
          Christ, from all your lusts and idols: 2 Corinthians 6:17, "Wherefore
          come out from among them, and be you separate, says the Lord, and
          touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you." They who once
          thus part freely, will never halt again between the two. Though they
          may have a weak side by reason of indwelling corruption, yet they have
          a sound side too, that is combating with that weakness: Galatians
          5:17, "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
          the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that you
          cannot do the things that you would." And they are in consequence
          longing for the victory: Romans 7:24, "O! wretched man that I am, who
          shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Unite with Jesus
          Christ, and you will walk in him; for where he is once freely chosen
          for a pilot to the ship, the sinner's course through the sea of this
          world will be completely managed; that soul will never be shipwrecked.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And now, if you be in earnest not to halt any more, I give you an
          advice—As soon as you get home after this work is over, retire by
          yourselves, and consider where your weak side lies, what is that lust
          or lusts that is most likely to draw you over to its side again; and
          having seen it, consider how your soul stands affected to it, and
          labor by all means to make sure a final parting with it in your heart;
          that is, honestly and resolutely before the Lord to give up with it
          again forever. And as for the void space which the renouncing that
          sweet morsel will make in your heart, fill it up with Christ himself,
          by taking him expressly in the room of that idol: Matthew 13:45, 46,
          "Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking
          goodly pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went
          and sold all that he had, and bought it."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To this some may object, is there any saint in the world that is free
          of halting? Answer: There is a great difference between the
          Christian's halting through weakness, and the halting through
          wickedness spoken of in the text, which is really more than halting,
          properly so called. The one is a halting like him that is lame of one
          leg, the other like him that is lame of both.—The Christian, whatever
          weakness he is attended with in his walk, is absolutely determined for
          God and holiness, in opposition to all his idols: the hypocrite wants
          this resolution of heart. The former longs, sighs, groans, and strives
          to get the victory over corruption; is never for truce and
          reconciliation between the Lord and lusts, but for the extirpation of
          these lusts. But the latter is at bottom for both together, a
          reconciliation between them, and cannot think to hold with the Lord
          without his lusts.—The Christian sins not with that full swing of
          heart the hypocrite does. The former has a sound side, a renewed part,
          which lusts against the flesh, and so far resists the sway to the weak
          side; whereas the latter has nothing sound, and so sins with full
          consent of the will, however the conscience may reclaim and reprove.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Another cause is, unmodified lusts and light meeting together in
          the soul. An enlightened conscience puts it forward to God;
          unmortified, lively, reigning lusts, draw it back again. Thus one is
          tossed from side to side, as in the case of Pilate and Balaam: Job
          24:13, "They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
          the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof." Lusts rise against
          light, and thrust a man out of the paths thereof. It is with them as
          with David, in the battle against Absalom. Upon the one hand, it was
          hard to lose a kingdom: on the other hand, to lose a son: "Therefore
          deal gently," says he, "with Absalom." Even so here, they are
          reluctant to lose their souls, yet reluctant also to lose their idols.
          Hence they must do something for each of them.—In this case there is
          this
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          REMEDY—Mortify your lusts, that you may trample on them, and follow
          the light: Colossians 3:5, "Mortify, therefore, your members which are
          upon the earth," etc. Prune off these suckers, that you may have a
          thriving soul. Deny their cravings, that you may weaken and starve
          them. And that you may be enabled to do this, let your conscience and
          your heart both together take up their rest in Christ by faith. Know,
          O sinner! there is enough in Christ for the boundless desires of your
          heart, as well as for the cravings of your conscience: Canticles 5:16,
          "His month is most sweet; yes, he is altogether lovely." Colossians
          2:9, 10, "For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
          And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
          power."—Here some may reason,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) How can that be? for, alas! there are many desires in my wretched
          heart, that are of such a carnal sort, that there can be nothing in
          Christ for them. Answer: Our Lord satisfies the desires of poor
          sinners, by enlarging such of them as are holy, fulfilling these, and
          extinguishing others of them that are unholy: Psalm 81:10, "I am the
          Lord your God, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt:" "Open
          your mouth wide, and I will fill it." Though you can not have in
          Christ the unworthy thing your false heart desires, you shall have in
          him what is a thousand times more desirable; and then the desire of
          that thing will die away. None complains of the want of candles while
          the sun shines into the room, for that more than supplies the want of
          them all; and none will cry, "Who will show us any good?" when the
          Lord "lifts up upon them the light of his countenance." A child may be
          fond of his rattle, and will not part with it; but put a more pleasing
          thing in his hand, and he will immediately let it go: Matthew 13:44,
          "The kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, the which
          when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all
          that he has, and buys that field."—Another may inquire,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) What way shall I take to get Christ to fill my heart? The answer,
          in a word, is, Believe.—What shall we believe?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Believe that there is a complete fullness in Christ, sufficient
          to satisfy the boundless desires of your hearts: Colossians 2:19,
          "Holding the head, from which all the body by joints and bands, having
          nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase
          of God." He is infinite in perfections; and whatever is desirable in
          all the creation, is eminently in him as the fountain of all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Believe that he, with all his fullness, is offered to you, in the
          way of exchange with all your lusts and idols. Sincerely consent to
          the exchange. There is a full Christ before you; and the lust of the
          eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, are with you. Give
          up with these, as expressly and solemnly as you can, and take Christ
          in their room; believing there shall be no missing of them, and
          looking for the heart-satisfaction in him you used to seek in them.
          And believe it is a bargain unalterable for eternity: Matthew 13:45,
          46; Psalm 73:25, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is none
          upon earth that I desire besides thee.—God is the strength of my heart
          and my portion forever."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) When your lusts come back, offering to entertain you as formerly,
          believe you have in Christ what is a thousand times better: Psalm
          84:10, "For a day in your courts is better than a thousand." Say in
          your souls, as the olive, Jude. 9:9, Shall I come down from bread, and
          lie down to eat husks? Shall I leave the milk and honey, and fill my
          mouth with gravel-stones? If the lust of vanity say, there is gaiety
          and finery, the eyes of beholders are fixed on you; let the soul say,
          but I have in Christ a never-fading beauty, glorious robes of
          unspotted righteousness, Christ's love and his Father's, etc. that is
          solid and substantial, not to be exchanged for the airy nothings of
          the world's vanity. If the lust of covetousness say, there is a good
          prize to be had by a very little stretch, let the soul say, but I have
          riches in Christ, and that without any sting, durable riches and
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Another course of this walking is, men's touching but very
          lightly on religion in its turn, but digging deep in their lusts in
          their turn: Psalm 78:18, "And they tempted God in their heart, by
          asking meat for their lusts." Verse 36, "Nevertheless, they did
          flatter him with their month, and they lied unto him with their
          tongues." They are as it were in jest in the former, but in deep
          earnest in the latter; they swim like feathers in the waters of the
          sanctuary, but sink as lead in the mighty waters of their corrupt
          affections.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this case, I propose this remedy—Labor to be experimental
          Christians: Psalm 34:8, "O taste and see that the Lord is good." A
          taste of the transcendent goodness of God, the hidden excellency of
          religion, would hold you fast to the right side: John 4:10, "Jesus
          answered, and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it
          is that says to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked of him,
          and he would have given you living water." O then press eagerly into
          the inner court of religion; there are beauties there that will arrest
          your heart. Labor that you may have your hearts in every duty; break
          through the shell, until you come to the kernel. Once make religion
          your business, it will soon fill your hands, as well as your hearts.—I
          shall only mention,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Another cause of this walking. They would gladly be at Heaven, but
          have no heart for the rugged way to it: Mark 10:21, "Then Jesus
          beholding him, loved him, and said unto him, One thing you lack; go
          your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall
          have treasure in Heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
          And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved; for he had great
          possessions." The sluggard loves the gold, but will not dig for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this case the remedy is, to put on a resolution, a peremptory
          resolution for God, to cleave to him at any rate, and to pass through
          the wilderness to the heavenly Canaan, cost what it will: Numbers
          14:24, "But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
          and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he
          went; and his seed shall possess it." There you may be, there you must
          be, else you are ruined. And there are two things, as to which I would
          caution you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Have you not got that victory over your idols you were expecting?
          Do not give over, but resolutely continue the struggle, looking to the
          Lord for strength to accomplish that In which you have engaged: Romans
          16:20, "And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
          shortly." Have you come to Christ's door, though you apprehend you
          have got nothing yet? Be peremptorily resolved you will not go back to
          the door of your lusts, but hang on at his, though you should die at
          it, and you shall find, as in Canticles 3:4, "It was but a little that
          I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loves."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Have you got your feet on the necks of your idols? Pray, do not
          think the war is over, or that the Egyptian pursuers, who have been
          sometimes heavy on you, will be seen no more. No, no; the broken
          forces of corruption will rally again, and the newly-baffled idols
          will lift up their heads; therefore be on your watch, and prepare to
          renew the battle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. I am now to make some improvement, which for the present shall
          only be in an use of exhortation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Beware of wavering, and study to be stable Christians.—To enforce
          this, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That stability is the ground of fruitfulness: Psalm 1:3, "And he
          shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth
          his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever
          he does shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff
          which the wind drives away." A tree, after being lifted, and planted
          sometimes here, sometimes there, cannot be fruitful: "The rolling
          stone gathers no fog." Unstable as water, can never prevail. Doubts,
          fears, and dryness in the soul's case, is a necessary consequence of
          unsettledness.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That stability is the beginning of comfortable experiences in
          religion. We cannot think to thrive in a trade, until we settle to it.
          A fool is always beginning, leaves off, begins again, and so on; he
          never brings anything to perfection.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That stability is a fence against temptations. The wavering
          professor is a hopeful prey to temptation. The town that begins to
          parley, is next door to surrendering. The Jews saw Pilate begin to
          waver, and then they plied him to condemn Christ, until they carried
          him off his feet.—Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That stability is the foundation of serviceableness for God.
          The vessels of the temple were of gold, silver, brass, etc. but none
          of glass, no crystal ones; these were too brittle for temple-service.
          So wavering professors will never be honored of God to be serviceable
          for him, but they will do much harm to the way of the Lord.
