          2 Chronicles 30:8 "Now, be not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but
          yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he
          has sanctified forever; and serve the Lord your God, that the
          fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THESE words are an exhortation given upon the occasion of a public
          intimation made of a design to celebrate the sacrament of the Passover
          at the house of the Lord in Jerusalem. The intimation is made to all
          Israel, even those of the ten tribes, who were not of Hezekiah's
          kingdom. Though they were of different kingdoms, and many other
          differences among them, yet these were not to hinder their communion
          in one sealing ordinance. In the words we have two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A blessed season of grace marked for them. Now, Hezekiah takes
          notice, and would have them take notice, of the opportunity put into
          their hand. Now, when the doors of the house of the Lord, long shut,
          are opened, chapter 29:3. When the temple service, long in disuse, is
          revived. It is like that of Paul, "Behold, now is the accepted time,
          behold, now is the day of salvation."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Their duty in that blessed season of grace. It is, first, negative.
          Be not stiff-necked. Hebrew, harden not your neck. It is a metaphor
          taken from bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke, who make great
          difficulty and resistance about taking it on. In a season of grace,
          God offers to lay his yoke on the neck of sinners, and now he is
          offering to lay it on yours. Do not resist nor shift it, make no
          difficulty about it; but take it on readily and easily.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          They had an example of stiffness in their fathers, who had been ruined
          by it, so that the kingdom of Israel was now near to be extinguished.
          Therefore he would have them beware of following them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Then comes next positive duty, which is threefold. First, yielding
          themselves to the Lord. Hebrew, give you the hand to the Lord. Giving
          of the hand, in the language of the Holy Spirit, is opposed to
          stiff-neckedness, and denotes one's yielding himself up, as the
          besieged to the besiegers, Jeremiah 50:15. Or as a nation, Ezekiel
          17:18. or particular persons, 1 Chronicles 29:24. yield and give up
          themselves to a king.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a natural sign confirming the yielding, and so is used for
          engaging to a thing yielded to. So the sense is, God is requiring you
          to yield yourselves to him. Do it then as by giving the hand. The next
          part of their duty is, to enter into his sanctuary. It is a kind
          invitation to God's house. The doors of it are opened. Come in then to
          that place which he has chosen to put his name there, and have
          communion with him in his house. They are also to serve him. Serve him
          in his ordinances, serve him in your daily walk, that his wrath may be
          turned away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine I.—In a season of grace, in which God is offering to lay his
          yoke on sinners, they should beware of being stiff-necked, or refusing
          to take it on. Let us inquire,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What is that yoke which the Lord is offering to lay on sinners. There
          is a twofold yoke which he has for their necks. First, there is an
          iron yoke for the destruction of the impenitent. Thus God told the
          Israelites, "That because they would not serve him with joyfulness,
          and gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things, therefore he
          would put a yoke of iron upon their neck, until he have destroyed
          them." This is a yoke that is laid on the sinner, whether he will or
          not. There is no shifting of it. So this cannot be the yoke here
          intended. But secondly, there is a soft and easy yoke for the
          salvation and welfare of penitent sinners. "Take my yoke upon you,
          says Jesus, and learn of me: For my yoke is easy." This is not laid on
          against their will; and so those that struggle against it, and will
          not receive it, go without it. This is the yoke here meant. God as a
          judge, lays on the former, as a Savior he offers to lay on the latter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now this is the yoke of kindly willing subjection to God in Christ,
          submitting ourselves to him. We must submit to him as our rightful
          Lord and ruler, "as the princes and the mighty men, and all the sons
          likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king."
          We must no more go without a yoke, but take on his yoke. It is
          twofold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The yoke of subjection to the will of his commandments. He who made
          you is offering to rule and govern you, to give out commandments to
          you, to be obeyed. "You have commanded us to keep your precepts
          diligently." It is your duty to submit, to take his will for your law.
          He must be obeyed, as well as believed. "For Christ is the author of
          eternal salvation unto all them that obey him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The yoke of his providential will. He who made the world and you,
          claims the government of the world, and of you; that since you are his
          own, he may do with you, as to your lot, what he will. "Is it not
          lawful for me, says he, to do what I will with mine own?" He will not
          have you masters of your own process, or to carve for yourselves. He
          claims to dispose of you, as seems good to him. And you ought to take
          on this yoke, saying, He shall choose our inheritance for us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, this obedience of the sinner to God is called a yoke,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because coming under it, we are in a state of subjection as those
          under a yoke. The ox that has never been under the yoke is untamed,
          and goes where he lists; so does the unsubdued sinner. "They say, with
          our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own, who is Lord over
          us?" The sinner's own will is his law. But when he submits his neck to
          God's yoke, he yields to do and suffer what he will, saying, with Paul
          at his conversion, "Lord what will you have me to do?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because it is laid on us for labor or work. Beasts for slaughter go
          without a yoke at their own ease and pleasure; but those that are for
          work must bear it. Those men who walk licentiously after their own
          lusts, if they repent not, will find that the case of cattle for
          slaughter will be theirs. "For, says the prophet, God will pull them
          out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of
          slaughter." But the yoke is taken on for labor. Under it we are with
          David "to serve our generation by the will of God, and to work out our
          own salvation, with fear and trembling."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because by it we are not only kept at work, but kept in order at
          our work. If anything be wrong in the yoke, the work becomes
          disorderly. They who truly bear the yoke, are uniform and orderly in
          their obedience. "They have respect unto all God's commandments." They
          who take their religion by fits and starts, who are partial in the
          law, strict in some plain duties, loose in others, who serve God but
          by halves at best, discover themselves not to be truly come under the
          yoke.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because of its uneasiness to the flesh. Though the service of God
          is a blessed state of freedom; yet to flesh and blood, it is a yoke,
          grating to our sensitive appetites, and crossing our corrupt wills. To
          the new nature indeed it is easy; but to the old corrupt nature most
          uneasy; and as long as there are any remains of it, there will be a
          pain in bearing it. "For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the
          spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other;
          so that you cannot do the things that you would."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Because it fixes subjection upon us. It is not left to us
          whether we will obey and bear or not. But we are under sacred bonds,
          that we must needs do it. And they are the very strongest bonds. What
          can bind more firmly than the authority of God? Every duty and
          dispensation toward us is bound on with a thus says the Lord. Who then
          dare say against it? If God say stoop, who dare stand upright? Yet
          these bonds are sweet and agreeable to his willing people. They love
          the law of God, and to them his commandments are not grievous.
          Therefore I exhort you, be not stiff-necked but take on God's yoke.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motives.—1. God is the party with whom we have to do. Whoever they are
          whom men will adventure to strive against, they should consider that
          they are not to take upon them to strive against God. For woe unto him
          that strives with his Maker. His sovereignty should awe us into humble
          submission.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There will be nothing gained by stiff-neckedness to the yoke of
          God. "For who has hardened himself against him and has prospered." The
          potsherds of earth cannot make head against their Maker.—When the two
          are engaged it is easy to see who must either bow or break. The truth
          is, so doing we work against our own undoubted interest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, God has waited long on you, but will not wait always. Many
          opportunities of grace he has put into your hands, and many you have
          slighted. But beware of going on in that way, lest the reconciliation
          be broken up suddenly. "For he who being often reproved, hardens his
          neck, shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine II.—Now, while a season of grace is afforded to sinners, it
          is their duty to fall in with it speedily, to give the hand and yield
          themselves to the Lord.—Now says the text, yield yourselves unto the
          Lord, etc. They had then a solemn season of grace and so have we now.
          Here we shall,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Show how sinners have a season of grace afforded them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. What is supposed in this gracious call to sinners, to give the
          hand and yield themselves to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show in a general and also particular manner, what it is to give
          the hand or yield ourselves to the Lord. We are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show how sinners have a season of grace afforded them, a now, in
          which they may yield themselves to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By their being continued in life, and not cut off by death in their
          state of rebellion against God. "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it
          with all your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
          nor wisdom in the grave whether you go." They who are gone out of the
          world in their sins, have now no more access to get them removed, no
          more season of grace, which is confined to this present life. At death
          the door is shut, and as the tree falls it must lie.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. By the call of the gospel, its being sounded in their ears, as
          directed to them. "Unto you, O men, do I call, and my voice is unto
          the sons of men; behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the
          day of salvation." Whatever low thoughts some entertain of the
          preaching of the gospel, it is God's appointed mean of salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not
          God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
          believe." The preaching of the gospel is to every one that hears it,
          God's message of peace and reconciliation; it is God's summons to
          sinners to yield, the execution whereof will be precisely marked in
          the court of Heaven. And the voice of these turtles heard in the land
          makes a day of grace there; for the gospel is the grace of God that
          brings salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By solemn sacramental occasions afforded to a people. This is the
          case in the text. These make a precious now, not to be slighted; lest
          the opportunity be lost, and the wind never again blow so fair to us
          for Immanuel's land. At ordinary occasions of the gospel, the blessed
          bargain is offered; but now the seal of Heaven is also ready to
          confirm it. And many have had much comfort in a deathbed, from what
          they have enjoyed on such solemn occasions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, By some inward motions felt within one's own soul, pressing
          them to comply and yield now at length. It is not to be thought, but
          that several feel something of this now and then. Now that is the
          Beloved by his Spirit putting in his hand by the hole of the lock. It
          is the secret whisper of the Spirit to the sinner to yield. It is a
          fair gale blowing to you for Immanuel's land.—And so a special season
          of grace. "When you said, seek you my face; my heart said unto you,
          Your face, Lord, will I seek." We are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To inquire what is supposed in this gracious call to sinners, to
          give the hand, and yield themselves to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It supposes that sinners are naturally in a state of rebellion
          against the Lord. "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for
          it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." He is
          their rightful sovereign, but they are alienated from him, and are
          like a fort keeping out against him; hence the gospel has much to do
          to bring them to yield. "For the weapons of our warfare are not
          carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds:
          casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself
          against the knowledge of God, and brings into captivity every thought
          to the obedience of Christ." What else is your refusing to comply with
          the will of God's commandments and of his providence? All the mighty
          prejudices, and reasonings of the corrupt mind against religion are so
          many strong walls by which they defend themselves in their rebellion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That though the Lord can break the sinner in pieces for his
          rebellion, yet he would rather that the sinner yield. "Say unto them,
          As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the
          wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn you, turn
          you from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?" In
          justice he might cut us off, because we have lifted up the heel
          against him. By his power he can do it as easily as we can break an
          earthen pitcher. A touch of his iron rod would dash us in pieces; but
          mercy interposes to try if the sinner will yield himself. He needs us
          not. Though we were all broken to pieces, he would be happy in
          himself; yet our yielding would be more pleasant to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That God's hand is stretched out to receive the sinner yielding
          himself. He is willing to receive the worst of sinners yielding
          themselves to him. "I have spread out my hands, says he, all the day
          unto a rebellious people, which walks in a way that is not good, after
          their own thoughts." He is now on a throne of grace, offering you the
          covenant of his peace. He is ready to strike hands with you; and there
          is nothing to hinder the closing of the bargain, if you will but
          honestly strike hands with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. That forced work will not be acceptable here.—He will have a
          willing people that with the full consent of their own hearts shall
          become his. Your people shall be willing in the day of your power. He
          does not say, He will force them to come in, but he would have sinners
          from their own judgment and choice, yield themselves. Terror indeed
          uses to begin the work, but love and good-will crowns it, where it is
          right.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That the sinner willingly yielding shall be kindly received
          and accepted. "All that the Father gives me shall come to me, says
          Jesus, and him that comes unto me I will in no wise cast out." The
          sinner shall be received into the covenant, a marriage covenant with
          our Maker; give the hand then, yield yourselves to the Lord and it
          shall be a bargain, the best bargain you ever made, or ever can make,
          a bargain for eternity, by which you shall be made forever happy.
          Nothing shall any more prevent the making of it; and nothing shall
          forever hinder the keeping of it. Let us proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To show in general and also in a particular manner, what it is to
          give the hand or yield ourselves to the Lord. Let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Speak of the nature of it in general. It comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The work of conviction in receiving it. When the Spirit of the Lord
          lays siege to a soul, the first attack that is made on it, is by the
          fiery law convincing of sin and misery. When "the Spirit comes he will
          reprove the world of sin; of righteousness and of judgment." Many have
          the doctrine of the law urged upon them for their conviction; but will
          not yield, retaining still good thoughts of their own state and case.
          "When they hear the words of the curse, they bless themselves in their
          heart saying, We shall have peace, though we walk in the imagination
          of our heart, to add drunkenness to thirst." But elect souls are at
          length brought to yield, saying with Paul, "I had not known sin but by
          the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall
          not covet." Then like the prodigal, they conclude themselves ruined
          perishing creatures; seeing themselves altogether vile in their
          nature, hearts, lips, and lives, and therefore concluded under the
          curse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The work of illumination in the knowledge of Christ, in receiving
          the discovery of a Savior. "For God who commanded the light to shine
          out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
          knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." This
          impression is made by the gospel, on the soul suffering a divine
          siege. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all,
          with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
          changed into the same image, from glory to glory even as by the Spirit
          of the Lord." In conviction there is a yielding to the light of the
          law, but if there is no more, the soul will at best flee from the
          Lord. But in gospel illumination the soul is drawn to yield to the
          Lord. Says Jesus, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
          men unto me." It sees in Christ a remedy for its wound, is persuaded
          of his ability and willingness to save, his all-fullness of merit and
          of spirit, his superlative excellency affording a rest for the
          conscience and the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The work of humiliation, in becoming pliable to the divine proposal
          in the gospel; leading them trembling and astonished to say with Paul,
          "Lord what will you have me to do?" The iron sinew in the sinner's
          neck is broken, the heart of stone is taken away, and the soul is made
          willing in a day of power. Thus the sinner is brought down from his
          towering heights; the outer door of the mind and the inner door of the
          will, are both cast open to the Lord Christ; the soul yields to-the
          summons, "Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be you lifted up you
          everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The work of faith in the sinner's believing on, and so closing with
          Christ, as his Savior from sin and wrath, renouncing all others. This
          is precisely the chief thing meant by giving the hand to the Lord.—For
          faith is, in scripture style, the hand of the soul.—Hence it is said,
          "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
          God, even to them that believe in his name." And as the Lord in the
          gospel, holds out his hand to the sinner, Isaiah 65:2. So the sinner
          by believing gives him his hand. Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her
          hands unto God. Thus the bargain is closed by Christ and the sinner
          striking hands. And this is a work of divine power. "Wherefore, says
          Paul, we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of
          this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and
          the work of faith with power."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The work of repentance from dead works, in putting off the body of
          the sins of the flesh, Colossians 2:11. Faith and repentance are
          inseparable. That faith which produces not repentance, even true
          evangelical repentance, is but dead faith. "And I will pour upon the
          house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of
          grace and supplications; and they shall look upon me whom they have
          pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son,
          and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for
          his first-born." If you continue to yield yourselves to your lusts,
          you have not yielded to the Lord, Romans 6:13, 14. He who yields to
          the Lord, renounces his former lovers and his other lords, saying, "O
          Lord our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us; but
          by you only will we make mention of your name."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The work of entire resignation; in the believer's wholly
          devoting and yielding up himself to the Lord. Says the apostle, "they
          first gave their own selves to the Lord and unto us by the will of
          God." Whatever way the man disposed of himself before, he now lays
          himself and his all at the Lord's feet, without reserve. He surrenders
          himself to the Lord without limitation. We shall now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Explain the nature of this giving of ourselves to the Lord more
          particularly. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Let us inquire what it is, that the soul giving the hand or
          yielding itself to the Lord, does yield up to him. If you will give
          the hand to the Lord, you must then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Yield your souls, or inner man to the Lord. If he be your Lord, he
          must be the Lord of your soul in all the faculties thereof, and the
          kingdom of God must be within you. "You shall love, says Jesus, the
          Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
          all your mind." And you must yield your mind and conscience to the
          Lord, to be taught, instructed, and directed by his word and Spirit
          only. Men must no longer be lords of your conscience, by your taking
          the judgment of the carnal world for your rule in matters of sin and
          duty, Ephesians 2:2; or by taking up principles in religion on mere
          human testimony or authority. But you must hear him as the great
          Teacher. "And call no man your father upon the earth, for one is your
          Father which is in Heaven. Neither be called masters, for one is your
          Master even Christ." And you must believe what he says, because he
          says it; in opposition to your own or others' corrupt reasonings.
          Making our reason the rule of faith, is subversive of divine faith:
          and makes the assent, knowledge, or opinion not divine faith, because
          not raised on divine testimony, but on the testimony of reason.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must also yield your will to him, that his will may hence-forth be
          your. Saying, "Father your will be done in earth as it is in Heaven."
          If you will have a will of your own still, and not submit it in all
          things to the Lord, you do not yield to, but rebel against the Lord.
          If the motions of a will contrary to the Lord's rise in you, you must
          deny and cross them and submit your will to him. You must in like
          manner yield your heart and affections to him. "My son, says he, give
          me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways." If you yield him
          the hand without the heart, you yield not yourselves. Your heart is in
          a thousand pieces, your affections scattered among the creatures. Your
          heart must be united, your affections gathered in as the rays of the
          sun in the burning glass, and all point to and center in Christ. "Whom
          have I in Heaven but you, and there is none in all the earth that I
          desire beside you." He must be the object of your love and desire,
          your chief joy and delight, and have the throne in your heart, all
          lying at his footstool.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Yield your bodies, or outward man to the Lord. "What! don't you
          know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you,
          which you have of God, and you are not your own? For you are bought
          with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
          which are God's." The Lord has redeemed the body as well as the soul,
          and by the tenor of the covenant, he is as to believers, their God,
          not of their souls only, but of their persons, soul and body. Now as
          he is for it, it must be for him. For the body is for the Lord, and
          the Lord for the body. It ought then to be consecrated to him as a
          living sacrifice, and be employed and spent in his service; our
          members as instruments of righteousness unto God. Whatever way it can
          be serviceable to him, it should be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Yield up all your lusts and idols to him, as traitors which you can
          no more harbor; saying, what have we any more to do with idols.
          "Repent, says God; and turn yourselves from all your transgressions;
          so iniquity shall not be your ruin." Let there be no secret morsel
          reserved, as you would not quit your part in Christ. A day of yielding
          to the Lord, is a day in which a bill of divorce is put in the hand of
          all idols. And if there be any bosom lust, let it be yielded up by
          head mark as the signal competitor for the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Yield all your lawful enjoyments to him, so as to be at his
          disposal, and never to break with him for them or any of them. Jesus
          said, "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and
          wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life
          also, he cannot be my disciple." Yield your relations to the Lord that
          they may be his with your consent, to be continued or taken from you
          when he will; your substance in the world to be disposed of as he sees
          good; your credit and reputation, to let him have it, if he sees meet
          to make a stepping-stone of it for his own glory: your liberty, ease
          and conveniences of life; yes, and your life itself, to be for his
          service, and if he will for a sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Yield your lot and your all to him; saying, he shall choose
          our inheritance for us. Close your own eyes, and let the Lord
          hence-forth lead you; hold up your own hands and let him cut and carve
          for you.—Be no more choosers for yourselves, but resign yourselves to
          him, what way to carry you through the world home, through good and
          bad report, adversity or prosperity. Give him the choice of your
          comforts, and of your crosses and afflictions. Your lawful desires
          must be laid at his feet. Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Show in what sort and manner the soul should give the hand or
          yield itself to the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Yield yourselves to the Lord in a marriage covenant. "Behold, says
          he, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings are killed, and
          all things are ready, come unto the marriage." The Lord Jesus Christ,
          your Maker, is offering himself to you for a husband. "And I will
          betroth you, says he, unto me forever; yes I will betroth you unto me
          in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in
          mercies. I will even betroth you unto me in faithfulness; and you
          shall know the Lord." The gospel preached unto you is the proposal of
          the match with your souls, and you are pressed in his name to accept.
          The Bridegroom is the heir of all things. His hand is put out to you
          this day; now give him your hand and yield yourselves, and it is a
          bargain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now you must yield yourselves to him wholly. Servants give work for
          wages. Suitors give token to further love. But married persons give
          themselves wholly to one another. Give yourselves to be for him. "You
          are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be
          married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we
          should bring forth fruit unto God." The import of this is expressed in
          these words, For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. As if he
          had said, He is the sum of my life, the center of my heart,
          affections, and actions. You must yield yourselves to him only.
          "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also
          your own people, and your father's house." A married state is a state
          of rest. "Naomi said to Ruth, shall I not seek rest for you, that it
          may be well with you. The soul out of Christ is in a restless state.
          Heart and eyes rambling up and down among the creatures, seeking and
          looking for a proper match. But when once it yields itself to Christ,
          it rests in him and closes its eyes as now matched and at the end of
          its desires; saying, "Whom have I in Heaven but you, and there is none
          in all the earth whom I desire besides you." And no wonder, for Christ
          says to the soul, "You shall not be for another man; so will I also be
          for thee."—And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must yield yourselves to him forever. "He will be the strength of
          your heart and your portion forever." There is an awfully solemn
          clause in earthly marriages, namely, Until God shall separate you by
          death. Here death stands up on the one hand of the bride, while the
          husband stands on the other, warning her, that it will come between
          him and her at length. But the heavenly marriage is forever. No death,
          divorce, nor second marriage. As Christ takes the soul, so the soul
          yields itself to Christ forever and ever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Yield yourselves as subjects to a conqueror.—"The Lord shall send
          the rod of your strength out of Zion; rule you in the midst of your
          enemies. Your people shall be willing in the day of your power."
          Christ appears in the gospel sitting on a white horse, with his how in
          his hand and a crown on his head, going forth conquering and to
          conquer. He is shooting arrows of the law and arrows of love among
          you. If you find the force of the former they will gall you, if of the
          latter you must yield as conquered. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yield to him as your king and sovereign Lord, casting open the gates
          of your souls to him, that have been shut against him before. Give up
          with all other lords, that formerly have had dominion over you, and
          enter into allegiance to him, Isaiah 26:13. You must break with your
          former lusts and look no more after them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must yield to him at discretion. Many will not yield to Christ,
          but by capitulation. They must have such and such terms of him, if
          they yield; some right eye, or right hand lust must be spared;
          Christ's cross must not be laid on their tender shoulders. But you
          must yield at discretion, or you really yield not at all to him. Put a
          blank in his hand, or else you give him not the hand, saying, Lord,
          what will you have me to do. And lay your accounts with the worst,
          that a popish and malignant sword, fire or rope shall not separate
          between Christ and you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Yield yourselves as filial servants to a fatherly Master. "And they
          shall be mine, says the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my
          jewels: and I will spare them as a man spares his own son that serves
          him." There are two kinds of persons who make wrong work of yielding
          to the Lord. First, those who yield themselves as sons, not servants.
          They will take the inheritance, but will not bear his yoke. They will
          pretend to believe, and under the pretense of faith and free grace
          take liberty to themselves in sin. But such faith is dead and will
          never save you, James 2:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Second, Those who yield themselves as mere servants. They will serve
          the Lord on condition salvation may be their wages. And many make such
          bargains with Christ at communions which he will never approve. Our
          Lord is seeking no such servants among you, but sends them away to the
          law their proper master, Matthew 19:16, 17. All his are filial
          servants. "Wherefore, you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a
          son then an heir of God through Christ." They are, you see, first
          saved by faith and get a right to the inheritance by free grace, and
          strength in him for work; and then they are set to work, in a way of
          gratitude to their Father.

        <p align="justify">The Improvement</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use. 1. Of conviction and humiliation, in respect of the sad bias
          which man's nature has got. The very call to yield ourselves, even
          this fixes upon us a black brand of rebelliousness against God, and
          backwardness to good. It stigmatizes us as a parcel of apostates,
          willful headstrong fools, naturally running headlong to their own
          destruction in a course of opposition to God. Mourn over this, you
          that have not yielded yourselves to the Lord. See and be humbled for
          the rebellion of your nature and the rebellions of your lives. Look to
          your own picture and drop tears over your state and case. "How can you
          say, I am not polluted. You are like a wild donkey used to the
          wilderness, that snufs up the wind at her pleasure." Some of you have
          sometimes seemed to yield; but you deceived yourselves and others, and
          have gone back with the dog to the vomit, and have altogether broken
          the yoke and burst the bonds.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mourn over this also you that have yielded yourselves to the Lord.
          Look back to the state of rebellion in which you formerly were. "For
          we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
          serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful
          and hating one another." Look over the remains of the backwardness of
          your nature yet with you, and what sad work it has made in your life,
          thwarting with the will of God's commandments and providences as if
          you had not yielded yourself to the Lord. And to help forward your
          humiliation, consider how long the Lord has waited upon you patiently,
          while he might have broke you in pieces at every time you refused to
          yield to him. And let his goodness lead you to repentance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Consider also how you have fought against your own interest; refusing
          to yield to the Lord you have in effect courted your own destruction
          by that means.—"For he who sins against me, says the Savior, wrongs
          his own soul: all they that hate me love death." And you have stood in
          the way of your own mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. Of exhortation. Come then sinners, yield yourselves to the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motives.—1. You must yield yourself to one or other, for you are not
          self-sufficient. If you yield not to the Lord, you will yield to a
          vain world, deceitful lusts, and so to the devouring lion. Therefore
          if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom
          you will serve.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The Lord has the best right to you. You were the Lord's originally
          by creation. You have yielded yourselves to his enemy Satan and cast
          off the yoke of subjection to God. But you never had a right to
          dispose of yourself to another than him. Therefore return him his own.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Consider what the Lord has yielded for you. The Father yielded his
          own Son to the death for sinners, Romans 8:32. Jesus Christ yielded
          his life for us though enemies, Romans 5:8. The Holy Spirit has
          yielded himself to strive with you for your yielding. Genesis 6:3. And
          has been many times resisted, grieved, and vexed by you; and yet
          continues to strive with you. Every wound that Christ got for us, is a
          mouth crying aloud to you to yield yourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The Savior is very desirous of your yielding.—My son, says he, give
          me your heart. Nothing you can do, can be so acceptable to him. He
          values it as a king does his crown, Song 3:11. O! if he should come
          down in person and propose your yielding to him, would you refuse? But
          our Master is a king and courts his bride by proxy. Matthew 22:4. "Now
          then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by
          us; we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. He is not seeking your yielding yourselves for nothing. Yield
          yourselves to him and he will give himself to you. Hosea 3:3. "He will
          take your wants upon him, and give you of his fullness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. You must yield or die, bow or break. "Those mine enemies, which
          would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them
          before me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Yield, and all your former rebellions shall be forgiven, and you
          shall be restored to the Lord's favor. "Come now, and let us reason
          together, says the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
          as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
          wool." Thus pardoned you shall enjoy all the privileges of his
          subjects.
        </p>

          Lastly, Yield, or the Lord will have war with you forever. And how
          will you be able to make head against him? How will you bear his
          coming. 2 Thessalonians 1:7, 9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What prevents you that you will not yield? Some will not, because if
          they yield to the Lord, they must forego their lusts, which they know
          not how to live without. And hence their love to these fixes an enmity
          to God, and an aversion to his yoke in them.—The spring of this is
          unacquaintedness with Christ and never seeing sin in its own colors.
          Assure yourselves the Lord bids you part with nothing for him, without
          offering you far better in its stead. And a discovery of Christ in his
          glory would determine the matter, Matthew 13:45, 46.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some think it is too soon for them to yield, for they are yet but
          young, they may yield time enough long after this. I shall yield to
          you, if there is none in the churchyard as young as you. Does death
          ask any person's age? Are you sure you shall live to be old? The
          longer you live without yielding, the more Satan's interest will be
          strengthened in you, and is it not strong enough already. And must the
          bloom and vigor be for sin and Satan, and only the withering age for
          God. Some fear that they will not be able to keep with God, but Satan
          will have them back again. But yield, throwing yourselves into God's
          covenant of free grace; it will keep you. "He will put his fear in
          your hearts and you shall not depart from him." Wherefore, I summon
          you to yield; and yield now presently and freely; it is dangerous to
          delay: "Behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of
          salvation." Amen.
