    1 Corinthians 10:17 "For we being many are one bread and one body: for we 
    are all partakers of that one bread."</p>
<p align="justify">ONE great reason why communions do so little good, is, 
    that communicants are so little concerned in one another for their spiritual 
    welfare. And this has its rise from their not discerning, and seriously 
    laying to heart the spiritual relation there is among them, by them avouched 
    and publicly testified by their partaking of one bread at the 
    communion-table. People readily have some notion that it is a communion with 
    Christ; but few consider that it is a communion of saints, and what duties 
    flow from it as such. I would therefore lay this matter before you, in order 
    to pursue the benefit of our late solemn occasion.</p>
<p align="justify">The scope of these words is to show, That those who 
    partaked of idolatrous feasts were by that action declared one body with 
    idolaters. This is proven by a parity of reason, namely, that those who 
    partake of the Lord's table declare themselves one body with the saints. In 
    the preceding verse he shows the nature of the sacrament of the supper; it 
    is the communion of the body and blood of Christ; a sign, seal, and 
    appointed means of our joint feeding on a slain Savior, like so many eagles 
    on the slain body. Here he shows the nature of the society of saints, for 
    whom it is appointed, namely, that they are one body, namely, the body of 
    Christ; and therefore being united to him, they have certainly communion in 
    his body and blood. For we being many are one bread and one body: for we are 
    all partakers of that one bread.</p>
<p align="justify">In the words are two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The spiritual conjunction and communion of saints 
    among themselves asserted; We, many, etc. He speaks of the whole multitude 
    of believers. They being many particular saints, some men, some women, 
    teachers, taught, weak, strong, are yet so joined, and have such intimate 
    union and communion one with another, that they are one bread, that is, one 
    body represented by the one sacramental bread. If you ask whose is that 
    body? or who is the head of it? It is Christ's 1 Corinthians 12:27. "Now you 
    are the body of Christ, and members in particular." Not his natural body, 
    but his mystical body: and therefore the many are not such as meet at one 
    communion-table in one congregation, but all the members of Christ's 
    mystical body through the world, for Christ has but one body: and as many 
    grains do make up but one sacramental bread, so they being many do make up 
    but one body.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This spiritual conjunction and communion of saints 
    among themselves, inferred from their all pertaking of that one bread; For 
    we being many are one bread, etc. By that one bread is meant, that bread 
    which is exhibited in the sacrament, namely, both the invisible bread, which 
    is Christ himself, and the visible bread which we take into our mouths, the 
    latter the sign of the former. Believing communicants partake of both: they 
    partake of that bread, which is the Lord; so are all united to, and hold 
    communion with the head as members, and therefore are one body among 
    themselves: they partake of the sacramental bread, which is an instituted 
    sign of the other, and thereby profess their communion with Christ the head, 
    and consequently their communion with the saints, as members of the same 
    body with them. And in this last, hypocritical communicants join with them, 
    by their partaking, declaring, and avouching themselves to be of the 
    communion of saints of the mystical body of Christ, and binding themselves 
    to the duty of that communion; although in reality they are not so, as not 
    partaking of the invisible bread, which is Christ the Lord. The case is the 
    same as to baptism. "For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, 
    whether we be Jews or Gentiles." 1 Corinthians 12:13.</p>
<p align="justify">The point to be handled is this doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. There is a communion of saints among 
    themselves, as being conjoined into one mystical body of Christ, declared 
    and avouched by partakers of the sacraments, especially that of the Lord's 
    supper, every one for themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two parts of this doctrine. One is, That there 
    is such a strait and intimate communion and conjunction among the saints, 
    that they are really and truly one body mystically, however many they be. 
    The other is, That one's partaking of the sacrament is a declaring and 
    avouching himself to be of that communion. By a communion I mean a society 
    having a common interest in things.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall inquire into the nature of the communion of 
    saints as one body. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Who are the members of this communion—of this happy 
    society the body of Christ? There are two sorts of members of it, some in 
    show only, some in reality. As to the former I offer two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The openly wicked and profane, among whom must be 
    reckoned the grossly ignorant, and all such as have no form of godliness, 
    are not so much as visible or apparent members of the communion of saints. 
    They are excluded from the communion of the the saints above, Galatians 
    5:19–21. "Now the works of the flesh are manifest—adultery, fornication, 
    &amp;c.—of which I tell you before, as I have told you in time past, that they 
    which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." From the 
    communion of saints below, Acts 26:18. "To open their eyes, and to turn them 
    from darkness to light—that they may receive inheritance among them that are 
    sanctified"—and visibly belong to the devil's family, John 8:44. What though 
    they have been baptized, and are yet in the visible church, they have in 
    effect renounced it, Romans 2:25. "But if you be a breaker of the law, your 
    circumcision is made uncircumcision." For though they were baptized into 
    this one body, 1 Corinthians 12:13. yet they will have no communion with 
    that body, nor the head of it. Though they got on Christ's mark of baptism 
    in their infancy, they have now got the devil's mark on above it. So Romans 
    2:25. therefore not to be admitted to the Lord's table, Matthew 7:6. "Give 
    not that which is holy unto dogs."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Masked hypocrites are seeming visible members of 
    this communion, but not real members of it. They are brethren of the saints, 
    but only half brothers, Can. 1:6. false brethren, Galatians 2:4. They are 
    among them, and communicate among them, but they are not of them, 1 John 
    2:19. They want the wedding-garment; and though the servants cannot but 
    admit them as visible saints, the Master will throw them out, as none of 
    that communion in his sight, Matthew 22:12.</p>
<p align="justify">Hypocrites belong to the mystical body, as a branch bound 
    up, but not knitting with the stock belongs to the tree, or as a tree-leg 
    belongs to the body; but not otherwise. See the case of these members in 
    these three things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are useful for the mystical body of Christ with 
    their gifts as the tree-leg with its strength to the natural body. So was 
    Judas and Demas, etc. Graceless well-gifted ministers and professors, they 
    may have a mouth to speak for truth, ay and hands to act for it too, and the 
    profit redound to the saints, not themselves, who have no heart to embrace 
    it in reality; and to adorn the communion as long as they keep green, as 
    such branches do the tree, by which God is honored before the world, Psalm 
    81:15.</p>
<p align="justify">They are under the particular care of the body, as the 
    tree-leg—and the branch under the gardener's inspection. Hence they get 
    their gifts increased for the good of the body, are preserved from many 
    snares they would otherways fall into if they had nothing at all to do with 
    the communion of saints, as may appear from the way they go when they turn 
    apostates. They fare the better they are in good company. But,</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are laid aside at length, as the branch, John 
    15:2. and the tree-leg, if not before, yet at the time when the body goes to 
    rest, Psalm 125:5. Though the living leg be broken, so crazed that for the 
    time it can be of no discernible use for the head, nor for the other members 
    of the body, it is not cast by, nor separate from the body, but its weakness 
    borne with, and it healed at length. But the tree-leg goes for altogether.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the latter, there are three sorts of these real 
    members.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Real members in God's design, but not yet formed. 
    These are all the elect, who are yet to be born, or yet to be born again, 
    and we cannot have a full view of the body without eying them, Ephesians 
    1:10. "That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather 
    together in one all things in Christ.—They shall all of them be formed at 
    length, all conjoined unto the body, and they all belong to the perfection 
    of the body, for carrying on of which the ministry is appointed, Ephesians 
    4:11–13. For the body of Christ is all the elect knit to him as the head, 
    Ephesians 5:23. "For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is 
    the head of the Church."—</p>
<p align="justify">2. Real members already perfected, at least as to their 
    souls. These are the saints triumphant, who are with us members, 
    fellow-members of the body of Christ, though glorified ones. Therefore, 
    Hebrews 12:22, 23. "But you are come—to the general assembly and church of 
    the first-born—and to the spirits of just men made perfect." Even they, as 
    high as they are, are of this communion of saints, of the same family of 
    Heaven with us militant on earth, though they are in the upper rooms, and we 
    in the lower, Ephesians 3:15.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Real members formed, but not perfected yet. These are 
    the saints on earth, even all of them upon the face of the earth, whatever 
    particular visible church they belong to: at whatever distance they are one 
    from another, though they never saw, nor never will see one another's face 
    until they come to meet in glory, they are all one body, all members of that 
    one body of Christ, 1 Corinthians 12:12. "For as the body is one, and has 
    many members, and all the members, being many are one body, so also in 
    Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">These last are they whom our text speaks of, as one body 
    partaking of the sacramental bread, namely, the body of Christ, as to that 
    part of it which is on earth; and of this we speak. So there is a communion 
    of saints on earth, and all the saints are members of it: wherever they 
    dwell, whatever lesser points of doctrine, worship, etc. they differ in, 
    they have communion with one another, as being all conjoined into one body.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Wherein this communion of saints consists; or how 
    they are one body.</p>
<p align="justify">1. they have all one head, namely, the Lord Jesus Christ, 
    who is the head of all the saints, Ephesians 1:22, 23.—"And gave him to be 
    the head over all things to the church, which is his body."—They are all 
    united to him by his Spirit, 1 Corinthians 6:17.—"He who is joined to the 
    Lord is one spirit." And from him as their head, they derive vital 
    influences, Colossians 2:19. "From which all the body, by joints and bands, 
    having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the 
    increase of God." There may be great difference between members, in respect 
    of growth, liveliness, and usefulness; but the meanest have communion with 
    the highest in one head, which is common to them all. So they are all under 
    the direction, government and influence of Jesus Christ, as their common 
    head.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are all animated, enlivened and actuated by one 
    Spirit, namely, the Holy Spirit of Christ. This Spirit dwells in Christ as 
    the head, and in all the saints as his members, Romans 8:9. and unites them 
    to the head, and among themselves too, so that they are one body, 1 
    Corinthians 12:13. A tree-leg, though bound close to the body, is no member 
    of it, because it is not animated by the soul and life of that body; but if 
    there were a body of a man, whose head did reach the clouds, any toe of that 
    man's foot, though defiled by the ground it touches, is as really a member 
    of that body as the shoulders are, having communion with them in the same 
    soul or spirit, which actuates the one as well as the other.</p>
<p align="justify">Great is the difference of the saint's souls or spirits, 
    as men and women; some are bold, some fearful. It is as easy for some to 
    draw the sword in Christ's quarrel, as for others to speak a word for him. 
    Some are of clear, cheerful, easy, active spirits; some under a spirit of 
    heaviness and indisposition for action; but as saints they have all one 
    Spirit: whose could discern, how unanimously they vote Christ to be king of 
    the heart, of the church, of the world, against the torrent of solicitations 
    from the devil, world, and flesh; how, as with one eye, they look up to God 
    in Christ as their only happiness, and away from the world which the rest of 
    mankind fix their eye on; how with one heart and one soul they all groan 
    under the remains of sin, and for perfection in holiness, though some louder 
    than others; he behooved to say, these have all one Spirit of faith, 
    holiness, and contempt of the world, Ezekiel 36:27. Numbers 14:24.</p>
<p align="justify">3. One grace of faith wrought by the self-same Spirit in 
    them all, Colossians 2:12. terminates in and knits them to one head, the 
    Lord Jesus, Ephesians 3:17. As all the lines drawn from the circumference 
    meet in the center, and there have communion; so the faith of all God's 
    elect meet in Jesus Christ, and thus they have communion among themselves, 
    Titus 1:1–4. Thus are they one body, as being all knit to the head, by one 
    and the same spiritual band for kind. The strong faith gripes here, the weak 
    faith reaches to him; though the weak hand of faith is not so steady, nor 
    gripes so hard as the other, yet both knit, Canticles 4:9. and 5:1.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They have all one heart and one mind in respect of 
    fundamentals, Ephesians 4:5. One faith, namely, of doctrine, the substance 
    of which was and ever will be the same, Hebrews 13:8. Whatever be their 
    different opinions as to inferior truths, they all agree in the main, Acts 
    4:12. "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name 
    under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." Thus, according to 
    the promise, Jeremiah 32:39. they have "one heart and one way;" for they are 
    all partakers of that one unction which teaches all things necessary to 
    salvation, 1 John 2:20. "But you have an unction from the holy One, and you 
    know all things." For they are all taught of God: and that doctrine which 
    contradicts the experience of the saints, and relishes not with discerning 
    souls exercised to godliness, is justly to be suspected, Matthew 
    11:19.—"Wisdom is justified of her children."</p>
<p align="justify">5. They are united to one another in love, Colossians 
    3:14. Ephesians 4:16. This is a powerful cement. Love cements hearts and 
    souls, and so knits fast. They love one another, though they never saw 
    other's faces, if they do but know there are such persons in the world. They 
    love them for the common image of God which they bear; and in all the 
    company of saints this love will break over all the differences in lesser 
    matters among them; so that it is made a mark of a member of that communion, 
    1 John 3:14. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we 
    love the brethren."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They have a communion in one another's gifts and 
    graces, as the case stands in the natural body, Ephesians 4:16. There is a 
    diversity of gifts and offices in the common body of saints; some are 
    teachers, some taught; rulers, ruled. Some excel in one gift or grace, some 
    in another: some perhaps cannot be said to excel their fellow-saints in 
    anything: but all these are for the common advantage of the body, 1 
    Corinthians 12:27. and the glory of the head. And, wherever they are, they 
    belong to the whole body, as the light that is in the eye, the strength in 
    the arms, the swiftness in the legs, belong to, and are for the good of the 
    whole body. 1 Corinthians 3:22, 23. "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or 
    the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are 
    yours, and you are Christ's." And every the meanest member and gift has its 
    own use and necessity. See 1 Corinthians 12:13. and downwards.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Here is a fellowship you may all partake of, and I 
    invite you all to the communion of saints, 1 John 1:3. "That which we have 
    seen and heard declare we unto you, that you may also have fellowship with 
    us." Many are ruined with their love of that they call good-fellowship. What 
    is the fellowship deserves that name? Not the communion of sinners ruining 
    one another under the influence of Satan and their lusts; not the fellowship 
    of drunkards and revelers, whose common profit and pleasure goes away like 
    the crackling of thorns—only it leaves a stink behind; not the fellowship of 
    the men of the world, in advancing some temporal gain; but the communion of 
    saints, the pleasantest, richest, best fellowship in all the world. O! leave 
    the communion of sinners for this; come out from among them, and be you 
    separate, joining yourselves to this communion.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The properties of this communion.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a most honorable communion, for it is a 
    communion with the holy Trinity, 1 John 1:3. "And truly our fellowship is 
    with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The Father is the Head and Father of the communion, 
    Ephesians 4:6. 1 Corinthians 11:3. He is Father Creator of all men, Acts 
    17:29. But of the communion of saints he is Father by a special, gracious, 
    saving relation. So that they are all his children, John 1:12. 2 Corinthians 
    6:17, 18. And they have communion with him, and union through the Lord Jesus 
    Christ, since he and the Father are one.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The center of this communion is the Son, the blessed 
    Mediator. In him all meet, 1 Corinthians 11:3. The saints meet in Christ as 
    their head, and in him the Father meets with them, 2 Corinthians 5:19. "God 
    was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their 
    trespasses unto them." Christ presents all believers through the world unto 
    his Father, saying, "Behold, I, and the children which God has given me," 
    Hebrews 2:13. So, being the Mediator's, they become his, John 20:17. In this 
    respect Christ is called the way to the Father, John 14:6. "I am the way, 
    and the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father but by me."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The Holy Spirit is the internal original bond of 
    this communion, knitting all the members to Christ, and among themselves, 
    Ephesians 4:4. He brings them together into Christ, and to his Father, fixes 
    and holds them there by his infinite power, that they can never be broken 
    off again. So believers, members of this communion, have communion with the 
    Father and the Son, 1 John 1:3. and the Holy Spirit, 2 Corinthians 13:14.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a most rich communion. There are societies and 
    companies this day joining stocks together, to advance worldly wealth; but 
    the richest of them have nothing but trifles in comparison with the company 
    or communion of saints. The communion of saints is the company trading to 
    Heaven, and their wealth is past reckoning. For a view of it, consider only 
    these two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They have communion with Christ, a common interest 
    with him who is Heir of all things, so that they may set their name under 
    his, on all that is his. They have communion with him in his perfect 
    righteousness, Isaiah 45:24. Hence they are all fair, Canticles 4:7. clear 
    as the sun, Canticles 6:10. In his active obedience, so that they have 
    obeyed in Christ, as they sinned in Adam, Romans 8:3, 4. In his sufferings 
    and death, Galatians 2:20. In his resurrection and ascension, Ephesians 2:6. 
    and glory. Compare Hebrews 6:20. They have a common interest in all his 
    purchase, and, as poor as some of them sit, they want nothing, but are 
    complete, Colossians 2:10. "And you are complete in him."</p>
<p align="justify">They have a real participation of Christ himself, Hebrews 
    3:14. Of his death and his resurrection, Romans 6:4, 5. Of his Spirit, 
    Philippians 2:1. Of the divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4. Of his offices; they are 
    prophets, Psalm 105:15; priests and kings, Revelation 1:6. And of his 
    fullness, John 1:16.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They have communion with God; for so runs the 
    covenant, "I will be your God." And Psalm 144:15. God the Father, Son, and 
    Holy Spirit, is theirs. All his attributes are theirs; the power of God to 
    protect them, the wisdom of God to guide them, etc. and with him all things, 
    since all is his, and he is theirs, 1 Corinthians 3:21, 22, 23.</p>
<p align="justify">Behold the riches of this company. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) None of the saints bring anything with them to put 
    into the stock: but they are admitted freely.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Not only is a part for every one, but each one has 
    all; and so it may be, since the stock is infinite.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a most extensive communion. And it extends,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Over the earth; and so is called the Catholic or 
    universal church, 1 Corinthians 1:2. Though vast tracks of land and huge 
    seas interpose between them; though they have different languages, so that 
    some of them cannot understand what others say, and their customs are very 
    different; yet none of all these prevent their being members of one and the 
    same body.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To the heavens. The saints above belong to the 
    communion of saints, Hebrews 12:23. Ay, and the holy angels too, in the same 
    sense, verse 22; for the head of the saints is the head of angels too, 
    Colossians 2:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is a holy communion. It is a fellowship of 
    saints, Ephesians 2:19. "You are no more strangers and foreigners, but 
    fellow-citizens with the saints, and household of God." The head, center, 
    and bond, and members of this communion, are all holy. They are a society 
    set apart for God, drawn out of the world lying in wickedness, walking in 
    the way of holiness with displayed banners towards the holy land.</p>
<p align="justify">SECONDLY, That one's partaking of the sacrament is a 
    declaring and avouching himself to be of that communion. By partaking of 
    baptism we have all done it once; and by the Lord's supper it is done as oft 
    as we communicate in it. By the former in our infancy, it is done with our 
    virtual consent; by the latter with our express consent. This point will be 
    clear, if we consider the relation the sacrament has to the communion of 
    saints.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a sign and badge of the communion of saints. We 
    are one bread, says the text. The one bread signifying, that we are one 
    body; and by receiving the sign, and wearing the badge of the society, we 
    declare two things, according to the nature of a distinguishing sign.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That we are no more of the communion of the world 
    lying in wickedness, which is the opposite society, 1 Corinthians 10:21. 
    "You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and the table of devils." That 
    we have left our Father's house and people, and are no more to share with 
    them in their way and manner of life. It is the putting on the sign of 
    Zion's King, that we may be distinguished from those that belong to the 
    enemy.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That we are henceforth of the communion of saints, 
    and not neutrals, Revelation 14:1. That we have joined ourselves to that 
    blessed society of saints, the head of which is Jesus Christ, to take part 
    with them for better and worse. We have said to them, as Ruth to Naomi, Ruth 
    1:16. "Where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your 
    people shall be my people, and your God my God."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a seal of the communion of saints, and seals it 
    effectually to all those that do sincerely take hold of the covenant, Romans 
    4:11. The righteousness of faith is the possession of the society of saints, 
    and the sacrament sealing that to a man, seals his being of that communion. 
    A believer may be sore pressed with that question, How shall I put you among 
    the children? But the sacrament, to put it out of doubt, seals and confirms 
    his being put among them. Their being one body, is sealed by their partaking 
    of one bread. So 1 Corinthians 12:13.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The sacraments are the external bonds of this 
    communion, whereby they are visibly embodied into one select society, 1 
    Corinthians 12:13. And hence it is that the uncircumcised under the Old 
    Testament were to be cut off from their people. The church of God makes a 
    visible society in the world: and it is not the hearing of the word that is 
    the bond of it, for that is left common to any who will; but the sacraments, 
    which are not to be given but to visible believers.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is an engagement to the duties of this communion of 
    saints. "I therefore the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you, that you walk 
    worthy of the vocation with which you are called, with all lowliness and 
    meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring 
    to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and 
    one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, 
    one faith, one baptism," Ephesians 4:1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Whoever is embodied into 
    a regular society, by his entering into it, is obliged to walk by the rules 
    of it. And so the sacrament is an engagement or oath to walk by the rules of 
    holiness, which are the rules of the communion of saints.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, whoever does receive the public sign, seal, bond, 
    and engagements of a society, does thereby publicly declare and avouch 
    himself to be of that society: but, by partaking of the sacrament, the 
    partakers do take on the public sign—of the communion of saints: therefore, 
    etc.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. I draw some practical inferences from this doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">I. There is a very near and special particular relation 
    among the partakers of the sacraments, visibly constitute by their joint 
    partaking of them. They do thereby declare themselves to be of one body, the 
    head whereof is Jesus Christ: even baptism alone constitutes this special 
    relation, 1 Corinthians 12:13; for by that holy sign, the baptized are 
    distinguished from those without the visible church, and have all given up 
    their names to Christ. Much more does the receiving of the Lord's supper 
    also, as says the text.</p>
<p align="justify">As for the invisible real members of the communion of 
    saints, that is, the real members of the invisible church, God alone 
    certainly knows them in particular. But the visible members of it are saints 
    by profession, not visibly contradicted by their habitual practice, Romans 
    1:7. 1 Thessalonians 5:5. "You are all the children of light, and the 
    children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness." Among these 
    there is a special relation, as one visible body of Christ; those who are 
    only baptized, though they may be complete members of the invisible body, 
    being only incomplete members of the visible; and such as partake of the 
    sacrament of the supper, complete ones, as admitted unto all external 
    privileges of the communion of saints, even the highest of them, which is 
    that of the Lord's table. And therefore there is a more full relation among 
    communicants than others. Hence I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You who are baptized, yet openly wicked and profane, 
    or grossly ignorant of the fundamentals of religion, being come to years, 
    are apostates in effect, having by your way visibly cut off yourselves from 
    the communion of saints. For in your infancy you were baptized into that 
    body; but now by your unholy lives, you openly declare yourselves to be none 
    of it, and have taken on the devil's mark, and declare yourselves to be of 
    the world lying in wickedness, Romans 2:25. To you I say,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Have you not thus openly rejected communion with 
    God, that you may maintain communion with the world? If you will have 
    nothing ado with the family of Heaven, do you not renounce the Father of it 
    for your Father? If you will be none of Christ's mystical body, do you not 
    refuse him for a head? Yes, sure, 1 John 1:3.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Had it not been better for you, if you repent not, 
    to have lived and died among Pagans, where the name of Christ was never 
    heard, than to have been baptized into one body with the saints, and yet 
    cast off all by your openly profane life? 2 Peter 2:21. "For it had been 
    better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they 
    have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."</p>
<p align="justify">2. You who are saints by profession, yet only baptized, 
    not partakers of the Lord's table, why do you continue so? Who is there that 
    values a communion or society, and does not endeavor to partake of all the 
    privileges thereof, that may be of use to them? And, if you have any value 
    for the communion of saints, why do you not lay out yourselves to be one 
    bread with them? Sist your consciences before the Lord, and it will not be 
    excused from contempt of communion with Christ; with his mystical body, and 
    the means thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You who are saints by profession, and both baptized 
    and partakers of the Lord's table, your external privilege is great; you 
    stand visibly related to the communion of saints, as visible members 
    thereof. What a sad miss will it be, if you fail of real membership, and all 
    your interest in it be but show and pretense, as it will be, if you be not 
    real saints? It will be a poor plea at the great day, Luke 13:26.—"We have 
    eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets."</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The society you are visible apparent members of, is 
    the mystical body of Christ, enriched with the highest special privileges of 
    communion with the holy Trinity, to their eternal happiness. It will be a 
    sad matter for you to cheat yourselves with a show and semblance only of 
    partaking with them; with the empty name, while you have nothing of the 
    thing, Galatians 6:3. "For if a man think himself to be something, when he 
    is nothing, he deceives himself."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, You are not far from the kingdom of God. Will you 
    lose it for not going forward the other step, the main step? You have gone 
    through the several gates of the outer court of religion, the door of the 
    inner court stands open to you. Will you not enter in there where the great 
    glory of the house lies? 2 Timothy 3:7. The form of godliness will carry you 
    all the length you have gone in these externals; but the power of it is 
    necessary to evidence you a real member of that body.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, You will lose your good company before long, if you 
    get not a surer holding than mere visible membership; if you be not bound up 
    with them by the Spirit of holiness dwelling in you, as in them, the 
    external bands of sacraments will not do, John 15:2. "Every branch in me 
    that bears not fruit, he takes away."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) You may fall, 2 Timothy 2:18, 19. out from among 
    them, while you live, by apostasy, losing your fair leaves of a profession, 
    as well as fruit, 1 John 2:19. "They went out from us, but they were not of 
    us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) You will certainly be separated from among them at 
    death, Psalm 125:5. and at judgment, Matthew 25:32.</p>
<p align="justify">4. You who are real saints, baptized with the Holy 
    Spirit, and partakers of the invisible bread, as well as of the visible 
    bread, in the Lord's supper, and the outward baptism, happy are you in the 
    thorough relation you have with the communion of the saints. You are members 
    of it to all intents and purposes, true and real members of the mystical 
    body of Christ. Who can express the happiness of this privilege! I name only 
    these.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, You have passed the gulf as to condemnation, Romans 
    8:1. You are set beyond the reach of the condemning law: the curse is 
    removed, and you have got your Father's blessing, and you shall be blessed 
    for time and eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, You are most honorably related, of the blood-royal 
    of Heaven, since you are of the mystical body of Christ. Christ's Father is 
    your Father, John 20:17. "I ascend unto my Father and your Father, to my God 
    and your God." Himself is your head, Ephesians 1:22, 23. His Spirit is the 
    bond of your mystical union with him, Ephesians 4:4. The church is your 
    mother, and you are her true and genuine children, Galatians 4:26. The 
    glorified saints are your grown brethren, come to their full stature, and 
    you are the little ones of the same family, Ephesians 3:15. Ay, and the 
    angels too are so, Revelation 19:10. All these fall to you by that 
    membership.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, You are infinitely enriched; for on that society, 
    whereof you are members, all things are settled by the God of all, 1 
    Corinthians 3:21. "All things are yours." The purchase of the head belongs 
    to the members, and they have a title to all, and possess all in their head, 
    Colossians 2:10. So you are heirs of the world to come, heirs of glory, 
    Romans 8:17. The covenant is your charter, the sacraments the seals of it.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, You are perfectly secured, you shall never perish, 
    come what will come, John 3:16. "God so loved the world, that he gave his 
    only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have 
    everlasting life." Christ's natural body saw no corruption, even in a grave, 
    and Christ's mystical body cannot perish, nor any member of it, John 14:19. 
    "Because I live, you shall live also." You are secured against,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Falling off. The tree-leg may fall off from the 
    body, but the live-leg cannot: so hypocrites may fall away totally and 
    finally; but the believer cannot, because a living member of Christ's body, 
    John 10:28. "I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, 
    neither shall any pluck them out of my hand." A saint may fall down in a 
    mire, he may fall back, but never fall off, nor fall away.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Cutting off. It is true, a child of God, as to his 
    spiritual state, may be sick and sore; he may be bruised, wounded, and 
    broken at such a rate, that he is of little or no use for the head, or for 
    the body, but paining and bringing grief to both; and so think he is cut 
    off, Psalm 88:16. "Your fierce wrath goes over me, your terrors have cut me 
    off." But no man will ever yield to the cutting off a member of his body, 
    while it is in his power to cure it: and therefore, forasmuch as no case of 
    a saint is beyond the reach of the great Physician's skill, be their case 
    what it will, they shall be cured at length, but never cut off.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Dying off. Spiritual death can never overtake them 
    again; the infinite Spirit, the bond of the union, will always preserve the 
    communication between the head and members, John 14:19. And temporal death 
    cannot dissolve the union; though it separate between soul and body, each of 
    them still remains united to Christ, 1 Thessalonians 4:14. All these things 
    are sealed by the sacrament.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The sacramental declaration is a matter of such 
    weight, as deserves the deepest impression on one's spirit, and the 
    tenderest regard in one's life, for all time thereafter. What that is you 
    have already heard, namely, a solemn declaration made by one's partaking, 
    that he is of the communion of saints, joined with them into one mystical 
    body of Christ. This is the declaration you made by your act of partaking; 
    and this is what, I say, deserves the deepest impression, etc. This will be 
    clear, if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The subject-matter of that declaration, which is most 
    important. It concerns the mystical body of Christ, and their joining 
    themselves unto it. Is it possible that one can have a weightier matter than 
    that in hand? Does not eternity depend upon it? Heaven or Hell hang upon it 
    to your soul? Can any rational man think that to be a matter for one to play 
    with, not to be in deepest earnest about it?</p>
<p align="justify">2. The parties to whom it is made, God and all the 
    saints. The Lord has erected the saints into a society under Christ the 
    alone head; they have their patent in Heaven, and God has endowed them with 
    the richest privileges. He sends out the gospel-proclamation, inviting all 
    to join them, and offering them admission into it freely, withal making the 
    partaking of the sacraments to be their declaration of entering into it, 1 
    Corinthians 12:13. So it is evident the partaker, by his action, says unto 
    God, Isaiah 44:5. "I am the Lord's;" and to all the saints, Zechariah 8:23. 
    "We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you." If you think 
    light of making that declaration to them, do but consider the day when the 
    Lord, and all his saints shall judge the world, and call you to an account 
    of the declaration made to themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The nature of that declaration. It is not indeed 
    verbal, but real; not by words, but by an action, but that instituted by 
    Christ, and so interpreted by him, as importing what it was designed to 
    signify. As it is sacramental, it is of the nature of an oath, wherein God 
    is invocated as judge and witness of the sincerity of your declaration. So 
    that you have in effect sworn yourselves of the communion of saints: and 
    that is weighty.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The solemnity of it. It was not a business huddled up 
    in secret, but done openly. The sacraments are public actions of their own 
    nature: and therefore our church has wrested against private baptism and 
    private communion. You were, I suppose, baptized in presence of the church, 
    a lesser or greater number present. You did communicate in the Lord's supper 
    in the face of the sun, and before many witnesses, in a most solemn manner. 
    It was a very solemn covenanting between God and Abram, Genesis 15:9–18. And 
    your covenant-declaration was over the broken body and shed blood of Christ 
    represented in the sacrament. What greater solemnity could there be?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The amount of it. If you do not sincerely cleave 
    to it, but in your practice cast it behind your back, it will amount to a 
    lie made to God himself, and to all his saints, in a matter of the utmost 
    weight with the greatest solemnity, yes, to the guilt of perjury in effect. 
    Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead for a lie made in the matter of the 
    price of their land: what will be the punishment of a lie made with such 
    solemnity to God, over the broken body of his Son? Matthew 24:46. "He shall 
    cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites." Compared 
    with Jeremiah 34:18–20. "I will give the men that have transgressed my 
    covenant,—which they have made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, 
    and passed between the parts thereof.—I will even give them into the hand of 
    their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life." Wherefore,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Reflect on, and seriously consider what you have 
    avouched solemnly in partaking of the sacraments. Think on the action 
    deeply, and the import of it, and impress it on your spirits. Look back all 
    of you to your baptism.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider that in your baptism you were given up to 
    Christ, to lay hold on him by faith, Acts 19:4. That therein you declared 
    and avouched your putting on Christ, Galatians 3:27. "For as many of you as 
    have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ." Your dying to sin, and 
    living to righteousness, Romans 6:3, 4. "don't you know, that so many of us 
    as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized unto his death? Therefore 
    we are buried with him by baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised 
    up from the dead—even so we also should walk in newness of life." Your being 
    of the mystical body of Christ, 1 Corinthians 12:13. "For by one Spirit we 
    are all baptized into one body." If people would seriously consider the 
    import of their baptism, they who think themselves loose by their not being 
    communicants, would see they are bound already; and that they do but cheat 
    themselves in thinking, by the neglect of the supper, to keep off these 
    bands, which they are already firmly under; the which if they regard not, 
    they will hear it afterwards to their cost.</p>
<p align="justify">Look back, communicants, to your partaking. Consider what 
    you have done. You have declared yourselves well pleased with the device of 
    salvation through a crucified Christ, your taking of him to be your head and 
    ruler, your joining yourselves to him by faith as lively members of his 
    mystical body; that you are no more henceforth to be of the communion of the 
    world lying in wickedness, but for the Lord only, wholly, and forever; to 
    take your part with the saints in the world, whatever your lot be, Psalm 
    45:10. You have said all this, and in effect sworn it, over the broken body 
    of Christ, before angels and men.</p>
<p align="justify">You would do well to take some time alone to reflect on 
    this, and to revive the impressions. We find the saints making such 
    reflections, and putting themselves in mind of what they have done in such a 
    case, Psalm 16:2. "O my soul, you have said unto the Lord, You are my Lord." 
    Psalm 119:57, 106. "I have sworn, and I will perform it—that I will keep 
    your righteous judgments."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Never forget it, Jeremiah 50:5. People use not to 
    forget their marriage-day, and the transactions of it. But, alas! the 
    declared marriage-consent to Christ is often forgotten, notwithstanding the 
    solemnity at it, Jeremiah 2:32. "Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride 
    her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number." They are 
    men of prostituted consciences, who forget their oaths, and have wrought 
    themselves clean of the impressions of them. But, alas! there are many, who 
    sometimes made this solemn declaration, who seem to have quite forgot it, 
    and the impressions are razed. But have you forgot it? God has sworn he will 
    never forget it, Amos 8:7. "The Lord has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, 
    Surely I will never forget any of their works." See Jeremiah 2:2.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Remember it afresh on particular occasions, and awe 
    your spirits with it, when temptations offer to come to you against it. 
    Remember it as Jephthah did his vow, Judges 11:35. "I have opened my mouth 
    unto the Lord, and I cannot go back."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) When your old lusts come back and fawn on you. No 
    doubt they will come, but deny them, 1 Peter 1:14 "As obedient children, not 
    fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts, in your ignorance." 
    Remember you have solemnly declared against them of your own accord, and to 
    go back to them must be to go over the belly of God's bands on you.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When your old companions in sin would draw you aside 
    with them, then say, as Joseph, Genesis 39:9. "How can I do this great 
    wickedness, and sin against God?" Remember you are not of their communion, 
    but have solemnly renounced it, and have embodied with the saints. Is it not 
    a very good reason not to serve the devil with men, because you are not of 
    the communion of his servants and society?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Do not retract it. It is too solemn and weighty a 
    business to eat in again, Proverbs 20:25. "It is a snare to the man to 
    devour that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry." Ecclesiastes 
    5:5. "Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not 
    pay." Some poor wretches expressly retract and renounce their sacramental 
    vows, giving themselves to Satan. Many practically retract their sacramental 
    declaration, particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) By slighting the renewing of it, when the Lord puts 
    an occasion of it in their hands. Thus many baptized persons never set 
    themselves to partake of the Lord's table: some that have partaken of it 
    sometime, leave it off again. Does not this plainly say, that, if they had 
    that to do which is done in that matter, it should not be done for them now? 
    and is not that retracting practically? Luke 9:62. "No man having put his 
    hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." Lot's 
    wife's rueful looking back was dear to her.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By living a loose and licentious life, as if one had 
    never come under bonds to be the Lord's, Titus 1:16. The language of the 
    conversation of many is, "Let us break their bands," etc. O that such would 
    consider, Hebrews 10:38. "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no 
    pleasure in him."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Beware of everything unsuitable to it. You have 
    declared yourselves of the communion of saints, do nothing unsuitable to 
    that communion, and your own solemn declaration. Let not the way of God be 
    evil-spoken of through your unsuitable walk, Romans 2:24. Always remember 
    your character as professed members of the communion of saints, and walk 
    accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Separation from the men of the world lying in 
    wickedness, and fixed standing off from the communion of sinners, is the 
    necessary duty of all saints by profession, and particularly of 
    communicants. Numbers 23:9. "The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be 
    reckoned among the nations." 2 Corinthians 6:14–17. "Be you not unequally 
    yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with 
    unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness? and what 
    concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he who believes with an 
    infidel?—Wherefore come out from among them, and be you separate, says the 
    Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">First, Whereto this holy separation extends itself.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Negatively, It does not extend,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To the casting off the duties of natural affections, 
    and relations to them, 1 Corinthians 7:12, 13. "If any brother has a wife 
    that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her 
    away," etc. Religion does not weaken, but purify and strengthen natural 
    affection, Romans 9:4. And the nearer that sinners stand related unto 
    saints, they will have, and ought to have the greater concern for them, both 
    for their spiritual and temporal good.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Not to the casting off civil converse with the men 
    of the world, according as one has the call of providence thereto. 1 
    Corinthians 7:9, 10. "I wrote unto you—not to company with fornicators. Yet 
    not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or 
    extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the 
    world." The saints are not shut up in a corner of the world by themselves, 
    and therefore must needs have civil society with the men of this world. 
    Neither does religion divest Christians of humanity, or give them a liberty 
    to be rude and indiscreet to others; but obliges them to "live peaceably 
    with all men,"—Romans 12:18. to "honor them," 1 Peter 2:17. to be 
    "courteous," Chapter 3:8, 9.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Nor to the hindering of us to do them all the good 
    we can. Nay, religion obliges us to seek their good, 1 Timothy 2:1. "I 
    exhort therefore, that—supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of 
    thanks be made for all men:" and to do good to their souls and bodies, as we 
    have opportunity, Galatians 6:10. "As we have therefore opportunity, let us 
    do good to all men."</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Nor to the refusing to serve God, and worship him 
    with them according to his own institution. This our Savior himself did, 
    Luke 4:16. "And he came to Nazareth—and, as his custom was, he went into the 
    synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up for to read." Thus did the 
    apostles also with the Jews. Thus, in all congregations of saints in the 
    world, there are readily found some who have no appearance of saint-ship, 
    whom yet they do not so shun as to refuse to worship God with them in his 
    own way.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Positively, It extends to, and consists in,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Shunning all unnecessary society and familiarity 
    with them, Psalm 24:4, 5. "I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I 
    go with dissemblers. I have hated the congregation of evil-doers: and will 
    not sit with the wicked." They are not to be chosen for our companions of 
    converse, or friendship, far less for companions of life, where we can have 
    a choice; but we are to be companions of those that fear the Lord. The 
    company of sinners has been fatal to many, Proverbs 13:20. "He who walks 
    with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be destroyed." 
    Men of the same employment, or that are going to one place, draw together: 
    and should not Christians draw to Christians? It is sad to make Christian 
    congregations and families, like Noah's ark, a receptacle for clean and 
    unclean, 1 Corinthians 15:33. "Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt 
    good manners."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Non-conformity to the world, Romans 12:2. "And be 
    not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your 
    mind."—You must have another manner of life and conversation than they, if 
    you be of the communion of saints. It is a disgrace to religion, for the men 
    of the world to have it to say of a saint by profession, "Behold, the man is 
    as one of us." Make them not your rule, your example, nor do you think to 
    stamp an offensive way into a lawful one, by the authority of the multitude. 
    For the multitude is in the way to destruction, Matthew 7:13.—"Wide is the 
    gate, and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be 
    which go in thereat:" and their principles are lax, and their practice 
    licentious: they look on tenderness as niceness and preciseness, and wonder 
    that you cannot take the same liberty they do, 1 Peter 4:4. "Wherein they 
    think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, 
    speaking evil of you." But look you to God's word for your way, and see 
    yourselves obliged to separate from them in your manner of life. See the 
    general rule, Philip. 4:8. "Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, 
    whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are 
    pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if 
    there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Refusing communion with them in sin, Proverbs 1:10. 
    "My son, if sinners entice you, consent you not." Every man is for his own 
    master's interest, and therefore they are for bringing you over into the 
    service of the devil their master, as you will be for bringing them to 
    Christ, if you be real Christians. Beware of fellowship with them in sin, 
    Ephesians 5:11. "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of 
    darkness, but rather reprove them." Do not homologate their sinful courses 
    by approving or consenting any manner of way thereto, far less by actual 
    joining with them in their sin, Psalm 50:18. It is an affront to Heaven, but 
    a pleasure to Hell, to see Christ's sheep and the devil's goats yoked 
    together in one sinful course. Nay, communicant, you should be like the 
    ermine, that will by no means pass over the mud, that would stain its 
    precious fur.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Refusing communion with them in the worship of God, 
    in a false way, or even in a right way upon sinful terms. The saints must 
    separate from all false worship, that is, worship which is not instituted by 
    God himself wholly, but is mixed with human inventions and ordinances, 
    Revelation 18:4. Nay, where the worship is pure, but some sinful thing is 
    imposed upon you as a term of communion with the worshipers, you must refuse 
    communion with them in worship on these terms, Romans 3:8. In these cases 
    separation is not only lawful, but a necessary duty. And could I perceive 
    either of these this day, in our case, in the communion of this church, I 
    should not only think it my duty to separate, but also to press you to it. 
    But though our mother has gone far back, she has not gone that length yet.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Reasons of this separation. Because,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The communion of saints and the communion of sinners 
    are opposite societies, 1 John 5:19. "And we know that we are of God, and 
    the whole world lies in wickedness." So that joining to the one particularly 
    infers separation from the other. You may as well imagine to bring east and 
    west together, to make fire and water agree, as to make God's family and the 
    devil's to agree; the seed of the woman and serpent. Wherefore, having 
    joined to the communion of saints, you must needs separate from the 
    communion of sinners, Matthew 6:24. "No man can serve two masters: for 
    either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the 
    one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The communion of saints is gathered out of the world 
    lying in wickedness; so that separation from the world is enrapt up in the 
    very constitution of the society of saints, 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18. 
    "Wherefore come out from among them, and be you separate, says the Lord, and 
    touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."—The mystical body of 
    Christ is made up of those that were sometimes limbs of the devil: the 
    branches engrafted into the true vine were all broken off from our natural 
    stock, the old Adam, that degenerate, dead, and killing stock: Christ's 
    family of mankind is wholly made up of run-always from the devil's family, 
    Psalm 45:10. So that if you be saints at all, you are separatists.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The design of erecting the communion of saints is, 
    that they may be a separate society by themselves, under Christ their head, 
    to his honor, Numbers 23:9. Ephesians 5:25–27. They are a peculiar people, 1 
    Peter 2:9. How will they answer the design of their erection, and the honor 
    of their head, if they be not thus a separate people? Our Lord Christ has 
    appointed badges of this communion, namely, the sacraments, to be external 
    signs of distinction, between his and the world: and can it be thought but 
    they will distinguish themselves by their practice?</p>
<p align="justify">4. The profession of saintship is the profession of this 
    separation, 1 Corinthians 12:13. Let baptized persons and communicants be 
    ashamed to say they do not pretend to be saints. If you pretend not to be 
    saints, renounce your pretensions to Heaven, for none other come there, 
    Hebrews 12:14. "Follow peace with men, and holiness, without which no man 
    shall see the Lord." If you pretend not to be saints, you must own 
    yourselves apostates, that have renounced and cast off the communion of 
    saints. And, communicants, if you pretend not to be saints, how dared you 
    adventure to sit down at the Lord's table? Well, in so far as you were 
    baptized and communicated, you professed yourselves members of Christ's 
    body, saints, and so separate from the world: therefore you must live 
    separate from them.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, I say unto all saints by profession, and 
    particularly communicants—"Save yourselves from this untoward generation," 
    Acts 2:14. 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18. Shun all unnecessary society with those 
    of the world lying in wickedness, conform not to their ways, have no 
    communion with them in sin, nor in the service of God on sinful terms. 
    Remember you have solemnly declared yourselves of another communion than 
    with them.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. Consider the authority of God that binds this 
    upon you. Ephesians 5:7, 8, 11. "Be not you therefore partakers with them. 
    For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walks as 
    children of light.—And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of 
    darkness, but rather reprove them." The men and women of the world are 
    separated from God, Ephesians 2:12. They are walking contrary to him: and 
    therefore he will have you to separate from them, and be as a people 
    dwelling alone, in the midst of the world's throng, because they are not of 
    your communion.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The proof of the sincerity of your pretension to 
    saintship depends very much on it. Psalm 16:2, 3. "My goodness extends not 
    to you; but to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in 
    whom is all my delight." See also, Psalm 26:4, 5 and 15:4. It is evident men 
    will choose such company as is most agreeable, in their opinion, to their 
    own temper and disposition. And so one may very well guess at the 
    disposition of a person by the company he chooses and delights in. And if 
    you are inclined to be a companion of the graceless, rather than of the 
    gracious, it is a shrewd sign of a graceless heart.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The honor of God lies at stake here, Romans 2:24. If 
    you do wear Christ's badge, and will not separate from the communion of 
    sinners, but go with them in their way, religion will be wounded through 
    your sides, and exposed to the mockery of profane men. And there are 
    particularly three communions of sinners I would warn you against, as you 
    would not stab religion to the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The communion of drunkards. O how unlike is that to 
    the communion of saints at the Lord's table! For the Lord's sake 
    communicants, when you have the temptation, remember that word, 1 
    Corinthians 10:21, 22. "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of 
    devils. You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and the table of 
    devils. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The communion of harlots. That is a communion of 
    sinners, in an eminent manner, most inconsistent with the communion of 
    saints, from which the apostle argues against it, 1 Corinthians 6:15–17. 
    "don't you know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then 
    take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God 
    forbid. What, don't you know that he who is joined to an harlot is one 
    body?—But he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The communion of unjust men, in sinful dishonest 
    ways of getting gain. Solomon speaks of this, Proverbs 1:14, 15. It is dear 
    bought that is got at the rate of God's displeasure.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, If you separate not from them, you will perish 
    with them, Revelation 18:4. If you partake of their sins, you must partake 
    of their plagues.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. There are certain duties of the communion of saints 
    lying on all the members of it, by virtue of their membership: the which 
    duties all saints by profession, and especially communicants, are solemnly 
    engaged unto by their partaking of the sacraments.</p>
<p align="justify">To clear the first part of this inference, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Every relation wherein one stands brings along with it 
    a train of duties with respect to one's relatives. Relations are the joints 
    of society, whereby persons are joined together for mutual usefulness; and 
    their union is the ground of this debt they owe to one another. This holds 
    in all relations, natural relations, and voluntary ones too made by consent. 
    If one be a father of children, there are paternal duties lying on him by 
    virtue of that relation; if he be a child of such parents, he owes a duty to 
    them. If one become a member of a family, a kingdom, or any corporation, his 
    membership lays him under such and such duties: wherefore it is not to be 
    doubted, but, in as much as one is a member of the communion of saints, he 
    is under obligations to the duties of that society.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is a certain connection between privilege 
    bestowed on a man, and duty required of him. If one be admitted to the 
    privilege of any society, he must with the honor receive the burden of duty 
    belonging to it. If we receive the privilege of sons of God, we must be 
    obedient children—"not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts 
    in your ignorance," 1 Peter 1:14. If we are members of the holy society 
    whereof Christ is the head, we must be holy as he is, verse 15, 16. "But as 
    he who has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation. 
    Because it is written, Be you holy, for I am holy." If we be advanced to the 
    communion of saints, we must act as becomes saints.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The principle of self-preservation, natural to all 
    men, evidences this. If one be taken with a pain in his foot, all the 
    members of the body will do their best to recover it; for if one member 
    suffer, all suffer by reason of the union among them, and the evil, if not 
    removed, creeps from one to another. So the apostle will have the saints in 
    Corinth to take heed to a corrupt member, and use the means to recover him, 
    from this principle of self-preservation, 1 Corinthians 5:6. They who dwell 
    together find themselves obliged to take heed every one to his neighbor's 
    house, lest, when the neighbor's house is on fire, the flames also catch 
    hold of their own: wherefore whoever is a member of the communion of saints, 
    must see a duty lying on him as such.</p>
<p align="justify">To clear the second part of the inference, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. By partaking of the sacrament one declares himself to 
    be of the communion of saints, and consequently declares his being engaged 
    to the duties of that communion, 1 John 2:6. He voluntarily takes on the 
    yoke, while he yokes himself with those who bear it. If one pretends to the 
    privilege, he cannot in reason shake himself loose of the duty. "And why 
    call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" Luke 6:46.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sacraments are the external bands of our union 
    with Christ the head, and the members, 1 Corinthians 12:13. Thereby we are 
    sacramentally joined with the saints into one body, one bread. What is the 
    partaking of them, then, less than solemnly, as it were by oath, engaging 
    ourselves to the duties of the communion of saints?</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, all you who are saints by profession, 
    particularly communicants, as you are one visible body of Christ, a visible 
    communion of saints, I would press on you the duties which lie upon you as 
    such. And they are of three sorts.</p>
<p align="justify">First, There are duties you owe to the head. Christ is 
    the head of this body the communion of saints, Ephesians 1:22, 23. You are 
    the professed members of Christ, and of his body; consider and 
    conscientiously practice the duty you owe to your head.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Acknowledge not, nor own any other for head of the 
    church or communion of saints, but Jesus Christ, Ephesians 5:23. Men may 
    distinguish as they will; but, as a body with more heads than one is a 
    monster in nature, the scripture is plain, the communion of saints, which is 
    the church, is no such monster, Ephesians 4:4, 5. "One body one Lord." The 
    Roman Antichrist has long blasphemously arrogate to himself the headship and 
    supremacy, and, at the lame reformation of England, it was taken from the 
    pope there, but not restored to the royal Mediator, but made a part of their 
    king's royal dignity. And in the days of Scotland's apostasy from their 
    covenanted God, it was sacrilegiously usurped over this church by the powers 
    then reigning, but contended against by the sufferings of many of this 
    church, the Lord having made the Mediator's alone headship and supremacy a 
    peculiar piece of this church's testimony, for which, alas! the present 
    generation has not been duly jealous, the which has helped to bring this 
    church into the miserable pass she is at this day. But why should any 
    pretend to be head of the body of Christ? to be her head, while they cannot 
    communicate life or spirit to her? This is Christ's peculiar prerogative, 
    communicable to no mortal.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Depend by faith on Jesus Christ, as your head, for 
    all. He is constituted the head of that society whereof you are members, and 
    by virtue of his headship their life lies in him, the direction and care of 
    them lies on him.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Depend on him for vital influences, Colossians 
    2:19.—"From which all the body by joints and bands, having nourishment 
    ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God." The 
    believer's life lies in him, Colossians 3:3.—"Your life is hidden with 
    Christ in God." Therefore it cannot be lost, John 14:19.—"Because I live you 
    shall live also." The church is liable to great decay; she may be under a 
    spiritual consumption, her pulse may beat very low, yet the sickness cannot 
    be unto death, because there is still life in the head, which will be 
    communicated more abundantly to the members. It is our business to live by 
    faith, and draw virtue from him, and not to live on our inherent stock of 
    life and grace, 2 Timothy 2:1. Two things are here to be observed.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That there is a fullness lodged in Christ as the 
    head of the body, to be communicated to all the members, Colossians 1:19. A 
    fullness of a fountain, which has not only enough for itself, but those that 
    come to draw. There is a fullness of merit in him, for the life of pure 
    pardon and comfort, and refreshment for the soul slain with a sense of 
    guilt: a fullness of Spirit for the life of sanctification; and ready access 
    to it for all the members, John 1:16. "And of his fullness have all we 
    received, and grace for grace."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The promises are the conduit-pipes by which 
    influences of grace run into us, and faith is the drawing grace by which 
    they are brought into the soul, Galatians 2:20. The settled method of the 
    dispensation of grace is that, "According to your faith, so be it unto you." 
    Faith believes and applies the promises, and so life more abundantly is 
    conveyed, Hosea 14:7.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Depend upon him for direction, Proverbs 3:5, 6. 
    "Trust in the Lord with all your heart: and lean not to your own 
    understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your 
    steps." The direction of the whole body belongs to the head, and the 
    direction and guidance of all the members of Christ to him, by virtue of his 
    headship. Therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Take not the guiding of yourselves upon yourselves, 
    trust not to your own wit and skill. If you do, it is an usurping of 
    Christ's prerogative, Isaiah 55:5. and you will not prosper in it, but 
    stumble at noon-day. Where are the eyes but in the head? And therefore since 
    Christ is the head of all the saints, he is appointed of the Father to be 
    eyes to them in the wilderness. And the way of carnal wit has ay been 
    ruining to churches, and particular members. The end of the way, pointed out 
    by it, is always misery.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Look to him, and trust him for direction in all 
    cases, Proverbs 3:3. God brings his people into a thicket of perplexities, 
    and they are at their wits end, that faith may begin, and wait for a way 
    when they can see none, Isaiah 42:16. Then he leads them by his word, 
    providence, and Spirit. He is the pilot of the ship bound to Emmanuel's land 
    with all the heirs of glory as passengers; their guide through the wayless 
    wilderness, and they must keep their eye on him.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Depend on his care, 1 Peter 5:7. "Casting all your 
    care upon him, for he cares for you." The care of the whole communion of 
    saints lies on Christ as their head, 1 Peter 2:25. The Father has given them 
    to him, devolved the care of them upon him, in such sort that he is to be 
    answerable for them, that none of them be lost, John 6:39. "And this is the 
    Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me, I should 
    lose nothing."—Thus the hearts of his people may safely trust in him,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) For provision. He, as their head, sees to the 
    provision of their souls, "providing them green pastures, and still waters," 
    Psalm 23:2. He provides for their bodies, Isaiah 33:16.—"Bread shall be 
    given him, his waters shall be sure." The faith of Christ's headship might 
    still all anxious thoughts about one's through-bearing in any case whatever: 
    for, come what will come, surely the head will ay see to the provision of 
    the members.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) For protection, Ephesians 5:23. The saints have many 
    enemies without and within; but, being settled under such a head, they may 
    be sure of protection in all dangers. They will ay be safe, if not from 
    trouble, yet in it, John 16:33. "These things I have spoken unto you, that 
    in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation; but be 
    of good cheer, I have overcome the world." From the sting of it, that it 
    shall do them no real harm, 1 Peter 3:13. "And who is he who will harm you, 
    if you be followers of that which is good?"</p>
<p align="justify">The saints are oft-times in a mighty stir, having great 
    cares on their own heads: but O how happy would they be, if they would lay 
    their cares all on their mystical head, and be at their duty, and leave them 
    all on him! "Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and 
    supplication—let your requests be made known unto God," Philip. 4:6.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Subject yourselves wholly to his government, as to 
    your head, Ephesians 5:22–24. The head must rule the body, and Christ must 
    rule you, if you be his members. Coming into the communion of saints, you 
    resign yourselves to the head of that society, for good and all, forever.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Be obedient to his commands, Luke 6:46. Our Lord 
    Jesus has freed the members of his mystical body from the law as a covenant 
    of works, but with his own hands he binds on them the yoke of obedience to 
    the commands thereof as his own commands, 1 Corinthians 9:21. "Being not 
    without law to God, but under the law to Christ." What confusion would there 
    be in the natural body, for the head to be directing and pointing out one 
    way, and the members going another? If Christ be your head, be ruled by him, 
    renouncing your own will, and making his your law.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Resign yourselves to the disposals of his 
    providence, 1 Samuel 3:18. 2 Samuel 1:25, 26. The members of Christ have 
    good reason for an absolute resignation of themselves and all their concerns 
    to the Lord. The sovereignty of their head may silence them; the wisdom and 
    love of their head to his own members may satisfy them, that whatever he 
    does with them is best done. Their interest is his own, as that of the 
    members is the interest of the head.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Let the interests of Jesus Christ, as your head, be 
    your interest, his honor and glory be dear unto you, Psalm 69:9. "For the 
    zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that 
    reproached you are fallen upon me." All the members of the body are 
    concerned for the head, as the head is for all the members; and those who 
    are not touched with the care of Christ's honor in the world, give shrewd 
    evidences they are none of his members. Then,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Act for the honor of your head, in every capacity 
    seeking to advance his glory, Psalm 45:17. "I will make your name to be 
    remembered in all generations."—There is a party in the world opposed to 
    Christ, and they act against him. He has been going among us, saying, Who is 
    on my side? And you, by professing your submission to him, and declaring 
    yourselves sacramentally to be of the communion of saints, have solemnly 
    gone over to his side. Then act for him, his truths and ways; act for him in 
    your families, in your neighborhoods, wherever you have access, whoever they 
    are that act against him.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Be ready to suffer for him, as he may call you. 
    Remember the communion of which you have declared yourselves members, is, in 
    this world, like a lily among thorns, which will be uneasy to them; and you 
    were warned of what is expected of all the members, Luke 14:26. In such a 
    long time of peace, it is no wonder many limbs of the devil have got in 
    among Christ's members, and many a hollow-hearted sinner is externally got 
    into the communion of saints, and the saints by this time, are much the 
    worse of their company; and between foolish virgins, and sleeping wise ones, 
    the interest of Christ and religion is going to decay. So that the case of 
    the church, in the common course of providence, seems to presage such a 
    trying stroke as will awaken living members, and make many dead lifeless 
    members fly off. But if Christ be your head, you will be so minded as to 
    suffer for him in his strength: you know nothing is more natural, than, when 
    a stroke is directed against one's head, to lift up one's arm to ward off 
    the blow from the head. The rage of enemies is against Christ himself; and 
    to quit Christ, and go over to their side, is the way many take in such a 
    day. But the real members of Christ's body take not that way, more than a 
    man will put out his head to keep off a stroke designed against his arms, 
    the head being that which all the members will take special care of. In the 
    mean time,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Suffer with him, Psalm 69:9. If the members suffer, 
    the head suffers with them; and if the head be pained, all the body suffers 
    with it; such is the sympathy. If Christ's members suffer, he sympathizeth 
    with them, Acts 9:4. And it is reasonable that they who think to reign with 
    Christ after, suffer with him now. This is a day wherein the glorious head 
    of the mystical body is suffering egregiously among us, and wherein all his 
    members are called to mourn as suffering with him, Psalm 119:136. "Rivers of 
    waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not your law." Our head suffers 
    from his open enemies, is wounded in the house of his friends, is suffering 
    from professors and profane, ministers and people of all ranks. Happy they 
    who shall be found mourning for the dishonors done to his name, truths, 
    ways, etc. they are like to be hidden in the day he rises up to resent the 
    affronts.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Take care of yourselves for the sake of your 
    head. The follies of a wife reflect dishonor on her husband. Men will take 
    care of their feet, for that, if they catch cold in them, it will fly up to 
    their head. O saints by profession, communicants, remember that from the day 
    you give up your names to Christ, and declare yourselves of the communion of 
    saints, the honor of Christ is concerned in your walk at another rate than 
    ever before. Your sins have a peculiar aggravation in them of dishonor to 
    your head, Romans 2:24. "For the name of God is blasphemed among the 
    Gentiles through you." Therefore, if you have any respect to the honor of 
    Christ, take heed that your conversation be as becomes the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, There are duties you owe to the body in 
    general, the mystical body of Christ, which is the church or communion of 
    saints, Ephesians 1:22, 23. You are professed members of this body, whereof 
    Christ is the head; and this body is not confined to one particular church, 
    but is made up of all the churches of Christ, and particular saints through 
    the world, united to Christ by his Spirit dwelling in them. Consider, and 
    practice the duties to this body, lying on you by virtue of your membership.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Sympathize with the body, as being yourselves of it, 1 
    Corinthians 12:26. "And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer 
    with it." The concerns of the church of Christ through the world should be 
    the concern of every member. Distance of place, and differences in lesser 
    things among those of the mystical body of Christ, should not take away this 
    concern. Whoever are allowed a place in Christ's mystical body, should have 
    room allowed them in our hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Mourn with the body under its affliction and evils. 
    Such a kindly member was Nehemiah, chapter 2:2. The distresses of foreign 
    churches, as well as of our own, require our cordial sympathy; and the 
    saints are naturally led to it, as knit with them to one common head.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Rejoice with it in its prosperity, 1 Corinthians 
    12:26. "And whether one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it." 
    The thriving of the kingdom of Christ, in any place through the world, 
    should be refreshful to all the members of Christ, and fill their mouths 
    with praises. To bear a part in the joys and moans of the church everywhere, 
    is the natural duty of all the members.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Pray continually for the welfare of the body, Psalm 
    122:6. "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love you." 
    Isaiah 62:6, 7, "You that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence; and 
    give him no rest until he establish, and until he make Jerusalem a praise in 
    the earth." The apostle is express for all saints, Ephesians 6:18. "Praying 
    always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching 
    thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints." Confine 
    not your prayers to your own private case, but in all earnestness extend 
    them to the church of Christ in the land where you live, and through the 
    world. Prayer is a duty wherein all the members of Christ on earth can have 
    actual communion; they meet at the throne of grace who never saw one 
    another's face. It is the joint petition of all the saints, "Your kingdom 
    come." Pray for the building up, increase, peace, and purity of the church 
    universal.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Take your lot with the body in foul or fair weather. 
    You have said in effect, to this happy society, as Ruth 1:16. Sometimes 
    there is a storm on the church of Christ, when the world lying in wickedness 
    enjoys a calm. This occasions many naughty members to change sides, to 
    desert the communion of saints, and fall in with the communion of sinners, 2 
    Timothy 4:10. "Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world." You 
    know not how soon you may be tried in this point; but do you resolutely 
    adhere to the mystical body. To move you to which, consider these three 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is safer to be with the saints in their lowest 
    condition, than with sinners in the highest pinnacle of prosperity: for the 
    darkest night with the former will have a joyful morning, Psalm 97:11. while 
    the fairest day with the latter will issue in a black and fearful night, 
    Ecclesiastes 7:5, 6.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The trial of sincerity of members is one of the 
    great ends of the Lord's bringing trouble on the body, to try who are wise 
    and foolish builders. It is true, when the natural body being sick is laid 
    upon a-bed, the tree-leg is laid by, but all the living members of the body 
    go with it. So, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Backsliding is dangerous, and speaks one not fit for 
    the kingdom of God, Luke 9:62. "No man having put his hand to the plough, 
    and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God;" it exposes one to the 
    fearful displeasure of God, Hebrews 10:38. "But if any man draw back, my 
    soul shall have no pleasure in him;" and makes their case worse than if they 
    had never set out heavenward.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Strive in all lawful ways to maintain and advance the 
    interests of the body; for the interest of the church is the interest of 
    Christ, and dear therefore to every member. The truths of God are a sacred 
    trust committed to the church, the pillar of truth; and they require our 
    deep concern for the defense thereof, against the assaults of error, Jude 3. 
    "Contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints." 
    Christ's ordinances and institutions, and the several privileges thereof, 
    which Satan and the world seek to deprive her of and corrupt, they are 
    Christ's purchase for his mystical body, and therefore they are to be held 
    fast, and the purity of them contended for, refusing to subject them or 
    ourselves to the lusts of men, Galatians 5:1. 1 Corinthians 7:23. This will 
    always require doing of us, holding hand to the maintenance of the precious 
    interests of the mystical body, Psalm 45:17. and sometimes suffering, 
    Hebrews 12:3, 4. It is a debt we owe to Christ, to the church, to posterity, 
    and to our own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be tender of the unity of the body, Ephesians 
    5:3, 4. "Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," 
    1 Corinthians 12:25. Schisms, rents, and divisions in the church, are like 
    wounds, cuts, and breaking of bones in the natural body, which exceedingly 
    weaken it, and mar its beauty. They are the sin and judgment of a church, 
    bringing dishonor to the Lord Jesus, marring the success of the gospel, and 
    ruining the church at length: they bring much grief to tender souls, and 
    expose religion to the mockery of enemies. The renting of the body of Christ 
    has so much of horror about it, as may make it frightful to serious members. 
    We must separate from none farther than they separate from Christ. We must 
    not go into sin with members of the mystical body, more than with the world, 
    under the pain of the displeasure of the Head: but we may lawfully serve the 
    Lord in his own ordinances with sinful members; even as though when one foot 
    is in a mire, the other must not go into the mire with it, yet there is no 
    necessity of rending the one leg from the other, but the one may still walk 
    with the other on clean ground.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, There are duties you owe to the members in 
    particular, as you are fellow-members with them of the same body, 1 Cor 
    12:25. "That there should be no schism in the body, but that the members 
    should have the same care one for another." It is not in your power to know 
    certainly and infallibly who are real members of this body, as others cannot 
    know the same concerning you: but the visible body of Christ is made up of 
    saints by profession, not openly contradicted by their habitual practice, 1 
    Corinthians 1:2. and as such they are admitted to the Lord's table, upon 
    their desire.</p>
<p align="justify">So there is a particular visible relation among all 
    saints by profession, and particularly among communicants, as visible 
    members of the same mystical body of Christ. And therefore, though they owe 
    a duty to all men, of love, good-will and beneficence, yet they are in a 
    particular manner engaged to dutifulness to one another, as members of the 
    visible communion of saints separate from the world.</p>
<p align="justify">Of this visible body or communion there are two sorts of 
    members, official and simple ones; the former bearing office in the body, 
    the other not so, but private persons; both members of the one body.</p>
<p align="justify">First, The official members are the office-bearers in the 
    church, which is the body, and these are pastors, teachers, ruling-elders, 
    and deacons. These are in the mystical body, as in man's natural body are 
    the stomach, bearing the office of provider for the whole body, the legs of 
    supporters, the eyes of light to the whole body. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The duty of the official members to the rest may be 
    summed up in these two, as they are, Acts 20:28. namely,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That they take heed to themselves. They must take 
    heed to their feet, that they walk as becomes the gospel, and their office 
    and character: to their tongues, that their doctrine and instructions be 
    sound: and to their hearts, that these be upright, that so both word and 
    walk may be holy. This I reckon a duty they owe to the rest of the members, 
    as well as to themselves: because their holy tender walk is an ordinance of 
    Christ for edifying the body, as well as sound doctrine, 1 Timothy 4:12. "Be 
    you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in 
    spirit, in faith, in purity." 1 Peter 5:3. "Neither as being lords over 
    God's heritage, but being examples unto the flock." And a scandalous, 
    untender practice, in a church-officer, wounds not only his own conscience, 
    but does a singular mischief to the church; as a hurt in the eye does not 
    only wrong it, but the whole body.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, That they take heed to the rest of the members over 
    whom they are overseers, conscientiously following the duties of their 
    respective offices in the body. It is not enough that they be good men in 
    their private capacity; but that they be good ministers, elders, etc. in 
    their public capacity. If the stomach had never such a good disposition, yet 
    if it keep all the nourishment to itself only, the body would go to ruin: 
    so, if church-officers ply not their official duty, the church suffers by 
    them; they are useless, and worse than useless in the place they have in the 
    body.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is also a special duty that the rest of the 
    members owe to the official members in the body. And this also may be summed 
    up in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, A peculiar concern for them, Galatians 4:15. "For I 
    bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out 
    your own eyes, and have given them to me." It is evident nature itself 
    teaches a peculiar concern for those members which are of the most diffusive 
    usefulness in the natural body, by virtue of their office. Who would not 
    take many thrusts through the leg rather than one through the heart? Who 
    will put a toe in the balance with an eye? So, in the mystical body, however 
    selfish many are, yet tender considering Christians will have a peculiar 
    concern for official members.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) This should proceed from a reverential estimation of 
    them for their work's sake, 1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13. "And we beseech you, 
    brethren, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, 
    and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in love, for their work's 
    sake." Their work is great; if they have the honor, they have the burden 
    with it. Their work is for the honor of the head, and the profit of the 
    body: and many a time they are like the candle, which, giving light to 
    others, wastes itself. The Master has put an honor on them, and a reverend 
    regard to them, as his officers, is a duty acceptable to God in Christ; yet 
    this respect to them is but civil respect, though the motive is sacred.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It should vent itself in these.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Praying for them seriously, 2 Thessalonians 3:1. 
    "Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free 
    course, and be glorified." As their work is great, their needs, temptations, 
    and trials are many. The better it fares with them, it is likely to fare the 
    better with you: on the contrary, the worse it fares with with them, the 
    worse it will fare with you. So much is your own case enrapt up in theirs. 
    Pinch the stomach with hunger, the plump members of the body will soon fall: 
    let the disorders of it be cured, and the rest of the body will soon feel 
    the good of it. The devil strikes at them, that in them he may strike at the 
    whole congregation. And ministers get not only comforts, but afflictions 
    from the hand of God, for the good of the people, 2 Corinthians 4:5, 6. Then 
    even help them by your prayers that bear the burden.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Supporting of them cordially, 2 Timothy 1:16. "The 
    Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he oft refreshed me." 
    Encourage them in their work, which will be a lightening under a heavy 
    burden. You should support their credit, and cast a veil over their 
    infirmities, Galatians 4:14. "And my temptation which was in my flesh, you 
    despised not, nor rejected; but received me as angel of God, even as Christ 
    Jesus;" and not make molehills in them mountains, as many do, who delight to 
    blacken those of that character; unlike a kindly member of the body, which 
    will not spread, but endeavor to cure the weakness of an official member. 
    And by divine right the rest owe them a competent maintenance according to 
    their ability, 1 Corinthians 9:14. "Even so has the Lord ordained, that they 
    who preach the gospel should live of the gospel."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, A ready compliance with them in the work of their 
    office, as the body goes where the eyes direct, and the legs carry. An 
    implicit faith and blind obedience is due to no man; but the mind of the 
    Lord, held out by official members to the rest, is to be readily complied 
    with, as they would not incur the displeasure of the head, 1 Thessalonians 
    2:13. "For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because when you 
    received the Word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the 
    word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually 
    works also in you that believe."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Imitate them, and follow their steps so far as they 
    follow Christ. "Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ," 1 
    Corinthians 11:1. "Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them 
    which walk so, as you have us for an example," Philip. 3:17. It is a part of 
    the work of their office to be examples to the flock: and if that be a 
    divine ordinance, for the edification of the church, surely the rest of the 
    members are obliged to follow the example; and if they do not, their 
    practice, so far as it is holy, as well as their doctrine, will be a witness 
    against them. This is a point but little regarded. Many will tell how 
    church-officers should walk, that never once look on themselves as obliged 
    to follow their steps in the way of holiness: but the way of holiness is but 
    one to ministers and people, though many are ready to make two of them, and 
    take the broadest to themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Submit to their instructions, admonitions, 
    exhortations, etc. Hebrews 13:17. "Obey them that have the rule over you, 
    and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give 
    account."—What confusion would be in the natural body, if the members would 
    not be guided by the light of the eye, or refuse the nourishment prepared by 
    the stomach? So unnatural is it for the members of the mystical body, to be 
    refractory to the official members in the discharge of their duty, to refuse 
    their wholesome instructions, and to be satisfied without receiving benefit 
    of ordinances dispensed by them.</p>
<p align="justify">O learn to look on ministers, and other church-officers, 
    as standing in this capacity and relation to the body whereof you are 
    members. Consider them as members of the same mystical body with yourselves, 
    and as official members, in whose welfare, and regular discharge of their 
    office, your own welfare is enrapt up. This would,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Make you modestly and Christianly concerned that 
    they may do their duty to the edification of the body, Psalm 132:9. For 
    people to treat their ministers imperiously and disrespectfully, and 
    superciliously to dictate to them how to behave in the exercise of their 
    office, as many do, and value themselves upon it, is an argument of pride 
    and emptiness, of men's forgetting themselves, and regardlessness of that 
    order which Christ the head has appointed in his mystical body. But for 
    people, in a modest, serious, and Christian way, to excite their ministers 
    to their duty, to inform and advise them of what may contribute to their 
    carrying on the Lord's work most successfully, as the Lord's word gives them 
    warrant to do it, Colossians 4:17. and their own soul's interest in the 
    matter gives them a right to it; so a godly minister would bless God for 
    having such an advantage. Are not all the members concerned for the eye, 
    stomach, etc. in the natural body? But do they fall a beating of them, or 
    overcharging them, that they may do their office? No, but with all 
    tenderness to them they endeavor to enable them to do their respective 
    offices.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It would put you on to a conscientious performance 
    of your duty to them, your own soul's interest engaging you thereto, 1 
    Thessalonians 5:12. The fable of the members conspiring against the belly, 
    to pinch it by withholding food, and being forced to give it over by reason 
    that they themselves suffered by that means, may represent to us, as in an 
    emblem, the folly of a people undutiful to their ministers to their own 
    souls' great loss. The relation is so very near, that undutifulness on 
    either hand must be hurtful to both.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, The simple members are such as are not 
    office-bearers in the body, but private Christians. These owe a duty one to 
    another, as members of the same mystical body. They are the visible members 
    of the body of Christ, and so obliged to a native care for one another, 1 
    Corinthians 12:25.—"That the members should have the same care one for 
    another." This extends to all such Christians, through the world, as we have 
    occasion to do this duty towards; but in a special manner it is to be 
    exercised towards those with whom we live in actual church-communion; and 
    partakers of the Lord's supper together are in a special manner under this 
    obligation. As you are one bread and one body, so I would exhort you to make 
    conscience of the duties you owe to one another as such.</p>
<p align="justify">Communicants are a separated body from others, 
    distinguished from others, by the most solemn badge of the Christian 
    profession: O if they would carry themselves as a people separated from the 
    world to Jesus Christ, and joined together for him in one body, then would 
    we see the benefit of communions, to the honor of Christ, the success of the 
    gospel, and the good of their own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">The church is a society gathered out of the world, 
    visibly joined together by the use of the sacraments; though they are in the 
    world, they are not of it; and all the members of it should be a people 
    dwelling alone, though in the midst of others, not reckoned among the 
    nations. The truth is, there are many baptized in their infancy, who openly 
    go over to the world's side; but all you who are saints by profession, and 
    particularly communicants, as you profess yourselves to be of one body, and 
    owe a Christian duty to them that are without; so I would lay before you the 
    duties you owe to one another, by virtue of your being visible members of 
    one and the same body.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Love one another affectionately and sincerely, John 
    15:12. "This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved 
    you." To walk rightly in Christian communion, we must "walk in love," 
    Ephesians 5:2. You ought to love all men, being ready to desire their good, 
    and do them all the good you can: but you owe brotherly love to all the 
    visible members of Christ's body, which is so often recommended to the 
    followers of Christ, 1 Thessalonians 3:12. "And the Lord make you to 
    increase and abound in love one towards another, and towards all men, even 
    as we do towards you." Romans 12:10. "Be kindly affectioned one to 
    another, with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another." O what an 
    inconsistency is there in sitting down at the Lord's table together, the 
    table of love, and the hearts of the partakers never united in love!</p>
<p align="justify">Objection There are some so naughty in their way and 
    manner of life, that it is hard to love them with brotherly love.</p>
<p align="justify">Ans. The decay of love among the professors of 
    Christianity is most visible at this day: and I must say, I despair of 
    seeing due love among church-members restored, as long as the church among 
    us is so mixed with, and so little separated from the world, and until the 
    church be more distinguished from the nation, for as fond as we have been of 
    a national church. God separated them in the late times by the fire of 
    persecution, and then this love flamed among them: peace being restored, the 
    church even mixed again with the world lying in wickedness, and that love 
    died out of course. And while many are acknowledged as church-members, few, 
    very few are loved as such. The New-Testament churches, though there were 
    many hypocrites in them, yet they seem to have been constituted of visible 
    saints, saints by profession, not visibly contradicted by their practices, 
    Romans 1:7. 1 Corinthians 1:2. 1 Thessalonians 5:5. But more directly to the 
    objection.</p>
<p align="justify">It is plain that brotherly love is to be proportioned to 
    the degrees of the divine image discernible in any. And therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) where nothing of it appears, but people are openly 
    wicked, we owe not this brotherly love to them: and every member of the 
    church, private Christians as well as church officers, should endeavor that 
    they partake not of that one bread in the sacrament. But,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) since the best are not free of some evils hanging 
    about them, even to the discerning of others, we ought not to refuse 
    brotherly love to any in whom any lineaments of God's image appears, though 
    they have several things in their way altogether unlovely. It is the work of 
    grace here to pick the pearl of grace out of a dunghill of sinful qualities, 
    and to love the person for it, drawing a veil over many sins, 1 Peter 4:8. 
    "And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves; for charity 
    shall cover a multitude of sins." And not to aggravate the ills about them, 
    so as to hide their good from our eyes. Woe unto us if God should treat us 
    so, yes, or the saints; wherefore love one another.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is the principle of the duties of 
    church-communion, therefore called the bond of perfectness in the church, 
    Colossians 3:12, 13, 14. In the primitive church they were most dutiful one 
    to another; see the source of it, Acts 4:32. "And the multitude of them that 
    believed were of one heart and of one soul."—Where it prevails, it will make 
    every one concerned for the good of his fellow-Christian, as for his own: 
    where it is not, people, though in church-communion, will be ready to say, 
    "Am I my brother's keeper?" So the want of it turns all loose.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is a badge of sincerity. "We know that we have 
    passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren," 1 John 3:14. And 
    without it we cannot prove ourselves true Christians, neither to ourselves, 
    nor to the world of onlookers, John 13:35. "By this shall all men know that 
    you are my disciples, if you have love one to another." For love to God will 
    produce love to all those who bear his image.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) It is the most natural result of the love of Christ 
    to us, John 13:34.—"As I have loved you, that you also love one another." 
    Never was there such love as that of Christ to his people in his dying for 
    them: this shed abroad in the heart must needs make a loving disposition to 
    him, and all that belong to him, for his sake.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The near relation in which the followers of 
    Christ stand to one another, pleads for it. They are fellow-members of the 
    same body, joined together under one head, are members of one heavenly 
    family, shall dwell together for evermore in Heaven, and are joint objects 
    of the world's hatred.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Bear with one another's weaknesses, failures, and 
    infirmities. This has many branches, see Colossians 3:12, 13. "Put on 
    therefore (as the elect of God holy and beloved) affections of mercies, 
    kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one 
    another, and forgiving one another, if any man has a quarrel against 
    another: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you." Be of a meek, patient, 
    forbearing and forgiving temper, as to all men, so particularly to the 
    members of the body of Christ, your fellow-members, and that because they 
    are so. When we come to Heaven we will have nothing to bear with; but until 
    we come there, we will have occasion to exercise this grace towards others, 
    and others towards us, since every one has their own imperfections, and 
    there is not one to cast a stone at another on this score.</p>
<p align="justify">It is sad to see how easily professors are brought to 
    cast at one another, how they cannot bear the least provocation, cannot 
    forgive nor forget injuries; yes, many there are who rejoice in the failures 
    of others, and are glad when they get an ill tale of them, or see some false 
    step made by them, which they improve to run them down, and to the judging 
    of their state. But consider, I pray you,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) How the Lord bears with you, Ephesians 4:32. "And be 
    you kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God 
    for Christ's sake has forgiven you." O what would come of us if God would 
    bear no more with us than we can bear with our fellow-servants! Dreadful 
    would the measure be, if God should mete to us as we often do to our 
    fellow-Christians. Does the Spirit of the Lord suffer us long, and will not 
    we learn long-suffering? Are we forgiven talents, and will not forgive a few 
    pence?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) How the Lord bears with them. He overlooks many 
    things in his people, though he does not approve of them. Shall not his 
    example draw us to imitation?</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Do not we ourselves stand in need of forbearance and 
    forgiveness from others? Ecclesiastes 7:21, 22. "Also take no heed unto all 
    words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you. For often times 
    also your own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others." 
    And are every day in hazard of being led aside with temptation, Galatians 
    4:1. "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual 
    restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself lest you 
    also be tempted." Why should we then so forget ourselves, as not to allow to 
    others what we need from them?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Is not your interest in the matter, since you are 
    of the body with them? When one hand labors under any sore, does not the 
    other tenderly dress it, and even "those members of the body, which we think 
    less honorable, do not we bestow abundant honor on them?" 1 Corinthians 
    12:23. So should we be ready to cast a veil of love over the infirmities of 
    our brethren.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Watch over one another, Hebrews 10:24. "And let us 
    consider one another, to provoke to love, and to good works:" And 12:15. 
    "Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of 
    bitterness, springing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled." This is 
    one of the principal duties of church-communion, and, if duly managed, would 
    be of notable use for the honor of the head, and good of the body. It is 
    true the Lord has appointed some watchmen, by office, in his church: but the 
    law of love among the members of the mystical body, and the appointment of 
    the head, makes also every one watchman over another.</p>
<p align="justify">I mean not to encourage men to a censorious prying into 
    other men's matters, malicious searching into the hidden faults of others, 
    to get something whereupon to make them odious. There are abundance of these 
    who are spies from the devil's camp, improving their discoveries, imagined 
    or real, to the dishonor of religion, and wounding the reputation of the 
    brethren. But that, with an eye of love, you would observe one another's 
    walk, for your mutual advantage, to imitate what is lovely in one another, 
    and endeavor to amend what is amiss, or to prevent it. I take in under this 
    these following things.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Excite and stir up one another to a holy tender 
    walk, in the several parts or duties of it, Hebrews 10:24. Every member of 
    the body should be a spur to another, to quicken his pace in the way of 
    duty: so far should they be from being hindrances to, and clogs upon one 
    another. All of us have a principle of sloth in us, which disposes us to 
    flag and sink in our endeavors after holiness; and happy they who have a 
    fellow Christian to quicken them by word and example, Proverbs 27:17. "Iron 
    sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Warn one another of snares in your way, as 
    fellow-travelers towards Zion, 1 Thessalonians 5:14. "Now, we exhort you, 
    brethren, warn them that are unruly." One may see a snare before another, 
    which he is not aware of that is in the greatest hazard of it; and it is a 
    piece of Christian duty to warn one of it. This is to blow the trumpet as a 
    watchman, the trumpet of private warning, the which if he does not, he is 
    guilty of the sin his brother falls into, as not preventing it.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Confirm the staggering, and labor to bear up him 
    who is ready to fall, 1 Thessalonians 5:14. "Comfort the feeble-minded, 
    support the weak." O what a substantial kindness did Abigail to David, in 
    preventing the sin he was slipping into! An enemy is to be helped to raise 
    up his donkey lying under a burden, Exodus 23:5. that he may not lose it: 
    how much more, when one sees his brother under a weight of temptation, is he 
    to help him above it? like to be carried away with the stream, is he to 
    catch hold of him, and do his best to draw him out?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Admonish and reprove one another, in a spirit of 
    meekness, for what is amiss, Romans 15:14. 2 Thessalonians 3:15. Ephesians 
    5:11. The infirmity cleaving to the best, with the variety of snares lying 
    in our way, occasions every one sometimes to go wrong: and though it is easy 
    to step aside, it is not so easy to recover, and come into the way again. 
    This makes admonition necessary. There is a corrupt principle of self-love 
    in us, that we are apt to look on our own faults with an eye prejudged in 
    favor of them; therefore God has appointed this ordinance of mutual reproof 
    and admonition, that each one holding the glass to his neighbor's face, he 
    may see his spots, and wipe them off.</p>
<p align="justify">There is an authoritative admonition and reproof 
    administered by church-officers, in virtue of their office, not only to 
    hearers promiscuously, in the preaching of the word, but to persons 
    particularly by themselves, in the way of discipline, 1 Timothy 5:20. "Them 
    that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear." Or privately, as 
    Nathan did to David. See 1 Thessalonians 5:12. "And we beseech you, 
    brethren, to know them which are over you in the Lord, and admonish you." 
    The which, though privately administered, is public, in respect of the 
    public person who gives it. But of this we speak not.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a charitable admonition and reproof belonging to 
    private persons, in virtue of the law of charity of love, which makes them 
    monitors of, and reprovers to one another. This, in respect of the objects 
    of it, is twofold.</p>
<p align="justify">1. General; common to all men within or without the 
    church, whether visible members of the mystical body or not. It goes as wide 
    as the holy law carries love to our neighbor. We are not to confine our 
    charitable admonitions and reproofs to saints by profession, more than our 
    love of benevolence and beneficence to them. We owe this duty, even to these 
    of the world lying in wickedness, Ephesians 5:11. "And have no fellowship 
    with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them," compare 
    with verse 8:12. and ought to do it, if so we may contribute to the plucking 
    of the brands out of the burning.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true there are some arrived at such a daring pitch 
    of wickedness, that there is not the least hope of doing them good by 
    admonition or reproof; but, on the contrary, they are in hazard of being the 
    worse of them. Concerning such our Lord's rule is, Matthew 7:6. "Give not 
    that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, 
    lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you." But 
    we should take heed that we do not rashly put men into this class: they may 
    be the worse of a reproof at one time, who may be bettered by it at another 
    time. And besides, a testimony against sin may be necessary, even in the 
    case of such a one, in respect of others, witnesses thereto. But neither is 
    it of this sort of admonition and reproof we speak. But,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Fraternal or brotherly admonition and reproof, 
    competent to the visible members of the mystical body among themselves, 2 
    Thessalonians 3:15. Though we owe this duty and kindness to all men, yet it 
    is plain there are special obligations to it on saints by profession towards 
    one another, and especially on communicants, who sit at one table of the 
    Lord together. They are one body; they owe more than a common, namely, a 
    brotherly love to one another; therefore, as in the natural body one hand 
    washes the other by special duty: so let all communicants, and all saints by 
    profession, know that they are obliged in conscience to mutual brotherly 
    admonition and reproof, as they are "one body, and members one of another," 
    Romans 12:5. And the sacraments, whether baptism or the Lord's supper, much 
    more both, bind them thereto.</p>
<p align="justify">This ordinance and special duty of church-communion, 
    which would be of exceeding usefulness, if rightly managed, as it is, alas, 
    very little in use in our degenerate age, is often so marred, when it is 
    used, that matters are made worse thereby, and the disease takes strength 
    from the remedy. People's minds are alienated one from another; grudges are 
    raised between the parties; and so it is an occasion of evil. This arises 
    from two causes.</p>
<p align="justify">First, The indiscreet management of the reprover, who 
    often ministers his remedy in such a manner as that it is apt to irritate 
    the corruption of his brother, instead of exciting his grace or goodness, as 
    it ought. To rectify this, and remove this grand hindrance of benefit by 
    this duty, I lay before you these following things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Look upon this duty of fraternal admonition and 
    reproof, as an ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ, appointed by him, in his 
    visible mystical body, for the spiritual good of the body. It is as really 
    so, as preaching, prayer, sacraments, etc. are, Matthew 18:15. "Moreover, if 
    your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between 
    you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother." It 
    has a blessing annexed to it, Proverbs 9:8. "Rebuke a wise man, and he will 
    love you." The consideration of this might influence men to go about it with 
    awful solemnity, and to fear its being marred in their hands.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Begin at home, in your own life and conversation, to 
    purge it, Matthew 7:3, 5. "And why behold you the mote that is in your 
    brother's eye, and consider not the beam that is in your own eye? First cast 
    out the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out 
    the mote out of your brother's eye." A man who attempts to reprove his 
    brother, and is guilty in the same or the like offence, is like a profane 
    minister reproving profanity, who cannot expect success, but to have it cast 
    up to him, Physician cure yourself. And this may let one see the mischief 
    that his untenderness does, not only involving him in personal guilt, but in 
    the guilt of his neighbor's sin too, whom he puts himself out of capacity to 
    do good to.</p>
<p align="justify">Question: Is one in such a case free from this duty then? 
    Answer. No, by no means; one's own sin can never free him from this natural 
    duty. His business is to set about the work, removing the impediment of the 
    success by repentance before the Lord; and to accuse himself, and profess 
    resolution to amend, in the first place, to his brother, and then to 
    admonish him of his fault.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be not precipitant and rash in your reproofs, but 
    proceed on knowledge of the offence, in which so much moral certainty is 
    required, as one cannot be justly blamed for rashness in thinking his 
    brother to have offended so and so. The too ready crediting everything that 
    is spoken to our brother's disadvantage, or judging a thing to be an offence 
    which may be is none; a readiness to take other men's actions by the wrong 
    handle, when there is a right one, and thereupon to reprove them, will more 
    argue the want of that charity, 1 Corinthians 13:7. than prudent zeal for 
    God's honor and our brother's good; yet, in doubtful matters, it will often 
    be found duty prudently to insinuate that there is a suspicion, and what way 
    he ought to remove it, 1 Thessalonians 5:22. "Abstain from all appearance of 
    evil."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Let love to God's honor, and your brother's good, be 
    the principle from which your admonition or reproof proceeds, and let it 
    appear so, as much as may be, to his conviction, 2 Thessalonians 3:15. "Yet 
    count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother." 2 Corinthians 
    2:4. "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with 
    many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love 
    which I have more abundantly unto you." So little of this appears in the 
    reproofs of many, that they seem to the reproved rather reproaches than 
    reproofs, and to show more contempt of the offender than love to him; and so 
    the benefit by them is marred.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Be sure to found your admonitions or reproofs on the 
    Word of God, and convey them to your brother in a word of the holy 
    scripture, the proper vehicle of a medicine for the soul or conscience. 
    Colossians 3:16. "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, 
    teaching and admonishing one another." How else can you think to reach his 
    conscience? The word is the instrument with which the Spirit works, and upon 
    which we have ground to expect the blessing. And happy is he in whom the 
    word dwells richly for this end.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Let it be managed with meekness, Galatians 6:1. 
    "Restore such an one in the spirit of meekness." Zeal and meekness are very 
    consistent; they are fruits of the same holy Spirit. Beware of mixing your 
    own passions with this duty; that is to bring common fire to God's altar, 
    which mars the acceptance of the sacrifice with God, and is ready to mar the 
    success of it with your brother, Jam. 1:20. "For the wrath of man works not 
    the righteousness of God." O it is hard to hold off splitting on this rock! 
    Moses dashed on it, though the meekest man on earth, Numbers 20:10. "You 
    rebels." Which should make us jealous of ourselves upon such an occasion. 
    Happy is that man who, when he declares God's wrath, can best hold down his 
    own. In a special manner use mildness when the offence is a personal injury 
    against yourselves. Men who are like lions in their own cause, and lambs in 
    the cause of God, are selfish naughty men. They who are like lions in their 
    own cause, and in God's too, owe their pretended zeal to their own spirits, 
    not to the Spirit of God: but they who are as lambs in their own cause, but 
    as lions in God's cause, leave convictions, in the breasts of others, that 
    they are acted by God's Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Be patient and continue at the duty as occasion 
    offers, though the fruit do not soon appear, or though one and the same 
    person may give frequent occasion, 2 Peter 1:13. "Yes I think it meet, as 
    long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in 
    remembrance." Luke 17:3, 4. "If your brother trespass against you, rebuke 
    him, and if he repent, forgive him; and if he trespass against you seven 
    times a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent, 
    you shall forgive him." Thus the Lord deals with us with long-suffering: so 
    should we with our brethren. We should hold on as long as there is any hope 
    of doing good by it.</p>
<p align="justify">Question: What should we do, when all we can do appears 
    to be fruitless, and to no purpose? Answer. Our Lord's directions are very 
    plain in this case, though very little practiced, Matthew 18:15, 16, 17. 
    "Moreover, if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his 
    fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your 
    brother: but if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more; in 
    the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word shall be established: and if 
    he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to 
    hear the church, let him be unto you as an heathen man and a publican."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be sure to take the fittest season for discharge 
    of this duty. Everything is beautiful in the season thereof, and there is a 
    season for reproof, Ecclesiastes 3:7. The Spirit of the Lord takes notice of 
    Abigail's observing it with her husband, 1 Samuel 25:36, 37. And of the 
    blessed man it is said, he brings forth fruit in his season, Psalm 1:3. 
    Unseasonable reproofs rarely do good, but often do much harm.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, An undue entertainment of it by the reproved. 
    God has prescribed, in his word, how admonitions and reproofs are to be 
    taken, as well as how to be given. They are to be received,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) with love and esteem of the party that does us that 
    good office, 1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13. As we esteem the physician that would 
    cure us of bodily blemishes, so him that endeavors to cure us of spiritual 
    blemishes much more.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) With humbleness of mind, suffering ourselves to be 
    told of our faults, in order to our amendment, Hebrews 13:22. "And I beseech 
    you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation." So David, Psalm 141:5. "Let 
    the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it 
    shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) With a practical answering of the end of it. This 
    our Lord calls hearing of our brother, Matthew 18:15. Compare Proverbs 
    15:31, 32. "The ear that hears the reproof of life abides among the wise.—He 
    who hears reproof gets understanding."</p>
<p align="justify">But where are they to be found who thus entertain 
    admonitions and reproofs? Nay, the most part cannot endure to be reproved or 
    admonished of anything amiss in their way. Instead of giving a Christian 
    entertainment to admonition or reproof, their proud hearts rise in passion 
    against him that dares tell them their fault; they will defend their deed, 
    which in calm blood their own conscience condemns; and if they can gather 
    any dirt against the reprover, right or wrong, they will be sure to fling it 
    in his face on that occasion. This deserves to be lamented with tears of 
    blood, if we could command them. To such I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Admonition and reproof is an ordinance of Christ, 
    appointed by him in his church among the visible members of his body, 
    Matthew 18:15. and downwards, 1 Timothy 5:20. Why are you angry at your 
    brother for doing his duty he is obliged to do under the pain of the Lord's 
    displeasure? Why will you be reckoned members of Christ's family, and will 
    not submit to the ordinances and laws of his house? Is it fit the church of 
    Christ should be as when there was no king in Israel, every one doing that 
    which is right in his own eyes?</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is that which your brother has a special interest 
    in, and a right to see to, as being a member of the body. Nothing more 
    ordinary than, What are you concerned? The eye might as well question the 
    concern of the hand in drawing a mote out of it, or the face in wiping a 
    spot off it. "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of 
    you."—1 Corinthians 11:21. His concern is plain, he is a visible member of 
    the same body with you, and your faults which give offence, affect him and 
    the body too. In a corporation of tradesmen, every member has a right to 
    quarrel what is done against the laws of the corporation. In a neighborhood 
    of gardeners, every one has a right to quarrel what is done against the laws 
    of the neighborhood. Yet, in a society of Christians by profession, one may 
    not be allowed to reprove another for what is done against the laws of 
    Christianity. "Be astonished, O you heavens!"</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is your own interest, and the advantage of your 
    soul, to be admonished and reproved for your faults. Proverbs 
    6:23.—"Reproofs of instruction are the way of life." It is a real kindness 
    done you, Psalm 141:5. Why will you be angry with your mercy? Many are 
    ruined through the want of a faithful friend to admonish them of what is 
    amiss in their way. Men do not readily espy their own faults in full light; 
    and when they have none to say it is ill they do, they are apt to flatter 
    themselves in their iniquity to their own ruin. But admonition and reproof 
    is the way to repentance and reformation.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The trial of your state whether you are a real 
    Christian or not, depends more on the way of entertaining admonition and 
    reproof than you are aware of, Proverbs 9:8. "Reprove not a scorner, lest he 
    hate you: rebuke a wise man, and he will love you." It is a good sign of a 
    gracious soul, to entertain it in a Christian way, Proverbs 15:5.—"He who 
    regards reproof is prudent." It speaks a humble soul, one ready and willing 
    to know his faults and amend them, to whom conscience is dearer than credit, 
    and the approbation of God than the applause of men. But, on the contrary, 
    it is a very black mark in one not to be able to bear admonition and 
    reproof, Proverbs 12:1. "Whoever loves instruction, loves knowledge: but he 
    who hates reproof is brutish," and chapter 15:12. See how the Spirit of God 
    describes a wicked generation, Isaiah 29:21. "That make a man an offender 
    for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate."—Amos 5:10. 
    "They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks 
    uprightly." This temper of spirit speaks a man to be unwilling to see his 
    sin, and therefore unwilling to part with it; to be a lover of darkness 
    rather than light; a lover of his own credit more than God's honor; to be 
    proud, selfish, without due regard either to God or his brother. It is true 
    a good man may, at a time, take a just reproof very ill, as Asa, 2 
    Chronicles 16:10. but it is not the habitual disposition of his spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Not taking with admonition and reproof is a 
    forerunner of ruin, Proverbs 15:10.—"He who hates reproof shall die;" and 
    29:1. "He who being often reproved, hardens his neek, shall suddenly be 
    destroyed, and that without remedy." As it is a high pitch of sin, and runs 
    up the offence to a height, so it is a presage of the approach of a heavy 
    stroke—"Let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your people are as they 
    that strive with the priest. Therefore shall you fall in the day, and the 
    prophet shall fall with you in the night,"—Hosea 4:4, 5. They who will not 
    take an admonition or reproof from their brethren, may expect God will reach 
    them one from Heaven, that they shall not get shifted. It is a terrible 
    remark made on Eli's sons, their not taking with reproof, 1 Samuel 2:25, 
    "They hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would 
    slay them." See Proverbs 5:12. The sum of what is said, you may find, 
    Proverbs 25:12. "As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold: so is 
    a wise reprover upon an obedient ear." Let the reprover manage wisely, and 
    the reproved entertain it obediently, so shall it be profitable to both. The 
    impediments thus removed, I would press this duty of brotherly admonition 
    and reproof among all the visible members of the mystical body, all saints 
    by profession, and communicants particularly. Admonish and reprove one 
    another, for what you discern to be offensive in one another's way. Make 
    conscience of this duty.</p>
<p align="justify">Mot. 1. For the sake of the head, that is, for Christ's 
    sake. The sins of professors and communicants do, in a special manner, 
    reflect dishonor on Jesus Christ, 2 Samuel 12:14. And therefore, while we 
    see the visible members of that body dishonoring their head, our hearts 
    should stir within us for that dishonor. Here is a fair occasion to vent our 
    zeal for Christ, to declare our sympathy with him, Psalm 69:9, "The 
    reproaches of them that reproached you are fallen upon me." And, in such a 
    case, you are upon your trials as to what regard you have to his honor.</p>
<p align="justify">2. For the sake of the body. The welfare of the mystical 
    body lies in the welfare of the members: it cannot be right while the 
    members are wrong. Consider the offending party as a member of the body, and 
    you will see the body of Christ is concerned in his not walking with a 
    straight foot, which may stir you up to admonish him. Scandalous practices 
    or offensive steps in a member, reflect dishonor on the whole body, 
    Ecclesiastes 9:18. Yes, and the contagion, if not timely prevented, is apt 
    to creep from one member to another, and so to annoy the whole body, Hebrews 
    12:15, "Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby 
    many be defiled." For this cause Paul openly reproved Peter, Galatians 2:14.</p>
<p align="justify">3. For the sake of the offending member. It is one of the 
    greatest offices of love you can do to his soul, to admonish him of his 
    offence, James 5:19, 20. "Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and 
    one convert him, let him know that he which converts the sinner from the 
    error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude 
    of sins." You will thereby do him a double kindness.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Remove sin from off him, which is a load so much the 
    more dangerous, as he is not aware of it, Leviticus 19:17. It is hating him, 
    in God's account, not to rebuke him, as it would be not to draw him out of 
    the mire, when he is sticking in it. If he had disjointed a leg or arm, 
    would you not set it again if you could? Such harm do wrong steps in a 
    Christian's way to his soul; therefore, "If a man be overtaken in a fault, 
    you which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness," 
    Galatians 6:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Prevent his sinning more in that way. One wrong 
    step, if not righted, makes way for another; and much guilt is contracted by 
    one's not being told of his fault, being in that case, "like a son left to 
    himself, who brings his father to shame;" whereas a faithful reproof might 
    prevent the repeating of the same folly. And as it would thus be a kindness 
    to him in respect of the putting away of sin, so consequently in preventing 
    strokes from the hand of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">4. For your own sake. God has laid this duty upon you, 
    under the pain of his displeasure; so your own interest is engaged here. As 
    you would not partake of other men's sins, make conscience of this duty, 
    without which the guilt will creep over on your own souls, and the 
    punishment thereof with it, Ephesians 5:11. And why should one by the 
    neglect of this duty, adopt other men's sins, defile his own conscience, and 
    mar his peace with God? Better displease all the world than make a breach 
    between God and your own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">5. For the sake of the common badge of the visible 
    mystical body of the Christian profession, the holy sacraments, 1 Timothy 
    6:1. Is it not cutting to hear men say, Take up your professors, your 
    communicants? O that professors would consider the Christian profession to 
    be of that dignity, and so tender a point, that they might tremble to think 
    of bringing a stain upon it by their loose walking! O that communicants 
    would remember, that though the partaking of the Lord's table is in itself a 
    passing action, yet it is an abiding holy sign, whereby they are externally 
    distinguished for Christ; and that they would beware of such practices as 
    may render their badge mean and despised in the eyes of the world. Or if 
    some will be so untender as not duly to regard it, that others would be so 
    tender thereof as to check them for their offensive carriage, out of a 
    regard to the holy badge of the Christian profession, the holy sacraments.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, For the sake of those who are not of the body, 
    but of the world lying in wickedness. It is a piece of Christian duty to 
    regard these, Colossians 4:5. "Walk in wisdom toward them that are without." 
    God writes his impartiality in his judgments, in not passing by the offences 
    of those called by his own name, Isaiah 42:4. And it would much contribute 
    to commend religion to those who are strangers to it, and impress them with 
    honorable thoughts of the communion of saints, if the members of it were 
    faithful to check everything among themselves, Acts 5:1. and downwards, 
    compare with verse 13. otherwise snares and stumbling-blocks are laid before 
    the blind world.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Walk holily and tenderly, so as your conversation may 
    be exemplary and edifying to one another, Matthew 5:16. Hebrews 12:14. 
    Romans 14:19. The church, in scripture-language, is often called Heaven, and 
    every member thereof ought to be as a shining light there, and not the 
    pastors only, Philippians 2:15, 16. "That you may be blameless and harmless, 
    the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse 
    nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world: holding forth the word 
    of life." This is the most effectual way of edifying one another, namely, by 
    a holy example. And it is one great advantage of church-communion, whereby 
    one's soul is edified, while the members labor so to walk. For understanding 
    of this, two things are to be marked.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, There is a holiness of heart, and a holiness of 
    conversation, Psalm 24:3, 4. The former is the spring of the latter; the 
    former lies in the inner man, the latter in the outward. Holiness of heart 
    is a personal duty, which not the church, but God and one's own conscience 
    can take notice of directly: therefore I speak not of it, while treating of 
    the duties of the members of the body one to another. Holiness of 
    conversation is a relative duty, in so far as our fellow-members ought to 
    see it in us all, and may see it where it is to their own edification: and 
    we owe it as an indispensable duty to the body whereof we are members, 
    namely, that our conversation be exemplarily holy and tender, Canticles 1:8. 
    For we are not only to know Christ, and speak of him, but to live unto him, 
    Philippians 1:21. "For me to live is Christ." This is the holiness and 
    tenderness I speak of.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Though it is abominable hypocrisy to do good works 
    to be seen of men, that we may gain their applause; yet it is not only 
    lawful, but a necessary duty of Christianity, and particularly of 
    church-communion, to walk so as your walk may be exemplary, and to have an 
    eye to the edification of others in walking tenderly before them, Matthew 
    5:16. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good 
    works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven." 2 Thessalonians 3:9. 
    Though our internal religion lies only between God and us, yet our outward 
    acts are apt to be copied by our brethren; therefore we should endeavor to 
    get the copy fair, chiefly to please God, and next to edify our brethren.</p>
<p align="justify">Now this exemplary, tender, holy walking, required of 
    every visible church-member, for edifying the fellow-members of the body, 
    has many branches, being as broad as the whole law of God on the outward 
    man. I shall reduce them to these two general heads.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be exemplarily holy and tender, with respect to the 
    doing part of religion and a holy life, Luke 1:6. The members of Christ are 
    not to be idle, but active, dying to sin, and living unto righteousness. Be 
    exemplarily holy and tender,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) With respect to duty, Ecclesiastes 9:10. "Whatever 
    your hand finds to do, do it with your might." Let your conversation be 
    filled up with the performance and conscientious discharge of every duty 
    required at your hands, that it may be uniform, "Then shall I not be 
    ashamed, when I have respect unto all your commandments," Psalm 119:6. Let 
    your duty to God be conscientiously performed in all the parts of it; since 
    he is your Creator and Redeemer, refuse him no piece of required service, 
    for you are wholly his, Acts 27:23. Be conscientious in your duty to man for 
    God's sake, and so join in your practice what God has joined in the 
    commandment, Acts 24:16. Neglect not personal duty which lies between you, 
    Titus 2:12. and have a special regard to the duties of your station, and the 
    relation wherein you stand, if ever you would have your conversation 
    edifying. God has set every one of us in some station and relation, and the 
    conscientious practice of the duty of our respective stations makes a man or 
    woman shine, however low a sphere they move in, 1 Timothy 6:1. "Let as many 
    servants as are under the yoke, count their own masters worthy of all honor, 
    that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed," 1 Peter 3:1, 2. 
    There is no person who may not this way edify the body of Christ, and be an 
    useful member for their own and others' good.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) With respect to sin, Jude 23. O the mischief done by 
    the sinful liberty church-members take to themselves! They fearlessly break 
    down and go over the holy hedge, and others, seeing them before, do follow 
    after, and so they prove ruining to themselves and others too, Matthew 18:7. 
    Think no sin little, since it is an offence against a great God, and makes 
    way for greater, not only in yourselves, but in others too. For the sake of 
    the head, and the rest of the members, abhor it as Hell, Romans 12:9. and 1 
    Thessalonians 5:22.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In the practice and use of indifferent things. There 
    the apostle's rule should take place, Romans 15:1, 2. "We then that are 
    strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please 
    ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to 
    edification." It is not enough that the thing is in itself lawful; you are 
    also, in respect of your brother, to consider if it be expedient, 1 
    Corinthians 6:12. What is in itself indifferent, may in its circumstances be 
    rendered unlawful to you, in so far as you cannot do it without the scandal 
    of your brother, Romans 14:20. The neglect of this is one of the crying sins 
    of this day. Men consider their own selves, without regard to others, and 
    hence fearlessly lay stumbling-blocks before others. The sense of the duties 
    of church-communion is much lost among all parties in this church this day: 
    in the natural body a thing will be refused, though it be good for the 
    stomach, if it be ill for the head, etc. But, in this degenerate generation, 
    the members of the visible mystical body are grown so selfish, that to 
    please themselves they can drive over others, without any regard to their 
    good or hurt.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Be exemplarily holy and tender in the suffering part 
    of religion. And be so for the edification of the body. Others have been so 
    for our good, Hebrews 12:1. so should we be for the good of others. What 
    crosses and afflictions the Lord may be pleased to lay on you, bear 
    Christianly, with patience, submission, and resignation, bringing forth the 
    fruit of them, Romans 12:12. "Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; 
    continuing instant in prayer." They are trials, and in them we ought to 
    carry so, as God may be honored and our brethren edified, while we are by 
    divine providence brought upon the stage to undergo our respective trials. 
    Consider here,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) God, in laying afflictions on some of his people, 
    has an eye to others' good, as well as that of the afflicted party: even as 
    blood is let out of the arm or foot, not for the good of the arm or foot 
    only, but the good of the whole body; though it is only one member that gets 
    the wound, yet the design is for the rest of the members too, 2 Corinthians 
    1:6. "And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, 
    which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also 
    suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and 
    salvation." As when one is examined the rest are instructed; when one of the 
    children of a family is chastised, the rest are thereby bettered; so our 
    gracious God often teaches many at the expense of one only.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A Christian behavior under trouble is one of the 
    most influential points of Christian practice, likely to have the greatest 
    efficacy on others, spectators of it and witnesses to it, or to whose 
    knowledge it may come, Hebrews 12:1, 2, 3. Hence the blood of the martyrs 
    was said to be the seed of the church: and the cause of the gospel never 
    lost by persecution, while the persecuted were honestly carried through. 
    Doing well is ready to influence others, but suffering well is far more so. 
    A cross carried evenly and Christianly has a certain force to draw others to 
    imitation, as it is most admired.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Those who, by reason of their afflictions, seem to 
    themselves to be laid by as useless, are mistaken; they have a most precious 
    opportunity put into their hand, to be serviceable to Christ and the members 
    of his body, Colossians 1:24. "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and 
    fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for 
    his body's sake." God has brought them forth on the stage, to take trial of 
    their suffering graces, for the instructing, exciting, strengthening, and 
    edifying of others. Job was a man who did much for God in his day; but the 
    suffering part of his life has been of the greatest use in all ages since, 
    and will be to the end. The Psalmist David complains, Psalm 31:12. that he 
    was like a broken vessel; but every shred of that broken pot has been of 
    good use to the church of Christ since, and has helped to heal many.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Wherefore Christians under their afflictions ought 
    to consider that they suffer as members of the body, bearing that part 
    allotted for them of the sufferings appointed for mystical Christ; for the 
    sufferings of Christ personal are at an end, but the sufferings of Christ 
    mystical are but yet a filling up, Colossians 1:24. This would arm them with 
    patience, as considering their particular trials to be, in some sort, a 
    common cause for the good of others, as well as their own; and may excite 
    them, in the blackest lines of providence, to cast such a fair copy as 
    others may write after.</p>
<p align="justify">To press this duty of church-communion, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The interest of God's name and honor in it, John 15:8. 
    "Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my 
    disciples." The fruitfulness of those who are planted in the house of the 
    Lord brings much glory to the Master of the house; and their barrenness 
    brings much dishonor to him before the world. And should not the one be 
    vigorously pursued, and the other guarded against, by all those whom he has 
    "called into the fellowship of his Son?"</p>
<p align="justify">2. The interest of your fellow-members in it. It is a 
    dark world; they are the most useful in the communion of saints, who most 
    shine as lights. Every action of yours, every piece of your carriage, being 
    in church communion, is apt to be copied. By your tender example you may do 
    good to many; by your untenderness you may prove stumbling-blocks to others.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The interest of the gospel in it, Titus 2:9, 10. 
    "Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters—not purloining, but 
    showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our 
    Savior in all things." It is the glory of the gospel, that the power thereof 
    appears in the lives of the professors thereof, stamping holiness and 
    tenderness upon every part of their own walk: and, on the other hand, it 
    brings great scandal on the doctrine of Christ, that the professors of it 
    are unholy in their lives.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Your own interest is in it for time and eternity. 
    As you sow you shall reap, both for kind and quantity.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Bear one another's burdens of afflictions, crosses, 
    temptations and trials, Galatians 6:2. "Bear you one another's burdens, and 
    so fulfill the law of Christ." Hebrews 13:3. "Remember them that are in 
    bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being 
    yourselves also in the body." 1 Corinthians 12:26. "And whether one member 
    suffer, all the members suffer with it." This is a natural duty of the 
    members of one body. That part of the communion of saints, which is above, 
    is got quite beyond these; but those of them who are yet in the world, are 
    in the place of trial, where the clouds return after the rain. But not being 
    standing each one by himself, but in the body with other fellow-members, 
    bearing their part of the sufferings allotted for the body, there is all 
    reason that the afflicted's lot should be looked on as a common cause, and 
    each one should help to bear the burden with them; their burden of simple 
    affliction, or burden of temptation. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Have a cordial sympathy with them, and hearty concern 
    in their afflictions and temptations; and so express it as they may know it, 
    Romans 12:15. Let your hearts be touched with fellow-feeling of the 
    distresses of your brethren; and therefore "put on affections of mercy," 
    etc. Colossians 3:12. and lay aside selfishness and un-concernedness with 
    the case of others. It is a mortified member that is not touched with the 
    pain of other members of the body; and he who has no kindly sympathy with 
    the saints, in their troubles and temptations, seems not to partake of the 
    spirit of that communion, Amos 6:1, 6. "Woe to them that are at ease in 
    Zion—that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief 
    ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph." And let 
    them know it: for what comfort can it afford to them, though your affections 
    yearn toward them, if they understand it not? if they see it not, it is all 
    a case to them as if it were not.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Bear their burden as it affects them, and not always 
    as it would affect yourselves, Romans 15:1. Many weigh the afflictions and 
    temptations of others in their own balance, so find them very light; and 
    therefore pass them as unworthy of their concern. Job 12:5. "He who is ready 
    to slip with his feet, is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is 
    at ease." But the true way of judging of the weight of these things is, as 
    they are apt to affect the afflicted party, and with that weight we should 
    bear them, 2 Corinthians 11:29. "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is 
    offended, and I burn not?" One mote will disturb the eye, when a hundred of 
    them lying on the hand will create no trouble, no hazard. Shall the hand 
    then be unconcerned to pluck it out? That may make a heavy affliction and 
    dangerous temptation to one, which would be a very light one, and perhaps 
    none at all to another. And it may be a greater act of Christian obedience 
    in one to make his way through a temptation or affliction in itself small, 
    than in another through one ten times greater; as the widow's throwing in 
    her mite was more than all the gifts of the rich men, Luke 21:1, 2, 3.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Let your mouths be open to inquire into their griefs, 
    as far as Christian prudence will allow, and your hearts open to receive 
    their moans, Colossians 4:7, 8. "All my state shall Tychicus declare unto 
    you—whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your 
    estate, and comfort your hearts." If any member of the natural body be sore 
    and wounded, how natural is it for the hand tenderly to uncover and open it 
    up, the eye to pry with compassion on the several parts of the sore, etc. 
    even when they cannot remove the trouble? Such is the case of human nature 
    in its present state of weakness, that there is a kind of relief, though but 
    a sorry one, in venting of their grief into the bosom of one where it may be 
    entertained with sympathy. The want of which makes afflictions and 
    temptations often like a fire shut up, preying on one's spirits, Psalm 39:3. 
    and has made the best of men complain heavily, Micah 7:1, 5. and downwards.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Comfort, encourage, advise, and direct them suitable 
    to their case, 1 Thessalonians 4:18. This is all that is within the compass 
    of one's power to do for their afflicted brethren, in some cases, Matthew 
    25:36. And thus may one by a word fitly spoken, be a happy instrument to 
    refresh the affections of the afflicted, and blunt the edge of a temptation, 
    2 Timothy 1:16. Job 16:5.—"I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the 
    moving of my lips should assuage your grief." And here a special tenderness 
    is required; and, with a due regard to the circumstances of the afflicted, 
    all harshness is to be evited, lest one add affliction to the afflicted; 
    which was the rock Job's friends split upon, and caused him to make that 
    affecting resentment, Job 16:4, 5.</p>
<p align="justify">5. What you can in conscience and reason ward off, or 
    carry off of their burden, do it, for you are members one of another; Romans 
    12:5. Philip. 2:4. "Look not every one on his own things, but every man also 
    on the things of others." So you are to give all your spiritual or temporal 
    assistances to the lessening or removing of their trial in a way of duty. 
    This should particularly appear in shielding one another's reputation, which 
    is often blasted by venomous tongues and open ears, which together lay a 
    heavy burden on the suffering party, Proverbs 25:23.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In troubles and temptations from men, support and 
    stand by the oppressed for their deliverance, especially in the cause of 
    Christ and religion, 2 Timothy 4:16. "At my first answer no man stood with 
    me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their 
    charge." And chapter 1:16, 17. "The Lord give mercy unto the house of 
    Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 
    but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me." 
    We are not born for ourselves, but for God's honor, and the good of our 
    brethren. And the leaving of those helpless, on whom, by the divine 
    providence, the storm of the trial or temptation falls, is a forsaking and 
    being ashamed of the cause of Christ in the world. Thus ought we to bear one 
    another's burden, as members of the body of Christ. To stir you up to which 
    necessary duty, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Earnest prayer is to be made to God for our 
    brethren under their trials, that they may be supported, refreshed, and 
    delivered, according to the will of God; and this whether their trials be 
    from the immediate hand of God or man, Acts 12:5. "Peter therefore was kept 
    in prison; but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for 
    him." 2 Thessalonians 3:1, 2. "Finally, brethren, pray for us—that we may be 
    delivered from unreasonable and wicked men."—This is a special way of 
    bearing one another's burdens, to bear them before the throne of grace, and 
    to wrestle with God for them there. This is one of the great advantages of 
    the communion of saints, namely, a communion of prayers, that when any known 
    weight lies upon a member, the rest cry unto the head on behalf of it. And 
    here I offer four things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is much to be wished that Christians praying 
    together, when occasionally meeting, were more in use. And particularly that 
    those who are in distress would not only require ministers or elders to pray 
    with them, but even fellow-Christians visiting them, and that such should 
    readily comply with such a desire, both observing circumstances so as to 
    discern when and in what cases it may be to edification. It is very 
    agreeable to the communion of saints, and to that love and sympathy which 
    ought to be among the members of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As it is a commendable practice in the church, to 
    require public prayers on behalf of the sick or those otherwise afflicted; 
    and as the minister is the mouth of the congregation, so you would consider 
    that you ought affectionately to join in these prayers, as parties nearly 
    concerned, and whose prayers for the afflicted are desired, forasmuch as the 
    prayers desired are the prayers of the congregation, and not the minister's 
    only. The language of these prayers is, Brethren, pray for us. And 
    therefore, I beseech you, let not this be a matter of mere form to you, in 
    which you may only notice what is begged for them; but let your hearts go 
    along with the words even the length of the throne, for a brother or sister 
    in distress.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Carry home with you the case of those to your family 
    and secret prayers, and confine not your concern for them within the walls 
    of the church. If the afflictions of others do touch your hearts as they 
    ought, you may carry a copy of the paper home with you on your sympathizing 
    hearts, to mind you to put up petitions for them in your families and in 
    secret. If you have neglected this formerly, mend it in time to come, and, 
    when you have done it, know you have done no more than what is your duty, 
    Hebrews 13:3. "Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them 
    which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Some cases of others in affliction may require of 
    you extraordinary prayer, by setting some time apart for that very end, 
    either yourselves alone, or in conjunction with fellow-Christians. So David 
    in the case of the child, "fasted, and went in and lay all night on the 
    earth," 2 Samuel 12:16. And in the case of others too, Psalm 35:13, 14. And 
    so in the case of Peter in prison, Acts 12:12. "Many were gathered together 
    in the house of Mary, praying." The serious consideration of the kind of the 
    affliction, and of the person under it, with respect to the honor of God, 
    the good of the church, and your own particular interest depending thereon, 
    must determine these cases.</p>
<p align="justify">I will add, by the bye, that where prayers are desired 
    for those in affliction, the affliction being removed, thanksgiving should 
    likewise be desired. It is but the prevalence of an unallowable custom, to 
    give up notes for praying for the sick, and yet to give none for 
    thanksgiving for the recovery of the party when recovered. If the 
    congregation weep with them, it is reasonable they have occasion to rejoice 
    with them too; if to petition for the mercy, to give thanks for it too, Luke 
    17:17, 18.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. Consider it is the special command of your 
    head, Galatians 6:2. it is a "fulfilling of the law of Christ," namely, the 
    law of love. Our Lord Jesus loved his people so as to die for them, 
    therefore he requires them particularly to love one another. His compassion 
    to them was without a parallel, therefore he will have them full of 
    affections towards each other; he bare the burdens of the whole, the burden 
    of guilt, and curse due to them for sin, therefore he will have them bear 
    one another's burden. Here is the special reason why it is called the law of 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You have the example of the head for it, John 13:15. 
    "For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you." 
    He is touched with all their afflictions, Isaiah 63:9. If any annoy them, he 
    reckons himself persecuted, Acts 9:4. A most tender sympathy he has with 
    them—"for he who touches you, toncheth the apple of his eye," Zechariah 2:8. 
    And as for their temptations, he is not unconcerned about them, Hebrews 
    4:15. Imitate your head, O members of the body: sympathize with them whom 
    Christ sympathizes with, lest you pour contempt on those whom Christ honors, 
    and forget the afflictions of those whom he tenderly remembers.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The trials and distresses of others are designed for 
    your good, as was said before. Our merciful Father, in compassion to the 
    rest, teaches them at the expense of one. Does it not then require your 
    sympathy, that others are afflicted for your sake? Colossians 1:24. Should 
    not you answer the design of providence, in exercising of those duties and 
    graces which providence lays afflictions and temptations on others to bring 
    forth into exercise on you? He lays the rod on your fellow-members, to bring 
    you and many others to the throne of grace.</p>
<p align="justify">4. What is your brother's case today, may be your 
    tomorrow. Is he under affliction now? You may be in the same hereafter, or 
    in another as hard for you to bear, as it is for him now to bear his. Is he 
    under temptation? As fast as you seems to stand now, you may be as low under 
    the same or a worse, tomorrow, as he is today, Galatians 6:1. 1 Corinthians 
    10:12. Refuse him not that help of you, which you may need of him before 
    long. There is no trouble, no temptation, which befalls one member of the 
    body, which another can certainly secure himself from.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is necessary to evidence your being of the 
    body, 1 Corinthians 12:26. Colossians 3:12. How can it be accounted a live 
    member, that has not sympathy with the rest in pain? but that Christian 
    sympathy of bearing one another's burden speaks union with the members of 
    the head. That hardness, selfishness, and carelessness about the trials and 
    temptations of others, which is found in many, cannot but darken the 
    evidences of good people so far as it prevails, and cast them as naught in 
    whom it reigns.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Edify one another by Christian conference, Ephesians 
    4:29. "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that 
    which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the 
    hearers." 1 Thessalonians 5:11. "Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and 
    edify one another." In so far as the body is made up of several Christians, 
    they ought to have suitable conference, for the edification of one another 
    as members, as they are brought together by divine providence. It is the 
    duty of joint members of any lawful society, to treat among themselves of 
    the interests of it and its concerns. Fellow-travelers to one place are to 
    be useful this way to one another. Christians are a society by themselves, 
    the communion of saints, they are fellow-travelers towards Zion: Christian 
    conference is the native result of the relation. I shall branch out this in 
    these things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those who by providence are cast together ordinarily, 
    whether in a family or neighborhood, so as they must ordinarily converse 
    together, should labor to be useful to, and edify one another by their 
    communication, Hebrews 3:13. "But exhort one another daily while it is 
    called, Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of 
    sin." Religion should be carried by us into all our relations, and however 
    we be posted in particular societies, we should always remember our general 
    calling and relation, as visible members of the mystical body, that we 
    converse together as becomes saints.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Occasional meetings of Christians together should be 
    thus improved. There is a commandment "to speak of those things while men 
    walk by the way together," Deuteronomy 6:7. We find the two disciples going 
    to Emmaus thus exercised, and a happy issue of their conference, Luke 24:14, 
    15. Were men's spirits habitually heavenly, even occasional encounters would 
    produce something of this sort between fellow-Christians.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Christians meeting together on holy and spiritual 
    sacred occasions should, in a special manner, be thus improved, as on 
    Sabbathdays, and at sermons. Then it is the day calls for it, and the Lord's 
    word and ordinances minister matter of Christian conference. Days have been, 
    when people going to or coming from ordinances, have been sweetly employed 
    this way, Psalm 55:14. and between sermons, either went alone for prayer and 
    meditation, or gathered together for Christian conference. But, alas! this 
    is much decayed, and among none more perhaps than among as. I often see 
    people standing busy speaking together, after the public worship is begun, 
    and with my eye or voice, must labor to break off the conference, the which 
    if it were not worldly, would surely be broken off by the beginning of the 
    public worship. The worldly discourse in our churchyard has been, and is an 
    offence and stumbling-block to strangers, and is like to turn to the 
    reproach of the place, whereby God is highly dishonored. This is a horrid 
    profanation of the Lord's day, an open contempt of it and his ordinances, 
    which speaks the gospel sapless and tasteless to you, and is a presage of a 
    stroke, Nehemiah 13:18. Alas! how think you one should preach to people 
    making such preparation for hearing? How shall you profit by preaching after 
    such communications? Isaiah 58:13, 14. How shall we pray for God's blessing 
    on your labors and substance, or look to be heard, when you sacrilegiously 
    rob God of his own day at this rate? I beseech you, for the Lord's sake, and 
    your own souls' sake, and as you would not provoke the Lord to leave me as 
    an idol-shepherd among you, who shall have no power to profit your souls, 
    reform this practice, and either go by yourselves for prayer and meditation, 
    or converse like Christians.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Fellow-Christians should communicate their cases one 
    to another, as far as Christian prudence will allow, and strengthen, 
    instruct, and edify one another, Psalm 66:16. The wise man observes, that 
    "two are better than one; for if the one fall, the other will lift him up," 
    Ecclesiastes 4:10. And happy are they who thus have a friend in need. How 
    many might have instruction in what they know not, the edge of temptations 
    blunted, their hearts warmed, and their souls bettered, by a mutual 
    communication of cases, troubles, temptations, and experiences?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Appointed private meetings of several Christians 
    together, for prayer and Christian conference for their mutual edification, 
    provided it mar not family-worship, nor be improved to the prejudice of 
    public ordinances, as they are warranted by the Word of God, so might be of 
    good use (if rightly improved) to the advancement of religion, Acts 12:12. 
    Malachi 3:16. Colossians 3:16. By this means Christians might improve both 
    in gifts and grace, in knowledge and love, and they have been blessed of God 
    to these holy ends unto many: and ordinarily, in parishes where the gospel 
    begins to thrive, they are set up almost as naturally as the birds draw 
    together in the spring: and, where the gospel work is going back, they 
    decay, owing their fall, either to coldness in God's matters creeping 
    in, or to the fiery heat of division.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. The necessity and usefulness of it is great. It 
    is necessary and useful for the honor of God, 1 Peter 2:9. for the good of 
    our brethren, Romans 14:19. and for our own good, Proverbs 11:25. The tongue 
    is called our glory, because it is the instrument of glorifying God, and so 
    doing good to others: and, without this, men are chargeable with laying up 
    their talents in a napkin, hiding their light under a bushel.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The thriving or decay of religion goes hand in hand 
    with it. Look to the times wherein religion prospered, and you will find 
    that "they who feared the Lord spoke often one to another;" and as that wore 
    away, so religion decayed. Nearest the heart nearest the mouth. Where the 
    fire is burning on the hearth, the smoke is going forth of the chimney. 
    Where religion is lively in the heart, it will appear in men's converse.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Times of abounding sin and approaching wrath is a 
    special season for it, and calls the fearers of God to set about it, Malachi 
    3:16. Such is the day in which we live, "wherein iniquity abounds, and the 
    love of many waxes cold." God is removing the pillars, and his judgments are 
    abroad in the world, and lesser strokes are sent as forerunners of greater.</p>
<p align="justify">7. and lastly, Be ready to assist the needy members, and 
    to communicate of your worldly goods to the poor in the body. 1 John 3:17, 
    18. "But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and 
    shuts up his affections of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God 
    in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but 
    in deed and in truth." Romans 12:13. "Distributing to the necessity of 
    saints, given to hospitality." It is much to be regretted, that many of the 
    poor, especially the vagrant ones, have no semblance of piety or membership 
    in the body of Christ. Yet even these have a right to supply from us, 
    because they are God's creatures. But the poor saints have a double right to 
    it, not only as God's creatures, but as members of Christ, and therefore the 
    church is bound particularly to see to them, Galatians 6:10. "As we have 
    therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who 
    are of the household of faith." The Lord in his wisdom has seen it meet to 
    make some of his members poor in the world, not only for their own trial, 
    but the trial of their brethren, who are obliged to supply them, Deuteronomy 
    15:11. "For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command 
    you, saying, You shall open your hand wide unto your brother, to your poor, 
    and to your needy in the land," Matthew 26:11. This duty I branch out in 
    five particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Seasonably act towards the relief of those members who 
    are fallen into decay in the world, as you have opportunity, Leviticus 
    25:35. "And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you, 
    then you shall relieve him, yes, though he be a stranger or a sojourner, 
    that he may live with you." As the keeping of a man that is stumbling from 
    quite falling down, is much alike with helping him up when he is fallen; so 
    the relieving of a man at the brink of poverty, is much alike with relieving 
    him in it. This duty I take to be aimed at, Luke 6:35. "But love you your 
    enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again." And if it were 
    more exercised, there would be fewer poor than there are.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Abound in private distributions towards the poor 
    members, at your houses, or otherwise, as you have occasion, Matthew 6:3. 
    Hebrews 13:16. "But, to do good, and to communicate, forget not, for with 
    such sacrifices God is well pleased." Occasions of this nature are ordinary, 
    which try what sort of stewards we are of the good things of this life which 
    providence has put into our hand. It was Job's comfort in his poverty, that 
    when he was wealthy, he communicated of what he had to the poor, Job 31:19. 
    and downward.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Conscientiously give in to the Sabbath's collections, 
    to be distributed by the church. God has appointed these, and the Lord Jesus 
    has appointed church-officers for taking care of the poor in the church, 
    Acts 6:1, 3. And what they are to give out is to come into their hand by the 
    church-collections, 1 Corinthians 16:2. "Upon the first day of the week, let 
    every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there 
    be no gatherings when I come." So this matter of the Sabbath-day's 
    collections is not to be looked upon as a business of mere fashion, but as a 
    divine ordinance in the church, which should make people, out of conscience 
    towards God, to give into it, in a suitable proportion to the substance God 
    has put in their hands.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Grudge not extraordinary distributions, towards the 
    relief not only of those of other congregations, but of other churches, whom 
    you never saw, nor will perhaps see in the face, Romans 15:26. "For it has 
    pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia, to make a certain contribution for the 
    saints which are at Jerusalem." This is a duty of the communion of saints; 
    for all the churches and congregations of saints in the world make but one 
    body of Christ, and they who are at the greatest distance from you are your 
    brethren. Why should any then think themselves unconcerned with their 
    distress?"</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be ready to give of your substance for pious 
    uses, towards the advancing of the good of the body, which is the church, 
    Proverbs 3:9. There are several occasions people have of laying out money 
    for pious uses, which want of due consideration makes them to do grudgingly. 
    But if you have an occasion put into your hand, by this money to honor God, 
    to bring about good for the souls of others, to contribute to the good of 
    the church, you are to look on it as a special duty of the communion of 
    saints, and an occasion of bestowing it to a noble use.</p>
<p align="justify">As to what one is to give, every one must conscientiously 
    determine that for himself: but here is the general rule, namely, that 
    people are to give in a proportion to the necessity of their brethren, and 
    their own ability, Romans 12:13. 1 Corinthians 16:2. One is to eye,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The necessity of their brethren: for that may be too 
    little for some, which may be more than enough to others whose straits are 
    not so great. And withal, in weighing this their necessity, it is to be 
    noticed, if the poor walk suitable to their condition; for neither religion 
    nor reason requires us to foster them in voluntary idleness, or in living 
    beyond the bounds of their condition, 2 Thessalonians 3:10, 11.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Their own ability. What one gives must be his own, and 
    not another's, for God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those to whom God 
    has given much, of them much is required; those who have little, the less is 
    required. Our own strait condition does not altogether excuse from it. The 
    widow's two mites were required and accepted; yes, people are bound to labor 
    for that they may have what to give to the poor, Ephesians 4:28. "Let him 
    that stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands 
    the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs." And 
    whatever is in their power to do for them, they are obliged to do, Acts 3:6.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. Consider our Lord Christ looks on what is given 
    to his poor members as given to himself, and will make honorable mention of 
    it at the great day, Matthew 25:35, 36. "For I was an hungered, and you gave 
    me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you 
    took me in: naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was 
    in prison, and you came unto me." Christ is in them, his image upon them, 
    they and he are one, and shall not their fellow-members regard them as such, 
    in supplying of their necessities? We are to part with our all to him at his 
    call. Sometimes he requires it by persecutors, and then we are to give it up 
    at his call for his sake: sometimes by his needy members; and then also it 
    is given to him, Lent to the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We are not absolute masters of our substance, but 
    stewards of it, accountable to the Lord for our management. The church is 
    God's household, and Christ has secured, by the covenant, necessities for 
    this life to all that are his, Isaiah 33:16.—"Bread shall be given him, his 
    water shall be sure." Only he has put the portion of the poor members in the 
    hands of others, to give it out to them, according to their necessity, and 
    what of it is in their hand, Luke 16:10, 11, 12. Therefore we shall be 
    unfaithful stewards, if we distribute not to the necessities of the saints.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are fellow-members of the same body with you, and 
    fellow-heirs of the same inheritance, Galatians 6:10. "As we have therefore 
    opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of 
    the household of faith." The spiritual relation that is between us and them 
    challenges it as a debt of love. Have we not all one Father, one elder 
    Brother, one Spirit knitting us to one Head, and one heritage forever, to 
    which men are admitted without respect of persons? Suppose several men were 
    traveling together into a far country to receive a common inheritance, would 
    not those who have abundance of spending money supply those who are run 
    short in the way? So should we do with the poor saints.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It tends much to the honor of God, and the credit of 
    the gospel and of the church. Every society looks on themselves as obliged 
    to see to the supply of the wants of their members: and should not the 
    communion of saints be exemplary therein, considering the most strait ties 
    among them? By our Lord's own verdict, "Giving is a more blessed thing than 
    receiving," Acts 20:35. therein we do in a special manner appear in likeness 
    to the Lord, Luke 6:35, 36. And O should we not honor with our substance 
    him, who, for our sakes, became poor, that we might be rich?" 2 Corinthians 
    8:9.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It has a reward of grace annexed to it, being 
    rightly performed. It is the best way to secure a throughbearing for us and 
    ours, Proverbs 28:27. "He who gives to the poor shall not have lack." What 
    we have is liable to many accidents; but laying out for God is better 
    security than laying up what God calls for at our hand, Ecclesiastes 11:1. 
    "Cast your bread upon the waters: for you shall find it after many days." 
    What is thus laid out brings in to the giver, Proverbs 3:9, 10. "Honor the 
    Lord with your substance, and with the first-fruits of all your increase; so 
    shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out 
    with new wine." Solomon observes the accomplishment of it, Proverbs 11:24. 
    "There is that scatters and yet increases." And though our good works do not 
    merit either the temporal or eternal reward of glory; yet even the eternal 
    reward will be according to our works, and that is an eternal truth, 2 
    Corinthians 9:6. "But this I say, He which sows sparingly, shall reap also 
    sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully."</p>
<p align="justify">V. Admission to the Lord's table is a matter of the 
    greatest weight and concern, to be managed and gone about with all solemn 
    seriousness and caution. Whoever considers that, being one bread, we declare 
    ourselves thereby one body of Christ, must needs see this, and that there is 
    great need to take heed to our feet in entering on that holy ground. And 
    considering that the church is a communion of saints in profession, whereof 
    Christ is the head, there is need to look well who be admitted thereto as 
    complete members of the visible body. And here it is evident,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That there ought not to be a promiscuous admission to 
    the Lord's table, which some have contended for. It is not only contrary to 
    our Lord's express command, Matthew 7:6. "Give not that which is holy unto 
    the dogs," but contrary to the nature, use and ends of that ordinance. It is 
    a distinguishing sign, to put a visible difference between the communion of 
    saints and communion of sinners; and therefore cannot be common to both. 
    Shall the badge of the members of Christ be put upon those who bear Satan's 
    mark on their foreheads? Shall they be declared of the body of Christ, who 
    are, to the conviction of the church, of the world lying in wickedness?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Admission to the Lord's table is an act of church 
    power and government: for, if the church be a body or society by itself, and 
    the Lord's table the special privilege of that body, whereby one is declared 
    and allowed to be of that body, there can be no lawful admission thereto but 
    in the way of church power and government. For what corporation is there, 
    in which one may be admitted without an act of the governing part of it? 
    Our Lord has appointed governors in his church, 1 Corinthians 12:28. who 
    have a power to admit to, and debar from the sacrament, Matthew 7:6; and 
    this belongs not to the minister alone, but to the society of ruling 
    church-officers, that is, the minister and elders; for the keys of 
    government, to which admission belongs, are not given to one, but to the 
    unity of church-officers, 2 Corinthians 2:6.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There ought to be a due trial of those who are 
    admitted to the Lord's table, that it may be seen, whether or not those who 
    seek to be admitted are qualified according to the laws of the visible 
    kingdom of Christ, lest such be brought in as may bring a stain on the 
    society, and corrupt and defile them, instead of edifying them. This also 
    flows from the nature of the church as a separate society, and a communion 
    of saints. For, to bring in hand over head, without consideration of the 
    persons, is much a case with throwing open the doors of the sanctuary, that 
    any who pleases may enter. It is true, since God only knows the heart, no 
    doubt hypocrites and naughty persons may be let in as honest-hearted 
    Christians; the devil's goats may come in by their likeness to Christ's 
    sheep; but if their outside be promising, that is all the church can judge 
    of, other things are left to God's judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The whole matter is of the greatest weight and deepest 
    concern; and that,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, To the admitters, who are, as it were, the porters 
    of the Lord's house, and should look well whom they admit to the Lord's 
    table, that it be not profaned through their default. There are two things 
    requisite to give one a right before the church, to the Lord's table.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A competent measure of knowledge; without this 
    people cannot examine themselves, nor rightly discern the Lord's body, 1 
    Corinthians 11:28, 29. and they are declared none of the Lord's people, 
    Isaiah 27:11. "It is a people of no understanding; therefore he who made 
    them will not have mercy on them, and he who formed them will show them no 
    favor." The minister, whose office it is to teach, is the most competent, 
    though perhaps not the only judge in this point.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A blameless life, not scandalous and profane, 
    Matthew 7:6. These cannot be fit guests at the holy table, whose 
    conversation is openly wicked. And ministers and elders, who are, by their 
    office, overseers of the manners of the people, are to inquire into this. 
    And whoever duly considers it, will find it a most weighty piece of work.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, To the church, and every member thereof. Is it not 
    the concern of every one in the society, who be admitted as fellow-members 
    of the body, to partake of the greatest privileges of the church? It is the 
    duty of all to do what in them lies, that God's ordinance be not profaned, 
    that the communion of saints, which is one bread, receive not harm by the 
    bringing in thereto such as will stain and defile it, and that they be not 
    partakers of other men's sins, 1 Corinthians 5:6, 7. "Your glorying is not 
    good: don't you know, that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Purge out 
    therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. 
    For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us."</p>
<p align="justify">Question: What can and ought private Christians to do in 
    this case? Ans. If the case or offence of the party being such as renders 
    him unworthy to be admitted, cannot be removed by private admonition, either 
    through the party's obstinacy, or the publicness of it, in that case, they 
    ought to bring it to the church-officers, in order to stop the admission, 
    Matthew 18:15. If they do not this, they partake of the guilt; if they do, 
    they have delivered their own souls, though the church-officers do not their 
    duty, and may partake with a good conscience.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, To the party himself. It is the taking on of the 
    external public badge of the communion of saints, a solemn declaration of 
    his being one body with the members of Christ, the which must needs be of 
    great concern to any one who duly considers how solemn and awful an action 
    this is. To go about this work ignorantly, indeliberately and rashly, 
    without due preparation, is a taking of God's name in vain with a witness. 
    Wherefore,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Let those who have a hand in admission to the Lord's 
    table, be careful and conscientious to approve themselves to God in this 
    weighty matter.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Let the whole communicants be concerned to see to it 
    as they have opportunity.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Let persons looking that way duly consider the 
    weight of the matter.</p>
<p align="justify">Those who have been once orderly admitted, may at every 
    occasion thereafter claim their privilege in case they have kept free from 
    public scandal. But as for those who have not yet been orderly admitted, 
    they ought to make it a matter of time, that there be no hurry in their 
    admission. I have often complained, that some never show their desire of 
    admission, until there be little time left either for themselves or us to 
    consider of that weighty business. I have endeavored to prevent that, by 
    giving intimation some weeks before, but almost still in vain as to some. 
    May we be helped to take some method hereafter that may effectually prevent 
    it. Is it not highly reasonable, that those who by office are to see to 
    this, be satisfied both as to the knowledge and conversation of those they 
    must admit? And why should people be so conceited of themselves as not to 
    allow a competent time for this? Let all consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The honor of Christ, how it is concerned in this 
    matter, that that be not said concerning us, Romans 2:24.—"The name of God 
    is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you."—The lovely order of the 
    Lord's house is for his sake to be carefully observed.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The ordinance is in hazard of profanation, and all are 
    in hazard of being guilty of it. The admitters bring guilt on themselves 
    when they are negligent in this matter, Ezekiel 44:7. "In that you have 
    brought into my sanctuary strangers uncircumcised in heart, and 
    uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary to pollute it, even my house, 
    when you offer my bread."—The whole church when they are not in their duty, 
    Leviticus 5:1. and the party, Ezekiel 23:39.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The church is in hazard of being defiled, Hebrews 
    12:15.—"Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby 
    many be defiled." Some profane leaven brought in, may soon leaven the whole 
    lump.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The party who comes unwarrantably runs a terrible risk 
    1 Corinthians 11:29. "For he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks 
    damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The sacrament of the Lord's supper is to be 
    highly prized, and the partakers of it to walk worthy of their character and 
    privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let all those who are come to the years of discretion 
    duly value this high privilege, and timeously prepare themselves to partake 
    of it. They must needs be under mighty prejudices, or very untender persons, 
    who, without much ado, live without this ordinance time after time.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let those who are partakers remember their character, 
    as declared visible members of the body of Christ, and walk towards the 
    Lord, and towards one another, as those who are the Lord's by personal 
    dedication, and live in church-communion.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus have I shown you what a society professors and 
    communicants are, and what lies upon them by virtue of their being thus 
    joined in church-communion.</p>
