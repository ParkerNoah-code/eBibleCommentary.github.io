<p align="justify"><br/>
    Mark 4:11, "And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery 
    of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are 
    done in parables."</p>
<p align="justify">AS the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, and 
    the wisdom of God reckoned foolishness by the blind world; so, in all ages, 
    the one part of mankind has reckoned the other fools, according as they have 
    followed these different sorts of wisdom. Sinners think saints fools; and 
    saints know sinners to be fools. Tracing this to its original, it will be 
    found to arise from that very different light in which spiritual things 
    appear to the several parties, as says the text. In which we have two 
    things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The spiritual privilege of some, with respect to the 
    kingdom of God: "Unto you it is given to know," etc. By the kingdom of God, 
    is meant the kingdom of the Messiah. That was common style among the Jews in 
    the days of our Savior, Luke 17:20; 19:11. But they quite mistook the nature 
    of it, and imagining it would be a kingdom of worldly pomp and grandeur, 
    they knew it not when it was set up among them; and rejected Christ as the 
    king of it, because he appeared not in the splendor in which they 
    apprehended the king-messiah would appear. However, Christ, being the 
    Messiah, his kingdom is the kingdom of God. His kingdom was a mystery which 
    they could not understand; but unto some it was given of God to know the 
    mystery; and these being opposed to such as were without, it is plain by 
    them is meant such as were within it, that is, the true subjects of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The state of darkness and blindness in which others 
    were, with respect to that subject, the kingdom of God. To them that are 
    without the kingdom, who are not the subjects of it, but of the kingdom of 
    the devil, all these things, or the all that concerns that kingdom, is under 
    a veil; as things proposed in a parable, which the hearers understand not.</p>
<p align="justify">The scope and substance of these words, we may take up in 
    these four points, upon each of which I would enlarge a little:</p>
<p align="justify">I. There is a kingdom of Christ erected among men, which 
    is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The kingdom of Christ is a mysterious kingdom.</p>
<p align="justify">III. It is the privilege of the subjects of Christ's 
    kingdom, to know the mystery of it.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. It is the misery of those without the kingdom of 
    Christ, that they know it not, more than a parable which they do not 
    understand. We shall attend to these in their order:</p>
<p align="justify">I. There is a kingdom of Christ erected among men, which 
    is the kingdom of God. Here we consider only two things, namely, the 
    erecting of the kingdom, and the extent of it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The erecting of this kingdom. Concerning this, observe 
    three things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The erector of it. He who set it up. That was the 
    Father. "I have set my king," says he, "upon my holy hill of Zion." 
    Therefore it is called the kingdom of God. It is different from his eternal 
    kingdom. The kingdom of Messiah is a mediatory kingdom, of which some men, 
    and not all, are subjects. It is a delegated kingdom, of which Christ is the 
    king by delegation and commission from the Father. To put his title to it 
    out of question, he was anointed king of it, namely, by the Holy Spirit, 
    Isaiah 61:1.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The cause for which it was erected was the recovery of 
    lost sinners; lost to God, and lost to themselves. All mankind being lost in 
    Adam, God purposed from eternity, by his grace, to save some of them. But 
    the kingdom of nature, founded on the work of creation, and governed 
    according to the covenant of works, could not reach this end. Therefore 
    there was a new kingdom erected, founded on the work of redemption, and to 
    be governed according to the great charter of the covenant of grace. And 
    Christ Jesus having borne the burden of laying the foundation of it with his 
    own blood, upon him was the honor of the crown of it conferred.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The time of its creation. It was purposed from 
    eternity. But it is an ancient kingdom, considered even from the time of its 
    being actually set up, which was at Adam's fall. Then Christ entered on the 
    government, and as a king examined, judged, and proclaimed a remission to 
    our guilty first parents, and pronounced the serpent's doom, Genesis 3:8, 9, 
    and downwards. It has continued ever since, without interruption, 
    notwithstanding the continual opposition made to it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We may consider the extent of it. Here it may be 
    observed, that, in respect of the kinds of jurisdiction, it comprehends the 
    kingdom of grace. All the grace and favors of Heaven to salvation, relative 
    or real, that ever mortals may, or shall partake of in this world, are in 
    the hands of this king to dispense. "God has put all things under his feet, 
    and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church." It comprehends 
    also the kingdom of glory, for the glory of Heaven is also at his disposal, 
    as well as the grace of Heaven; Luke 22:29, 30. The kingdom of providence is 
    also under his control; for into the same hands that the Father has 
    committed the government of the church, he has also committed the government 
    of the world, and that for the good of the church. "The Father judges no 
    man. but has committed all judgment to the Son."</p>
<p align="justify">In respect of the bounds of the kingdom. It reaches to 
    both worlds, Heaven and earth. "All power is given unto me," says Jesus, "in 
    Heaven and in earth." He administers the government in both worlds, for the 
    kingdom is but one. Only some of the subjects dwell in the upper parts of 
    his dominion, namely, the glorified saints in Heaven, and them he rules. 
    "For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall 
    lead them unto living fountains of water." Others dwell in the lower parts 
    of his dominion, namely, the saints on earth, and them he rules, Psalm 2:8. 
    Nay, the passage between the upper and lower parts of his dominion, namely, 
    the valley of the shadow of death, is part of his dominion also, that you 
    may be sure that his kingdom, as large as it is, is but one. "He has the 
    keys of Hell and of death."</p>
<p align="justify">In respect of duration, this kingdom will last forever, 
    without end. "Of this kingdom there shall be no end." At the great day, 
    indeed, he will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, presenting all the 
    designed subjects of it complete, according to the design of the erection of 
    the kingdom. But he will continue in his kingly dignity and office, without 
    end. "His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; 
    and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Beware then of opposing this kingdom of Christ, by 
    sisting yourselves enemies to him by unbelief and impenitence, opposing 
    truth and holiness. It is the kingdom of God, and therefore shall 
    undoubtedly prevail, and the enemies of it will fall, and fall under a 
    dreadful weight, falling under the wrath of this king, which will grind them 
    to powder, Luke 20:17, 18.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Submit yourselves to the Royal Mediator. "Kiss the 
    Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is 
    kindled but for a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him." 
    Submit to his righteousness, renouncing your own. To his teaching, 
    renouncing your own wisdom. Submit to his government, renouncing your 
    corrupt lusts and affections. His father has put the crown on his head; his 
    mother, also, crowns him the day of his espousals, Song 3:11; and on your 
    espousals to him by faith, he will account himself crowned by you. We 
    proceed now to the</p>
<p align="justify">II. Point. The kingdom of Christ is a mysterious kingdom. 
    A mystery is a secret, or hidden thing; hidden under some outward veil or 
    other, which must be drawn aside, before one can see and discern it. 
    Accordingly, the kingdom of Christ is a secret, a hidden thing; a mysterious 
    kingdom, though among men before their eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The kingdom of Christ itself is a mystery. "The 
    mystery of the kingdom." The kingdoms of this world are no mysteries, for 
    the outward show which they make to the eye, with crown and scepter, and 
    other ensigns of royalty, plainly discovers to the meanest capacity, at 
    first sight, what they are; and is equal to, if not above their intrinsic 
    excellency. But the outward show of the kingdom of Christ is so mean and low 
    in this world, that the carnal eye cannot thereby discern it to be a kingdom 
    at all, far less to be a kingdom above all other kingdoms, as indeed it is. 
    And therefore I think it is that Christ says, "the kingdom of God comes not 
    with observation." It is like a treasure in earthen vessels, a prince in the 
    habit of a servant, not to be known by the outward show.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a kingdom of mysteries; "even the mysteries of 
    the kingdom." A constellation of mysteries; many mysteries gathered together 
    in one; so that there will still be mysteries to be discovered to the 
    favorites of the King, and they will never be fully known until the veil be 
    rent, and the soul be admitted into the holy of holies above.</p>
<p align="justify">There are mysteries of faith in it. Mysteries to be 
    believed. We have a cluster of them in these words: "Without controversy, 
    great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified 
    in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in 
    the world, received up into glory." The incarnation of the Son of God, his 
    humiliation in his birth, life, and death on the cross; his burial, 
    resurrection, ascension, and sitting at the right hand of God in our nature, 
    are all great mysteries of faith.</p>
<p align="justify">There are mysteries of privileges. O what mysterious 
    privileges are conferred on the subjects of this kingdom! The imputation of 
    Christ's righteousness to them, the holiness of his nature, the 
    righteousness of his life, and the satisfaction made by his death; all set 
    down on their account, and their justification and deliverance from the law 
    as a covenant of works by it, are great mysteries. The union of believers 
    with Christ is justly called mystical, for it is a great mystery indeed: the 
    head in Heaven, the members on earth in a mean and low condition. They 
    crucified with Christ, so dead, yet living. So as he was in the world, an 
    unknown king; so are they in it unknown favorites, walking under a veil.</p>
<p align="justify">There are mysteries even of practice. As great is the 
    mystery of the principles, so of the practice of godliness. Sanctification 
    by union with Christ through faith, 1 Corinthians 1:2; Acts 26:18, is a 
    mysterious way of sanctification unknown to the Jewish Rabbis and Greek 
    philosophers, an imaginary sanctification in the eyes of all legalists. The 
    life of faith, emptying the man of himself, counting all his doings and 
    sufferings loss and dung; doing every duty in borrowed strength, standing on 
    borrowed legs, seeing with borrowed eyes, bearing burdens with borrowed 
    strength; Christ being all to the man, and himself nothing, is a mysterious 
    practice. Yet it is the life and practice in the kingdom of Christ. "I am 
    crucified with Christ," says Paul, "nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but 
    Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the 
    faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."</p>
<p align="justify">There are mysteries of providence. Kings of the earth 
    have their secrets of government, kept up from the body of their people. The 
    king of Zion has his secrets of government too, vastly more beyond the reach 
    of the spectators of the conduct. This providence was represented to 
    Ezekiel, chapter I., under the emblem of a wheel within a wheel, going on 
    its four sides, the rings so high as they were dreadful, and full of eyes. 
    The King's special favorites cast down to the dust, his enemies raised up. 
    John Baptist's head in a charger, the incestuous Herodias triumphing over 
    it. Men going in the way of duty, and the storm blowing hard on their face. 
    Others going on in the way of wickedness, and the sun of providence shining 
    warm on them. The King's dear children singled out to extraordinary 
    afflictions, and so made a spectacle to the world; and rebel sinners treated 
    as the darlings of Heaven. These are such mysteries as have puzzled the best 
    of men to unfold; as Asaph, Psalm 73; Jeremiah 12; and upon which the blind 
    world can make no commentary, but such as destroys the text. When they say, 
    "It is vain to serve the Lord; and what profit is it that we have kept his 
    ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hosts? And 
    now we call the proud happy. Yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, 
    they that tempt God are even delivered."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Take heed how you treat religion and seriousness, 
    in the principles and practice of it. Beware you traduce it not, in your 
    words and course of life, as foolishness; but maintain a solemn regard to it 
    upon your spirits, lest your censures of it be found as those of blind men 
    judging of colors, while you condemn what you do not understand; and lest a 
    fire unblown from a holy jealous God, whom you discern not in the revelation 
    which he has made of himself in Christ, break out upon you unto destruction. 
    "Now therefore be not mockers, lest your bands be made strong; for I have 
    heard from the Lord God of Hosts, a consumption even determined upon the 
    whole earth."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Profane persons are none of those who belong to this 
    kingdom. Drunkards, swearers, dishonest persons, unclean persons, and carnal 
    worldlings, that have not even the appearance of godliness. These are none 
    of this kingdom, for there is no mystery in their case but a mystery of 
    iniquity, proclaiming them to belong to the devil's kingdom, Galatians 5:19.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Formal hypocrites belong not to this kingdom. You that 
    are strangers to the power of godliness in the inner man, absolutely 
    unacquainted with the life of faith in your practice and experience; whose 
    religion is a parcel of mere bodily exercises, external performances. There 
    is no mystery in your religion, what is of it appears to the eye. The hidden 
    man of the heart is wanting, and therefore it is naught; "for bodily 
    exercise profits little." "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power 
    thereof, from such turn away." We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To show that it is the privilege of the subjects of 
    Christ's kingdom to know the mystery of it. Here consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The subjects of the kingdom of Christ. Who are they. 
    They are believers, and only believers. All the members of the visible 
    church are Christ's subjects in profession; but it is believers only who are 
    so in reallity. They are the only persons "who have been made willing in a 
    day of power;" who have opened the everlasting doors of their souls to 
    receive the King of Glory, to reign in them, and over them forever; who have 
    been espoused to him, and put the crown upon his head.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Their privilege in this point. It is "given them to 
    know the mystery of the kingdom." It is their privilege to be already 
    initiated in the mystery of the kingdom, to have the beginning of the 
    knowledge of it. They have obtained a proper view of the mysteries of faith, 
    of privilege, of practice, and providence, though in the meantime it is but 
    in part. "For now we see through a glass darkly, and know but in part." They 
    have so much insight into them, as keeps them from stumbling at them; and 
    all the wisdom of the world, and human learning, cannot give this much. This 
    have all the saints. "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a 
    stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are 
    called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of 
    God."</p>
<p align="justify">It is their privilege, also, to be in due time perfected 
    in the knowledge of the mystery of the kingdom, as far as their limited 
    capacity, enlarged by glorification, can reach. "For now we see through a 
    glass darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then we shall 
    know, even as also we are known." The light of glory will enlarge their 
    knowledge to a high degree, that shall perfect their happiness. And whoever 
    learn the first elements of it here, shall certainly get it perfected 
    hereafter, and get over all their difficulties that now remain. "The Lord 
    will perfect that which concerns me: your mercy, O Lord, endures forever: 
    forsake not the works of your own hands."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Let us consider how they get the knowledge of this 
    mystery which they have. They get it by the light of the word. "The law of 
    the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, 
    making wise the simple. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening 
    the eyes." The Bible is the book of the manner of the kingdom, and unfolds 
    the mysteries of it, as Asaph found in his experience, Psalm 73:16, 17. The 
    Bible, indeed, is flat, tasteless, and nauseous to many; but to none of the 
    subjects of the kingdom, only to those that are without.</p>
<p align="justify">They get this knowledge, also, by the teaching of the 
    Spirit, with the word. "God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the 
    Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God." He lets in a light 
    from Heaven into the mysteries, and opens the eyes of believers to see the 
    wondrous things. And no advantages of human are can make up the want of this 
    teaching. "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the 
    heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him." But 
    all the saints enjoy this teaching. "For it is written," says our Savior, 
    "in the prophets, and they shall be all taught of God. Every man, therefore, 
    that has heard and learned of the Father, comes unto me." They obtain this 
    knowledge, also, by experience. "O taste and see," says David, "that the 
    Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusts in him." An unfelt religion, is 
    the religion of them that are without, whose sound principles are like fire 
    painted on a wall; as far from any sanctifying efficacy on their lives, or 
    from burning up their corruptions, as that painted fire is from burning the 
    house on which it is. But the religion of the saints is a felt, experimental 
    religion. They feel the power of its mysteries upon their own souls, and 
    therefore adhere to them, in spite of carnal reasonings against them, for it 
    is difficult to dispute men out of their senses. "I am not ashamed of the 
    gospel of Christ," says Paul, "for it is the power of God unto salvation, to 
    every one that believes."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Come and see, is the only proper way to be 
    satisfied as to the reality and excellency of religion. Philip gave this 
    advice to Nathaniel, and, by following it, he was soon brought to say to 
    Jesus, "you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel." Enter 
    yourselves subjects of this kingdom by believing, and you shall know the 
    mystery of it. "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, 
    whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." Would you have the 
    privilege of subjects, before you be subjects? Or would you know a mystery, 
    before you give yourselves up to be taught? It is the commendation of 
    religion that none disparage it but those who have no experience of it; none 
    condemn it, but those whose blind eyes never saw the merits of the cause. So 
    the day will come that they will retract, at least when there is no remedy.</p>
<p align="justify">2. No king treats his subjects so advantageously, so 
    honorably, as Christ does his. The devil keeps his subjects in darkness, and 
    darkness is the main pillar of his kingdom. Without that, the works of 
    darkness would appear loathsome. Christ brings his subjects into light. He 
    makes them wise and knowing, however otherwise simple. Kings of the earth 
    will not impart the secrets of their government to their subjects, if it is 
    not to very few. But the Prince of the kings of the earth makes all his 
    subjects acquainted with the mysteries of the kingdom. We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To show that it is the misery of those without the 
    kingdom of Christ that they know not the mystery of it, more than a parable 
    which they do not understand. Here consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Who these are, that are without. All unbelievers are 
    such, who have never opened their hearts to receive Christ by faith. The 
    Jews called the Gentiles by this name. But our Lord teaches that it belongs 
    to unbelieving Jews, as well as Gentiles; and so to unbelieving Christians 
    as well as heathens. Though they are in the church they are not of it, and 
    so are reckoned without; being out of God's family, out of his covenant, and 
    out of the body of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. What is it they do not know? The text says, all these 
    things; namely, all that concerns the mystery of the kingdom; the shell, the 
    outward appearance of it is excepted. They know nothing of the other parts 
    of it. All is to them under a veil. Christ the King of it is a veiled Christ 
    to them. They know him not. The gospel, the scepter of the kingdom, is a 
    hidden gospel to them. The Spirit, the light and life of the kingdom, is an 
    unknown Spirit to them. "He is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot 
    receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him." The ten commands in 
    the hands of the Mediator, the laws of the kingdom, are unknown to them in 
    their spirituality, Matthew chapter 5. The covenant of grace, the instrument 
    of government in the kingdom, is an unknown instrument to them, Psalm 25:14. 
    The mysteries of faith, privilege, practice, and providence, remain all 
    under a veil to them. Let us inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">3. How it is they know it not. Though they know the words 
    in which that kingdom is revealed, they know not the thing itself. As a man 
    hearing a parable in his mother tongue, understands the grammatical sense of 
    the words, yet does not perceive the thing itself, enrapt up in the parable. 
    So is it here. "The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of 
    God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because 
    they are spiritually discerned." They are to them like a lecture of 
    philosophy, in a learned language, to a schoolboy.</p>
<p align="justify">They know it not by the teaching of the Spirit. "They are 
    sensual, having not the Spirit." They are strangers to supernatural 
    illumination, and the highest source of their knowledge is flesh and blood, 
    improved by external objective revelation; being strangers to the subjective 
    revelation, the opening the eyes of the mind, Deuteronomy 29:4.</p>
<p align="justify">They know it not by experience; and so they know no more 
    of religion than one does of honey or vinegar, how sweet or how sour they 
    are, who may have heard of them, but never tasted the one or the other.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Here see the source of the dreadful inundation of 
    atheism, deism, and contempt of revealed religion; the source of the flood 
    of irreligion, immorality, and profanity, overflowing all its banks this 
    day. These wretched men are without, and though they have no eyes to see the 
    mystery of the kingdom, they have pride and self-conceit to think that they 
    see through it. Their impetuous lusts need such a shelter, and they know 
    that if there be that reality in religion which they would not wish, they 
    are undone forever. So they neither come into the kernel of religion, nor 
    desire to come; but break their teeth on the shell which they cannot open.</p>
<p align="justify">2. I exhort all to study the mystery of the kingdom of 
    Christ. Religion is another thing than either the profane multitude, or 
    common crowd of professors take it to be. Strive earnestly to get into the 
    spirit of it now, and to feel its life and power upon your souls. It will be 
    no comfort when in Hell, with your eyes open, to say, that you never thought 
    that it had been such a hidden thing. You have clear and strong testimony 
    afforded you from the Word of God, and the experience of the saints, that 
    there is a reality in religion; and that the possession and practice of it 
    are absolutely necessary to your happiness. "For except a man be born again, 
    he cannot see the kingdom of God;" "and without holiness, no man shall see 
    the Lord." Trifle no longer, then, with this great and important concern. 
    Give yourselves with earnestness, diligence, and perseverance, to the use of 
    all the appointed means by which the necessary and happy change may be 
    produced in your souls. Pray fervently that "he who at first commanded the 
    light to shine out of darkness, may himself shine into your hearts," by his 
    word and Spirit; "to give you the light of the knowledge of his glory in the 
    face of Jesus, and thus make you his willing people in the day of his 
    power." Amen.</p>
