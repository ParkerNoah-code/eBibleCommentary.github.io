          Romans 1:18 "For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all
          ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
          unrighteousness!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IT is highly necessary to move men to depart from iniquity, that they
          understand how heinously the Lord takes their going on in it, and to
          what hazard they expose themselves by it. Right impressions of this
          would oblige men to stand and consider what they are doing towards
          their own ruin, while they resist known truth, and go on in opposition
          to it, in favor of their lusts, which in effect is the blowing up of
          the Lord's wrath against themselves. "For the wrath of God is revealed
          from Heaven," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Attend 1st. To the connection, For, This is the general argument to
          prove justification to be by the righteousness of faith revealed in
          the gospel. Namely, that all who hold the truth in unrighteousness,
          and so are ungodly and unrighteous, (and such are the heathens, verse
          19–32 and such are the Jews and carnal professors of the gospel,
          chapter 2) are condemned by the law, and therefore cannot be justified
          by it; but if they be justified at all, it must be by faith. "For the
          wrath of God," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Attend to the words themselves, in which consider two things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A revelation of wrath made. The wrath of God is revealed. This is
          opposed to the revelation of righteousness, verse 17. and shows the
          absolute necessity thereof, and none will value the latter, but they
          who see and are convinced of the former. Now here consider, what is
          revealed, The wrath of God. This is no passion in him, who is without
          parts and passions, but a firm and constant will in God severely to
          punish men for their sins, as men filled with wrath avenge themselves
          on those that provoke them. The revelation itself. This imports the
          existence of wrath in the heart of God against sinners, and also the
          unavailing and discovering of it to them. They cannot say it is hidden
          and unknown to them. No, it is plainly revealed to them all. To those
          without the church, in the natural law, or dictates of their own
          conscience, verse 32. To those in the church, not only in their
          consciences by the natural knowledge thereof; but also in the written
          law. To both, by strokes of wrath inflicted for sin. This wrath is
          revealed from Heaven. Either from the God of Heaven; or rather from
          Heaven as the throne of God, where he sits judging men on the earth
          and from which the sentence comes.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The objects of the wrath revealed. These are twofold. First, the
          personal objects, those who hold the truth in unrighteousness. This is
          the character of the objects of wrath. They are men who maltreat the
          truth which the Lord has lodged with them. In men's understandings the
          Lord has lodged truth, whether of the natural or revealed law, there
          to command in chief, in their hearts and lives. But they, instead of
          allowing it to rule them, raise up their lusts against it, and
          unrighteously and wickedly hold it in and hold it under. The word
          signifies, to obstruct, or hinder, 2 Thessalonians 2:6. You know what
          withholds. So they hinder the effect of truth in their hearts and
          lives, it can do nothing for their reformation. And it signifies to
          hold forcibly, 1 Thessalonians 5:21. Hold fast that which is good.
          They imprison or hold the truth prisoner, in their heads, that they
          may do as they please in their hearts and lives. For it is thought to
          be a metaphor from tyrants who oppress the innocent, keeping them
          prisoners against all right.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, The real objects of this wrath, the things which provoke him
          against the persons, all ungodliness and unrighteousness. The former
          comprehends all sins against the first table, of which keeping truth
          prisoner is none of the least. The latter comprehends all sins against
          the second table. These are the effects of men's holding truth
          prisoner; for during this confinement, they range up and down at
          liberty. And against these, and all these, however little men judge of
          them, God's wrath is revealed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine 1.—Men's unjust holding truth prisoner makes them objects of
          God's wrath. I shall consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. What is that truth which men hold prisoner.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. Show how men hold truth prisoner.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show that truth is unjustly thus treated. And
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Confirm the doctrine. We are to inquire,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. What is that truth which men hold prisoner?</p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is religious and practical truth which tends to the right ruling of
          the heart and life in obedience to the will of God. And all religious
          truth is practical, even from the lowest to the most sublime truths of
          religion. For the truth is after godliness. From the truth of God's
          word, we ought to learn how to carry ourselves towards God and our
          neighbor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This truth is twofold. First, The truth of natural religion, or the
          dictates of a natural conscience, agreeable to those common notices of
          good and evil, left in man since the fall. "Which show the work of the
          law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing them
          witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing
          one another." When God made man, he impressed on his mind, the
          knowledge of the whole of his duty. This was greatly defaced by the
          fall, yet not quite obliterated, but that there are such remains of it
          as the going against them renders men inexcusable. "For the invisible
          things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly seen being
          understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
          Godhead; so that they are without excuse." The truths thus known are
          such as, God is to be worshiped, men must live honestly, every one is
          to have his due from us. The which and the like may be and have been
          improved into a considerable system of morality.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Second, The truth of revealed religion, which is held out to us in the
          written word, and comprehends the whole truths of the law and of the
          gospel also. The end of which is sanctification. Sanctify them through
          your truth, your word is truth. These truths are revealed in the
          church, being read and preached to them among whom God has set up his
          tabernacle. And they shine as light in a dark place, to guide men's
          feet in the way of duty. The particular truths of each of these kinds
          are many. But all of them are held prisoners by the ungodly and the
          wicked who will not bow to them in their practice, nor be guided by
          them. We proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show how men hold truth prisoner. Two ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Men hold truth prisoner in others, and so expose themselves to
          God's wrath. This specially three ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By putting truth into an ill name, casting reproach and disgrace
          upon it, on whatever pretenses. Thus many of them said of Jesus, who
          is himself the truth, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you him?
          This does effectually lay bands on the truth in an evil world.
          "Brethren, says Paul, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
          free course and be glorified, even as it is with you. And that we may
          be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not
          faith." Much guilt lies upon a professing generation among us for hard
          speeches, which have imprisoned preached truth many a time, and marred
          its efficacy both on themselves and others; while they have little
          considered of what dreadful consequence to poor souls, the liberty
          which they have taken to themselves that way, has proved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. By resisting and opposing the truth. "Thus when the Jews opposed
          themselves and blasphemed, Paul shook his clothing and said unto them,
          your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will
          go to the Gentiles." When men give loose reins to their lusts to
          oppose the truth told them publicly or privately, they lay bands on
          it, and hinder its efficacy, saying, it shall not reign over us. Thus
          men are often irritated by the truth, instead of being humbled and
          bettered by it. "Am I therefore, says Paul to the Galatians, become
          your enemy, because I tell you the truth?" Men will have truth suited
          to their humours, instead of suiting themselves to the truth. "This is
          a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the
          law of the Lord. Which say to the seers, see not; and to the prophets,
          prophesy not unto us right things; speak unto us smooth things,
          prophesy deceits."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, By an authoritative shutting up of truth. This often follows
          as a judgment. "But you, O son of man, said God to Ezekiel, behold,
          they shall put bands upon you, and shall bind you with them, and you
          shall not go out among them. And I will make your tongue cleave to the
          roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a
          reprover; for they are a rebellious house." And thus sometimes lights
          in the Lord's house are taken down from off the candlestick and put
          under a bushel, to the marring of the progress of truth, the darkening
          of the house, and hastening on of more wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Men hold truth prisoner in themselves. This is what the text mainly
          aims at. The office of truth is to combat sin, to advance holiness, to
          bring the world and the soul in which it lodges, to a conformity to
          itself, to cast them into its own mold. "But God be thanked that you
          were the servants of sin; but you have obeyed from the heart that form
          of doctrine which was delivered you." And it is held prisoner, when
          this effect of it is prevented by us, and we will not allow it to
          exert its efficacy. This is done two ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. With respect to others, when it is kept back from preventing sin in
          them. This is done two ways. First, when it is restrained by undue
          silence. If the Lord call men to bring it forth, silence in that case
          is undue, and a bond laid on truth. "Whoever therefore shall be
          ashamed of me and of my words, in this sinful and adulterous
          generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes
          in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels." And from this
          arises sin's going on without control in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question, When is truth held prisoner by undue silence?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Answer, I. Negatively, not when one has no sufficient call to bring it
          forth. The wise man observes, There is a time to keep silence, and a
          time to speak. And in discerning these times there is much spiritual
          wisdom. A wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment. Truth kept
          in silence, during the proper time of silence, is not kept prisoner,
          but entertained in its lodging suitable to its character. "A fool
          utters all his mind, but a wise man keeps it in until afterwards."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Truth is too sacred a thing, to bring forth just to make a show of,
          and far more to prostitute to men's lusts and humours. There is an
          unseasonable venting of truth, by which truth and holiness gain
          nothing, but lose much; as is clear in the case of Doeg discovering
          David, 1 Samuel 22:10. Our Lord forbids it. "Give not that which is
          holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine; lest they
          trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you." The
          apostle says he had declared all the counsel of God, Acts 20:27. But
          behold how it is qualified, verse 20. "And how I have kept back
          nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have
          taught you publicly and from house to house." Compare 1 Thessalonians
          5:1 where he says, "But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you
          have no need that I write unto you." Our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
          truth itself, see his practice in this matter. "But these things have
          I told you, that, when the time shall come, you may remember that I
          told you of them. And these things I told not unto you at the
          beginning, because I was with you. I have yet many things to say unto
          you, but you cannot bear them now."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Positively, when the honor of God, and the good of our neighbor
          requires the bringing it forth. To hold truth back, when the Lord's
          honor requires it to come forth, is to hold it prisoner, Mark 8:38.
          already cited. When the Lord's honor is at stake, truth is like a fire
          that will seek a vent, and get it in a tender soul. Thus speaks
          Jeremiah, "Then I said, I will not make mention of him nor speak any
          more in his name; but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire
          shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not
          stay." And it exposes men to the wrath of God, to hold in truth in
          that case, for that is to sacrifice God's glory to men's own interests
          and lusts which is a dangerous business.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, to hold it in when the good of our neighbor requires it to come
          forth, is to hold it prisoner, "You shall not hate your brother in
          your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer
          sin upon him." Where there is any probable appearance of sin's being
          prevented in others, by means of the coming forth of truth, it is not
          to be held in, nor can it be so, without the guilt of imprisoning it.
          For how can one be guiltless, when he sees his neighbor pulling down
          the house about his ears, and yet will not warn him, putting his soul
          in hazard of the Lord's anger, going out of God's way, and yet does
          not tell him of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When by words or actions, one holding in the truth, leads another
          into sin. This is to hold truth prisoner with a witness, shutting the
          prison door with double bars. This Paul teaches, "Who knowing, says
          he, the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy
          of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do
          them." They knew things to be sinful, yet both did them themselves and
          helped forward others in them. There was a tincture of this in Peter's
          dissimulation, for which Paul reproved him, Galatians 2:11–14. This
          cannot miss to kindle the Lord's anger against a person, to lead
          others into that which he himself knows to be sinful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. With respect to themselves, they hold truth prisoner in themselves
          several ways. As by,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Neglecting, overlooking, and not adverting to it in the management
          of their hearts and lives. The Gibeonites who came to Joshua, took of
          their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord. There
          is a certain carelessness men are guilty of this way, by which, though
          the principles of holy walking are known to them, yet they take no
          heed to them, but walk at random at all adventures. The light shines
          about them, but they take no notice of it to order their steps by it.
          This is to put the Lord's candle in them, under a bushel. It is a
          principle of religion and right reason, Whatever you would that men
          should do unto you, do you also unto them. But in the affairs of many
          this is as little regarded, as if they were incapable of reflection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Not obeying truth speaking to them in their consciences. There is a
          conscience within men instructed in the truths of natural religion,
          and in Christians instructed in the truths of revealed religion,
          stirring up to duty to God, and one's neighbor accordingly. The which
          when men do not regard to obey it, in the dictates thereof, and to
          comply with the duties it presseth as the will of God, they hold truth
          prisoner, that it serves for nothing to them, but to be a witness
          against them, and to secure God's wrath upon them. "And think you
          this, O man that judge them that do such things, and do the same, that
          you shall escape the judgment of God?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Going on in opposition to known truth, knowing the right and doing
          the wrong. "They are of those that rebel against the light." This is a
          forcible holding of truth prisoner, refusing to admit its government
          in the soul, but on the contrary treading it under foot, to the
          kindling of the Lord's wrath against them who do so. How many such are
          there, who condemn these things in the general and in others, which
          yet they do themselves. Their heads are full of light, but their
          hearts and lives are full of darkness. They talk like saints, but live
          as the profane.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, by overcoming the truth in their war against it. "Who being
          past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work
          all impurity with greediness." Many a battle there is between truth in
          the conscience, and a man's lusts, until the man taking part with his
          lusts against the truth, convictions are murdered, the troublesome
          light in the soul is put out, and truth is taken and held prisoner;
          that it can no more disturb the man in the enjoyment of his lusts. But
          he can go on securely in his sins, though the light remain, the heat
          of it being gone. We proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To show that truth is unjustly thus treated, wrongly held
          prisoner by sinners. This is clear, for that,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is God's messenger to men and his deputy in the soul, over which
          they have no power and authority. "For we can do nothing against the
          truth, but for the truth." God's truths are eternal and unchangeable
          like himself, and are set up in his word and the consciences of men,
          to rule their hearts and lives, and not to be overruled by them. So
          that one cannot hold it prisoner but in unrighteousness, or wrongly
          and in rebellion against the God of truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is never guilty of any crime against men, that it should be so
          treated. Falsehood and lies are ever contrary to men's true interest,
          but the truth is never so. It is God's lamp set up to light them in
          the way to true happiness, and to keep them from the paths of ruin.
          And if sinners will allow it full sway in them and over them, they
          could not fail of being made forever happy by it, as the disregarding
          of it will without question ruin them for evermore.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It cannot be held prisoner but for an unrighteous cause, and in
          favor of some lust or other. The very thing that makes a person treat
          it so, is that he may go on in his sin without control. The office of
          truth is to be a reformer in the heart and life, and those who hate to
          be reformed, for that very cause rise up against it and lay bonds on
          it. "Seeing you hate instruction, and cast my words behind you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, A just God will clear it, and set it free at the cost of those
          who hold it prisoner. "They shall know, says the Lord, whose word
          shall stand, mine or theirs." If truth prevail not to men's
          reformation, it will prevail to their destruction; if its commands and
          instructions have not their effect on them, its threatenings will.
          "Your fathers where are they? And the prophets do they live forever?
          But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the
          prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? And they returned,
          and said, like as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us, according
          to our ways and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us."
          Wherefore strong is truth and will prevail, whoever oppose it. This
          brings us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. To confirm the doctrine. Consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A person's treating truth thus is rebellion against God, who is the
          God of truth and Lord of light. The gospel is the scepter of Christ's
          kingdom. The rod of his power, Psalm 110:2. Those who resist it, and
          in opposition to it go on in their sinful courses, are declared
          enemies and rebels to the Lord. "But these mine enemies, says he,
          which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay
          them before me." They will be broken with his iron rod. Conscience is
          God's deputy in the soul; therefore to go against it is to go against
          God, and God will ratify the sentence pronounced by conscience, out of
          his word against the sinner, "For if our heart condemn us, God is
          greater than our heart, and knows all things."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It exposes men to severe temporal judgments. It was our first
          parents holding truth prisoner, which brought in the flood of miseries
          on the world. To the old world Noah preached righteousness, yes,
          Christ by his Spirit in him preached to them, but they would not obey
          the truth, so they were swept away with the deluge, 1 Peter 3:19, 20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It exposes to spiritual judgments. Judgments of wrath on the soul.
          Men who will not see, God is provoked judicially to blind, to harden
          those who will not be softened; and to give them over to Satan and
          their lusts, who will not be reformed, nor withheld from them, Isaiah
          6:8–10. Thus the very means of grace become a savor of death unto
          many. Who can without horror read the fearful dispensation of
          providence against the heathens for imprisoning their light? Romans
          1:21–28.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It exposes to eternal judgments. "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed
          from Heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance
          on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
          Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from
          the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." This crime
          then will bring men to everlasting ruin. The imprisoning of the truth
          in unrighteousness, will make them truth's prisoners in Hell forever.
          "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
          men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
          Truth in God's word and in men's consciences says, Those who do this,
          are worthy of death. Their lusts bid them venture on them
          notwithstanding, hoping better things. But truth will prevail, because
          it is God's truth and cannot be broken.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It vehemently hightens wrath and aggravates the judgments of
          it here and hereafter. "And that servant, which knew his Lord's will,
          and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will shall be
          beaten with many stripes. But he who knew not and did commit things
          worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whoever
          much is given, of him shall be much required." The more light men sin
          against, the greater is their sin, and the more fearful will their
          punishment be. It will be a hot Hell that these will have, who have
          been faithfully warned by a gospel ministry, in comparison of theirs
          who either never heard the gospel, or whose light has been but dim and
          obscure. O consider that heavy word, Deuteronomy 29:19–21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 1.—This generation in this land is a generation of wrath, and
          cannot escape judgment come from what quarter it will. For this is the
          sin, the course of the generation, light is come, but they love
          darkness. We have had a long and clear dispensation of the gospel for
          many years. But look abroad in the land, and behold the fruits. They
          are fruits of Sodom. Few or none grow better. Many are waxing worse.
          Ungodliness and unrighteousness abound: not for want of light, but
          through resisting it. So that our sun of the gospel, is a winter sun
          whose efficacy is much gone. A gospel that is not obeyed but neglected
          and contemned; and if persecution be added to fill up the measure of
          iniquity and make the cup run over, it is but the native consequence
          of holding the truth in unrighteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let me apply this to you, to whom I have spoken the word of the
          Lord. To the best of my knowledge I have kept back nothing that was
          profitable for you. And I even own that your knowledge of the truth of
          religion, is as much generally as I ever observed in other places. But
          alas! I think truth is held prisoner with a witness, and our lives are
          not at all answerable to our light, and I fear it will bring wrath
          upon the place. Therefore I would have you convinced of this sin and
          of the hazard of it; and to forsake it and set truth free, that it may
          reign freely in your hearts and lives. Now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To convince you of the truth of this charge consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Are there not some who to maintain their peace, keep off from
          serious consideration of that weighty point, how matters stand with
          them before the Lord. They do not obey the command, "Examine
          yourselves whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. But the
          slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again
          to his mouth." They know if they should enter into the opening up of
          their state and case, their peace is gone. Their heart dies in them
          like a stone at the thoughts of it, and therefore they carefully hold
          from it. This is an evidence they are self-condemned and have no
          peace, but as truth is held prisoner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Where is conscientious reformation, according to the word preached
          and acknowledged in the time for true and right? "They come unto you,
          said God to Ezekiel, as the people comes, and they sit before you as
          my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for
          with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their
          covetousness." When you go to your looking-glasses what spots are on
          your faces you wipe off, what is wrong in your dresses you put right.
          The preaching of the word is the Lord's looking-glass, set up before
          you every Sabbath. See you no spots by it? Does it not discover your
          duties omitted, your sin committed, and often touch on the sore heel?
          "For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two
          edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit
          and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
          intents of the heart." But do you labor to wipe off the spots
          discovered, and rectify the wrongs about you? Or do you not even carry
          them away with you, and bring them back again and get the other view
          and carry them away again? James 1:23–25. Ah! sirs, this is
          imprisoning the truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. How many in the conduct of their lives and affairs consult their
          worldly interest and satisfy their unruly passions, but regard not the
          truth of God's law and gospel. Like a company of servants, that will
          have their own way, without any regard to their master's orders though
          he be looking on. They are so far from being in the fear of the Lord
          all the day long, that from their morning prayers, to their evening
          prayers, they have no more use for the fear of God, than the ape for
          his collar, which he puts off and on as his convenience serves, nor
          more use for their Bible and what it says, than if they were things
          out of date.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In their thoughts, words, and actions, towards God and their neighbor,
          they are children of Belial, without a yoke. They think, say, and do,
          what they please.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. How many are there whose lives are stained with gross
          transgressions against the letter of the law, and never reform? Are
          there any among us who do not know that cursing, swearing, lying,
          drunkenness, Sabbath-breaking, unrighteous dealing, wrath, strife and
          the like, are works of the flesh, and they that do such things shall
          not inherit the kingdom of God? I think there are none, though it were
          the advantage of some they had never known it, their sin had been the
          less. If men did not imprison truth, could their tongues be set
          against the heavens at the rate they are? Would they dare to do an
          unjust thing, bite and devour one another, fight and scold as void of
          God's fear?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Are not many things done, conscience in the very time reclaiming
          and witnessing against them; yet it is overruled and the sin done in
          opposition to it, Romans 2:15. Is it possible men and women can be
          hearers of the gospel and do such things as many do, without a witness
          against them in their own bosom, however fair a face they put on it?
          No, but they lay bands on it. They will tread over it, and strangle
          it, to please the lusts of others, or their own, and sell their souls
          to the devil for dishonest gain, and will do anything to save their
          credit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. How many have had rousing awakenings, with whom all is got hushed
          again, and they have all the ease in their sinful courses which they
          had before. "Their goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the early
          dew it passes away." The word has sometimes made a disturbance in some
          persons' consciences and they have gone away with God's arrows
          sticking in them, but they have got them out through time. "When Paul
          reasoned of righteousness, temperance and judgment to come, Felix
          trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a
          convenient season, I will call for you." They have met signal
          judgments from the Lord's hand that have spoken plain language, they
          have been in imminent danger of death and eternity; and these have
          made them bethink themselves of turning over a new leaf, and to be
          other sort of persons than ever they had been. But all has turned to
          nothing. "Lord in trouble have they visited you; they poured out a
          prayer when your chastening hand was upon them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Are there not some who will not witness against sin in others,
          when they have a fair call to it; or cannot bear it witnessed against
          themselves? Many who can speak well in their own cause, have not a
          word to speak in the cause of God and holiness, but imprison truth in
          themselves, to their partaking of the sins of others, but say what is
          that to us? And many are such sons of Belial, that one cannot speak to
          them of their offences, but their passions rise, and they pour
          contempt on the reprover, instead of taking with the reproof.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Having showed you the truth of the charge, let us try to convince you
          of the hazard of thus imprisoning the truth. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That it is ingratitude to God of the deepest dye. May not the Lord
          say, "Do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is he
          not your Father that has bought you? Has he not made you and
          established you?" God's laying to our hands the conveniences of this
          life, giving us fruitful seasons and filling us with food and
          gladness, obliges us to grateful improvement. Much more does his
          giving us the knowledge of the truth in his gospel oblige us to it. It
          is a very signal and eminent benefit, and so great must be the
          ingratitude in so treating it. Consider that it is a spiritual mercy,
          a benefit for our souls. It is God's candle set up in and among us, to
          let us see to work out our salvation. Shall we then take it and put it
          under a bushel? We must go through a dark and dangerous world; it is a
          lamp to our feet, shall we cover it up. Besides it is a mercy not
          common to all. "He shows his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his
          judgments unto Israel. He has not dealt so with any nation; and as for
          his judgments they have not known them. Praise you the Lord." It is
          true all have some natural truth, but as for gospel truth revealed
          unto us, many nations in the world are without it. Look through the
          heathen world, and behold how they sit in the region and shadow of
          death, knowing nothing of a Bible, Sabbaths, ministers, sermons; and
          look again into this country and see how we have all these in plenty.
          And then think what monstrous ingratitude it is to treat truth at this
          rate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is direct disobedience to God, a flying in the face of his orders.
          "Now unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but
          obey unrighteousness, God will render indignation and wrath." By this
          practice men will have their own will their law, and when the laws of
          Heaven are proclaimed to them, they will not admit them, nor subject
          themselves to them. So that such in a peculiar manner are children of
          disobedience, not through ignorance, but willfulness. Moreover,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a rising up against God in open rebellion and war. "They are
          of those that rebel against the light." It is as if men should not
          only disregard, but tear in pieces the proclamation of God's law, fall
          upon his heralds, and put them in bonds. If such could banish the
          truth from among them, that they should know it no more, they would;
          but since they cannot do that, they shut it up and are at war with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is working against our own interest in favor of Satan and our
          lusts. It is the putting out of the candle, which God in compassion to
          our darkness has lighted unto us. It is like one traveling through a
          wilderness of pits, rising up against his guide, binding him and
          casting him into one of them. Like captives conspiring against their
          deliverers, or sick men against their physician, to their own ruin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">This is the evil of it. Now the hazard is great.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Men so doing grow worse and worse. "Being past feeling have given
          themselves over to lasciviousness to work all impurity with
          greediness." It is a wonder to many to see men the longer they live
          under the means of grace, to grow worse instead of better; the name of
          the devil in them to turn legion, as it is with many this day. But
          here lies the matter, they are hellish conquerors, who grow insolent
          upon their victory. Like rebels waging war with their lawful prince,
          there is no abiding them, when the day is their own. Having got the
          victory over truth, they break all its bands, and cast its cords from
          them, the wall is thrown down, and wickedness, like a flood, breaks
          out and overflows all its banks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It brings on judicial blindness. "The God of this world has blinded
          the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious
          gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
          Men who loving darkness rather than light, shut their eyes against the
          light, are in a fair way to be struck blind. So that as darkness is
          their choice so they shall have enough of it, Isaiah 6:9, 10.
          Sometimes a light is broke up in one's breast, and he is awakened. But
          striving against it, it is lessened and grows feebler and feebler,
          like the evening light, until it go quite out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It brings on judicial hardness, Isaiah 6:10. A customary going on
          in opposition to light, is the high way to make one senseless and
          unfeeling, that one can sin without remorse. It makes the conscience
          as it were seared with a hot iron, benumbed, stupid, and dead. Every
          sin against light, wounds the conscience, the wounds multiplied,
          conscience is as it were slain outright. Hence it is, that some sins
          which one could not commit without great uneasiness, they have come by
          custom, to commit with all the ease they can wish.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It provokes God to give up with men and to give them over to their
          own lusts. "But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel
          would none of me. So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust; and
          they walked in their own counsels." This is a fearful judgment, when
          God withdraws the workings of his Spirit from men, which they have
          quenched; takes off the restraints of his providence from them, which
          they have striven against; lays the reins on their own necks, and
          suffers them to go wherever Satan and their own lusts drive them. Yet
          this is the native fruit of holding the truth in unrighteousness.
          Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. It paves the way to the unpardonable sin, the great transgression.
          The imprisoning of truth is a main ingredient in this sin, a going
          over the belly of known truth. It is a total apostasy of those once
          enlightened, Hebrews 6:1–8. And O what a fearful thing is it to come
          so near the borders of that hopeless case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. It is often punished with the prevailing of the spirit of error and
          delusion, Isaiah 66:3, 4. When the sacred truths of God are not
          entertained in the love of them, a fearful mist of error and delusion
          oftentimes arises to the ruin of the souls of many. "And for this
          cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a
          lie; that they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had
          pleasure in unrighteousness." This never since the revolution, looked
          so like to be the plague of this generation as now and within these
          few years. And by this we know what to blame for it. The primitive
          apostolic church had a great gospel day, but many held the truth in
          unrighteousness. And for the punishment of it some arose denying
          justification by faith, and some the resurrection and the like. After
          the church had had a long declining day, the great apostasy of
          antichrist followed in the west, 2 Thessalonians 2:6–12. And nearly
          about the same time, Mohammadanism in the east. When Luther arose, and
          he and others had brought back the truth from its Babylonish
          captivity, the anabaptists arose in Germany, with fearful and
          outrageous delusions. In the last age, after these nations had lost
          the purity of ordinances and sense of religion under prelacy, and they
          were recovered by the good hand of God: This nation renewing the
          national covenant, and the three nations entering into the solemn
          league and covenant, they had a bright day of the gospel a while. But
          not being improved an unparalleled deluge of errors and heresies came
          in on the back of it, as if the gates of the bottomless pit had been
          set wide open, especially in England. And we have had a great and long
          day of the gospel since the revolution, but fearfully misimproved. And
          the mist is now begun to rise. Not to speak of the prevailing of deism
          among many of the nobility and gentry, some of our own profession in
          the neighbor nation, teachers by office, have gone about to subvert
          the very foundation of Christianity. And in this church controversies
          about the doctrine have not long since broke out, and at this present
          time are in being, which trysting with the divisions and the separate
          practices among ministers have a fearful aspect and threaten a
          spreading cloud of ignorance and darkness. Believe you and receive the
          truth in love and give it free course with you, lest the time come
          when many shall say, They know not what to believe in more weighty
          matters, than they have yet been staggered about it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. It provokes God to remove the gospel from among a people, and to
          leave them in darkness. "Therefore, said Jesus, I say unto you, the
          kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing
          forth the fruit thereof." When people have no use for God's candle,
          but to divert themselves at it on Sabbath days, when they have no
          other thing to do, the candlestick is in a fair way to be removed out
          of its place, Revelation 2:5. Many of God's candles have been put out,
          because their burning and shining was for no purpose to advance
          holiness among those among whom they shined. Many have put them under
          their bushel, so that in vain they have given light, and therefore God
          threatens to put them under his bushel next.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          A while's darkness may make the light more prized and procure a more
          free course to the truth, 1 Samuel 3:1–8. It brings fearful tossings
          and rackings of conscience, when once conscience is awakened, under
          these Judas went and hanged himself. However one may for a while bear
          down truth in a silent conscience, it is apt to rise up on them some
          time or other. And as a fire long smothered makes terrible havoc when
          once it prevails and bursts out, so conscience when awakened. Then
          tormenting remorse takes its course in the soul and gives foretastes
          of Hell, where the worm never dies and the fire is not quenched.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It will aggravate a person's torment in Hell, But I say, unto
          you, said Jesus to the Jews, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
          Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. Remember the doom of the
          servant who knew his master's will, but did it not. As the sharpest
          vinegar comes of the most generous wine, so the most fierce wrath
          comes from the despising of truth revealed to one in the gospel. And
          when these, who were all their days kept ignorant of gospel truths
          shall be laid under wrath, what will the case be of those who have
          known them and imprisoned them? Double vengeance, even the Mediator's
          vengeance will be found their due, who have sinned against the remedy
          of sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3d Use. Set truth free, loose its bands that it may reign freely in
          your hearts and lives. That is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Resist not truth laid before you in or from the word, or by your
          own conscience. Never quarrel nor contend with it, nor oppose it more.
          Resist not its entry, but allow it free access into your consciences.
          Willful and affected ignorance in points of faith and practice, is a
          resisting of truth, says the Psalmist, "They know not, neither will
          they understand; they walk on in darkness." It is the character of the
          wicked, They say unto God, depart from us; for we desire not the
          knowledge of your ways. It is an evidence of enmity against the truth,
          when one desires not to know it, for that is only that they may enjoy
          someone lust or other with the more ease. But an upright heart opens
          to the truth, that it may be guided by it. Again, resist it not when
          it has entered. Rebel not against the light. Never resist the voice of
          your own consciences, by going contrary to its light, whatever be the
          temptation or the hazard. The testimony of one's conscience will be
          more comfortable under any trial, than all the world can be. "For our
          rejoicing is this, says Paul, the testimony of our conscience, that in
          simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the
          grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world." And an
          accusing and condemning conscience will be more heavy than any other
          burden.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Slight not nor overlook truth in the conduct of your lives. Let
          God's word be your rule in all your actions. Take the direction of
          conscience from the word along with you. And let not truth known unto
          you stand by unnoticed, but consult it and manage your life by it, in
          the several steps thereof.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Submit to the truth, to the truth in the word and to truth in your
          conscience, as the ruler of your life. It is God's deputy in your
          souls; it is the law of the great King, to which you are to yield in
          all points. Let it have the command in your souls, that they omit not
          what it requires, nor commit what it forbids. Let your souls be open
          to it, to be reformed, reproved, instructed and directed by it.
          Renounce your own wills, your own lusts, resolving to be guided by the
          testimonies of God, as to what is to be believed or practiced.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. It will set you at liberty. "You shall know the truth, and
          the truth shall make you free." Truth set free will break the bonds of
          sin and Satan, under which the soul is, and give the man true liberty.
          "I will walk at liberty, says David, for I seek your precepts."
          Licentiousness, to run freely wherever a person's lusts drive him, is
          no true liberty. But to walk according to the rules of religion and
          reason is liberty indeed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The way of truth is the way of holiness and happiness. Truth and
          godliness are akin to each other. Hence Paul speaks "of acknowledging
          the truth which is after godliness." Truth is the great mean of
          sanctification. "Sanctify them, says Jesus, through your truth, your
          word is truth." And error and darkness always foster the corruptions
          of the heart. Holiness leads the way to happiness. And so truth
          believed and practiced will spring up in eternal happiness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider the imprisoning of the truth is the occasion of all
          ungodliness and unrighteousness among the hearers of the gospel. See
          the text. What is the cause of the abounding impiety and profaneness
          of our day, but that truth has not its effect. When truth is pent up,
          the sluice of ungodliness and unrighteousness is opened overturning
          all duty to God and to our neighbor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine II. Truth being kept prisoner, ungodliness and
          unrighteousness get loose. These are like the scales in the balance,
          as the one goes up, the other goes down. Here we shall consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. In what cases this holds true. And II. Why it is so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. In what cases this holds true. This holds,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In the case of societies, churches, nations, congregations,
          families, and neighborhoods. If truth prevail among them; ungodliness
          and unrighteousness lose their ground. If it be not so; they prevail.
          Look without the visible church, it is so. "Have respect unto the
          covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations
          of cruelty."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Look within the church and you will find it is so, says Isaiah, "In
          transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our
          God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the
          heart words of falsehood. And judgment is turned away backward, and
          justice stands afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity
          cannot enter." If one would open the sluices of impiety that
          wickedness may overflow all its banks, he has no more to do, but to
          lay hands on the truth, and the flood will rush out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is so in the case of particular persons. "Withhold your foot
          from being unshod, and your throat from thirst; but you said there is
          no hope: for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go." When
          once the bands which should be laid on their lusts, are laid on the
          truth, then men live at large and unconfined, abandoned to a lawless
          liberty. And then a man becomes a son of Belial indeed, without a
          yoke, in effect he bids defiance to Heaven. "With our tongue, say
          they, we will prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?" And
          such persons regard not men, farther than their interest and humor
          lead them. "Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a
          fool in his folly." Now let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Show why it is so. Consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That truth and they are contrary the one to the other, so that as
          the one goes away, the other takes place, as light and darkness which
          can have no communion. "What fellowship has righteousness with
          unrighteousness, and what communion has light with darkness?" The
          truth set up in one's conscience and what is revealed in the gospel
          teaches, "To deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
          righteously, and godly, in this present world." And when the light of
          the truth is stopped, then darkness comes on, and ungodliness and
          unrighteousness creep out like wild beasts from their dens in the
          night.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Man's heart has a natural bias to ungodliness and unrighteousness.
          Truth is a curb to this bias of the heart, and when this curb is
          removed, the heart goes in the ungodly and unrighteous way to which it
          is naturally inclined. "My people, says God, are bent to backsliding
          from me; though they called them to the Most High, none at all would
          exalt him." Man since he first broke over the hedge of the law, cannot
          be kept within it, but by restraining or sanctifying grace. In both
          these truth is the great instrument, being that which is accommodated
          to the restraining of rational creatures. It is the bridle by which
          men, like horses and mules, must be kept in. Take it off, and men "Are
          as the wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snufs up the wind at
          her pleasure, in her occasion who can turn her away?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Satan strives against the truth, and to advance ungodliness and
          unrighteousness. For truth is a stop to the advancement of his
          kingdom, whereas ungodliness and unrighteousness are the very pillars
          of it. So getting the stop removed, he urges men with ease to ungodly
          and unrighteous lives. "You are, said our Lord to the Jews, of your
          father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do: he was a
          murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there
          is no truth in him." When he first brought in the flood of ungodliness
          on the world, he first attacked the truth; "You shall not, said he,
          surely die;" and when once he had gained that point, he carried all
          before him. The woman did eat, and gave also to her husband and he did
          eat with her. So to this day unbelief is the ruin of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Men do not lay bands on the truth or resist it, but that they may
          get loose reins to their lusts. "Let us, say they, break their bands
          asunder, and cast away their cords from us." They can have no quarrel
          with it, but that which the owl has with the sun, that it gives light,
          and they love darkness and the works of darkness, therefore they hate
          the light. Were the hearts of men reconciled to their duty, and
          devorced from their lusts, they would as willingly hearken to the
          truth, as a man that wishes to keep his way would listen to a
          director, who would conduct him safely past every danger.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 1st, See what is the spring and cause of all the ungodliness, and
          unrighteousness, and wickedness, which abound in the land, and in the
          congregation this day. It is the imprisoning of truth, men going in
          direct opposition to the Word of God, and their own consciences. The
          contempt of the gospel, and not obeying it, leaves the sluice of
          profanity open, fills churches, nations, and congregations with
          scandalous practices. "What could have been done more to my vineyard,
          that I have not done to it? Wherefore when I looked that it should
          bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Whoever they are, who have any hand in rendering the gospel
          unsuccessful, are so far chargeable with the ungodliness and
          unrighteousness that follow thereupon. And this will conclude all
          guilty of the wickedness of the generation, for, alas! on all hands,
          and among all parties, the success of the gospel is little regarded.
          Many stumbling-blocks are laid by the preachers of it, long have many
          people striven to make them contemptible; the weighty concern of the
          gospel, doing good to souls has been sacrificed to party zeal, humor
          and interest. So that it is like to be a fearful reckoning, God will
          have with pastors and people, with all the different parties among us,
          when God rises to visit for the unkind treatment, the gospel has
          received from all hands, as to the success of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. If there were no more evil in bearing down the truth and marring
          its efficacy, instead of promoting it in our several stations, it is
          bad policy. How many complaints are there in families, that masters,
          servants, husbands, wives, are most undutiful to their relatives,
          which occasions much uncomfortable living in families. How many
          complaints among neighbors, that people cannot trust one another, that
          so many stand not to wrong their neighbors, take the bread out of
          their mouths, bite and devour one another? What is the fountain of all
          this disorder? Alas it is a thing that is but little laid to heart.
          The truth has not its effect among us, and none, or next to none are
          concerned to promote it. Alas! Sirs, do you expect that they will
          regard man, who will have no regard to God? Do you expect that
          righteousness and dutifulness will be brought into your families and
          neighborhoods, where there are no pains taken to bring people to obey
          the truth and fear the Lord?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The way to obtain reformation much needed, is that every one in
          their several capacities, strive that the truth may have free course,
          the gospel may have its effect. Let no man think that this belongs to
          ministers only; no, but as when a house is on fire, every man is to
          help, so here. It is common duty and interest too. Beware of speaking
          or doing anything by which the success of the gospel may be marred,
          lest souls perish thereby and their blood be charged on those who lay
          the stumbling-block before them. Do everything in your power for the
          furtherance of the gospel. Were this point more considered, men would
          be very sure that God's command in his word, made separation a duty
          before they dared to venture upon it; because otherwise all the
          ruining consequences of it to many poor souls, thereby taught to
          despise ministers and ordinances by them administered, lie at their
          door who make the separation not made a necessary duty by God's own
          command in his word. I have with a bleeding heart often seen and felt
          the consequences of such separation, and have always been of the mind
          that our divisions here, are one of the great causes of the little
          success of the gospel among us; marring the effect both of doctrine
          and discipline upon poor souls. And therefore no marvel one have a
          horror of it, until God's own word bind it on their conscience.
          Professors may very well plead with their mother to put away her
          whoredom; and if she deny them the privileges of the family, unless
          they will play the whore also, or drive them out of her house, they
          may justly leave her. But while she does neither of these, but only
          requires them to join with her in uncontroverted duty to her husband,
          and managing the lawful affairs of the family; they cannot leave her
          without breach of duty and without condemning the generation of the
          righteous, following this method in the Old and New Testament. And let
          one's own conscience judge, whether staying in her house and pleading
          with her in this manner, or leaving her for altogether, be the most
          proper means to reclaim her from her whorish practices?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. See why truth in the gospel or in men's consciences once overborne
          and oppressed is so difficult to rise again. Ungodliness and
          unrighteousness break loose, and the sluice once opened is difficult
          to stop. The hard heart grows harder. The last state of that man is
          worse than the first. No person's case is more hopeless than that of
          apostates, the returning devil brings with him seven spirits worse
          than himself, 2 Peter 2:20–22. How many have sometimes had
          convictions, touches from the word into the innermost parts of their
          souls, from whom God is gone and answers them no more. And the more
          they had of these, they are now the harder to work upon.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. In what a sad case are these from whom the gospel is taken, or
          truths profitable for them kept up, or their consciences seared that
          truth cannot enter. In these cases ungodliness and unrighteousness get
          loose. When the gospel goes, God goes. Yes, woe also to them, says
          God, when I depart from them. So far as profitable truth is withheld,
          men's souls are starved and betrayed into snares, and the hands of
          their enemies. And the seared conscience must needs make a sinful
          life, when the eyes are put out the whole body must be full of
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, As ever you would have the current of ungodliness and
          unrighteousness stopped, labor you that truth may have a free course.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What can we do to the stopping of the dreadful current?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Walk in the truth yourselves. "I rejoiced greatly, said John, that
          I found of your children walking in the truth, as we have received
          commandment from the Father." Be you doers of the truth. Study to know
          it, and what you know practice. This will not only tend to the good of
          your own souls, but to the good of others, to direct them in their
          way. "Thus you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God, without
          rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you
          shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life;" and if
          men will not be taught by such conduct it will turn to a testimony
          against them. Thus Noah by his righteous conduct condemned the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Support the interest of truth in others. Do everything for the
          truth. Do all you can to promote the truth in others, because it is
          the sovereign remedy for healing sinners. The nails driven, in the
          preaching of the word, do you endeavor to rivet in any, as you have
          access to them. Labor to remove men's prejudices against the gospel
          and the way of holiness. Exert yourselves to carry on convictions of
          sin and duty, where they appear to be begun. Let your communications
          be to the use of edifying, and by these means you may be instrumental
          in stopping the current of unrighteousness and ungodliness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Consider the case of the day needs it. It is a day of
          abounding sin. "See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but
          as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil." It is a day
          in which our Savior's prediction is accomplished. "And because
          iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." All ranks of
          men have corrupted their ways, and every one is adding to his coal to
          the fire of wrath. A general corruption of manners overflows, atheism,
          irreligion, profanity and formality, and by these God is dishonored,
          our holy religion is blasphemed, and the glorious gospel is despised.
          It is also a day of approaching wrath. "Shall I not visit for these
          things, says the Lord; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a
          nation as this?" We have met with many deliverances. God has been
          saying, "How shall I give you up Ephraim? How shall I deliver you
          Israel? How shall I make you as Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim?
          My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together." But
          all this prevails not to make the generation one whit better; but we
          rather grow worse; and therefore God's voice may be to us, "You have
          forsaken me, says the Lord, you are gone backward, therefore will I
          stretch out my hand against you, and destroy you, I am weary with
          repenting." God has many arrows in his quiver. But whomever of them he
          use, there is no appearance that this generation can escape a rousing
          stroke.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 2. It will always be well with those who take part with truth
          and holiness, setting themselves against the flood of sin in an
          ungodly and unrighteous generation. "Say you to the righteous, that it
          shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If you do prevail in any measure to stop the flood of sin, so far as
          you do prevail, you bring honor to God, who is dishonored by ungodly
          and unrighteous practices. "Let your light so shine before men, that
          they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in
          Heaven." You also bring safety to perishing souls, and oh! what should
          not one do to save a soul from death. "Let him know that he which
          converts the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from
          death, and shall hide a multitude of sins." You also strengthen the
          cause of religion by making friends to it, and weaken Satan's kingdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But though you should not prevail, yet you give your testimony for
          God. "They that forsake the law praise the wicked; but such as keep
          the law contend with them." And you deliver your own souls from the
          guilt of the common conspiracy. You take the best way for safety in
          the evil day. "And the Lord said to him, go through the midst of the
          city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the forehead
          of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be
          done in the midst thereof." So that you shall either be delivered from
          trouble or in trouble.

          Doctrine III. and last. God's wrath is revealed against all
          ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who have the truth, but truth
          has not its effect upon them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This is not the sound of God's fearful trumpet of the law, against all
          who obey not the gospel by believing and repenting; and we are obliged
          to sound it, as well as the trumpet of the gospel. The gospel damns no
          man; it needs not, for if it save them not, the law will ruin them
          eternally, and that as law-breakers and despisers of the gospel. "Do
          not think, said Jesus to the Jews, that I will accuse you to the
          Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">From this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">

        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. Some pieces of gross ungodliness.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Blasphemy, denying God, or speaking reproachfully of God, or of any
          of the persons of the ever blessed Trinity. Such monsters this land of
          light has produced; for men disregarding known truth, grow worse than
          those to whom it is not revealed. And Satan rages the more that the
          light combats his kingdom. God's wrath is revealed against this sin.
          In the Old Testament it was death by the law of God. "Whoever curses
          his God shall bear his sin. And he who blasphemes the name of the
          Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall
          certainly stone him; as well the stranger as he who is born in the
          land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, he shall be put to
          death. In the New Testament we have blasphemers delivered unto Satan
          for their crime. "Whom, says Paul, I have delivered unto Satan, that
          they may learn not to blaspheme."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Idolatry and religious imagery. Papists profane our land. And I
          wish I could say they only did it. But there is a piece of horrible
          abomination crept into this land, the rudiments of popery, from our
          neighbors of the rotten church of England. Images or pictures of our
          glorious Lord Jesus Christ, some representing him, hanging on the
          cross, some ascending into Heaven. Strings of beads wrought before in
          the form of a cross, lime vessels with I. H. S. in the bottom. And I
          doubt not there are many other of that sort, which I have never seen.
          But to the best of my observation, this deluge broke in upon us from
          that quarter in the four last years of Queen Anne's reign; without
          doubt to prepare the nation insensibly for the popish Pretender and
          popery. I would gladly hope there are none of them among you? But why
          should I say that, for, to the best of my remembrance, it was in
          Presbyterian houses that I observed any of them. There is likewise in
          some Bibles the picture of God represented by the sun and the name
          Jehovah in Hebrew letters in the midst of it. I warn you from God,
          that all pictures of God or any person of the holy Trinity is an
          abomination; and if you have any of these things, that you deface or
          destroy them; and if you see them any where that you testify your
          abhorrence of them, as blasphemous against God, for the information of
          misled people, and as you would not partake of their sin. God's wrath
          is revealed against this in the second commandment. See also Romans
          1:23, 24.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Cursing and swearing profanely. Wrath is revealed against this in
          the third commandment. Some men curse and swear in cold blood. Others,
          when the devil has blown up their passions, they will open their mouth
          as if Hell were opening. What a wonder of patience is it, that God
          makes not the swearer's tongue to fall on himself, let loose the devil
          to take them away visibly that call on him so; that he strike not the
          worms dead on the spot that profane his sacred name. We cannot get
          this reformed among you, but it abounds among us, and some have the
          impudence to cry out against ministers taking the oath imposed by the
          law upon them, under the pain of all that they have in the world; and
          yet themselves will curse and swear, when no one bids them, but the
          same law of the land forbids them under a penalty. Some will be
          praying one while and cursing another. As I have often, so I now warn
          you that the wrath of God is revealed against profane cursing and
          swearing. And I here protest against all the cursers and swearers in
          this perish present or absent, and call the timber and stones of this
          house to witness, that God's wrath shall pursue them for evermore for
          it, if they do not repent, Deuteronomy 28:58, 59.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Sabbath-breaking and profane neglect of God's worship. This is a
          crying sin in our day, bringing wrath on the land. Application has
          been made to get the fairs and markets in the country altered, which
          occasion the Sabbath to be profaned by traveling and driving cattle to
          them on the Lord's day, but without success. It is profaned by many,
          who loiter away Sabbaths at home, as if the public exercise of God's
          worship was no part of Sabbath sanctification. How they are employed
          at home their own consciences can tell. But some there are whom
          nothing hinders, but a profane contempt and neglect of God's
          ordinances; that all the sermons which they hear from the end of the
          year to the other may be soon told. Some come to the church, whose
          behavior at it looks neither like grace nor good manners, doing
          several highly improper and offensive things even in the time of
          worship. Wrath is revealed against these. "Did not your fathers thus,
          said Nehemiah, and did not our God bring all this upon us, and upon
          this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
          Sabbath."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Some pieces of gross unrighteousness.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Disobedience to parents, refractoriness and rebellion against them.
          This is a piece of gross unrighteousness, for what human authority is
          more sacred than that of a parent, which some nevertheless trample on,
          and prove a grief of heart instead of a comfort to their parents. And
          this in some monsters of mankind has proceeded to cursing or beating
          of father or mother, and in some to the murdering of them. God's wrath
          is revealed against this in the fifth commandment. It is also
          declared, "That the eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey
          his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young
          eagles shall eat it. For every one that curses his father or his
          mother, shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his
          mother; his blood shall be upon him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Drunkenness that loathsome sin. This puts a man on a level with the
          beasts, destroys the soul, murders the body, darkens the mind, breaks
          a person's health, and ruins their substance. A sin prevailing among
          us beyond what we could believe; where there is fuel for the lust in
          so many houses, that by their number must be for luxury, not
          necessity. And love to, and abuse of, the fiery liquor in this place,
          which God nor nature never ordained for common drinking, will bring
          many to the place where your will not get a drop of cold water to cool
          their tongue, if they repent not. God's wrath is revealed against this
          sin. "Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength
          to mingle strong drink. Drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of
          God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Impurity, of which we seldom want sad instances, which fill our
          hands with many sad processes, besides others that are easily
          discovered. The causes of this sin abounding so much in the place, I
          reckon to be your fullness of bread and the solitariness of the place,
          and I think I may add a certain garb peculiar to the country, which I
          am sure in some places would not be reckoned a modest one. But let men
          and women know that God's wrath is revealed against this sin.
          "Whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge. For this we know, that
          no whoremonger, nor unclean person, has any inheritance in the kingdom
          of Christ and of God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Dishonesty; want of common honesty in dealings with men, cheating
          and stealing. God has established property among men, and forbidden
          all manner of injustice in that command, You shall not steal, and
          requires justice to reign among them. But alas how many are there, who
          are void of common honesty, stand not on cheating in their bargains,
          are unfaithful in what is committed to their trust, and can put out
          their hand to their neighbor's goods, if they can but carry their
          point without being discovered. Many have lost their credit in this
          way, brought themselves to disgrace and public punishment; and some
          from less to more have brought themselves to the gibbet. God's wrath
          is revealed against this. The unrighteous and thieves are excluded
          from the kingdom of God. What is brought in that way, if not worth
          twopence brings a curse with it. "I will bring it forth, says the Lord
          of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the
          house of him that swears falsely by my name, and it shall remain in
          the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof,
          and the stones thereof." And moreover, you must be ready to restore if
          in your power; else there is no pardon. Idleness and an unmortified
          lust are the inlets to this sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Lying, a common sin, which many commit freely. There is a
          certain baseness in this sin, beyond many others, so that liars
          themselves cannot endure to be called so. And no wonder, for the
          liar's credit is gone as soon as he is discovered, and there is no
          trusting him when he speaks truth not otherwise known. It is a part of
          the old man. "Hence, says the apostle, lie not one to another, seeing
          that you have put off the old man with his deeds." It is the natural
          product of the unrenewed heart. "The wicked are estranged from the
          womb, they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." But
          grace no sooner enters but it banishes it. "For he said, surely they
          are my people, children that will not lie; so he was their Savior."
          The devil was the first liar, and it was a lie that ruined the world.
          God has a particular hatred of it. "A lying tongue is an abomination
          to him." His wrath is revealed against it. "He will destroy them that
          speak leasing. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who
          speaks lies shall not escape." They are barred out of Heaven by name.
          "For there shall in no wise enter into it, anything that makes a lie."
          Their lodging is appointed with the devil in the lake which burns with
          fire and brimstone, in which all liars shall have their part. We are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To point out some mother sins and the wrath revealed against them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Unbelief, not believing the gospel, nor falling in with the grand
          device of salvation, through Jesus Christ, not closing with Christ in
          the gospel offer, nor making use of him for the great ends for which
          the Father has given him. This is lightly looked at, but is the great
          cause of ruin under the gospel, John 3:19. It is the mother sin to all
          others. Wrath against it is revealed in the most express manner. He
          who believes not shall be damned. And there is no escaping for them
          who neglect the great salvation. For it is sinning against the remedy,
          despising the love of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Gross ignorance of the principles of religion. It also is a mother
          sin; one may lead the blind what way he pleases; so may Satan, an evil
          world, and an evil heart, lead an ignorant person. Ignorance keeps one
          from believing, for they know not to believe from repenting, for they
          know not what to repent of. It muffles them up in darkness, and will
          land them in eternal darkness. Wrath is revealed against it, though
          many look on it as a shelter from wrath. "My people, says God, are
          destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge,
          I will also reject you." Behold how Christ comes, "in flaming fire
          taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
          gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with
          everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
          glory of his power."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Pride and self-conceit, another mother sin. It is the great
          deceiver. The pride of your heart has deceived you. It carries men
          into a thousand snares. It exalts them against the God that made them,
          and causes them break over all bounds. Who is the Lord, said Pharaoh,
          that I should obey him? They will not submit to word nor providences.
          It exalts them against men, they will not be advised nor taught; nay,
          they trample upon others, to raise up themselves. It hides a man from
          himself, blinds him to his sin and to his duty, Revelation 3:17. So is
          the highway to destruction. Wrath is revealed against it. As it makes
          one most unlike the lowly Jesus, it makes him like the devil, and
          leads the way to damnation. "Not a novice, lest being lifted up with
          pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil." God is the proud
          man's enemy. "God resists the proud. A man's pride shall bring him
          low."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Spiritual slothfulness. This is a devouring deep, in which many
          good motions, convictions, and purposes are swallowed up and utterly
          lost. It is a waster and destroyer of the life and health of the soul.
          It is a disposition of heart which renders a man adverse to good,
          prone to evil, and lays him open to Satan's snares. To this a man owes
          the neglect of his duty to God and to his own soul; his soul's case
          going all to wreck. "By much slothfulness the building decays; and
          through idleness of the hands, the house drop through." It is from
          this that there comes one off-put after another to repentance and
          reformation until the time be gone. Wrath is revealed against it, "Yet
          a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
          sleep; so shall your poverty come as one that travels, and your want
          as an armed man." Now is the seed time for eternity, to sleep now will
          make a bad harvest. "The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;
          therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing." See the doom of
          the sluggard and his sin, Matthew 25:26–30.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Inordinate love of the world. "Love not the world, neither the
          things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
          the Father is not in him." This is a corrupt spring which has several
          streams. "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
          lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is
          of the world." And the main stream is not the same in all. Some pursue
          the profits; others the lust of the eye; some the pleasures of it, the
          lust of the flesh; others the vain promp of it, the pride of life.
          Some roll themselves in the bosom of a fawning world; others court a
          frowning world, for its smiles as their chief good. In a word, the
          clay idol, in its several shapes, has many votaries who put it in the
          room of God. This is a mother evil, which turns the world upside down,
          and fills it with all manner of wickedness, done to gratify this
          master lust. "But they that will be rich fall into temptation, and a
          snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
          destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all
          evil; which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith,
          and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." But wrath is
          revealed against this sin. Paul declares repeatedly, "That for these
          things' sake the wrath of God comes upon the children of
          disobedience." See also, James 5:1–6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Slighting the means of grace, public, private, or secret. This is a
          mother sin too. When the wells of salvation are opened among a people,
          but they have no appetite to drink of them. Then is a price put into
          their hands to get wisdom, but they have no heart to it. This shows
          itself in the neglect of public ordinances, family and secret duties,
          or not improving of them. Wrath is revealed against this. Men may
          blind their own consciences with silly shifts and excuses, but these
          will not pass with God, Luke 14:16–24. Yes, such conduct will
          aggravate their condemnation. They had the opportunity but slighted
          it. These slighters will themselves be the losers, and find it so in
          the end. "He who sins against me, says Jesus, wrongs his own soul; all
          they that hate me love death."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Neglect of relative duties. These are the bands of society,
          which, when they are disregarded, all goes loose and into disorder.
          Families are the nurseries both of church and state. When the members
          of families do not regard, especially their spiritual duty to one
          another, parents to educate their children for God, to concern
          themselves for the welfare of the souls of their servants; and they
          again to be dutiful to them and watch over one another, it is the
          opening of a sluice of sin. Wrath is revealed against it. "Shall I not
          visit them for these things? Says the Lord; shall not my soul be
          avenged on such a nation as this." Micah 7:4–8. It remains,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To point out some distinctions and kinds of sin in general, and
          the wrath which is revealed against them. God's wrath is revealed
          against all kinds of sin, particularly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Against open sins, of one's life, lip, heart, and nature. Men's
          life-sins, their sinful deeds and actions. Let no man think that he
          may live as he pleases, and do as he will; for God remembers all our
          deeds, and men shall be judged according to their works, and a sinful
          life will make a sad reckoning: "For we must all appear before the
          judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in
          his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Against lip sins, the sins of the tongue. God made the tongue man's
          glory, but men have turned it to the dishonor of God: so that it is a
          world of iniquity. An unruly tongue rages against God and against man;
          and thinks little of words. They are but wind say some. But they are
          wind that will blow men to Hell. "But I say unto you, said Jesus, that
          every idle word that men shall speak, they shall account thereof in
          the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by
          your words you shall be condemned."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This wrath is revealed also against heart sins. "The heart is
          deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it? I
          the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give to every man
          according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings." The
          heart is hidden from men but God sees it clearly and all that lodges
          in it, or passes through it, and has bound men to heart holiness, as
          well as life holiness. And wrath is not more dreadfully revealed
          against any sins than heart sins. "And it come to pass, when he hears
          the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I
          shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to
          add drunkenness to thirst: The Lord will not spare him; but then the
          anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and
          all the curses that are written in this book shall be upon him, and
          the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Against the sin of man's nature, that corrupt bias of the heart which
          we bring into the world with us, containing in it an aversion to good
          and bent to evil; and a perversion of all the faculties of the soul.
          This was one of the causes of the deluge. "And God saw that the
          wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
          of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it
          repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved
          him at his heart." Accordingly infants as well as others were swept
          away with the deluge. Men think little of this, but it will ruin men
          forever, if it be not healed by regenerating grace. For except a man
          be born again, said our Lord, he cannot see the kingdom of God. God's
          holy nature can so little endure our depravity, that he will pursue it
          with eternal wrath, as what is most contrary to his holy nature. "And
          there shall in no wise enter into the heavenly Jerusalem, anything
          that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God's wrath is revealed against sins of commission and omission.
          Against sins of commission. God's law is the hedge which he has set
          about men to keep them in, and it is fenced with wrath revealed
          against those who shall venture to break over it. Whoever breaks this
          hedge, a serpent shall bite him. The sword of justice stands on the
          other side to pierce those who dare to commit what God has forbidden,
          for they are worthy of death, Romans 1:32. Also against sins of
          omission. God's wrath is not only revealed against men's doing what he
          has forbidden, but also against their not doing what he has commanded.
          And so many omissions of duty, we are guilty of so many sins exposing
          us to wrath. It is a sad thing that men should look so lightly on
          omission, seeing the great damning sin is of this kind. He who
          believes not shall be damned. And in the great day, sins of omission
          shall be brought forward to the condemnation of many, Matthew
          25:41–46. And the curse of the law runs directly against them. "For it
          is written, cursed is every one that continues not in all things
          written in the book of the law to do them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Against open and secret sins. Against open sins, whereby God is
          provoked and others stumbled and scandalized. "The show of their
          countenance does witness against them; and they declare their sin as
          Sodom, they hide it not; woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded
          evil unto themselves." Impudence in sin by which men bring forth their
          works of darkness before the sun, is no small aggravation of it and
          will also aggravate the punishment. "Were they ashamed when they had
          committed abomination? Nay they were not at all ashamed, neither they
          blush; therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of
          their visitation they shall be cast down, says the Lord." And the
          scandal given by open sin goes deep, Matthew 18:7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Against secret sins. "You have set our iniquities before you, our
          secret sins in the light of your countenance. For all our days are
          spent away in your wrath." Secret sinning is a daring or despising of
          the all-seeing eye, and therefore God watches to discover them to the
          world. "Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
          showed before the congregation." Secrecy is a great temptation to sin,
          but the godly will be afraid of secret as well as of open sin. Cleanse
          me, says David, from secret faults. They know that there is nothing
          hidden that shall not be revealed, or secret that shall not be made
          known, and that God will bring every secret thing into judgment. Sin
          is like the ointment of the right hand, it will discover itself. And
          be sure your sin will find you out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. God's wrath is revealed against personal sins and relative sins.
          Against personal sins, such as affect ourselves only in their own
          nature. The gospel requires personal holiness. It teaches us to live
          soberly. And wrath is revealed against, and shall be inflicted upon
          all who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though one lived
          alone altogether by himself, his duty to God, and his own soul must be
          performed, otherwise he incurs God's anger.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Against relative sins, the sins of the several relations in which we
          stand. In whatever relation we are placed, whether in the church,
          state, or family, God has prescribed us our duty, wherein we are to
          walk in these relations; and we cannot be unfaithful or negligent in
          them, but we expose ourselves to the anger of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Against the sin of the particular bias of our nature, as well as
          these of the general bias of it. "If your right eye offend you, pluck
          it out and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of
          your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be
          cast into Hell." The sin that by reason of our natural temper,
          constitution, manner of life, does most easily beset us, though we are
          apt to indulge ourselves in it, God will not, but it will bring us to
          ruin, if we hold not off from that as well as from others. I was also
          upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, God's wrath is revealed against all sin, great or small. The
          sins of every size, customary or not customary, signal miscarriages or
          more ordinary sinning. "For as many as are of the works of the law are
          under the curse: for it is written, cursed is every one that continues
          not in all things written in the book of the law to do them." We now
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To consider the wrath of God revealed against this ungodliness,
          and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
          Here we shall first show what this wrath is; and secondly, take notice
          of the properties of this wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. What is God's wrath? Wrath in men is the passion of anger risen to
          a height; but since there are no passions in God, wrath is not
          ascribed to God in respect of the affection, but of the will and
          effects. There are three things then in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The highest aversion to ungodliness and unrighteousness. "You Lord are
          of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity." They
          are most contrary to his holy nature, so that he cannot endure the
          sight of them. "The foolish shall not stand in your sight, you hate
          all workers of iniquity." He has (so to speak) a natural antipathy
          against them, such a strong aversion to them, that it is impossible he
          should ever lay aside his utmost abhorrence of them, or cease to hate
          them and be angry at them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It implies, secondly, A constant will to punish them as crimes against
          his honor. By the righteousness of his nature he has this will. "It is
          a righteous thing with God, says Paul, to recompense tribulation to
          them that trouble his people." So that these sins can never be
          forgiven, but on a valuable satisfaction, by which the due wrath and
          punishment not laid upon the guilty, is yet laid fully upon the
          Cautioner, who stands in their stead. And where there is no cautioner,
          there it falls on the head of the guilty. "And he shall bring upon
          them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own
          wickedness; yes, the Lord our God shall cut them off."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It implies, thirdly, Actual resentment of them in the effects of
          wrath. "Therefore says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty one of
          Israel, Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine
          enemies." This is called pouring out of wrath, by which the heavens,
          black above the heads of the ungodly and unrighteous, do disburden
          themselves upon them in showers. "For great, said Josiah the king, is
          the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, because our fathers
          have not kept the word of the Lord." And as no man can count the drops
          of a shower, so the direful effects of the wrath of God, on the body
          and soul are innumerable. "Who knows the power of your anger? Even
          according to your fear, so is your wrath." It is not only as showers
          of water, but of fire. "Who, says the prophet Nahum, Who can stand
          before his indignation, and who can abide in the fierceness of his
          anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down
          by him." And there is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The small rain of wrath, that falls on the ungodly and unrighteous on
          earth. "God, says Zophar, shall cast the fury of his wrath upon the
          wicked, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating." This is a rain
          that never ceases, sometimes it is greater, sometimes less; but it is
          never quite fair, any day that dawns to the ungodly. For God is angry
          with the wicked every day. Sometimes indeed the sun of outward
          prosperity shines on him, but even while it is shining, it is raining
          on him also. Drops of wrath are silently sinking into his soul, his
          body, his every enjoyment. The prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
          The least stroke he meets with is a drop of wrath. But besides these
          drops,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is also the great rain of his strength, that falls upon them in
          Hell. In this life there are thunder claps of wrath from the word, in
          the threatenings, and the shower falls; but for the most part sinners
          are deaf to the thunder, and shift for themselves under the rain. But
          at the great day, the great thunder clap is given from the throne.
          "Then the Judge shall say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me
          you cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
          angels." And then the fountains of the great deep, and the windows of
          Heaven are opened, and the full shower comes which makes an eternal
          deluge; for it will rain forever, without one clear blink through the
          ages of eternity. "Upon the wicked God shall rain, snares, fire and
          brimstone; and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their
          cup."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We find this shower represented under the notion of a shower of hail,
          Revelation 16:21. Every stone about the weight of a talent, a
          prodigious size; and then it will pierce them to the soul, and fill
          them with despair under which they will rage and despair evermore.
          This is that rain which is in the cloud of the threatening against the
          ungodly and unrighteous, which gathered together and began to fall
          when Adam fell from God; and which rained down in such abundance, as
          made the way between Heaven and earth unpassable. But with respect to
          believers, it is over, having fallen out on Christ their surety. With
          them the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. Nevertheless with
          respect to men who hold the truth in unrighteousness, it continues in
          its full force. This is that wrath of God which is revealed against
          all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men. Let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Take notice of the properties of this wrath of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is most mighty wrath. "Who knows the power of your anger? Even
          according to your fear, so is your wrath." There is no standing before
          it. Who may stand in your sight when once you are angry? It comes on
          like a deluge of waters, overflows and sweeps all away before it. The
          hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies. It burns as a fire and
          devours all before it as the flame does the dry stubble. "Men perish
          from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little." Worm man cannot
          resist it, cannot make head against it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is unsupportable. What men cannot resist, they will set
          themselves to bear. But wrath strikes the criminal in a most tender
          part, where a wound produces intolerable pain. A wounded spirit who
          can bear? Wrath is a sinking load on the soul, quite beyond the power
          of the creature to comport with. "Who among us shall dwell with
          devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings."
          Therefore there is no rest under the load, Revelation 14:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is most penetrating and piercing wrath, a seeking thing like
          water or oil. "As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his
          garments, so let it come into his affections like water, and like oil
          into his bones." Men's wrath may reach flesh, blood, and bones, but
          can go no further; there is a precious part within which it cannot
          reach. But God's wrath pierces into the whole man and every part. "God
          is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell." It sinks into the soul
          and conscience. "The arrows of the Almighty, says Job, are within me,
          the poison whereof drinks up my spirit; the terrors of God do set
          themselves in array against me." As with some struck with thunder, not
          a wound in their skin, yet the bones are crushed, or grinded, and the
          life is gone; so a person's external comforts standing entire about
          him, his soul may be melted within him, as in Belshazzar's case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is most vehement and exquisitely tormenting. By the hand of
          wrath, sinners falling under it shall be torn in pieces. Now consider
          this, you that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be
          none to deliver. It is a fearful story, 2 Kings 2:23. But the united
          force of lions, leopards, and bears, is little enough to represent,
          what tearing an angry God makes on the ungodly, Hosea 13:7, 8. By the
          millstone of wrath they will be grinded to powder, Luke 20:18. By the
          fire of wrath they will be burned and scorched. For God is a consuming
          fire. No pain more exquisite than what is caused by burning, and no
          fire burns so keenly as the fire of God's wrath. "The pile of Tophet
          is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of
          brimstone, does kindle it."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. It is wrath treasured up. "The wicked treasure up to themselves
          wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
          judgment of God." This speaks a fullness of wrath. The clouds of wrath
          are full and ready to burst, to empty themselves on impenitent
          sinners. A variety of it. The wrath of God is a teeming womb of all
          miseries on the ungodly, Deuteronomy 32:23–26. All the mischiefs that
          can befall a creature, are in this treasure, and all shall be gathered
          together and cast into the lake with the generation of his wrath. And
          whoever are not found written in the book of life, shall be cast into
          the lake of fire. It speaks also the reserving of it for them. They
          are reserved for it as fuel for the fire. God reserves the unjust unto
          the day of judgment to be punished. And it is reserved for them. "The
          Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries and he reserves wrath for
          his enemies." And this will be brought on them in due time, When the
          day of the Lord's anger comes upon them. Hence frequently compared to
          travailing pangs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. It is continuing wrath without intermission. The worst season has
          readily some intermission, some fair blinks, but God's wrath is an
          abiding cloud on the objects of it. The wrath of God abides on them.
          The curse abides in the house, Zechariah 5:4. Men are born children of
          wrath, and if they be not born again, it lies on them from the cradle
          to the grave. It leaves them not at death, but goes with them to the
          other world. The wicked is driven away in his wickedness. And the full
          shower comes on at last, when they are plunged into everlasting
          burning.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. It is eternal wrath. "They shall be punished with everlasting
          destruction from the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his
          power." It will lie on the sinner through all the ages of eternity.
          The bands of death will be loosed, and the grave will cast out the
          dead criminal, and though he cry to the hills and rocks to cover him,
          they will not hear; because he must live to the end he may be ever
          dying. The wrath of mortals, death will extinguish if nothing else
          can; but the wrath of the eternal God is a worm that never dies, and
          is a fire never quenched. And God's wrath will ever be the wrath to
          come.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. It is unavoidable to such as continue in their ungodly and
          unrighteous state and courses. "He who being often reproved, hardens
          his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy." What
          way is it possible for them to avoid it? They may fancy that time will
          wear it out, and a provoked God will forget the affronts. But in vain.
          "The Lord has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, surely I will never
          forget any of their works." Fair words will never appease this wrath.
          "Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin." They cannot
          outwit him who is omniscient; nor outbrave the omnipotent; nor flee
          from the presence of the omnipresent God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, After all, it is most just, a clear fire without smoke. Is God
          unrighteous who takes vengeance? The sea of wrath raging against the
          sinner, remains clear as crystal. No transport of fury to carry him to
          excess, is consistent with his nature. The offence is against an
          infinite God, and must be infinitely punished. It remains,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To show how this wrath is revealed against the ungodliness, and
          unrighteousness of men. It is revealed three ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In the word. Therein God has declared his anger against all such.
          And one jot or tittle cannot pass away without being fulfilled. The
          Bible is a standing witness against the ungodliness, and
          unrighteousness of men, a solemn warning piece to all. And the
          preaching of the word reveals it also. The Lord's messengers are sent
          to warn sinners of that wrath. They are to say, "Woe unto the wicked!
          it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given
          him." And the warnings which men get in this way will aggravate their
          condemnation. "Woe unto you, Chorazin! woe unto you, Bethsaida! for if
          the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and
          Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In providences. God has not left himself without a witness, in his
          works, as well as in his word. It is revealed to us, in the wrath
          which falls on others. Look into the records of providence, in all
          ages, the deluge, the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah, etc. Observe what
          has fallen out in our day of this sort. It is a revelation of God's
          wrath, against the ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, and the
          language is, except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is revealed also in the wrath, which at any time has fallen on
          ourselves. When that prevails not to turn men from their ungodly, and
          unrighteous courses, it says, "Therefore will I do unto you, O Israel;
          and because I will do this unto you, prepare to meet your God, O
          Israel." Who are they in whose experience some threatenings of the
          word have not been accomplished, which may have made them say, "As I
          have done, so God has requited me. Truly he is a God that judges in
          the earth." If therefore we repent not, these are pledges of the full
          shower of wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, in men's own consciences; "Who knowing the judgment of God,
          that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do
          the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." Ungodliness and
          unrighteousness, in those who have the truth, leaves a sting in their
          consciences behind it. Conscience is a domestic preacher to them, who
          lays before them the commands and threatenings with which they are
          fenced, and so binds them over to answer it before the tribunal of
          God. And as long as there is a conscience within men's breast, that
          witnesses for God, that he is angry with men's ungodliness, and
          unrighteousness, they must needs acknowledge his wrath to be revealed
          against them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use. 1. Of information.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. God is well pleased with those who obeying the truth, live godly
          and righteous lives. "He has showed you, O man, what is good, and what
          does the Lord require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
          to walk humbly with your God." God's word and their own conscience
          favor them, and the providence of God too, causing all things work
          together for their good. When they look without them into the word
          they find God's approbation of their way: when they look within them
          to their own conscience, they have its testimony in their favor; or
          about them in providence, they will see all for their real welfare.
          "Moreover by them, God's statutes, is your servant warned, and in
          keeping of them there is great reward."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The pleasure of ungodliness and gain of unrighteousness, are dear
          bought. It may be sweet in the mouth, but it will be bitter in the
          belly. "Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts, that the people shall
          labor in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very
          vanity." Did men consider the black cloud that hovers over their ways
          of ungodliness, and unrighteousness continually, they would be afraid
          to venture on them. For whatever case is found in them for the
          present, it exposes the soul to everlasting disquiet, and where a
          penny is gained, a talent is lost. "For what is a man profited, if he
          shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man
          give in exchange for his soul."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, They are left without excuse who living under the gospel, obey
          it not, but lead still ungodly, and unrighteous lives. They cannot say
          they are not warned, they understand not the danger of that course:
          for it is revealed to them plainly, that God's wrath will overtake
          them in such courses. And if men will not let themselves believe it,
          then who can help it? If men will delude themselves, and sooth up
          themselves in their ungodly, and unrighteous courses fearful will be
          the taking off the veil and undeceiving them, Deuteronomy 29:19, 20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use 2. Of exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          As ever you would escape the wrath of God in time and eternity
          renounce all ungodliness and unrighteousness; and since you have the
          gospel, the truth, let it have its effect on you. For the wrath of God
          is revealed against all who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Consider, much less than the wrath of God falling in full
          measure on impenitent sinners, is very terrible, how much more that
          wrath. The wrath of a king is terrible. The wrath of a king is as
          messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. When the wrath of
          Ahasuerus was kindled against Haman, his ruin was secured. Kings have
          power in their hand to reward or punish; so their wrath is terrible to
          their fellow-creatures. But what is the wrath of a king to that of the
          King of kings? The very threatening of God's wrath is most awful.
          "When I heard this, says Habakkuk, my belly trembled: my lips quivered
          at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
          myself." The sight of the hand writing on the wall made Belshazzar
          tremble. God speaking in wrath to a sinner, is enough to damp the
          stoutest sinner. How much more the fulfilling of it. Even God's
          fatherly anger against his own children is very dreadful. The Lord's
          rod on his own is but the rod of a man, but yet how does Job cry out
          under it. "For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
          whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in
          array against me." How did it affect Asaph, Psalm 77 and Heman, Psalm
          88. What must it then be on his enemies. Finally, God's giving the law
          on mount Sinai was full of terror. See how it affected the people,
          Exodus 20:18, 19. Yes, so terrible was the sight, that Moses himself
          said, I exceedingly fear and quake What will it then be when he comes
          to avenge the transgressions of that law?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 2. Consider what a God he is whose wrath is revealed. He is
          most just. He is of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on
          iniquity. God must act contrary to his own nature, if sin go without
          wrath. This makes the destruction of the impenitent pleasing to God.
          For though God distributes sorrows, with sorrow (so to speak) to his
          own people; For in all their afflictions, he is afflicted, yet he is
          eased as it were, in making his enemies the resting place of his
          wrath. Ah, says he, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
          of mine enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          He is omniscient. Therefore an angry God knows all the affronts given,
          and cannot fail to devise and find out all means, by which his wrath
          may be executed to all possible satisfaction of his justice. He is
          omnipotent. There is nothing beyond the compass of his power. It must
          be fearful to fall into the hands of the living God. For he can hold
          up sinners with one hand through eternity, while the other shall lie
          heavy upon them. Finally, God is eternal. Men die, and their wrath
          with them; but he will be an everlasting enemy, and while he is, will
          pursue the quarrel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 3d and last. Consider the fearful instances of wrath, first of
          men. Many have been made monuments of the Lord's anger, in their
          sinful courses. Wrath has swept away multitudes together, who have
          fallen a sacrifice to God's anger. Wrath has fallen on men's infant
          relations, yes on the very place of their ungodliness, and
          unrighteousness. Adam sinned and wrath came upon him, and upon all
          his. It came upon the old world; upon Sodom and Gomorrah. Upon the
          rich man in Hell, when he could not find a drop of water to cool his
          tongue.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Upon fallen angels. They sinned and God made their case
          hopeless. No Mediator was provided for them. They were the first that
          ventured to break over the hedge, and God made them dreadful instances
          of his justice and severity. They believe and tremble.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It came upon the man Christ standing in the room of the elect.
          God spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. Wrath
          coming on him makes him sore amazed, fall on the ground and sweat
          great drops of blood. What is a deluge? What is the noise of a
          dissolving world, to God groaning and dying on a cross? Infinite
          wisdom and holiness did it, to make sin appear like itself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wherefore I warn you all and every one, to renounce ungodliness and
          unrighteousness and to allow truth to have its full effect; declaring
          that otherwise the wrath of God will pursue those who will not. Amen.
