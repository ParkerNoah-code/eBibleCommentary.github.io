    Luke 14:26, "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and 
    wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, 
    he cannot be my disciple."</p>
<p align="justify">He is a fool who joins himself to any society, before he 
    has weighed with himself how he can comply with the laws and rules of that 
    society. In vain do we propose to be a disciple to any person, if we are not 
    disposed, to submit to his discipline. Man is born like a wild ass's colt, 
    naturally intractable and unteachable; the Son of God has set up his school 
    among us; many who externally belong to it stand at a distance from him, as 
    rude and unpolished by grace as when they first came to it. There is a 
    solemn and awful entry into the school of Christ before us, and it cannot be 
    unsuitable, especially on such a season as this, to stand and hear, out of 
    the month of the great Master, the necessary qualifications of all such as 
    will be reckoned his disciples indeed. This we have in the text.—In which 
    there is observable,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A case supposed; and there are two things in it. For 
    this case, though the case of many, is like the legs of the lame, which are 
    not equal.—In it, first, there is a fair profession. The man comes to 
    Christ, not in the way of believing on him, as this word is often used, the 
    expression here can by no means be thus explained; but in the way of an 
    outward profession, joining himself with his followers, taking on him the 
    name of his party. The occasion of the words clears this. Multitudes went 
    with him, and they were ready to value themselves because they kept good 
    company. The Lord turns to them, and tells them, that it was another thing 
    to be a disciple of his than most of them took it to be. He lays the matter 
    so plainly before them, as would make it easy to conclude, that most who 
    followed him now would leave him afterwards; and that when it came to the 
    trying pinch, he would have but a thin backing; therefore they should in 
    time consider what they are doing.—In the case there is, next, a foul and 
    false heart. The man comes to Christ, and brings not his heart with him, but 
    leaves it at home with his father or mother, etc. or keeps it still hugging 
    and embracing his dear self, his life, so that he cannot embrace Christ, 
    more than a man can take both Heaven and earth in his arms at once. Christ 
    must be dearer to his disciples than what is dearest to them in the world. 
    The dearest persons are father, mother, etc. The dearest thing is life. That 
    which makes this case so bad is, that they are dearer to the man than 
    Christ. He hates not his father, mother, etc. He who taught us in the law, 
    to love our neighbor as ourselves, does not contradict this here, but speaks 
    out what was implied there, that we must neither love our neighbor nor 
    ourselves, as God. It is not an absolute, but a comparative hatred which is 
    here meant; that is, a less love: Genesis 29:31, "And when the Lord saw that 
    Leah was hated;" that is, less loved than Rachel. Similar instances occur, 
    as in Deuteronomy 21:15; John 12:25. And thus it is explained, Matthew 
    10:37, "He who loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me." A 
    man must leave father and mother to cleave to his wife; but he must leave 
    his wife, yes, and his life also, to cleave to Christ. Levi gave a practical 
    commentary on this text, Deuteronomy 33:9, "Who said unto his father, and to 
    his mother, I have not seen, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor 
    knew his own children; for they observed your word, and kept your covenant." 
    And so did that disciple-like resolution of Jerome: "If my father should 
    stand before me," says he, "my mother hang upon me, my brethren press about 
    me, I would break through my brethren, throw down my father, tread under 
    feet my mother, to cleave to Jesus Christ." So said a certain Dutch 
    schoolmaster, being asked, if he loved not his wife and children? "Yes," 
    says he, "if all the world were gold, and mine to dispose of, I would give 
    it all to live with them, though but in a prison; yet is my soul and my Lord 
    Christ dearer than all." But perhaps this is only the attainment of few. 
    Mistake it not, but hear,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's verdict upon the case, and venture not to 
    distinguish where the law makes no distinction: "If any man come to me, and 
    hate not, &amp;c., he cannot be my disciple." Be he or she who they will, they 
    cannot be Christ's disciples, if Christ be not dearer than what is dearest 
    to them in a world. Nominal disciples they may be indeed, but real they 
    cannot be, they cannot bear afflictions for Christ, because they want such 
    affections to him as are necessary to make them go in the strait and narrow 
    way which leads unto life.—From this subject I would take this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That no man can be a true disciple of Christ, 
    to whom Christ is not dearer than what is dearest to him in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">For illustrating this subject, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Speak to the nature of this necessary qualification of 
    a true disciple of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Confirm the doctrine of the text.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Offer some reasons why Christ is dearer to his true 
    disciples, than what is dearest to them in the world. And,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Conclude with some improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To speak to the nature of this necessary qualification 
    of a true disciple of Christ.—There are in it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. An esteem of Christ above all: Psalm 45:2, "You are 
    fairer than the children of men, grace is poured into your lips; therefore 
    God has blessed you forever." Christ is the highest and most glorious object 
    in the practical judgment of all his true disciples: Psalm 73:25, "Whom have 
    I in Heaven but you, and there is none upon earth that I desire beside you." 
    They do not only think him the best portion, considering things in the 
    general, in which sense he has even the commendation of those who slight 
    him; but they look upon him as best for them, in whatever circumstances they 
    may be; this is the character of a true disciple: Matthew 11:6, "And blessed 
    is he, whoever shall not be offended in me." As the sparkling stars hide 
    their heads when the sun arises, so all things in the world lose their 
    luster when the glory of God appears to them, shining in the face of Jesus; 
    though to others there is in him no beauty.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The heart renounces its property in all things of the 
    world, in the day of its closing with Jesus Christ. As a rebellious son, 
    turned out of his father's house into an uninhabited land, takes that as his 
    property which he falls upon by the right of first finding; but when he has 
    access to return, he quits it, that he may enjoy his father's estate: so 
    Adam and his children being driven out of paradise, and banished from the 
    presence and enjoyment of the Lord himself, they take up with what created 
    comforts they stumble upon in their blind rambling through the wilderness of 
    this world, as their own portion; but returning and taking Christ, they part 
    with these, their souls returning into their quiet rest. The natural man, 
    being alienated from the life of God, takes a dead hold of created things, 
    as suited to his corrupt state, and therefore his own by choice; hence so 
    many carnal "mys," but not a word of "my God" among them: Hosea 2:5, "She 
    said, I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water, my wool 
    and my flax, mine oil and my drink." This is very unlike to Psalm 18:1, 2, 
    "I will lore you, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress, 
    and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and 
    the horn of my salvation, and my high tower." Now, when the soul begins to 
    live, it quits that greedy grip of carnal things, and begins to fall off 
    from the world; that bond of iniquity which bound the heart and the world 
    together being broken; so that the disciple of Christ looks on all he has as 
    no more his own.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The soul resigns all to the Lord, lays all down at the 
    Lord's feet, to be disposed of as he will: 1 Samuel 3:18, "Eli said, it is 
    the Lord, let him do what seems him good." 2 Samuel 15:26, "David said, 
    Behold, here am I, let the Lord do with me as seems good unto him." If the 
    Lord have use for his comforts in the world, he, and all that are his, are 
    for his part at his service. Though they were his before, he now makes a 
    free-will offering of them all to the Lord; so that, in very deed, all that 
    a true disciple of Christ has, are dedicated things, consecrated to God. He 
    may not, he dare not, revoke the grant; they must be used, as God who is the 
    proprietor does direct, whose will must not be disputed in the disposal of 
    his own; they can be no more for profane, but holy uses. And if, through the 
    prevalence of corruption, he has put his hand to that which is not holy, 
    Christ's discipline will make him bring it back with the tear in his eye. 
    Never a soul doses with Christ aright, that lays not all its enjoyments, 
    even life itself, at his feet.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The soul accepts of Christ for, and instead of the 
    things resigned. God does not require us, nor will the heart ever part with 
    these, but for a better: Matthew 13:45, 46, "Again, the kingdom of Heaven is 
    like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had found one 
    pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it." The man 
    takes Christ instead of father, mother, and all things; for it is impossible 
    that man can be self-sufficient. The heart of man is an empty, hungry thing, 
    that must needs have something to feed upon; and let men ply their hearts 
    with the utmost diligence, they will still find it impossible to draw the 
    husks of the world out of their hearts, unless something better is set 
    before them. They must see Heaven, before they will be drawn from earth; 
    therefore, the great transaction between Christ and the soul is held out 
    under the notion of buying, in which a man does indeed in one sense, namely, 
    as to his portion, give away his money: but he obtains something instead of 
    it, which is better to him than his money. He gets Christ, the pearl of 
    great price, the one thing needful.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The soul is disposed to part with them, when the Lord 
    calls for them; has an habitual readiness to part with them for Christ. It 
    is true, indwelling corruption is ready to hold the grip too fast, even when 
    the Lord calls for a delivery; yet every soul closing with Christ has an 
    honest resolution to part with all for him actually, when he shall please to 
    put them to the trial. The grace of God loosens them at the root, when it 
    first comes into the soul, rooting and grounding them in love to Christ; 
    which root of the righteous shall never be moved.</p>
<p align="justify">6. There is in the soul a new power of living, without 
    them, on Jesus Christ; a life which is an absolute mystery to every 
    Christless soul: John 6:57, "As the living Father has sent me, and I live by 
    the Father, so he who eats me, even he shall live by me." If in this 
    spiritual bargain they have quit with their money, on the purchase made, 
    they can live without it, else would they never have quit with it. Though 
    all temporal things fail them, yet can they rejoice in the Lord as their 
    portion, and joy in the God of their salvation, Habakkuk 3:18. If father and 
    mother should leave them, they can satisfy themselves in the Lord's taking 
    them up. If they should lose all relations for him, his relation to them is, 
    in their eyes, more than sufficient to make up the loss. If they should not 
    know where to hide their heads, or how to get food in a hiding-place, he is 
    to them, not only a refuge for protection, but a portion for maintenance, 
    Psalm 142:4, 5. If all their substance should be taken from them, the 
    Almighty shall be the gold and silver of their strength, Job 27:23. Yes, 
    though natural life should go in his cause, himself is their life, a life 
    which cannot be taken from them; for, Colossians 3:4, "When Christ, who is 
    our life, shall appear, then shall we appear with him in glory."—We now 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To confirm the doctrine of the text, or show, that no 
    man can be a true disciple of Christ, to whom Christ is not dearer than what 
    it dearest to him in the world.—For this purpose, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the soul cannot truly lay hold on Christ, but it 
    must of necessity part with the world. The embracing of Christ infers 
    naturally the loosing our hold of the world: Matthew 6:24, "No man can serve 
    two masters. You cannot serve God and mammon." We may as soon grasp Heaven 
    and earth at once in our arms, as fix on Christ, and not loose our hold from 
    all things besides him. If you would look up to the heavens, you must look 
    away from the earth. The world is the term from which Christ calls us: Song 
    4:8, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon." Men may 
    keep his company, with the world under their feet, but not with the world in 
    their heart.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is impossible that the love of God, and the love of 
    the world, (the persons and things of the world), can at the same time be 
    predominant in the heart One of them must of necessity be uppermost. If the 
    love of God be predominant, then it will command the love of all worldly 
    things to yield; and these things will be disposed of, so as may best please 
    him that has the chief room in our hearts. All the streams of our love to 
    things below, will be swallowed up in the depth of our love to Christ: but 
    this will be swallowed up by none; for this love is strong as death. Many 
    waters cannot quench it, neither can the floods drown it. If a man should 
    give all the substance of his house for love, it would be utterly contemned; 
    see Hebrews 11:25, 26. If the love of the world predominate, then it leaves 
    no love to the Lord, because no predominant love of the world is consistent 
    with the true love of God: 1 John 2:15, "Love not the world, neither the 
    things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the 
    Father is not in him." This proves the man no disciple of Christ, Matthew 
    6:24; James 4:4; 2 Timothy 3:4, 5.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That if Christ be not dearer to us than the world, 
    there is no universal resignation, which is necessary to prove the sincerity 
    of the heart: Acts 9:6, "Lord, what will you have me to do!" 2 Corinthians 
    8:5.—"But first gave their own selves to the Lord."—If this be wanting, 
    there is nothing done; we give not to the Lord what he seeks, namely, that 
    we be all his, If we deal thus in this solemn transaction, we do but lie to 
    the Holy Spirit, as Ananias and Sapphira, keeping back part of the price. 
    This is a sure evidence that grace is not effectually at work with us, else 
    we would have been a willing people; we would have made ho reserves in 
    closing with Christ.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That if Christ is not loved supremely, there is a root 
    wanting, the fruit of which is necessary to evidence sincerity.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is no root of universal obedience, the want of 
    which will leave us ashamed, Psalm 119:6. There will always be, in this 
    case, one thing lacking, that will mar all other good things about us. There 
    will always be some idol of jealousy that gets Christ's room; some offending 
    right hand spared, that will bring the whole body to Hell at length.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is no root for Christian suffering, bearing 
    the cross of Christ, which is a cross of Christ's choosing, not of our own. 
    Our part is, to take up the cross that Christ lays down to us; and without 
    this we cannot be his disciples. And when Christ lays on his cross, it is 
    found, that readily he will have the man tried in that which of all things 
    lies nearest his heart, and bids fairest for Christ's room: so that, if 
    anything be dearer than Christ, the cross readily discovers it, and the 
    man's hypocrisy with it.</p>
<p align="justify">You, then, that are to sit down at the Lord's table, may 
    see how you are to manage this solemn transaction, so as that it may be 
    ratified in Heaven. If you take Christ, let these go their way. Lay down 
    your all at Christ's feet, with all solemn seriousness; if there be anything 
    kept back, you do but ruin your own souls. The laws of Christ's school are 
    read before you. Examine yourselves this night, whether you be content with 
    Christ on these terms or not. If you be not, it will be unnecessary, and 
    even criminal, for you to come to his table; you cannot be his disciples. If 
    you be content, then give up your all to him, and lay down your all at his 
    feet. Because of the deceitfulness of your heart, it will be good to be very 
    distinct and particular in this point, on which eternity depends.—In 
    consequence, I would advise you,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To give up with all your lusts. You have held the grip 
    long, let it now go: "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with 
    idols?" Hosea 14:8. Let none escape, let there be no reserved morsel, as you 
    would not quit your lot and portion in Christ. Let every man give up with 
    "the iniquity he knows," as the phrase is, 1 Samuel 3:13. If there be any 
    bosom-lust, which has been a signal competitor for the heart with the Lord, 
    let it be given up with in a particular manner. Sure, if lawful things must 
    be laid at the Lord's feet, unlawful must much more be laid down.—I would 
    advise you,</p>
<p align="justify">2. To lay down at the Lord's feet your nearest and 
    dearest relations, so as that you may never break with Christ for them: his 
    favor, truths, and ways, must be dearer to you than they. And sure I am, if 
    you meet with Christ at his table, you will say, "Henceforth know we no man 
    after the flesh." "I will love my father, mother, wife, children, brethren, 
    and sisters; but my Lord Jesus more than all."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lay down at the Lord's feet your substance in the 
    world, be it great or small, houses and lands, goods, etc. that he may 
    dispose of them as he may see meet. Times have been, and they are like to 
    return, wherein the Lord has sent for these things from professors, even by 
    wicked messengers, as he sent for the donkey and colt, Matthew 21:3, 
    "Saying, The Lord has need of them." And they that had before fairly given 
    them, with themselves, to the Lord, did not stand to deliver him his own: 
    "Go you, and do likewise."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lay down at the Lord's feet, your credit and esteem in 
    the world. This is often a great idol, and goes between many a man and 
    Christ. There are few that ever have it, but suffer an eclipse in some time 
    or other. God even sends for his people's credit, to be a stepping-stone for 
    his glory. But if you make sure work in this transaction, you will even be 
    content at his call to creep down, and lie among the pots, until he himself 
    bring you out again. You will be content to commence a fool to the world, 
    that you may be wise to God.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lay down at the Lord's feet, your ease and liberty: 
    Acts 21:13, "I am ready," said Paul, not to be bound only, but also to die 
    at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus." The flesh will cry, "Man, 
    spare yourself;" but the spirit must offer all to the Lord. You will not 
    break with Christ, though you should never get an easy hour, but be hunted 
    as partridges, until in Heaven. He to whom his ease and liberty is dearer 
    than Christ, is a slave to the devil, and cannot be Christ's disciple.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lay down at Christ's feet, your desires. Your desires 
    shall be to your spiritual Husband, who shall choose for you your 
    inheritance, Psalm 47:4. If he shall grant your lawful desires, it is well; 
    if he see meet to refuse them, it must even be well also in your eye; you 
    are to take himself, and give up with your own will, and say, Your will be 
    done.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Lay down at the Lord's feet, your life. Let your 
    bodies be given now to the Lord, not only for service, but also for a 
    sacrifice, if he requires it. The text makes it plain, none go to Heaven but 
    martyrs, either in action or in affection. It may be the Lord may have use 
    for your strength, for your health, it may be for your blood. Resign all to 
    him now. If you hate not your life, you cannot be his disciple. Be not 
    deterred from the sacrament by this, for, by the Word of God, the way to 
    Heaven is no easier. But when the time comes, that the saints are to be 
    carried to the table above, they will not be supposed to stand and look on, 
    as when they present themselves before the lower table; the fearful and 
    unbelieving shall be excluded from that table, Revelation 21:8. It is 
    necessary at all times that people should manage matters thus when they sit 
    down at the Lord's table, but especially at this time, when the cloud of the 
    church's trouble is gathering so fast, and our peace is flying from us. That 
    party has now got the ascendant, whose temper always has been to breathe out 
    threatening, cruelty, and blood, and furiously to drive their plough over 
    the back of the church, and to make their furrows deep, until the righteous 
    Lord do cut the cords of the ungodly crew. They have brought in their 
    superstitions already, by the favor of a toleration which reflects shame on 
    themselves before the world, as if they were men of no faith, but as to one 
    article. By their means we are threatened with idolatry, and with a French 
    government. But God sits in Heaven, and can bring order out of confusion. 
    Let us prepare for whatever may come, honestly committing all to the Lord, 
    and he will raise the sincere soul above itself, and give the back to bear 
    its own burden, if we be but willing to stoop, and take it on for his sake. 
    He left all for us, and shall we account anything too much for him? However, 
    this is the settled law of Heaven, "If any man come to me, and hate not his 
    father, and mother, and wife, and children, and sisters, yes, and his own 
    life also, he cannot be my disciple." Amen.</p>

<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING, in the preceding, discourse, attended to what was 
    proposed as the first and second heads of method, I now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To offer some reasons why Christ is dearer to his 
    true disciples than what is dearest to them in the world.—Among other 
    reasons, the following are mentioned.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because to every true disciple, sin, of all bitter 
    things, is the bitterest. A man will get a clearer view of the stars from 
    the bottom of a deep pit, than from the top of a high mountain; and the 
    lower that a man is laid in humiliation for sin, Christ will be the dearer 
    to him. Many things, nay, almost anything, is dearer to most persons than 
    Christ. Why so? Because any bitter thing is more bitter to their depraved 
    taste than sin. As when God intended to endear the promised land to the 
    Israelites, and make them content to leave the flesh-pots of Egypt, Exodus 
    1:14, their lives then were made bitter to them; go God gives his people 
    deep wounds for sin, until their consciences be made to dread it, and their 
    hearts to loathe it; he makes them sick at the heart with it, and puts more 
    and more bitterness in the cup to them, until it be of all things the 
    bitterest, to this very end, that Christ may be the dearest to them, and 
    that whatever they may afterwards meet with in his way, they may embrace it 
    rather than sin. Sin has been bitter to many, but not extremely bitter; 
    therefore they say, as the drunkard, Proverbs 23:35, "When shall I awake? I 
    will seek it yet again." But the experience of sin duly embittered quickly 
    determines the Christian which side to choose, when they are brought to this 
    alternative, to suffer or sin.—Another reason is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That God is man's chief end; and when he made him, he 
    made him pointing towards himself as his chief end: Ecclesiastes 7:29, "God 
    made man upright." But man sinning, turned off from God, turned his 
    intention, his love, and desire, beside the mark set before him, turned 
    these in to himself, made himself his chief end. So that the whole of every 
    natural man's religion, however refined, resolves itself into that cursed 
    principle, "Master, spare yourself." Hence they choose new gods, father, 
    mother, etc. setting their heart on them more than on God. Hence is their 
    war in the gates against Heaven, those things which were to be subordinate 
    to God are set in opposition to him; those which were to be below him in 
    their love and esteem, are set above him. If the grace of God rectify not 
    this disorder, it does nothing: for it is impossible, while the soul is 
    perverted as to its chief end, that anything can be right with that person; 
    as a watch that is once wrong set, though it go never so regularly, it is 
    still wrong, for it never points right. But grace truly, though not 
    perfectly while here, brings back the Christian to God as his chief end. It 
    makes him say, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is none upon the 
    earth that I desire besides you," Psalm 73:25; and again, "For to me to live 
    is Christ, and to die is gain," Philippians 1:21. It makes him holy in all 
    manner of conversation; so that whatever way the Christian turns, he points 
    habitually towards God.—Another reason is,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That as there unquestionably is, so they have seen, a 
    vanity and emptiness in all things of the world, even the things that are 
    dearest to them: Psalm 119:96, "I have seen an end of all perfection, but 
    your commandment is exceeding broad." God has hung the sign of vanity at the 
    door of all the creatures, yet do men throng into the house, every one 
    calling and looking for a fill, and promising it to themselves after a 
    thousand disappointments: Isaiah 57:10, "You are wearied in the greatness of 
    your way: yet said you not, There is no hope: you have found the life of 
    your hand; therefore you were not grieved." They see not the sign by the 
    light of grace, although they may have a rational conviction of it, which 
    will be as far from producing a true weaning of the heart from the world, as 
    painted fire is from burning off a man's bands. But Christians are made to 
    see it with the light of grace, which is the light of life, which makes them 
    go by the creatures' door to him in whom "it has pleased the father that all 
    fullness should dwell," Colossians 1:19. The Lord squeezes the sap out of 
    all things, besides himself, to his own, so as that when the heart is 
    seeking its rest, they are tasteless to them as the white of an egg: 
    Philippians 3:7, 8, "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss 
    for Christ. Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the 
    excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I have 
    suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win 
    Christ."—Another reason is,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because they find Christ of all objects the most 
    suitable to them, and therefore he cannot but be dearer to them than the 
    dearest thing in the world. The soul which has long gone through the dry 
    places of the world, seeking rest, and finding none, when it comes to 
    Christ, finds rest to the conscience under the covert of his blood, and rest 
    to his heart in that all-fullness dwelling in Christ which is commensurate 
    to the unbounded desires of the heart, desires which can never be satisfied 
    but by an infinite good; and therefore of necessity, and from choice, 
    settles here, saying, "This is my rest;" and that soul is not to be drawn 
    away from Christ by any means whatever: Romans 8:35, 38, "Who shall separate 
    us from the love of Christ? For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life, 
    nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things 
    to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to 
    separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." He is 
    fully suited to their case: and, what is more, he is suited to their mind, 
    they have no fault whatever to him: Song 5:16, "His mouth is most sweet, 
    yes, he is altogether lovely; this is my beloved, and this is my friend, O 
    daughters of Jerusalem." There is nothing in him they would have out of him, 
    and nothing out of him they would have in him; whereas every created 
    enjoyment is lame, and defective to a great degree; the fairest rose has 
    some sharp prickles about it. Now, that soul which has traversed all created 
    enjoyments dissatisfied, and could never find contentment, is completely 
    satisfied in him. How, then, can it otherwise be, than that he is dearer to 
    it than all other persons and things whatever?—Another reason is,</p>
<p align="justify">5. Because he is their greatest benefactor; his 
    unparalleled benefits command their hearts to be all his: he has done for 
    them what none other could do. When Lebanon was not sufficient to burn, nor 
    the cattle on a thousand hills for a sacrifice, when rivers of oil were too 
    shallow, and the fruit of their bodies for the sin of their souls would have 
    been rejected, he redeemed them with his own blood; he left the bosom of his 
    Father, and came and poured out his soul unto death for them, when they 
    deserved to have died forever. Ho is doing for them what none can do, he is 
    their resident at the court of Heaven, taking up emergent differences 
    between God and them, preparing a place for them in his Father's house of 
    many mansions. And he will do for them what none but he himself can do; he 
    will at last bring them to his glory, and make them perfectly blessed in the 
    full enjoyment of their God and Savior through all eternity.—Another reason 
    is,</p>
<p align="justify">6. Because they are sensible, that whatever they have in 
    the world, they have it through and by him. And so they behold him as the 
    fountain of all their mercies.—Thus,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They have the enjoyment of their blessings through 
    him. It is by him they enjoy father and mother, wife and children, etc; not 
    only by his common providence, as the wicked enjoy their mercies, but by his 
    blood, whereby the malefactor is not only pardoned, but also is set down 
    with these, and far better things, as the purchase of Christ's blood; 
    whereas, had not the Mediator intervened between them and the stroke of 
    justice, they had been stripped of all their enjoyments in the world, even 
    life itself, and shut up forever in the prison of Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They have the comfort of them through him. Every 
    creature is to us what the Lord makes it to be, and it is no more; no more 
    it can be. The creature in itself is a mere nothing: what drops of sweetness 
    are to be found in it, are distilled into it from himself, the fountain of 
    goodness: none good but one, that is, God. And surely the Lord never puts 
    any sweetness in the creature to arrest our hearts upon it, but rather that, 
    finding the sweetness of the streams, we might thereby be drawn up to the 
    Fountain, where sweet water is always sweetest. Let God call in his own from 
    our enjoyments, our dearest relations shall be utterly uncomfortable; yes, 
    our very life a burden. If it be by him only, then, that our enjoyments are 
    desirable, surely himself is much more so. And seeing the Christian loves 
    these things for what of God is in them, and with them, and can never be 
    satisfied with them without Christ, surely Christ himself must be dearest of 
    all.—Another reason is,</p>
<p align="justify">7. Because, if it were not so, Christ would have no 
    church in the world. His standard would fall, and there would be none to 
    take it up. There is an old inveterate enmity in the wicked against 
    godliness; the devil's partisans are always the most numerous. If 
    imprisoning, banishing, spoiling of goods, fields and scaffolds reeking with 
    the blood of the saints, would have deterred all persons from following 
    Christ, there had been no church in the world this day. But God will have a 
    church in spite of devils and wicked men. The spark shall be kept alive, 
    though in the. midst of an ocean, and "his name shall endure forever," Psalm 
    72:17. A new seed shall ever be rising to enlist themselves under Christ's 
    banner. God will not remove the rocks for them, but the way to Heaven, to 
    the world's end, shall lie through many tribulations; for he will animate 
    his people to quit with all that is dearest to them in a world, rather than 
    quit his way, and make them overcome through the word of his testimony, and 
    not love their lives even unto death.—I come now,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In an use of information.—You may hence see,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That Christ will admit no rival in the heart. One 
    throne cannot receive two kings, and one heart cannot admit both Christ and 
    any worldly thing set up beside him; it must needs lie at his feet, or all 
    is wrong in that heart; Matthew 6:24, "No man can serve two masters.—You 
    cannot serve God and mammon." Christ and the world have long struggled 
    together, it is hard to tell which of them many of us have been chiefly 
    following: but when Christ and the world parts, it will be known which of 
    them is our master.—Hence see,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) How far those persons are from being Christ's 
    disciples, to whom a loathsome lust is dearer by far than the Lord Christ. 
    Though it tends to ruin their bodies, their souls, and consciences, they 
    notwithstanding will not part with it for Christ. When Christ commands you 
    to do some great thing for him, how will you do it? Is it a right hand, a 
    right eye? You must cut it off, pluck it out; for were you parting with all 
    but one thing, this one will eternally separate between Christ and you, if 
    you can not also part with it for him.—Hence see,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That men are not out of danger, even when walking 
    within the bounds of lawful things. It is a certain observation, that lawful 
    things are a ditch, in which many souls are drowned, Matthew 24:38, 39. A 
    man in the use of lawful things, is like one walking on the brink of a steep 
    precipice; the ground is firm, but his head is ready to become giddy, and he 
    may fall over. It is hard to rejoice in them, and not to overjoy; to have 
    them, and yet to sit loose to them. Be often feeling the pulse of your 
    affection to them, how it beats, lest it be so violent as to separate Christ 
    and you.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) This shows what is the root of apostasy and 
    defection from the truths and ways of Christ, in a time of the church's 
    trials and troubles. It is the things of the world being dearer than Christ, 
    his truth and ways, this is the first spring of it: "Demas has forsaken me, 
    having loved the present world." If Christ be dearer to us than all things 
    else, we will follow him wherever he goes, and never break with him, for the 
    world's frowns.—I shall only add,</p>
<p align="justify">2. An use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me now exhort all of you, especially those who have 
    been communicants, to evidence yourselves the true disciples of Christ by 
    your comparative hating of father and mother, &amp;c., for Christ and his cause 
    in the world. Let your hearts be loosed from, and do you sit loose to, all 
    that is dear to you in the world, resolving in the Lord's strength, and 
    showing yourselves ready to part with all for Christ, if he shall call you 
    to it. In order to influence your complying with the exhortation, I would 
    lay before you the following motives—</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 1. This is necessary to fit you for trials; that you 
    may be able to stand in the evil day, arm your souls with this 
    disposition.—For this purpose consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That the pathway to Heaven lies by the cross, and 
    all who have a real desire for Heaven must lay their account with suffering; 
    John 16:33, "In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, 
    I have overcome the world." Acts 14:22, "We must through much tribulation 
    enter into the kingdom." 2 Timothy 3:12, "Yes, and all that will live godly 
    in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." Therefore he who does not lay his 
    account thus is a foolish builder, Luke 14:25, and downwards. There is 
    always a hot noon-tide in the church's day, Song 1:7, and it may as 
    certainly be expected as the noon.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the things which concern us appear to be making 
    haste. You have enjoyed the dispensation of the sacrament after Christ's 
    institution in peace, we have no great ground to promise another such season 
    in a haste. There has been much sad work wrought upon this church in a 
    little time, and it is the temper of our enemies to drive more violently 
    than deliberately. We have had long peace, and the air is usually quiet and 
    clear before an earthquake, and the winds are laid before great rains fall. 
    The gospel has been doing little good for many years; and where people are 
    not bettered, they are made worse by it. I believe there was never a 
    generation more disposed to root out serious godliness from the earth, than 
    that which this time affords. Among the fashionable people of the age, 
    religion is become almost quite out of fashion. Ministers and professors, 
    through long ease, have gathered much mud, they need to be emptied from 
    vessel to vessel. And it seems that judgment, as ordinary, must begin at the 
    house of God, to purge it, and prepare the nations for a more dreadful 
    vengeance; so that it is probable it will be brought to this before 
    long,—suffer or sin.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That it is not easy to stand in a time of trial. 
    Many will venture to sea in a fair day, that will never abide a storm. Many 
    tall cedars have been blown up from the root by the wind of persecution, and 
    they who have stood firmest, their towering branches have been made to sweep 
    the ground. Be not over confident; though you have endured a storm already, 
    there may be a harder yet before you, Hebrews 10:34, compared with chapter 
    12:4. There is need, then, to be preparing.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) That this will fit you for it. When the things of 
    the world hang loose about us, like Joseph's mantle, and Satan, by the hands 
    of wicked men, seizes them, to draw us to him by them, they will slip off, 
    and we will leave them in their hand, and so escape, as ho did. They who are 
    standing ready to encounter, will resist the enemy, while they who are 
    surprised will fall into confusion. It is a sad thing to feel trouble before 
    we see it, to be past hope before we have any fear. Troubles that find men 
    secure, ordinarily leave them desperate.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 2. Apostasy and defection from God in a trying time, 
    is dreadful and dangerous: Hebrews 10:38, "Now the just shall live by faith; 
    but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him." God 
    punishes men of this description oftentimes remarkably. How has a spirit of 
    defection been followed in the fearful judgment of God with a spirit of 
    persecution; for when God departs, the spirit is embittered. As the sharpest 
    vinegar is made of the most generous wine, so apostate professors often 
    become the bitterest persecutors. Besides, their gifts often wither, and dry 
    up. It has also often been seen, that they have quickly lost their all 
    dishonorably, who have gone out of God's way to save it, while they who have 
    walked honestly, have walked surely. Dreadful above expression will their 
    doom be, if they get not grace to repent: Matthew 10:33, "Whoever shall deny 
    me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in Heaven." 
    But, Hebrews 10:32, "Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after 
    you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The truths and ways of God are more worth than the 
    whole of what we have to lose for them. It is a general rule: Proverbs 
    23:23, "Buy the truth, and sell it not." The profane spirits of some 
    influence their slighting some less truths of religion; and they imagine, 
    after doing so, that they are secure from suffering, while the foundation 
    points remain untouched. if these men valued their bodies as little as they 
    do the truths of God, they would, in like manner, allow you to cut and 
    mangle them as you please, provided you did not stab them in the heart: but 
    they who value fundamental truths, because of Christ's stamp upon them, will 
    not dare to give up with circumstantial truths which they know, seeing they 
    also bear the same impression of divine authority; so that it is a bold 
    venture for a man, on any pretense, to quit the word of Christ's patience in 
    a time of trial, and to step out of God's way: for he leaves his soul in 
    pawn for it, which is of more worth than all he has in a world; and it is 
    one to a thousand, if ever he has power to come back, and redeem it by 
    repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 4. Death is approaching, and then you must part with 
    all you have in the world. Cleave as fast as you will to these things, you 
    must let go your hold at length. The serious consideration of the shortness 
    of our time, the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of the time of it, 
    would discover to us, that the whole we can make by turning aside from God's 
    way in a time of trial, is not worth our trouble, not worth the going off 
    our road for it; for it may be, what is refused for Christ may quickly be 
    taken from you at death. I am sure we will never part so easily with what we 
    have, as when we sit loose to it. Ripe fruit falls off the tree with a 
    shake,' when the unripe must be rent off. When the heart is loosed from what 
    we have in the world, it is easy parting with it, by what it is when the 
    heart holds by it until it be forced from it.—Nothing is ever parted with so 
    honorably, as when it is parted with for Christ. No thanks to you that you 
    part with what you have, when God takes it from you whether you will or not. 
    It is honorable to forsake the world at Christ's call, for Christ's sake, 
    before we be forsaken of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 5. You will be no losers at Christ's hands. If you 
    quit with them now to Christ, he probably will let you keep them, and accept 
    of your will for the deed. This was the case with Abraham, when called to 
    offer up Isaac; and with David when it was in his heart to build a house to 
    the Lord. Thus you will have them with his blessing and favor: Psalm 37:3, 
    "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and truly 
    you shall be fed." A little served up to you from the promise, and brought 
    to your hand by a particular providence, will have a double sweetness in it. 
    That bread will not be lost which is thrown upon these waters; after many 
    days you shall find it: Matthew 19:29, "And every one that has forsaken 
    houses, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, 
    for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal 
    life." Himself will be to you instead of all, and better than all here; and 
    Heaven will fully make up all hereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">If any shall say, "But, O! I fear I shall never be able 
    to carry through," I would say to such, You know that the foundation is 
    laid, if your heart be loosed from all things besides Christ, and if he be 
    dearer to you than what is dearest to you in a world: Psalm 45:10, 11, 
    "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your 
    own people, and your father's house. So shall the King greatly desire your 
    beauty, for he is your Lord, and worship you him." When the king thus 
    greatly desires your beauty; he will see to preserve it; John 10:28, 29, "I 
    give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any 
    man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, who gave them me, is greater than 
    all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's band." You have 
    taken him for all, and it lies upon his honor to see you carried through. 
    Live by faith, and draw your daily supplies from him: Habakkuk 2:4, "The 
    just shall live by his faith." Isaiah 40:31, "They that wait upon the Lord 
    shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they 
    shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint" Amen.</p>
