<p align="justify"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Christ's Invitation to 
    the Laboring and Heavy Laden</font></b></p>
<p align="justify">
<a href="https://gracegems.org/28/thomas_boston_sermons.htm">Thomas Boston</a>, 1676–1732</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Matthew 11:28, "Come unto me, all you that labor, and are heavy laden, and I 
    will give you rest."</p>
<p align="justify">THE great and main object of the gospel preaching and 
    gospel practice, is a coming to Christ. It is the first article in 
    Christianity, according to John 5:40, "You will not come to me, that you 
    might have life." It is the connecting chain, 1 Peter 2:4, "To whom coming 
    as unto a living stone, you also as lively stones are built up," etc. And it 
    is the last exercise of the Christian; for when finishing his warfare, the 
    invitation is, Matthew 25:34, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the 
    kingdom prepared for you." It is virtually the all which God requires of us: 
    John 6:29, "This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has 
    sent." The words of the text are a moat solemn and ample invitation which 
    Christ gives to sinners. In them I shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The connection. For which look to verses 25 and 26, 
    compare Luke 10:21, "Jesus rejoiced in spirit." It was a joyful time to him 
    when he made this invitation. He rejoiced in the account of the good news, 
    the success with which the message of the disciples was attended; and in the 
    wise and sovereign dispensation of grace by the Father, which he here 
    celebrates, as also upon the view of his own power; where he shows that all 
    power was lodged in him. The keys of the Father's treasures of grace are in 
    his hand, yes, and whatever is the Father's. He also shows, that none could 
    know the Father, but by him, for that is given to him only. He, as it were, 
    opens the treasure door to sinners in the text.—From the connection of this 
    verse, as just now stated, I would observe, that the solemnity of this 
    invitation is most observable. There seems something to be about it more 
    than ordinary. As,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It was given in the day of Christ's gladness. He was a 
    man of sorrows, all made up of sorrows. Sorrow, sighing, weeping, groaning, 
    were his ordinary fare. Once indeed we read of his being glad, John 11:15; 
    and once of his rejoicing, Luke 10:21. And, again, on this occasion, here 
    that thread of sorrow was interrupted, the sun of joy broke out for a little 
    from under the cloud. His heart was touched, and, as it were, leaped for 
    joy, as the word signifies; compare Matthew 5:12, with Luke 6:23. In the 
    Greek, "he was exceeding joyful." At this extraordinary time and frame, he 
    gives the invitation in the text. Hence infer,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That Christ invites sinners with an enlarged heart. 
    Joy enlarges it. His heart is open to you, his arms are stretched wide. You 
    often see him with sorrow and anger in his face, and this works with you 
    that you will not come. Behold him smiling and inviting you now to himself, 
    sending love-looks to lost sinners, from a joyful heart within! Infer,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, May I say, the Mediator's joy is not complete, 
    until you come and take a share? The scriptures will warrant the expression, 
    Isaiah 53:11, "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be 
    satisfied." He rejoices, but rests not; but invites sinners to a share, as 
    if all could not satisfy while he goes childless, as to some he has yet an 
    eye upon. Infer,</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, That nothing can make Christ forget poor sinners, 
    or be unconcerned for them. Sorrow could not do it, joy could not do it; 
    either of these will drive a narrow-spirited man so into himself, as to 
    forget all others. But never was his heart so filled either with sorrow or 
    joy, but there was always room for poor sinners there. When he was entering 
    the ocean of wrath, he remembered them, John 17; and as our forerunner, he 
    went into the ocean of joy, Hebrews 6:20. Like Aaron, he carried our names 
    on his heart, when he went in to appear before the Lord in Heaven, Exodus 
    28:29.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The invitation was given at a time when there was a 
    great breach made in the devil's kingdom, compare Luke 10:17, 18. Christ was 
    now beginning to set up a new kingdom, and he sends out seventy disciples, 
    which was the number of the Sanhedrin at first. He was to bring the people 
    out of the spiritual Egypt, compare Genesis 46:27. The success of the 
    disciples was a fair pledge of the devil's kingdom coming down, and the 
    delivery of sinners. And when the news of it comes, his heart rejoices, and 
    his tongue breaks out in this invitation to the devil's captives, to come 
    away upon this glorious signal. As he had begun to perform this part of the 
    covenant, the Father had begun to perform his, which made his heart leap for 
    joy, and sets him on to cry, that they would all come away, as disciples, 
    vigorously to pursue the advantage which was got, Psalm 110:7, "He shall 
    drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall he lift up the head. Hence 
    infer,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That Christ's heart is set upon the work of sinners' 
    salvation. You see no undue haste, but he would have no delays. He holds 
    hands to the work, calling, "Come unto me." He preferred it to the eating of 
    his bread; and what else is the meaning of all the ordinances and 
    providences you meet with? Infer,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, That Christ would have you to come, taking 
    encouragement from the example of others that have come before you. There is 
    a gap made in the devil's prison; some have made their escape by it already, 
    O! will not you follow? The Lord has set examples for us, both of judgment 
    and of mercy. In the beginnings of the Jewish church, there was an example 
    of God's sovereignty, in the destruction of Nadab and Abihu, Leviticus 10:1, 
    2; and of the Christian church, in the death of Ananias and Sapphira, Acts 
    5; of mercy, in the Jewish church, Rahab the harlot, besides Abraham the 
    father of them all, an idolater, Joshua 24:15, compare Isaiah 51:2. Then in 
    the Christian church, Paul the blasphemous persecutor, 1 Timothy 1:16. 
    Infer,</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, That however full Christ's house be, there is 
    always room for more; he wearies not of welcoming sinners; the more that 
    come the better. Christ's harvest is not all cut down at once, nor his house 
    built in a day; if the last stone were laid in the building, the scaffolding 
    of ordinances would be taken down, and the world be at an end. But none of 
    these has hitherto taken place; therefore yet there is room: Joel 3:21, "For 
    I will cleanse their blood that I have not yet cleansed, for the Lord dwells 
    in Zion."</p>
<p align="justify">3. This invitation is given on a solemn review of that 
    fullness, of that all which the Father has lodged in the hand of the 
    Mediator, and that solely. The Father, as it were, no sooner leads him into 
    these treasures, but he says, 'This and this is for you, sinners; here is a 
    treasure of mercies and blessings for you; pardon, life, peace, etc. is all 
    for you. Come, therefore, unto me, the Father has delivered them into my 
    hand, I long to deliver them over to you. Come, therefore, to me, and hence 
    I shall draw my fullness out to you.' Christ had got a kingdom from the 
    Father; it was as yet thinly peopled, and so he calls you to come to him, 
    that you may be happy in him. He has no will to enjoy these things alone, 
    but because he has them, he would have you to take a share.—I would draw 
    this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That as the fullness lodged in the Mediator has 
    a free vent in his heart, so it seeks to diffuse itself into the souls of 
    needy sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesus Christ longs to make sinners the better of that 
    all-fullness that is lodged in him by the Father. Christ speaks here to us 
    as the true Joseph, Genesis 45:9–11. As Joseph invited his brethren to come 
    and dwell with him, so Jesus cordially invites us, and promises us a share 
    of the fullness which he himself possesses.—In illustrating the above 
    proposition, I shall only,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Assign some reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to give some reasons of this doctrine, or show, 
    why Christ is so kind and liberal to sinners.—He is so,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because the Father has given him for that end: Isaiah 
    55:4, "Behold, I have given him for a Witness unto the people, a Leader and 
    Commander unto the people. The Father had thoughts of love to man; his love 
    designed to distribute a treasure of mercy, pardon, and grace, to lost 
    sinners; but justice would not allow his giving them immediately out of his 
    own hand; therefore he gives them to the Mediator to distribute. An absolute 
    God being a consuming fire, guilty creatures, as stubble, could not endure 
    his heat, but they would have been burnt up by it; therefore he sets his own 
    Son, in man's nature, as a crystal-wall between him and them; he gives him 
    the Spirit without measure, not only a fullness of sufficiency, but 
    abundance of blessings, is laid up in him; for it has pleased the Father, 
    that in him should all fullness dwell.—He is so,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because he received a fullness of treasure for that 
    very end: John 17:19, "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also 
    might be sanctified through the truth." The first Adam got mankind's stock; 
    he soon lost all. Christ takes the elect's stock in his hand for their 
    security, and so he is given for a covenant of the people; he takes the 
    burden upon him for them, and takes the administration of the second 
    covenant, that it might, with them, be a better covenant than the first.—He 
    is so,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because he bought these treasures at the price of his 
    blood for their behoof: Philippians 2:8, 9, "He humbled himself, and became 
    obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also has 
    highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name." The 
    Son of God, who is Lord of all, needed no exaltation in the court of Heaven, 
    being equal with his Father; but his design was, to exalt man's nature, to 
    make these that were the children of the devil—friends to Heaven, and 
    prepare for them room there: "I go (said he) to prepare a place for you," 
    John 14:2. No wonder, then, that he should long to see the purchase of his 
    blood, the fruit of the travail of his soul, come to him.—He is kind and 
    liberal,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because of his love to them. Where true love is, there 
    is an aptness to communicate; the lover cannot see the beloved want what he 
    has. God's love is giving love: "He so loved the world, that he gave his 
    only-begotten Son," John 3:16. Christ's love is also such; he loves indeed: 
    "He loved us, and gave himself for us," Galatians 2:20.—For the improvement 
    of this doctrine, I only add an use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">Come to Christ, then, O sinners, upon this his 
    invitation, and sit not his blessed call.—To enforce this, I urge these 
    motives—</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a fullness in him, all power is given him; 
    want what you will, he has a power to give it to you; the Son of man had 
    power, even on earth, to forgive sins. Grace without you, or grace within 
    you, he is the dispenser of all: John 1:16, "And of his fullness have all we 
    received, and grace for grace." He is the great Secretary of Heaven, the 
    keys hang at his belt; he shuts, and none can open; be opens, and none can 
    shut.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. You are welcome to it. He has it not to keep up, but 
    to give out, and to whom but to needy sinners? Even the worst of you are 
    welcome, if you will take it out of his own hand: "If any man thirst, (says 
    he), let him come to me, and drink," John 7:37.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Would you do Christ a pleasure? then come to him, 
    Isaiah 53:11, "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be 
    satisfied." Would you content and ease his heart? then come. It is a great 
    ease to full breasts to be sucked. The breasts of his consolations are full, 
    hear how pressingly he calls you to suck! "Eat, O friends! drink, yes, drink 
    abundantly, O beloved!"</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Would you fall in with the designs of the 
    Father's and the Son's love, in the mystery of salvation? then come to him. 
    Why is a fountain opened, but that you may run to it, and wash? Seal not, 
    shut not that to yourselves, which God and Christ have opened.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The second thing to be considered in the words is, 
    the persons invited. These are they that labor, and are heavy-laden. The 
    word labor signifies not every laboring, but a laboring to weariness, and so 
    some read it weary. Heavy laden are they that have a heavy burden on their 
    back, which they are not able to bear.</p>
<p align="justify">Who are meant by these? I cannot agree with those that 
    restrain these expressions to those that are sensible of their sins and 
    misery, without Christ, and are longing to be rid of the same; but I think 
    it includes all that are out of Christ, sensible or insensible; that is, 
    these that have not had, and those that have had, a law-work upon their 
    consciences. And to fix this interpretation, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The words agree to all that are out of Christ, and 
    none have any right to restrain them. None more properly labor, in the sense 
    of the text, than those that are out of Christ, seeking their satisfaction 
    in the creatures: Ecclesiastes 1:8, "All things are full of labor, man 
    cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled 
    with hearing." And who have such a burden of sin, and wrath upon their back 
    as they have? The word properly signifies a ship's lading, which, though 
    insensible of it, may yet sink under the weight.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. "The whole world lies in wickedness," 1 John 5:19, as 
    men in a deep mire, still sinking. Christ came to deliver men out of that 
    case; having taken upon him our nature, Hebrews 2:16, he caught hold (Greek) 
    as one does of a drowning man, even as he did of Peter when sinking, Matthew 
    14:31. And what are the invitations of the gospel, but Christ putting out 
    his hands to sinking souls, sinking with their own weight. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the words, in other scriptures, are without 
    controversy applied to the most insensible sinners. See what labor and 
    weariness! Habakkuk 2:13, "Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts, that the 
    people shall labor in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves 
    for very vanity?" In the most solemn invitation to Christ in all the Old 
    Testament, the word "laboring" is so used: Isaiah 55:2, "Wherefore do you 
    spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which 
    satisfies not?" Luke 11:46, "You lade men with burdens grievous to be 
    borne." "Lade" is the same Greek word used in the text. Isaiah 1:4, "Ah! 
    sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity." Were they sensible? far from 
    it; for verse 3, "Israel does not know, my people does not consider." And, 2 
    Timothy 3:6, it is said, "Silly women, laden with sins, led away with divers 
    lusts."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Consider the parallel text: Isaiah 55:1, "Ho, every 
    one that thirsts;" where by the thirsty is not so much understood those that 
    are thirsting after Christ, as those that are thirsting after happiness and 
    satisfaction, seeking to squeeze it out of the creature; for the thirsty 
    invited are the same that are spending their labor for that which satisfies 
    not. But those that are thirsting after Christ are not such.</p>
<p align="justify">5. If the words be a restriction of the call to sensible 
    sinners, then the most part of sinners are excluded. If they are not 
    included, sure they are excluded; and if the words are restrictive, sure 
    they are not included; and then, so far from being the truth of the text, 
    that it is no gospel-truth at all; for all, without exception, that hear the 
    gospel, are called to come to Christ; Revelation 3:20, "Behold, I stand at 
    the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will 
    come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." And if any "one" be 
    not called, they have no warrant to come; and if so, unbelief is not their 
    sin, as in the case of the Pagans, which is absurd.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, This is a most solemn invitation to come to 
    Christ; and if I say the most solemn, there is some ground for it by what is 
    said before. And shall that be judged restrained, that so expressly and 
    solemnly comes from that fullness of power lodged in Christ, more than that 
    just quoted? Revelation 3:20, where there is no shadow of restriction. 
    Besides, this restriction may well be a snare to an exercised soul, which 
    ordinarily, by a legal disposition in all, will not allow that they may come 
    to Christ, because sin is not heavy enough to them. But although sinners 
    will never come to Christ until they see their need of him, yet this I will 
    ever preach, that all, under pain of damnation, are obliged to come to him, 
    and that they shall be welcome on their coming, be their case what it will; 
    that such as are willing to come ought not to stop on a defect of their 
    sensibleness, but come to him, that they may get a true sense of sin unto 
    repentance; for he is "exalted a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance 
    unto Israel, and remission of sins," Acts 5:31, He is to give, not to stand 
    and wait, until "folly bring repentance with it."</p>
<p align="justify">III. Consider in the words, to what the laboring and 
    heavy-laden are invited. They are invited to come to Jesus; that is, to 
    believe on him, to take him as he offers himself in the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Observe the encouragement afforded to influence a 
    compliance with this invitation. Rest is promised to them here and 
    hereafter: "I will give you rest."—We may afterwards open up these things 
    more largely, in handling the following doctrinal propositions, which we 
    draw from the words thus explained, namely,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. I. That sinners, while out of Christ, are 
    engaged in a wearisome labor.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. II. That all who are out of Christ are under a 
    heavy load or burden, which by all their labors they cannot shake off.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. III. Whatever sinful and vain labors sinners 
    are engaged in, whatever be the loads which are lying on them, they are 
    welcome to Christ; nay, he calls, invites, and commands them to come unto 
    him.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall consider these in order.—I begin with DOCTRINE. 
    I. That sinners, while out of Christ, are engaged in a wearisome labor. Were 
    you condemned, until you forsook your lusts, to row in the galleys, chained 
    to the oars, to dig in mines, never to see the light of the sun, it were not 
    to be compared to this wearisome labor, while out of Christ. If sinners feel 
    it not, it is because they are not at all themselves. It is a truth, though 
    a sad one, Isaiah 55:2, that they "labor for that which satisfies not;" (in 
    the Hebrew,) they "labor to weariness." Ecclesiastes 10:15, "The labor of 
    the foolish wearies every one of them; because he knows not how to go to the 
    city."</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this point, we may inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What it is that sinners out of Christ are laboring 
    for.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How it is, that men out of Christ labor for happiness 
    and satisfaction.</p>
<p align="justify">III. What sort of labor it is that they have in these 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Why sinners labor in these things for satisfaction, 
    and do not come to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">V. Make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What it is that sinners out of Christ are laboring 
    for. No man engages in a labor, but for some end he proposes to himself. 
    Though the devil is oversman of these laborers, yet he does not make them go 
    like clocks, without a design. Every one that labors proposes some profit to 
    himself by his work, and so do these; there is always something, either 
    really or seemingly good, that men seek in all their labors. So, in a word, 
    it is happiness and satisfaction that they are laboring for, as well as the 
    godly. For, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The desire of happiness and satisfaction is natural to 
    man; all men wish to see good. It is not the desire of good that may 
    satisfy, that makes the difference between the godly and the wicked, but the 
    different ways they take: Psalm 4:6, 7, "There be many that say, Who will 
    show us any good? Lord, lift you up the light of your countenance upon us. 
    You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and 
    their wine increased." In whatever case a man is on earth, in Heaven or Hell 
    this is still his desire; and he must cease to be a man, before he can cease 
    to desire to be a happy man. When that desire, mentioned Ecclesiastes 12:5, 
    shall fail, this desire is still fresh and green; and it is good in itself. 
    Our Lord supposes this in the text, and therefore he promises to them what 
    they are seeking, rest, if they will come to him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This desire is the chief of all: all other things are 
    desired for it. All men's desires, however different, meet here, as all the 
    rivers meet in the sea, though their courses may be quite contrary. 
    Therefore this is what they labor for. The devil has some laborers at his 
    coarse work, others at the more fine, but they all meet in their end.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Defects and wants are interwoven with the very nature 
    of the creature; and the rational creature finds that it cannot be, nor is 
    self-sufficient. Hence it seeks its happiness without itself, and must do 
    it, to satisfy these natural desires.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Seeing, then, man's happiness is without himself, 
    it must be brought in, which cannot be done without labor. It is proper to 
    God to be happy in himself; but every creature must needs go out of itself 
    to find its happiness; so that action is the true way to it, that is, rest 
    cannot be found but in the way of action and labor, and because they are not 
    in the right way, it is wearisome labor.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">II. How it is that men out of Christ labor for happiness 
    and satisfaction. Here it is impossible for us to reckon up particulars, and 
    that in regard,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Of the different dispositions of men, and the various, 
    as well as contrary opinions, concerning what may make a man happy. Varro 
    says, there were two hundred and eighty opinions touching the chief good in 
    his time. It is true, Christianity, in the profession of it, has fixed this 
    point in principle; but nothing less than overcoming grace can fix it in 
    point of practice. The whole body of Christless sinners are like the 
    Sodomites at Lot's door; all were for the door, but one grasps one part of 
    the wall for it, another another part, not one of them found it. The world 
    is, as the air in a summer-day, full of insects; and natural men, like a 
    company of children, one running to catch one, another, another, while none 
    of them is worth the pains. One runs to the affections of the earth, another 
    to the ale-house, &amp;c.—It is impossible to determine here,</p>
<p align="justify">2. In regard of men's still altering their opinions about 
    it, as they meet with new disappointments. Like a man in a mist, seeking a 
    house in a wilderness, when every bush, tree, etc. deceives, until, by 
    coming near, he is undeceived. "O (thinks the man), if I had such a thing, I 
    would be well." Then he falls to labor for it; may be he never gets it, but 
    he ever pursues it. If he gets it, he finds it will not do, for as big as it 
    was afar off, yet it will not fill his hand when he grips it; but it must be 
    filled, or no rest, hence new labor to bring forth just a new 
    disappointment: Isaiah 26:18, "We have been with child, we have been in 
    pain, we have as it were brought forth wind."—It is difficult also,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because they cannot tell themselves what they would be 
    at. Their starving souls are like the hungry infant, that gapes, weeps, 
    cries, and sucks everything that comes near its mouth, but cannot tell what 
    it would have, but is still restless until the mother set it to the breast. 
    It is regenerating grace that does that to the soul. The Hebrew word for 
    believing, comes from a root that signifies to nurse, as if faith were 
    nothing but a laying of the soul on the breasts of Christ, in whom dwells 
    all the fullness of the Godhead. The scripture holds him out as the mother 
    that bare them; hence his people are called, Isaiah 53:11, "The fruit of the 
    travail of his soul." He also is their nourisher: hence he says, Isaiah 1:2, 
    "I have nourished and brought up children." The breasts of the church, 
    Isaiah 66:11, at which they are to suck and be satisfied, are no other than 
    Christ. But, in the general, to see from whence it is that men out of Christ 
    go about to squeeze out their happiness, see Psalm 4:6, 7, quoted above. 
    From which observe two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That it is not God, for these two are set in 
    opposition; go to as many doors as they will, they never go to the right 
    door; hence it follows, that it is the creatures out of which they labor to 
    draw their satisfaction: "Having forsaken the fountain of living waters, 
    they hew out to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no 
    water."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That it is good they are seeking out of them; and 
    indeed men can seek nothing but under that notion, though for the most part 
    they call evil good, and good evil. All good is either profitable, 
    pleasurable, or honest; these, then, are all that they are seeking, not from 
    God, but from themselves, or other creatures. The two former have respect to 
    the cravings of men's desires, the latter to the cravings of the law. And 
    seeing it is not in God that they seek their happiness and satisfaction, I 
    infer hence, that all out of Christ are laboring for their happiness and 
    satisfaction in one or both of these ways, either from their lusts, or from 
    the law; and this I take to be the very labor intended in the text. For 
    which consider these three things—</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That all natural men have two principles in them,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Corruption;</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Conscience. Both crave of them: Romans 2:15, "Which 
    show the work of the law, written in their heart, their conscience also 
    bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else 
    excusing one another." Hence, because they do not mortify the lusts, they 
    must be fed or no rest; and therefore they labor for their lusts to satisfy 
    them. Then, because they fly not to Christ for the satisfaction of their 
    conscience, they go to the law.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly. The bulk of natural men in the world have still 
    been of two sorts:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The profane party;</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The formal party. These have still been among Jews, 
    Pagans, and Christians; the former laboring most in lusts, the latter in the 
    law.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Adam left us with two yokes on our necks,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Of lusts;</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Of the law. The last was of God's putting, but he 
    gave strength with it to bear it; Adam took away the strength, but left the 
    yoke, and put on a yoke of lusts beside; and in opposition to both these, 
    Christ bids us come and take on his yoke, which is easy, and his burden, 
    which is light," Matthew 11:29.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the labor they have in their lusts, they call them, 
    and they run after them. These infernal devils in the heart drive the swine 
    of this world into the sea of perdition; nay, turn the soul itself into a 
    very sea, that cannot rest: Isaiah 57:20, "The wicked are like the troubled 
    sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt." They labor 
    like madmen for satisfaction to them, and no calm, no rest, until the soul 
    come to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They labor hard in the lusts of profit: 1 John 2:16, 
    "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the Inst of the eyes, 
    and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world." The 
    profits of the world are the cisterns they squeeze for satisfaction; they 
    bewitch the hearts of them that have them, and of them that want them; they 
    fly after them with that pains and labor the ravenous bird does after its 
    prey: Proverbs 23:5, "Will you set your eyes upon that which is not? for 
    riches take to themselves wings, they fly away, as an eagle towards Heaven." 
    The strength of men's desires, and the cream of their affections, are spent 
    on them; their happiness depends upon its smiles, their misery upon its 
    frowns; if gone, their God is gone. Hence is that verified, Habakkuk 2:13, 
    "They labor in the very fire, and weary themselves for very vanity," like a 
    poor fool running to catch a shadow. They have hard labor in lawful profits, 
    how to get them, and how to keep them, but hardest of all, how to squeeze 
    satisfaction out of them; there they labor in the very fire; they labor also 
    in unlawful profits. The soul is an empty thing; lusts are ill to guide; 
    conscience must make a stretch now and then, for the satisfaction of lusts; 
    and the man will leap over the hedge, though the serpent will bite him: 1 
    Timothy 6:9, 10, "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a 
    snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in 
    destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil." 
    Hence the carnal man, I may say, never gets up his back, but on his belly 
    does he go, and labors, as if he were a slave condemned to the mines, to dig 
    in the affections of the earth; like the blind moles, his constant labor is 
    in the earth, and he never opens his eyes until he is dying. He has his lade 
    of thick clay upon his back, Habakkuk 2:6, as the fruit of his laboring in 
    the fire. There is thus a laboring and heavy-laden party. Others take the 
    world in their hand as a staff, nay, tread on it as the dirt, and they get 
    it as a burden on their back; while guilt, many times contracted in the 
    getting of it, whether by oppression, cheatery, or neglecting of the soul 
    for it, is like a sore back under the load, that makes them ready in despair 
    to throw it away, but they know not how to exist without it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They labor in lusts of pleasure; they go about as the 
    bee, extracting the sweet out of the creatures for their own satisfaction; 
    this and the former usually go together. Profits and pleasures are the 
    world's two great baits, at which all natural men are constantly leaping, 
    until they are caught by the hook, and flung out into the fire of wrath: 
    Proverbs 9:17, 18, "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is 
    pleasant. But he knows not that the dead are there, and that her guests are 
    in the depths of Hell." Pleasure is a necessary ingredient in happiness, and 
    man cannot but seek it; hence God proposes it to men in himself, who is the 
    fountain of all sweetness: Psalm 16:11, "You will show me the path of life, 
    in your presence there is fullness of joy, at your right hand there are 
    pleasures for evermore." But blind man makes the creature-sweetness his 
    idol, and puts it in the room of God; for "they are lovers of pleasures, (in 
    this sense), more than lovers of God," 2 Timothy 3:4. It is no fault to seek 
    our profit; for, Hebrews 11:26, "We are to have respect unto the recompense 
    of the reward." Nor to seek what may be sweet to the soul; for we may wish 
    our souls to be "satisfied with marrow and fatness," Psalm 63:5. But the 
    natural man's misery and sin both is, he forsakes God, and fastens on the 
    breasts of the creatures for these things.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, there are two breasts of the creatures at which men 
    may be sucking.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The breast of lawful comforts. Natural men fall on 
    these, instead of the breasts of God's consolations, and labor, though in 
    vain, to squeeze happiness and satisfaction out of them, and that with the 
    greatest eagerness. They are lawful in themselves, but they often press so 
    hard, that they draw out blood instead of milk from them; and are like men 
    working at a flinty rook, to bring out water, instead of which they get fire 
    flashing in their face, as in that case, Judges 9:15, when "fire came out of 
    the bramble to devour the cedars of Lebanon."—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The breast of unlawful comforts, Proverbs 9:17, 
    "Stolen waters are sweet." Many seek their satisfaction in those things 
    which they ought not so much as to desire, and fill themselves with what God 
    forbids them so much as to taste. O! the misery of Christless sinners, to 
    whom both lawful and unlawful comforts are effectual snares for ruin. Like 
    mad beasts, if they abide within the hedge, they tear up all to the red 
    earth, which does not yet satisfy, But they most usually break over all 
    hedges; and they do so, because the creature can never fully answer the 
    craving desires and hungry appetite, and yet, after all, they will not come 
    to Christ, that they may have rest.</p>
<p align="justify">These breasts of the creatures have many springs, divers 
    lusts and pleasures, Titus 3:3, and these are served; men must labor in them 
    as a servant at his master's work. I shall reduce them to these two heads, 
    mentioned, Ephesians 2:3, the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They labor for satisfaction and happiness in the 
    pleasures of the flesh. And,—1. In sensuality. This was the door man first 
    went to, after he had left God. And since the world was turned upside down 
    by that means, the soul has lain downmost, and the flesh uppermost, so that 
    they are all sensual, as Jude says, verse 19, that have not the Spirit; and 
    the soul is made drudge of the body. The belly is a God, and the pleasures 
    of the flesh are squeezed for satisfaction; all the senses are set a-working 
    for it, and yet can never do enough: Ecclesiastes 6:7, "All the labor of man 
    is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled." Many arts and trades 
    are found out to bring this to perfection, though all in vain; and there is 
    no end of these things, which are of no use but to please the flesh, which, 
    like the grave, never says it has enough.—2. Ease, sloth, and quiet, which 
    is a negative kind of sensuality: Luke 12:19, "The rich man said, You has 
    goods laid up for many years, soul, take your ease." All to please the 
    flesh. This costs hard labor many times to the soul, many a throw conscience 
    gets for the sake of this idol, what by neglect of duties, what by going 
    over the belly of light to shun what is grieving to the flesh, as if men's 
    happiness consisted in the quiet enjoyment of themselves.—They labor for 
    satisfaction,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, In the desires of the mind, and pleasures thereof. 
    These, if they terminated on right objects, and were sought in a right 
    manner, it would be well, for our true happiness consists in the soul's 
    enjoyment of God; but in the natural man all is confusion. And,—1. There is 
    much labor in seeking happiness in the pleasures of the judgment. This is 
    the snare of thinking graceless men; this was among the first doors men went 
    to when they turned from God: Genesis 3:5, "You shall be as gods, knowing 
    good and evil." And there is hard labor without a figure, for the punishment 
    of that: Ecclesiastes 1:13, "And I gave my heart to seek and search out by 
    wisdom concerning all things that are done under Heaven; this sore travail 
    God has given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith." And what comes 
    it to at length? to no rest; for, verse 18, "In much wisdom there is much 
    grief; and he who increases knowledge, increases sorrow." Here is fulfilled, 
    Ecclesiastes 10:15, "The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, 
    because he knows not how to go to the city." Whereas, would they go to 
    Christ, they would be in a fair way to get what they are seeking; for, John 
    17:3, "This is life eternal, that they might know you the true God, and 
    Jesus Christ, whom you have sent." "In whom are hid, all the treasures of 
    wisdom and knowledge," Colossians 2:3. There is labor,—2. In pleasures of 
    the fancy. What else are all the lusts of the eye? all the abundance of the 
    riches for which men labor so much? Ecclesiastes 5:11, "When goods increase, 
    they are increased that eat them; and what good is there to the owner 
    thereof, saying the beholding of them with his eyes? all they can think or 
    say is, These are mine." What is honor, credit, and the like, but a tickling 
    of our fancy, with the fancies of others about us, adding nothing to real 
    worth? And how busy is the soul oftentimes in that, Ecclesiastes 6:9, 
    "Better is the sight or the eyes, than the wandering of the desire, 
    (Hebrews) "walking of the soul." This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
    What satisfaction is sought in imagination, sins, lust, revenge, and the 
    like? what restlessness there, 2 Peter 2:14, "Having eyes full of adultery, 
    that cannot cease from sin." How busy is the soul oftentimes in imagination, 
    of wealth, and the like, as if, when it had tried all other means in vain, 
    it would try, while awake, to dream itself happy! "The thoughts of my 
    heart," says Job, chapter 17:11, (Hebrews) "the passions of my heart," "are 
    broken off."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The other thing in which natural men labor for rest, 
    is the "law:" compare the text, Matthew 11:28, with verses 29 and 30. 
    Emphatically is that labor described, Romans 10:3, "For they being ignorant 
    of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own 
    righteousness." "Go about;" the word signifies, a seeking, like a disputer 
    in the schools, or a tormenter of one upon the rack; to establish, to make 
    it stand itself alone. They seek to make it stand, as men that will have a 
    stone to stand on end, which at the same time is ever coming down on them 
    again. Why all this? because it is their own: "Have not submitted." Christ 
    offers a righteousness; but to take it, is to them a point of submission, 
    against which they labor, as the untoward bullock against the yoke. They 
    will never let it on until God break the iron sinew of the neck, Isaiah 
    48:4.</p>
<p align="justify">To confirm this, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. All men desire to be happy, and no man can get his 
    conscience quite silenced, more than he can get the notion of a God quite 
    erased from his mind: Romans 2:14, 15, "They are a law unto themselves, 
    their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while 
    accusing or excusing one another." Peace of mind is a natural desire, which 
    none can divest himself of. Hence it follows, men cannot but seek inward 
    peace; and though they may set themselves to murder conscience for that end, 
    yet seeing it will not do for them totally, they do of necessity take some 
    other way. There never was but two ways, either Christ or the law. The 
    former they reject, therefore it follows, they follow the latter. Let us 
    view this in three sorts of natural men.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In the profane person, who has not so much as a form 
    of godliness; it is hardest to be found in them. But none so profane, but it 
    will readily be found they have someone good thing or another about them, 
    and sometimes they will compliment their consciences with a denial of 
    satisfaction to their lusts, which is a labor so much the harder to them, as 
    they are under the greater power of lusts. This sure they do not with an eye 
    to make themselves miserable, but happy that their consciences may excuse 
    them, Romans 2:15. Excusing, even those that are most at the devil's will, 
    and taken captive, as hunters who take their prey alive, 2 Timothy 2:26. 
    Importing still a conscience laboring in the law, though lusts, as being 
    stronger, do for the most part prevail.—Let us view this,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In the formal natural man: some of whom labor in the 
    duties of morality; others in those of religion: who are at no small travail 
    in the law, if we consider it all for nothing. Like the Pharisee, Luke 
    18:11, they take not the gospel-way, yet they labor in the law. Sure lusts 
    remain in them in their life and vigor. It surely costs labor so far to 
    restrain them.—Let us view this,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In the awakened sinner. I am not for excluding those 
    out of the text, but only that it be not restrained to them: Acts 2:37, 
    "Now, when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said unto 
    Peter, and the rest of the apostles, what shall we do?" These mend their 
    hands at this hard labor, and often labor so to keep the law, that they are 
    both by themselves, and others taken for saints of the first magnitude, and 
    yet it is but still in the law, until converting grace come, and sued them 
    off the old root.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is natural for men to labor in the law for 
    happiness, and therefore, until nature be overcome by grace, men will not be 
    put off it. The law was Adam's covenant, who, with his children, were to 
    work and win Heaven by their works; though they have lost their father's 
    strength, yet they will keep their father's trade; though their stock be 
    small, yet they will keep the merchandising for Heaven, and give God good 
    works for good wages. See nature speaking out of him, Matthew 19:16, "Good 
    Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" And it 
    often happens, that they who have fewest of good works lay the greatest 
    stress upon them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider how this practice has been formed into 
    principles, in the face of the sun of the gospel. Never was an error yet 
    vented in principle, but in compliance with some corruption of the heart; 
    therefore is that made the characteristic of true doctrine, that it is 
    according to godliness, 1 Timothy 6:3. No sooner was the gospel preached, 
    than Cain sets up for works in opposition to faith: Genesis 4:4, 5, "And the 
    Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offering; but unto Cain and his 
    offering he had not respect." Paul gives the reason: Hebrews 11:4, "By faith 
    Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain." In Abraham's 
    family, to whom the promise of righteousness was more clearly made, Hagar 
    bears her son; compare Galatians 4:24. When the people were in Egypt, the 
    generality of them knew nothing else. They had curtailed the law so very 
    short, as all that labor in it do, that they thought they kept all very 
    well: Romans 5:13, "For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not 
    imputed, when there is no law." For that cause God gave them the law, as in 
    Exodus 20. Galatians 3:29, "The law was added because of transgressions;" it 
    pravailed in the days of the prophets, in Christ's days, and from the 
    beginning of the Christian church to this day;—hence our swarms of Papists, 
    &amp;c.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">4. They turn the very gospel into law, as unclean vessels 
    sour the sweetest liquor that is put in them. What a real gospel was the 
    ceremonial law to the Jews, holding up blood, death, and translation of 
    guilt, from them to the substitute, every day before their eyes in their 
    sacrifices; But, Romans 9:11, "Their very table (that is, their altar, so 
    call, Malachi 1:12,) became a snare;" and they went about these things, as 
    if by them they would have made up what was wanting in their observation of 
    the moral law. Just so was it turned in Popery; yes, and alas! among 
    Protestants it is found thus soured, to whom the gospel is the law and 
    faith, repentance, and new obedience, the fulfilling of the law. But would 
    to God it stood in principles only; but as sure as every unrenewed man is 
    out of Christ, as sure even these natural men, whose heads are set right in 
    this point, in their hearts and practice the very gospel is turned into law, 
    and their obedience, their very faith and repentance, such as it is, is put 
    in the room of Christ. For practice, when fairly traced, will show the 
    principles from which it proceeds.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider, though all would be saved, yet natural 
    men are enemies to the gospel-way of salvation: 1 Corinthians 1:23, "It is 
    to the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness." They must 
    then be in love with the law; yes, so cleave they to it, that nothing but 
    death can part Adam's sons and it, and this even a violent death in a day of 
    God's power: Psalm 110:3; Romans 7:4, "You also are become dead to the law;" 
    (Greek,) "deadened, killed, or put to death." As long as a soul sees how to 
    shift without Christ, it will never come to him; add to this, that the godly 
    find the remains of this principle in them to struggle against. Self-denial 
    is the first lesson Christ gives, but they are a-learning it all their days. 
    If it is thus in the green tree, what shall it be in the dry?</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">WE are now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To inquire, What sort of a labor sinners have in 
    these things? For the sake of plainness, it will be necessary to consider 
    this labor, 1st, As it respects their lusts; 2dly, As it respects the 
    law.—We are,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, To consider this labor of sinners, as it respects 
    their lusts, their going up and down among the creatures, extracting from 
    them a comfort and pleasures, which they take for happiness.—I shall here 
    show the properties of this labor, and thus confirm the point, that they are 
    engaged in a wearisome labor.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is hard labor, and sore toil: Jeremiah 9:5, "They 
    weary themselves to commit iniquity." None win the devil's wages for 
    nothing, they eat no idle bread where he is taskmaster, and they must needs 
    run, whom he drives. The devil's yoke is of all yokes the heaviest.—To clear 
    this point, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) What the Scriptures compare this labor in lusts 
    unto; whereby it will appear hard labor.—It compares it,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] To the labor of a man going to a city and not 
    knowing the way: Ecclesiastes 10:15, "The labor of the foolish wearies every 
    one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city." That is hard 
    labor, as many know by experience. Many a weary foot such must go, many a 
    hardship they must endure, and so must these in pursuit of happiness.—It 
    compares it,</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] To a laboring in the fire: Habakkuk 2:13, "Behold, 
    is it not of the Lord of hosts, that the people shall labor in the very 
    fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?" How hard is 
    their labor that lies about a fire! what sweat! what toil! Jeremiah 6:29, 
    "The billows are burnt, the lead is consumed of the fire, the founder melts 
    in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away." But how much more hard in the 
    fire! As when a house is on fire, and men in it, laboring to preserve that 
    which the fire consumes, even among their hands. These labor, 1st, In the 
    fire of lusts, that inflames the heart, and scorches the very soul, Proverbs 
    6:27, 28, "For by means of a whorish woman, a man is brought to a piece of 
    bread, and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. Can a man take 
    fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?" 2dly In the fire of 
    divine wrath that is kindled by the former: Isaiah 9:18, "For wickedness 
    burns as the fire, it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle 
    in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up 
    of smoke." This consumes what they are working for in the other; so that 
    when, like the spider, they have spun out their own affections for a 
    covering, yet it is by far too narrow, and they have but wearied themselves 
    for very vanity.—It is compared,</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] To laboring under a burden, as in the text itself, 
    which will not let the man get up his back. They are the devil's drudges, 
    laboring under that load that will crush them at last, if they do not, as in 
    Psalm 55:22, cast their burden on the Lord, that he may sustain them. They 
    are laden with divers lusts, which lie on them as a burden on the weary 
    beast, which weary them indeed, but they are bound on as with bands of iron 
    and brass.—It is compared,</p>
<p align="justify">[4.] To the labor of a soldier in war; they watch for 
    iniquity as a sentry at his post: Isaiah 29:20. The natural man himself is 
    the very field of battle: James 4:1, "From whence come wars and fightings 
    among you, come they not hence, even of your lusts which war in your 
    members?" The war itself you may see described in the three following 
    verses. Who cannot but be well labored with the feet of men and horse in 
    that confusion? Though there be not grace and corruption to war in them, 
    there are lusts, and lusts opposed to one another, lusts and light also.—It 
    is compared,</p>
<p align="justify">[5.] To the labor of the gardener in plowing: Hosea 
    10:13, "You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity." They devise 
    wickedness, which the Hebrew calls plowing it: "Devise not evil against your 
    neighbor," Proverbs 3:29. "An ungodly man digs up evil, and in his lips 
    there is a burning fire," Proverbs 16:27.</p>
<p align="justify">It is compared,</p>
<p align="justify">[6.] Not to insist on more, to the labor of a woman in 
    child-birth: Psalm 7:4, "Behold, he travails with iniquity, and has 
    conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood." What pangs do raging lasts 
    create to the soul? What cords of death does it straiten with? No small toil 
    at conceiving of sin, and bearing it in the heart, and bringing it forth; 
    but nothing in the abominable brat to satisfy the soul after all.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is hard labor, if you consider that eminent 
    emblem of our natural state, the Egyptian bondage. Their deliverance out of 
    Egypt, was typical of their spiritual deliverance by Christ, and so that 
    must needs signify man's natural state; concerning which it may be remarked,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That as the children of Israel went down to Egypt in 
    the loins of their parents, so we in Adam.—(2.) As the deliverance was 
    wrought by the angel of the covenant, by the hands of Moses the lawgiver, 
    and Aaron the priest, so this by the law and the gospel.—(3.) As Pharaoh 
    opposed the children of Israel to the utmost, so the devil opposes here. 
    Pharaoh was "the great dragon which lies in the midst of his rivers, which 
    said, my river is mine own, and I have made it for myself," Ezekiel 29:3; 
    and was a type of that great red dragon, mentioned Revelation 12:3, etc. But 
    for that which concerns this point, see Exodus 5. There you will find 
    persons laboring, and heavy laden, verses 4, 5. It is hard labor to satisfy 
    lusts, the devil's taskmasters: Ephesians 2:2, 3, "He works in the children 
    of disobedience: Among whom also we had our conversation in times past, in 
    the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the 
    mind." The Israelites had their tasks doubled, to put religion out of their 
    heads and hearts, Exodus 5:10. Lusts also must be satisfied, but with which 
    to do it is withheld, as straw was from the Israelites, verse 11. They are 
    scattered up and down among the creatures for it, but can never squeeze out 
    a sufficiency for them, even as the Israelites could not find stubble enough 
    to prepare their bricks, verses 12, 13, 14. If any appearance of 
    deliverance, the labor is made the harder. Says Paul, Romans 7:9, "I was 
    alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and 
    I died."—It is hard labor,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) If you consider the effects this labor has, 1st, On 
    the souls of men. The minds of men have a toilsome task, where sin is on the 
    throne: Isaiah 5:20, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that 
    put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, 
    and sweet for bitter." That soul must needs be in a continual fever, while 
    inordinate affections are in their strength, as in all out of Christ. A 
    fermentation of lasts cannot but make a tossed mind. Anxiety and cares of 
    the world stretch the mind, as on tenter hooks. A conceived flight, like 
    that of Ahab, 1 Kings 21:4, sets the proud man's heart in a fire of wrath 
    and revenge, and squeezes the sap out of all their enjoyments, as in the 
    instance of Haman, Esther 5:9, 13. Envy slays the silly one, lust strikes as 
    a dart through the liver; anger, malice, discontent, and the like, make a 
    man his own executioner; they are tossed between hopes, fears, and vanity, 
    tumbled hither and thither with every wind of temptation, as a ship without 
    either pilot or ballast. 2dly, Even the body is often hard put to it in this 
    labor. The covetous rises early, eats the bread of sorrow for what is not; 
    the drunkard uses his body worse than his beast. More bodies have fallen 
    sacrifices to lust, one way or another, than ever fell by the hardships 
    either in or about religion.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is base, mean, and abject labor: See Jeremiah 2:21, 
    compared with verses 23, and 24. Were we to die like beasts, we might live 
    like beasts, with our souls groveling still downward on the earth. If the 
    soul had been so narrow, as to be satisfied with less than an infinite good, 
    he had not spoke like a fool, who said to his soul, Luke 12:19, "Soul, take 
    your ease, eat, drink, and be merry," when his barns were full; in that 
    case, the swine and his soul might have fed together. But we have immortal 
    souls, capable of enjoying an infinite good, and such working in the earth 
    must needs be a base labor for a heaven-born soul, which God breathed into 
    the formed dust, but gave not to be drowned in a mass of flesh and blood, 
    nor to be only as salt, to keep the body a while from rotting.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a constant labor. The sea rests sometimes, the 
    carnal heart never: Isaiah 57:20, "But the wicked are like the troubled sea, 
    when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt." Lusts are ever 
    craving, never say they have enough; they are rolling the stone to the top 
    of the hill, which still comes down on them again and again, and creates new 
    labor; see Psalm 78:18–20, 29, 30. Two things make it a continual labor. 
    1st, Continual disappointments. These they cannot miss, seeing there is no 
    satisfaction to be had in the creatures; yet their soul still craves, hence 
    no rest, but are urged on to work again: Isaiah 57:10, "You are weary in the 
    greatness of your way, yet said you not, There is no hope." Men are like the 
    silly doves without heart, who still go to the same nest where they have 
    been hurried ever so often before, and will even beg there, where they have 
    got a thousand nay-says. 2dly, What is got in them enlarges the desire, 
    instead of satisfying it; the more that lusts are fed, the more they require 
    to maintain them. Sin is an insatiable tyrant; to labor in its service, is 
    but to cast oil into the flame. The dropsy-thirst can never be quenched.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is vain labor, they can never reach the end of it: 
    Isaiah 55:2, "Wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread, and 
    your labor for that which satisfies not?" They shall as soon fill a triangle 
    with a circle, as the heart with such things; the grave shall sooner give 
    back its dead, than the lusts of the heart say, It is enough. It is 
    impossible to find satisfaction in these things, for they are not suitable 
    to the soul, more than stones for the nourishment of the body. The body gets 
    its nourishment from the earth, because it is of the earth; the soul is from 
    Heaven, and so its satisfaction must come from thence. The things of the 
    world cannot satisfy the soul, because they have no word of divine 
    appointment, to be the staff of that bread which nourishes it; without this, 
    grass could no more satisfy the beasts, nor bread the hunger of man, than 
    sand: Matthew 4:4, "Man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that 
    proceeds out of the mouth of God." God has kept this as his own prerogative, 
    to satisfy the soul, incommunicable to the creatures conjunctly or 
    separately.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is notwithstanding costly labor; for time that 
    is precious is spent on it, which men should husband well, Ephesians 5:16, 
    "Redeeming the time, because the days are evil." By time well improved, we 
    might attain true happiness; time once gone can never be recalled. But, ah! 
    what precious hours are cast away on these things, which might be improved 
    in trading for heaven.—It is costly, because the gifts of the mind are 
    thrown away on it. Reason makes us differ from the beasts, but by the abuse 
    of it men make themselves worse than the beasts: Jeremiah 8:7, "Yes, the 
    stork in the Heaven, knows her appointed times: and the turtle, and the 
    crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their coming: but my people know 
    not the judgment of the Lord." Men's minds are employed not to know God, but 
    other things; their choice also is not fixed upon him, their affections are 
    bestowed on other things.—Finally, it is costly, because the outward good 
    things of the body, and estate in the world, are bestowed upon it. Health 
    and strength go in the pursuit of vanity, and in the service of their lusts, 
    yes, are sacrificed many times on the altar of intemperance and sensuality. 
    Riches, power, honors, as the feeding of the horse does, make people kick 
    against him who lays these things to their hands. Yes, to crown all, the 
    soul itself is thrown away upon it: Matthew 16:26, "For what is a man 
    profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a 
    man give in exchange for his soul?" Men seeking vanity, lose what is most 
    excellent; and it is dear bought that is purchased at that rate.—I shall now 
    consider what is meant by,</p>
<p align="justify">II. A laboring in the law. And to this most of what has 
    been said may be applied; and besides it may occur afterwards. I shall only 
    say these two things anent it at present.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is most hard labor, for it requires most exact 
    obedience, under pain of the curse: Galatians 3:10, "Cursed is every one 
    that continues not in all things written in the book of the law, to do 
    them." Nothing but perfect obedience is accepted, according to the law; and 
    for the least failure, it dooms the sinner to death. Now, no man can perform 
    this, and yet so foolish are men, that they think to please God with their 
    works. Again,—it is hard, because the law neither promises nor gives 
    strength. God gave Adam strength to perform, he lost it, the law does not 
    restore it; so that in this case they must make the brick, and no straw is 
    laid to their hands. This makes hard work, and so, by the Spirit, it at 
    length breaks the heart of the elect, and makes them die to the law, as a 
    wife to a rigorous husband, Galatians 2:19.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a vain and useless labor. There are much pains, 
    and yet no gain, in this labor. It is vain, in respect of the soul thriving; 
    they that labor in the law do but sow their seed in the sand; all they reap 
    is wind, which may puff them up, but cannot nourish. Why so many barren dry 
    professors? but because they are not trading with Christ, but with the law. 
    Men go to duties, and rest in them; the pipe is laid short of the 
    fountain.—It is vain, in respect of acceptance with God. It is thankless 
    work, for it supersedes the commandment to believe: John 6:29, "This is the 
    work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent." It is a sad word, 
    Romans 9:31, 32, "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has 
    not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? because they sought it 
    not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law." Turtles were accepted 
    on the altar at Jerusalem, when bullocks were rejected on those at Dan and 
    Bethel.—Farther, it is vain, in respect of answering the demands of the law, 
    Galatians 3:10. Our curtailed obedience will not answer the measuring reed 
    of the law; it demands satisfaction for what is past, and perfect obedience 
    for what is to come.—Finally, it is vain, in respect of salvation. The way 
    to Heaven by the first covenant is blocked up; the angel with the flaming 
    sword guards it, Galatians 3:10. O sirs! duties are a sandy foundation, and 
    great will be the fall of legal professors.—Let us inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Why sinners labor in these things for satisfaction, 
    and do not come to Christ?—They do so because,</p>
<p align="justify">1. They have lost God, the fountain of happiness, and 
    therefore they seek to squeeze it out of the creatures: Ephesians 2:12, 
    "Having no hope, and without God in the world." For, says God, Jeremiah 
    2:13, "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters." The sun is 
    gone down upon them, and therefore they light their candles, and compass 
    themselves with their own sparks; for the empty soul must have something to 
    feed on. The prodigal wanted bread, and therefore fed on husks. Doves' dung 
    is precious, when there is no bread in Samaria.—Sinners labor in these 
    things,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because, by the power of a strong delusion, they still 
    expect satisfaction from them; they are represented in a magnifying glass, 
    as the forbidden fruit was to our first parents, Genesis 3:5, 6. That 
    delusion took with them, is conveyed to their posterity, and will never be 
    cured until grace do it. Hence men, though they meet with a thousand 
    disappointments in these things, yet still from now hopes they renew the 
    attempt.—Sinners labor thus,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because these things are most suitable to the corrupt 
    nature: Romans 8:5, "For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of 
    the flesh." Fishes swim in the river, and care not for the most pleasant 
    meadow; swine prefer the dunghill to a palace; because everything seeks its 
    like. Lusts must be nourished with these; even the way of the law, though 
    just and good in itself, is the way that agrees best with self: Romans 3:27, 
    "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay, but by 
    the law of faith? Sinners are engaged in this labor,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because they know no better. Christ is a hidden Christ 
    to men in their natural estate; they see not his glory, fullness, and 
    excellency; they say, as in Song 5:9, "What is your beloved more than 
    another beloved?" The bird scrapes by the jewels, and takes up a corn beside 
    them, because it knows not their worth: 1 Peter 2:7, Unto you, therefore, 
    which believe, he is precious, but unto them which be disobedient, the stone 
    the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a 
    stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them that stumble at the 
    word, being disobedient."—Sinners continue this labor,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Because men naturally are enemies to the way of 
    salvation by Jesus Christ.—I now come,</p>
<p align="justify">V. To make some practical improvement of the whole.</p>
<p align="justify">Allow me, then, to expostulate with you in the most 
    earnest manner upon this subject. Why spend you your labor for that which 
    satisfies not? Isaiah 55:2. Seeing you would labor, will you not change your 
    work, and labor in God's way, that you may enter into his rest? It is a 
    wearisome labor that all out of Christ are engaged in. I would have you, 
    then, to give it over, and engage in the service of Christ. I come in his 
    name, to bid you, to beseech you, to cease from this labor. I have these 
    things to say, in regard to it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a labor God never put in your hands, but it 
    proceeds from the devil, and a corrupt heart, who yoked you to that work of 
    seeking your happiness in the creatures; in lusts, or in the law, and not in 
    God. To this some may plead, Not guilty! "We know (say such) the world is 
    but a vain thing, and we place our chief happiness in God. God forbid we 
    should be laboring in any such way!" For your conviction, however, I must 
    speak a few things. You may be deceived; many are as busy as their hands can 
    be at that work, and yet say that they are not: Proverbs 30, "There is a 
    generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their 
    filthiness."—I would inquire at you,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Who loosed you from this labor? Were you never at 
    it? If you think so, you miserably deceive yourselves, Ephesians 2:3, 
    already quoted. Since Adam went from God, to pluck his happiness off the 
    forbidden tree, all mankind have followed his steps, and abide at the work, 
    until converting grace loose them. What is conversion, but a turning to God, 
    from whom we are naturally turned away? Alas! there are few converts!—I 
    inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Was you ever heartily wearied of this labor, seeing 
    your folly in abiding so long with it? Was it ever a heavy task, that you 
    was made to groan out under? All are welcome to Christ that will come, but 
    none will ever give over their labor until they be brought to this. God must 
    bring the soul to a holy despair in this way, before it be given over, Hosea 
    2:6, 7. And then the soul, having run itself out of breath, can neither get 
    satisfaction in the creatures, nor go to God; thus it leaves the pursuit, 
    and sits down with that, Jeremiah 31:18, "You have chastised me, and I was 
    chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; turn you me, and I shall 
    be turned, for you are the Lord my God.". John 6:44, "No man can come unto 
    me, except the Father who sent me draw him."—I inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) How are you kept from returning to this labor? If 
    you have left it, it will not be without a struggle. There is a natural bias 
    in the hearts of all men this way. Alas! the strong man keeps the house with 
    the greater part; they have no struggle with the world, neither how to get 
    it, nor how to keep it out of the heart.—I inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Whence is it your greatest dissatisfaction proceeds, 
    from the world's misgiving with you, or God's hiding his face from you? from 
    your disappointments in the world, or at the throne of grace? Where the 
    disappointment goes deepest, the expectations have been greatest: "Hope 
    deferred makes the heart sick;" an infallible evidence that most men are at 
    this work. Men will not be dissatisfied for missing a thing, where they were 
    not to find it.—I inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Where do you find your greatest satisfaction and 
    pleasure, if we may call it so? In the enjoyment of God, or of the world, or 
    in getting the cravings of your lusts answered? Ah! there are not a few, 
    from whom, if the world's joy was turned away, that would not have a blythe 
    hour. They never found as much sweetness in the benefits of the covenant, as 
    in those of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) If you be not laboring thus, what are you doing 
    then? There is not, and there cannot be, an idle soul among us. If the devil 
    has us not, God has us at work; one of the two must. These things must bring 
    convictions to our breasts.</p>
<p align="justify">Allow me still farther to expostulate with you. Why spend 
    you your labor for that which satisfies not? The labor you are engaged in is 
    a thankless labor; God will not thank you for it; he says, "Who has required 
    this at your hands?" the devil pays you the wages which are due to it, which 
    are death, Romans 6:23. He has no better to give. Besides this, the labor in 
    which you are engaged, is a laboring against God: Jeremiah 2:13, "Having 
    forsaken the fountain of living waters, you have hewed out for yourselves 
    cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water." You are thus setting the 
    creature in the room of God, and accordingly God is against you in this 
    labor, so that you can never get what you are seeking from it. Oh! then be 
    exhorted to cease from, to give up with this labor. To prevail with you in 
    doing this, I would lay before you the following motives.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Why will you toil so to bring out of the creatures 
    what is not in them? Nothing but God himself is commensurable to the desires 
    of the soul; no man ever saw or will see an end of his desires, until they 
    are swallowed up in God himself. When the creatures were at their best, 
    there was the forbidden tree in paradise to teach man his happiness was not 
    in them. How much more now, when they are so much worse! Isaiah 28:20, "For 
    the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it, and the 
    covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it."</p>
<p align="justify">2. How can you think to find rest in that which is 
    restless in itself? are not all things here unstable as water, and so cannot 
    excel? Unchangeableness is a necessary property of that which makes truly 
    happy, for otherwise the very fear of losing it mars the conceived 
    happiness. Will we seek our rest in vanity, fill our hands with the wind, 
    sit easy on the rolling waves, or on the top of a wheel that is in continual 
    motion?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Did you ever meet with that among creature enjoyments, 
    that was every way as you would have had it? Dissatisfaction will proceed 
    from any defect, however small, as it was with Haman, Esther 5:13; but 
    satisfaction requires a universal concurrence of all desirables in the thing 
    that must satisfy; So it is, Song 5:16, "He is altogether lovely." Let a man 
    turn over the whole creation for satisfaction, let all be cast into his lap, 
    yet he will find, as in Job 20:22, "In the fullness of his sufficiency he 
    shall be in straits." Who ever got the rose that wanted the prickles? the 
    sweetness in any of them, that wanted a mixture of bitterness?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Do not the disappointment of hopes necessarily cleave 
    to them all? They promise more when afar off, than they afford when they are 
    come near. Mountains afar off become mole-hills when near; like a ball of 
    snow, the more closely it is held, it will grow the less.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Has not the sap been squeezed out of enjoyments to you 
    between the hand and the mouth? Hosea 9:2, "The floor and the wine-press 
    shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her." Have you not had 
    fair prospects that have been blasted in a moment, before you ever tasted of 
    them? As if they had appeared for no other end, but to raise the appetite 
    that was not to be laid with them.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Has not the loss of them often brought greater sorrow 
    than ever the having of them gave joy: while God has taken away the desire 
    of your eyes, your choice comforts. Were you not more grieved then, than you 
    were happy before?</p>
<p align="justify">7. Has not that wherein you have expected the greatest 
    comfort turned out to be the greatest cross? This was the case with Rachel, 
    who said to Jacob, "Give me children, else I die," Genesis 31 compare 
    Genesis 35:16–20. She got children, and death instantly followed.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Have not signal mercies, as well as judgments, brought 
    a sting along with them, while conscience has been whispering unto you, that 
    God was your enemy.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Was ever your heart truly at rest in these things, so 
    that you could say you desire no more? Nay, but the more of these, the more 
    are they desired.</p>
<p align="justify">10. There is another way to come at your purpose. Come to 
    Christ, and he will give you rest. This is a short way, for all is in him; 
    whatever perfections are scattered up and down among the creatures, all is 
    in him, and infinitely more. It is a sure way, for you will not miss 
    happiness if you come to him.</p>
<p align="justify">I would once more expostulate with you. Why do you spend 
    your labor for that which satisfies not? I would beseech you, in the most 
    earnest manner, not only to cease from, to give up with, your present 
    unpleasant and unprofitable labor, but also to change your labor; I would 
    have you, not only to depart from evil, but even to do good; I would call 
    upon you to engage in the service of a new master, and run in the way of his 
    commandments. You are laboring, you must be laboring, one way or other; will 
    you not then engage in the labor of true religion, real godliness? If we 
    must serve, surely it is better to serve Christ than the devil. The labor 
    that there is in religion affrights the world at it; but why should it, 
    seeing their labor is so great while out of Christ? Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We are not calling you from idleness to working, but 
    from labor to labor. And even if we were still to be slaves, better be so to 
    God than to the devil. What will men say to Christ at the last day, who will 
    be at pains in their lusts, but at none in holiness, that will bear a yoke, 
    but not Christ's yoke?</p>
<p align="justify">2. We call you, not from one base labor to another, but 
    from a base to an honorable work. Should one be called from the stone-barrow 
    to be a king's cup-bearer, it were not comparable to what is proposed.—1. 
    They will have a more honorable master.—2. More honorable fellow-laborers, 
    for the angels serve him.—3. More honorable work, God himself is glorious in 
    holiness.—4. A more honorable office; from being slaves to the devil, they 
    are made kings and priests unto God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We call upon you from vain labor, to that which shall 
    be prosperous and successful; you are laboring for happiness there, where 
    you will never get it, but here are full breasts; you are in vain striking 
    at the flinty rock for water, here is an open fountain, where none ever went 
    away disappointed.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We call you from a barren labor, where you will get 
    nothing but sorrow to take away with you, to a labor which, when you have 
    finished your works, will follow you, Revelation 14:13. Ah! miserable is 
    your present labor, Isaiah 59:5, 6. The spider wastes its affections to spin 
    its web, and when all is done, one stroke of the broom sweeps all away; it 
    is either killed in its web, or drawn by it as a rope unto death; so that it 
    does but spin its winding-sheet, or plait the rope for itself. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That the worst which can be made of it is, that 
    religion is hard labor. But this should be no prejudice against it with you, 
    seeing, as has been said, the labor out of Christ is also hard labor. But to 
    cast the balance, observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) If it is hard labor, it is worth the pains, the 
    other is not so, for, Proverbs 2:4, 5, "If you Seek her as silver, and 
    search for her as hidden treasures, then shall you understand the fear of 
    the Lord, and find the knowledge of God." There is hard labor in digging 
    stones, as well as in digging for gold; nay, it is hard labor digging 
    disappointments, that which is not; whereas the gain of the other is 
    precious and certain.—1. The promise, Proverbs 8:21, "That I may cause those 
    that love me to inherit substance, and I will fill their treasures."—2. The 
    experience of all the laborers confirms the certainty of it: "I (God) said 
    not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek you my face in vain."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If it is hard labor, it is short; if the work be 
    sore, yet it is not longsome. You shall soon rest from your labors: 
    Revelation 14:13. He who is tired with his journey, his spirits will revive 
    when near the end. The shadow of the evening makes the laborer work 
    heartily, for loosing-time is at hand. The trials, afflictions, weeping, 
    etc. of the saints, endure but for a moment. On the other hand, the labor of 
    other persons knows no end; no rest abides them, but an everlasting toil 
    under wrath that never ends.</p>
<p align="justify">6. We call you from a hard to an easy labor: "My yoke is 
    easy;" Christ has said it, we must believe it. But to clear it, consider for 
    this time, only these two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) All the difficulties in religion arise from that 
    active corruption which is in men, putting them to labor in their lusts and 
    in the law: Matthew 11:12, "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the 
    violent take it by force." Violence and force, not with God, he opposes us 
    not, but with our own corruptions. And in this sense only the scripture 
    holds out the labor of religion to be hard. But men do not state the matter 
    fairly. Lay a ton-weight upon a rolling stone, certainly it is harder to 
    roll both together than the stone alone; but is the stone therefore lighter 
    than the ton-weight? Take them separately, and absolutely, the labor in 
    religion is easy, the other hard. Men cannot bear Christ's burden. Why? 
    because they still keep on the devil's burden, and they cannot bear the one 
    above the other; that is not fair. Lay off the one, take up the other; see 
    which is lightest. A meek and a passionate man, which of them has the 
    hardest task in bearing an affront? the sober man, or the drunkard? the 
    worldly man, or he who lives above the world? The more power grace has, the 
    more easy; the more power lusts have, the more hard is the labor.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is true help in the one, not in the other.—The 
    labor in religion has outward helps; the laborers are not helpless, they 
    have a cloud of witnesses gone before them, whom they may see with their 
    crowns upon their heads, Hebrews 12:1. You are not the forlorn in hope. 
    Armies of saints bare stormed Heaven before you and have left it behind them 
    that the work is possible and the reward certain. The other have not this; 
    if they get satisfaction in their lusts, they are the first. They see 
    thousands before them, who have labored as hard as they, disappointed, and 
    are lain down in sorrow.—This labor has inward helps. Christ bears the 
    heaviest part of his own yoke; he gives strength, he works the will for the 
    work; and the work for us, when we have the will: Philippians 2:13, "For it 
    is God that works in us, both to will and to do of his good pleasure." 
    Isaiah 26:12, "You also have wrought all our works in us." The others have 
    not. True, they have that within them which puts them on to this labor, but 
    the more of the one, the harder is the other, as the wearied beast is goaded 
    by the spur, and worn out by their being beaten when no straw is allowed 
    them. But where is the help to work satisfaction and happiness out of the 
    creatures, or from the law?</p>
<p align="justify">7. We call you from a wearisome to a lightsome pleasant 
    labor. I have proved the first; for the last, see Proverbs 3:17, "Her ways 
    are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." But let us hear what 
    can be said for both.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Is there much pleasure in sin? Answer: In some there 
    is none. What pleasure has the passionate man, that kindles a fire in his 
    own bosom? What pleasure has the envious, that gnaws himself like a serpent 
    for the good that others enjoy? What pleasure has the discontented, that is 
    his own executioner. Consider the calm of spirit that the contrary graces 
    bring, and judge who has the better part.—As for those sins in which 
    pleasure is found,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] It is common to them with these creatures with whom 
    they will not desire to be ranked. For these things that gratify men's 
    sensual appetite are common to them with beasts, as gluttony, drunkenness, 
    filthiness, etc. A sow can drink, and be as drunk as the greatest drunkard, 
    and so on. And they have the better of them, as being under no law, and 
    therefore they can go the full length of their appetite.—2. They do it 
    without remorse.—3. They find satisfaction in these things, seeing they are 
    not capable of desiring greater things. Now, put these together, where is 
    the pleasure? Is it not surpassed by the pain? As to the desires of the 
    mind, these are common to them with devils. The greatest swearer, liar, and 
    proud opposer of religion, have the trade but from the second hand. The 
    devil can satisfy his curiosity better than the most curious, reason more 
    closely against religion than any atheist. Only obstinate despisers of 
    reproof and mockers surpass the devil, for the devils believe and tremble: 
    whereas for a time they do not.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The pleasure is but momentary, the pain follows hard 
    at the heels, and is eternal. What pleasure can be devised, for which a man 
    would hold his finger over a burning candle for a quarter of an hour? how 
    much more dreadful to endure eternal burnings!</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The struggle that conscience makes against 
    corruption, brings more torment than that which corruption makes against 
    grace. Conscience is more dreadfully armed than corruption; there is here as 
    much difference as there is between the hand of God and the hand of the 
    devil. See now what becomes of the pleasure!</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The labor in religion is truly pleasant. It is truly 
    holy labor; for of that we speak, and scripture-testimony proves its 
    pleasantness; see Proverbs 3:17, "Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all 
    her paths are peace." Ask David, and he will tell you, in Psalm 84; Paul, in 
    2 Corinthians 12:10.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is a labor suited to the nature of the soul, the 
    better part, their divine supernatural nature, 2 Peter 1:4. Believers are 
    partakers of a divine nature. This must needs create ease and delight; the 
    stream easily flows from the fountain; birds with pleasure fly in the air. 
    The reason of the difficulty in religion to many is, they are out of their 
    element when engaged in it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Therein the soul carries on a trade with Heaven; 
    entertains communion with God, through the Spirit of Christ, by a mutual 
    fellowship of grace and duty, the soul receiving influences, and returning 
    them again in duties: as the rain falls on the earth freely, so the waters 
    run freely toward the sea again.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Great peace of conscience usually attends this; and 
    the more labor, the more peace: Psalm 119:165, "Great peace have they who 
    love your law." Here is a feast which nothing but sin mars: 2 Corinthians 
    1:12, "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in 
    simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of 
    God, we have had our conversation in the world." Men cannot take it from us, 
    John 14:27.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Sometimes they have great manifestations of Christ, 
    evidences of the Lord's love raising a high spring-tide of joy in their 
    souls, greater than that which the whole congregation of the world enjoys, 
    Psalm 4:6, 7. It is joy unspeakable, and full of glory, 1 Peter 1:8.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) It is a lightsome way they walk in, whereas the 
    other is darksome; the light of the Lord's word shines in it. The 
    Mahom-medans have a tradition, that Moses' law and Christ's gospel were 
    written first with ink made of pure light. Sure the scripture points out 
    duty, as if it were written with a sunbeam.</p>
<p align="justify">8. We call you from a labor against yourselves, to a 
    labor for your advantage. We must either do the work of God or the devil. 
    Every sin is a new impediment in your way to Heaven, a new stone laid on the 
    wall of separation. What a mad thing is it to be working out our damnation, 
    instead of our own salvation!</p>
<p align="justify">9. We call you not to more, but to other labor. We are 
    all laborious creatures; the greatest idler is in some sort busy. Paul calls 
    even them that work not at all, busy bodies, 2 Thessalonians 3:11. Our life 
    is nothing but a continual succession of actions, even as the fire is ever 
    burning, and the rivers running. It is in some respect impossible to do more 
    than we do; the watch runs as fast when wrong as when right. Why may we not 
    then keep the highway while we are traveling.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">10. That the same pains that men are at to ruin 
    themselves, might possibly serve to save them. There are difficulties in the 
    way of sin as well as of religion. Does not sin oftentimes bereave men of 
    their night's rest? Are they more disturbed when communing with their own 
    souls, and with God? Do not men draw sin as with cart-ropes? Isaiah 5:18. 
    Why might not labor be employed in drawing the heart to God? If men would 
    but change, and suck as greedily and incessantly at the breasts of God's 
    consolations, as they do of the creatures, how happy would they be!</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider that the labor in religion is not 
    greater, nay, it is less than in sin, for religion contracts our work to one 
    thing: Luke 10:41, 42, "Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about 
    many things, but one thing is needful." Sinners have many lusts to please, 
    the saints have but one God to please; the work of religion is all of a 
    piece, sin not so. There is a sweet harmony between all the graces and all 
    the duties of religion. But lusts are quite contrary, and as they war 
    against grace, so against one another, James 4:1, "From whence come wars and 
    fightings among you? come they not from hence, even of your lusts that war 
    in your members?" So that the sinner is dragged by one lust one way, by 
    another, another. And how hard is it to serve contrary masters!</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">I now proceed to the consideration of,</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine II. That all who are out of Christ, are under an 
    heavy burden, which, by all their labor, they cannot shake off.</p>
<p align="justify">In illustrating of which, I shall only,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Offer a few observations.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to offer a few observations; such as,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That Satan has a load on all out of Christ; it is a 
    load of sin; Isaiah 1:4, "Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity." 
    This load is twofold:</p>
<p align="justify">1st, A load of guilt, Genesis 4:13, "And Cain said unto 
    the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear," (Hebrews "sin.") Guilt 
    is the heaviest load ever was on the shoulders of men or angels. The 
    scriptures hold it forth,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As debt. He who is in debt is under a burden. It is 
    the worst of debts, we cannot pay it, nor escape the hands of our creditor; 
    yes, we deny the debt, care not for count and reckoning, we wave our 
    creditor as much as we can; so it stands uncancelled. But it is a debt that 
    must be paid: 2 Thessalonians 1:9, "Who shall be punished with everlasting 
    destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." 
    They shall pay what justice demands.—It is represented,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As a yoke tied fast on the sinner's neck; hence 
    pardon is called a loosing of it, guilt being, as it were, cords of wrath, 
    whereby the sinner is bound over to God's wrath. Pardon is also called 
    remission or relaxation: Romans 3:25, "To declare his righteousness for the 
    remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God."—It is 
    pointed out,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) As a burden: Hosea 14:2, "Take away all iniquity." 
    Take away, namely, as a burden off a man's back. Hence Christ is said to 
    have borne our sins, the burden of the elect's guilt being laid on his back. 
    What a heavy load is it!</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It makes the whole creation groan, Romans 8:22. It 
    caused them take their pains five thousand years since, and they are not yet 
    delivered of their burden. All the groans that ever men gave on earth and in 
    Hell were under this burden; it sunk the whole world into ruin: "Christ took 
    our nature," to prevent us going down to the pit, Hebrews 2:16; (Greek, 
    "caught hold"), as of a drowning man, not of the whole seed of Adam, for 
    great part of it fell to the ground, but of the seed of Abraham, the elect.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) This load sunk the fallen angels, made them fall as 
    stars from Heaven to the bottomless pit. And what a load was it to Christ, 
    that made him sweat as it were great drops of blood, that made him groan and 
    die!—It is,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, A load of servitude to lusts, which of themselves 
    are heavy burdens; the very remainder of which made the apostle groan: 
    Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body 
    of this death?" What greater burden can be, than for a man to have a swarm 
    of unmortified corruptions hanging about him, whose cravings he is still 
    obliged to answer. This is that which creates that weary labor, of which we 
    have already spoken; better a man were burdened with serpents sticking in 
    his flesh, than with these.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The law has a load on the Christless sinner; and that,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A load of duties, as great and numerous as the 
    commandment, which is exceeding broad, can lay on. Though they perform them 
    not, yet they are bound upon them by the commandment: and they shall sooner 
    dissolve the whole fabric of the world, than make void this commandment. 
    This is a heavy load. True, they that are in Christ have a yoke of duties 
    laid on them, but not by the law, but by Christ. The difference is great; 
    the law exacts perfect obedience, but gives no strength; Christ, when 
    claiming obedience to his law, gives strength for the performance, which 
    makes it an easy obedience.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A load of curses: Galatians 3:10, "Cursed is every 
    one that continues not in all things written in the book of the law, to do 
    them." Every commandment of the law is fenced with a curse, denounced 
    against the breakers of it. How great must be the load, then, where every 
    action is a sin, and every sin brings a curse! This is a heavy load, that 
    makes the earth reel to and fro, like a drunkard, under the weight of it.—I 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That God has a load on the Christless sinner, that is, 
    of wrath: Ephesians 2:3, "And were by nature children of wrath." This is an 
    abiding load: John 3:36, "He who believes not the Son, shall not see life, 
    but the wrath of God abides on him." This load is far heavier than mountains 
    of brass; it is weightier than can be expressed.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I am now to make some practical improvement. From 
    what has been said, I infer,</p>
<p align="justify">I. That every one must bear his own harden. There is no 
    getting through the world with an even-up back. If people will not take up 
    Christ's burden, they will bear a heavier one; if they will not be Christ's 
    servants, they must be slaves to their lusts; if they will not take on the 
    yoke of holiness, they shall bear a load of wrath; if people will still slip 
    the yoke of Christ, God will wreathe the yoke of their transgressions about 
    their neck, that they shall not get shaken off. We have given sorry 
    entertainment to Christ's burden: it is too likely we may come to get one of 
    another sort. The entertainment we have given to Christ's burden is like to 
    wreathe a threefold yoke about our necks. For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) We have had little taste for the preaching of 
    Christ, the great mysteries of the gospel. The preaching of sin and duty, as 
    they call it, has been more desired than the preaching of the vitals of 
    religion. I fear it be the plague of the generation, to get such preaching 
    of sin and duty, as that the doctrine of Christ and free grace fall through 
    between the two, and the gospel be turned into a system of morality with us.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We have little valued pure worship, it has been a 
    burden to us, and we have ground to fear a burden of another sort, the trash 
    of men's inventions in God's worship. There is an attempt already made to 
    set up Dagon by the ark of God; and God knows where it may stop. If the 
    ceremonies appointed by God himself were such, Acts 15:10, "as neither our 
    fathers nor we were able to bear, what must they be that are laid on by men?</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) God took the yoke of the enemy's oppression off our 
    necks, for which we have been very unthankful. It is very like that God 
    intends to lay it on again, that we may know the worth of our despised 
    mercy: Hosea 11:4, 5, "I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love, 
    and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid 
    meat unto them. He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian 
    shall be his king, because they refused to return."—We may hence lament,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The case of the generation living without Christ, 
    heavy laden, but not sensible of their burden, Isaiah 1:4; compare verse 3, 
    both already quoted. Sin sits light upon people, they reign as kings without 
    Christ; the law's authority does not draw them away to Christ; and though 
    wrath lies heavy, they feel it not. Oh! what is the matter? They never feel 
    the weight of it, nor once seriously put the question to themselves, What 
    shall we do to be saved? They are taken up with so many things, that their 
    soul's case cannot come into their minds. Again, they have a dead soul, and 
    a stupid conscience, they complain not. Men's spiritual senses are bound up, 
    and a seared conscience, got by sinning over the belly of daily warnings, is 
    the plague of the generation. Well, but when conscience is awakened, people 
    will find their sores; when drops of wrath fall on the conscience, it will 
    make a fearful hissing: Isaiah 33:14, "The sinners in Zion are afraid, 
    fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites; who among us shall dwell with the 
    devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"—I only 
    exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">3. To labor to be sensible of your burden, and to be 
    concerned to get rid of it. Is there not a burden of sin upon your backs? 
    mind that you have to do with it.—Consider, That heaven's gate is strait, 
    and will not let in a man with a burden of unpardoned, unmortified sin on 
    his back. The wide gate is that which only will afford room for such. Off it 
    must be, or they will never see heaven.—Consider again, all that they can do 
    will not shake it off, the bonds of iniquity are stronger than to be broken 
    with their weak arms; all the moisture of their bodies, dissolved into 
    tears, will not wash it off.—Consider, finally, it will never fall off of 
    its own accord. Age coming on may wear off the violence of some lusts, but 
    the guilt remains, and the root of sin. Death itself will not put it off, 
    for it will lie down, and also rise with you, and cleave to you through 
    eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">What shall we do then? What more proper than come to 
    Christ? He, and he only, can ease you of your burden. This brings us forward 
    to the invitation itself: "Come unto me, all you that labor, and are heavy 
    laden;" which we have expressed in</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. III. That whatever sinful and vain labors 
    sinners are engaged in, whatever be the loads which are lying on them, they 
    are welcome to Christ; he calls them to come to him, and in coming they 
    shall obtain rest.—Or more shortly thus—</p>
<p align="justify">The devil's drudges and burden-bearers, even the worst of 
    them, are welcome to come to Christ, and shall find rest in him.—In opening 
    which, I shall in general show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is meant by coming to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall more particularly attempt to unfold the 
    import of the invitation, in the several points deducible from the text.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall consider what is the rest which Christ 
    promises, and will give to such as come to him.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I shall make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall show what in general is meant by coming to 
    Christ. To come to Christ is to believe on him: John 6:35, "And Jesus said 
    unto them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall never hunger, 
    and he who believes on me shall never thirst." Unbelief is the soul's 
    departing, not from a living law, but from the living God, Hebrews 3:12. 
    Christ is the Lord, God is in him, he calls sinners to come to him; faith 
    answers the call, and so brings back the soul to God in Christ. Now, the 
    scripture holds forth Christ many ways answering to this notion of coming to 
    him by faith. And that you may see your privilege and call, I shall hold 
    forth some of these to you.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The devil's drudges and burden-bearers are welcome to 
    Christ, as the great gift of the Father to sinners, to come and take it: 
    John 3:16, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that 
    whoever believes on him might not perish, but have everlasting life." The 
    world was broken by Adam; God sends Christ as an up-making gift, and the 
    worst of you are welcome to him, yes, he bodes (urges) himself upon you. 
    Come to him, then, you broken impoverished souls, that have nothing left you 
    but poverty, wants, and debt.—Such are to come to him,</p>
<p align="justify">2. As the great Physician of souls: Matthew 9:12, "They 
    that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick." Christ in the 
    gospel comes into the world as to an hospital of sin-sick souls, ready to 
    administer a cure to those that will come to him for it. Our diseases are 
    many, all of them deadly, but he is willing and able to cure them all. He is 
    lifted up on the pole of the gospel, and says, "Look unto me, and be you 
    saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else," 
    Isaiah 45:22.—Such should come to him,</p>
<p align="justify">3. As the satisfying food of the soul: Isaiah 55:1–3, 
    "Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters; and he who has no 
    money, come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy wine and milk, without money, 
    and without price. Wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread? 
    and your labor for that which satisfies not? hearken diligently unto me, and 
    eat that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline 
    your ear, and come unto me; hear and your soul shall live; and I will make 
    an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David." The soul 
    is an empty thing, and has hungry and thirsty desires to be satisfied; the 
    creatures cannot satisfy, Christ can: John 6:35, "My flesh, (says he,) is 
    meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." God has made a feast of fat 
    things in Christ, in him all the cravings of the soul may be satisfied; 
    there are no angels to guard the tree of life; no seal on this fountain: 
    Zechariah 13:1, "In that day, there shall be a fountain opened to the house 
    of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity." 
    There is no inclosure about this flower of glory, Canticles 2:1. Here is the 
    carcass—where are the eagles that should gather together?—Such come to 
    Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">4. As one on whom they may rest: Song 8:5, "Who is this 
    that comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved?" We are not able 
    to do our own torn, but on him we should rely; 2 Chronicles 16:8. "Because 
    you did rely on the Lord, he delivered your enemies into your hand." Guilt 
    mates the mind in a fluctating condition. By coming to Jesus we are stayed, 
    as is a ship at anchor. In, or from ourselves, we have nothing for 
    justification and sanctification. God has laid help upon one that is mighty; 
    the weary soul is welcome to rest in him.—Such come to him,</p>
<p align="justify">5. As one on whom they may cast their burdens: Psalm 
    55:22, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he shall sustain you." The soul is 
    heavy laden, while out of Christ: Jesus holds out the everlasting arms, 
    Deut, 33:27, faith settles down on them, casting the soul's burden upon 
    them; "Come (says he) with all your misery, debts, beggary, and wants, I 
    have shoulders to bear them all; I will take on the burden, you shall get 
    rest." He is content to marry the poor widow.—Such come to him,</p>
<p align="justify">6. As one in whom they may find refuge: Hebrews 6:18, 
    "Who have fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before us." The law, 
    as the avenger of blood, pursues the soul. Christ is that city of refuge, 
    where none can have power against them. The gates are never shut; here is a 
    refuge from the law, from justice, and from the revenging wrath of God. Here 
    is shelter under the wings of Christ: how, willing is he to gather his 
    people, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings!—Such come to him,</p>
<p align="justify">7. As one in whom the soul may at length find rest: Psalm 
    37:7, "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him." The soul out of Christ 
    is in a restless state, still shifting from one creature to another, not 
    finding content in any. But by coming to Christ, the soul takes up its 
    eternal rest in him, and he becomes a covering of the eyes to it. We are 
    like men in a fever, still changing beds; like the dove out of the ark, we 
    have no rest, until we come to Christ. Such come to Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">8. As a husband: Matthew 22:4, "All things are ready, 
    come unto the marriage. Your Maker is content to be your husband, Psalm 
    45:10. Ministers are sent, as Abraham's servant, to seek a spouse for 
    Christ. He is willing to match with the worst, the meanest of you; he seeks 
    no dowry; he is the richest, the most honorable, the most tender and loving 
    husband.—Such come to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, As a powerful deliverer. Christ stands at our 
    prison doors, as in Isaiah 61:1, "proclaiming liberty to the captive, and 
    the opening of the prison to them that are bound." All who come to him, as 
    in 2 Corinthians 8:5, first give their own selves unto the Lord. Whoever 
    will come to Jesus, must give up themselves to him. It is the work of faith, 
    to give up the soul to Christ, that he may save it, that he may open the 
    prison doors, take the prey from the mighty, and deliver the lawful captive.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING very briefly considered what it is to come to 
    Christ, by pointing out under what characters we are to come to him, and the 
    consequent improvement which this coming denotes, in order to explain the 
    invitation here given more particularly, I go on, as was proposed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To unfold its import, viewed in the several parts of 
    which the text consists.</p>
<p align="justify">You will accordingly observe, that there is in the text, 
    the characters invited,—the "laboring and heavy laden;" there is the 
    invitation itself, "Come unto me;" by whom the invitation is given, by 
    Christ; and the encouragement proposed to their complying with it, "I will 
    give you rest."—All these considered complexly, in our view, import the 
    following things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. That all men naturally are at a distance from God; if 
    it were not so, they needed not be bid come. This is not a distance of 
    place, but a relative distance, a distance of opposition, which lies in 
    these three things.,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The original union between God and man is blown up; 
    they were united in a covenant of works, whereby they had common friends and 
    enemies. This was the first marriage-covenant, but Adam broke it, and so 
    broke off from God. Hence God drove him out of paradise, as a divorced woman 
    out of the house of her husband, spoiled of all her ornaments.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The hearts of men are naturally turned from God, and 
    are a mass of enmity against him: Romans 8:7, "Because the carnal mind is 
    enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed 
    can be." There is a perfect contrariety between the nature of God and ours. 
    That first sin of Adam has been a little leaven, that has quite soured the 
    whole lump of mankind: so that we are not only away, but far off from the 
    Lord: Ephesians 2:13, "Without God in the world."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The soul is still going farther and farther from God 
    in the whole of our life, while in that state: Hebrews 3:12, "Take heed, 
    brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in 
    departing from the living God." Every sin is a step farther from God; 
    therefore the gospel-call is after them that are running away, that they may 
    return to the Lord. We are on the road leading to destruction, and moving 
    very swiftly, as the water, the more it runs, the farther it is removed from 
    the fountain-head whence it came.</p>
<p align="justify">From what has been now observed, we may learn the 
    sinfulness and misery of our natural state. It is our duty and privilege to 
    be near God; to be far from him must then be our sin and misery. No wonder, 
    then, we be dead, that we can do no good while in this state of separation 
    from God. God also is departed from us, Jeremiah 6:7. Will not this end in 
    eternal separation, if we return not?—The invitation imports,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That if you have a mind to meet and unite with God 
    again, you must meet with him in Christ, and unite with God in him. "All 
    things (says Jesus) are delivered unto me of my Father. Come therefore unto 
    me, all you that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." 
    Would you have peace, pardon, and every blessing? you must come to him for 
    it. God has condescended so far to forward the meeting, that he has come 
    down, and dwelt in the flesh of Christ, there to wait sinners, to promote 
    their meeting with him: 2 Corinthians 5:19, "God is in Christ, reconciling 
    the world unto himself." He needed not to have come so far, but of his own 
    free grace he has done it; but be will never come farther. There, then, and 
    only there, sinners may meet him; God is in him, and is there to make up the 
    peace through him; and if you will not come to him, and meet God there, you 
    shall never see his face in peace.—Here it may be proper to show, that this 
    is God's contrivance for re-uniting with sinners that are by sin far from 
    him; and that there is no other way. This appears,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) From plain scripture-testimony: John 14:6, "I (said 
    Jesus) am the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes to the Father, but 
    by me." He is the great Secretary of Heaven, by whom alone you can be 
    brought into the King's presence: Ephesians 2:18, "For through him we both 
    have access by one Spirit unto the Father." The keys of the house of David 
    hang at his belt.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If there were any other way of coming to God again, 
    it behooved to be one of these two: either, 1st, By satisfying the law 
    according to the first covenant; but that is impossible for us, seeing we 
    cannot give perfect obedience, nor satisfy justice for the sins we are 
    guilty of, Galatians 3:10, often quoted: Or, 2dly, in a way of mere mercy, 
    for mercy's sake. But this cannot be: for,—The justice of God necessarily 
    requires satisfaction, and God will not dispense his mercy in prejudice of 
    his justice: Psalm 5:5, "The foolish shall not stand in your sight, and you 
    hate all the workers of iniquity." One part of the character of God is, that 
    "he will by no means clear the guilty," namely, without satisfaction. The 
    law is already made, fenced with threatenings of eternal wrath, and it is 
    broken; God's justice and truth are both, in consequence, engaged to see the 
    threatening accomplished.—Again, God's last will and testament is already 
    made, and sealed by the death of his Son, but there is no such way proposed 
    in it; no mercy but in Christ; yes, God has declared they shall have no 
    mercy that come not to Christ: Matthew 16:16, "He who believes, and is 
    baptized, shall be saved; but he who believes not shall be 
    damned."—Moreover, the very providing of this way makes it evident that 
    there is no other. Were there another way of bringing sinners to God, would 
    not an infinitely wise God, and a loving Father, have fetched a compass, and 
    dispensed with the blood of his own Son? If any could have been spared, it 
    might have been expected that He would; but, Romans 8:32, "God spared not 
    his own Son, but delivered him up to the death for us all."—Finally, ever 
    since Adam was driven out of paradise, this has been held forth as the only 
    way, as in the first promise. Abel's acceptance was by it, Hebrews 11:4. 
    Jesus is the only propitiatory, where God speaks in mercy to sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">Here I might also show, what a suitable contrivance this 
    is, for the purpose of uniting God and sinners.—It is most suitable: For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is suited to God's honor, the glory of his divine 
    perfections: Hebrews 2:10, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and 
    by whom are all things, in bringing many souls unto glory, to make the 
    Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." God, with the safety 
    of his honor, may be reconciled to the worst of sinners in Christ; yes, the 
    glory of all his perfections shines forth most illustriously in the mystery 
    of Christ; there would be no safety in this plan, if it were not so.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is suited to the comfort of the sinner, the 
    contrivance being such, that it answers all the necessities of the sinner: 
    Revelation 3:18, "I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that 
    you may be rich, and white clothing, that you may be clothed, and that the 
    shame of your nakedness do not appear, and anoint your eyes with eye-salve, 
    you then may see." So that the soul may confidently come to God by Christ, 
    who can do such things for it.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us more particularly consider this contrivance of the 
    sinner's coming to, and uniting with God, by coming to Christ.—With this 
    view, we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That Christ is a substantial Mediator, partaking of 
    both natures. He is the Father's fellow, yet bone of our bone. The worst of 
    men are nearer to Heaven than the fallen angels; for "Jesus took not upon 
    him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham." Here is the true ladder, 
    the foot of which, his humanity, is set on earth, the top of which, his 
    divinity, reaching to Heaven, Genesis 28 above which the Lord stands making 
    the covenant. If it consisted with the honor of God, for the divine nature 
    to take into personal union with itself the human nature, it is equally 
    consistent to take men into mystical union with the divine person of our 
    Immanuel, upon this foundation. And when sinners see the first, they are 
    encouraged to look for the second in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In Christ justice is satisfied: He said, "It is 
    finished." In him God has presented to him a sacrifice to offended justice, 
    a satisfaction to his law. God exacted, and he answered, until the utmost 
    farthing was paid: Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of 
    the law, having been made a curse for us;" and he got up the discharge. The 
    sinner has in him a defense against justice, an everlasting righteousness, 
    in which God may behold the sinner, and be well pleased with him, and the 
    sinner may see God, and yet live. Mercy has a free vent in him, and pardons 
    run freely through his blood. "We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the covenant is made with him in his blood; and 
    all the promises of the covenant, all the benefits of it, sinners have at 
    the second hand, Galatians 3:16. God has laid up all in him: 2 Corinthians 
    1:20, "For all the promises of God in him, are yes, and in him amen, to the 
    glory of God by us." Sinners are to come to him for saving blessings, and to 
    take them from him as the purchase of his blood: John 5:22. Our 
    righteousness, pardon, peace, are all in him, "who of God is made unto us 
    wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption," 1 Corinthians 1:30. 
    Grace is in him, "for of his fullness have all we received, and grace for 
    grace," John 1:16. Glory is from him: "The Lord will give grace and glory."</p>
<p align="justify">4. By this means, the grace of God is exalted. It is to 
    the praise of the glory of his grace. This is necessary for the glory of God 
    in the second covenant, and for the sinner's comfort, which could not be 
    promoted nor secured except in this way.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Here the matter is made sure; God is sure of the 
    sinner, and the sinner sure of his union with God: such as are built upon 
    this foundation, made members of him, Jesus will lose none of them. From 
    what has been stated, I would infer,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That all who come to Christ shall come back to the 
    state of union and communion with God, through him who knits Heaven and 
    earth, rent asunder by Adam's sin. Let your sins be never so great, these 
    shall not stop it, for the cry of his blood is louder in God's ears, than 
    that of our sins.—Infer,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That they that never come to Christ, shall never see 
    God in mercy. Meet they may, but it will be a sad meeting, a meeting as of a 
    malefactor with an inexorable judge, dry stubble with consuming fire, where 
    our leaf will be as rottenness, and the blossoms of Christless duties go up 
    as dust.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus you see there is but one door to God; but what if it 
    be shut? No; it is open. For the invitation imports,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That sinners are welcome to come to Christ, that they 
    may unite with God by him; Christ is ready to receive you on your coming.—As 
    to this, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Christ has made a long journey to meet with sinners. 
    What brought him out of the Father's bosom into the world, but to bring 
    sinners to himself, and so back to God again? What was the errand of the 
    great Shepherd, but to seek them, even them that were straying on the 
    mountains of vanity? Luke 19, "For the Son of man is come to seek and to 
    save that which was lost."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) How dear it cost him to purchase your union with God 
    by him, 2 Corinthians 5:21, "For he has made him, who knew no sin, to be sin 
    for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." Though you 
    should little value his blood, he will not undervalue it himself; for 
    sinners it was shed, and will he not welcome the reward of it, the fruit of 
    the travail of his soul? Why were his arms stretched on a cross, and his 
    side pierced through, but that he might open up our way to God?—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) How near lost sinners lay to Christ's heart, that he 
    would refuse no hardship, in order that he might see the travail of his 
    soul. His love was ancient love; from eternity, "his delights were with the 
    sons of men," Proverbs 8:31; see his choice, Hebrews 12:2; and therefore, 
    when he was to suffer, his heart was upon the work: Luke 12:50, "I have a 
    baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened until it be 
    accomplished?" Jacob's love to Rachel showed itself by his long service for 
    her, which seemed to him but a few days.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Why has he set up a ministry in the world, but to 
    bring sinners to himself? Matthew 22:3, "And he sent forth his servants to 
    call them that were bidden to the wedding." He would not have left 
    ambassadors to treat with sinners in his name, if he were not willing to 
    receive them, nay, were he not anxious that they should come to 
    him.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) He heartily invites you to come to him; as in the 
    text; in Isaiah 55:1, "Ho! every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, 
    and he who has no money, come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy wine and 
    milk, without money and without price;" and in Revelation 3:2, "Behold, I 
    stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I 
    will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." These 
    invitations look not like one who cares not whether sinners come or not, far 
    less like one who is not willing to receive them. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) The earnestness of the invitations; he deals with 
    sinners as one that will not take a nay-say: Luke 14:23, "Compel them to 
    come in, that my house may be filled." He not only knocks, but stands and 
    knocks: strives with sinners by his word, his providences, and the motions 
    of his Spirit; answers their objections, Isaiah 55:1, and downwards; while 
    none can refuse, but those that rush willfully on in their ruin; as in 
    Ezekiel 33:11, "As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the 
    death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn 
    you, turn you, from your wicked ways, for why will you die, O house of 
    Israel?" Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) How he complains of these that will not come: John 
    5:40, "And you will not come unto me, that you might have life." "He speaks 
    as one that has been working in vain: Isaiah 49:4, "I have labored in vain, 
    I have spent my strength for nothing and in vain." He complains of 
    Jerusalem, Matthew 23:37; yes, he weeps over obstinate incorrigible sinners; 
    Luke 19:41, 42, "And when he came near, he beheld the city, and wept over 
    it, saying, if you had known, even you at least in this your day, the things 
    which belong unto your peace; but now they are hidden from your eyes." Sure 
    he has lost no affections of compassion by going to Heaven; they flow out as 
    freely and tenderly as ever.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(8.) He commands sinners to come to him. The invitations 
    are all commands; they are most peremptory: 1 John 3:23, "This is his 
    commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son, Jesus Christ." 
    If you do it not, you can do nothing that will please him: John 6:29, "Jesus 
    answered and said unto them, this is the work of God, that you believe on 
    him whom he has sent." And he leaves it on us with the most dreadful 
    certification: Mark 16:16, "He who believes not shall be damned." And hence 
    it follows, that the hearers of the gospel who perish, are inexcusable; the 
    door was open, but they would not enter in.—The invitation imports,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That the worst of sinners are welcome to Christ: 
    however great their burden of sin and misery be, it is no hindrance in their 
    way to come to Christ. Where all are invited, none are excluded. But upon 
    this I do not enlarge here, having insisted upon it at some length, when 
    discoursing upon Joel 3:10. All that I shall just now observe is, that this 
    consideration shall shame you out of your slighting of Christ, and strike at 
    the root of that bitter despair which lodges in the breasts of many, who are 
    yet far enough from absolute despair of their case.—The invitation imports,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That Christ allows sinners to come to him, rather on 
    account of the desperateness of their case, than otherwise: "Come unto me, 
    all you that labor, and are heavy laden." As if he had said, "You have been 
    laboring, and yet can get no rest; let that engage you to come to me. Sit 
    down and consider your case, if nothing else will prevail with you, let the 
    desperateness of your disease bring you to the great Physician." You are 
    cordially welcome to do so. For, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That it is for this very end God discovers the worst 
    of a man's case to himself, drives them to their wit's end, in order that he 
    may begin to be wise: Hosea 2:6, "Therefore, behold I will hedge up your way 
    with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths." Verse 7, 
    "Then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was 
    it better with me than now."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That Christ has made offers of himself to those in 
    the worst of cases: Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let us reason together, says 
    the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow: 
    though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." And he holds out 
    himself as a Savior in particular for these, Revelation 3:17, 18; Isaiah 
    55:7.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Such have been made welcome, who have employed such 
    arguments with him: Psalm 25:11, "For your name's sake, pardon mine 
    iniquity, for it is very great;" and so also in the case of the Canaanite 
    woman with Jesus, Matthew 15:26–28. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) He has the more glory, the more desperate that the 
    case is, none see the stars so well as from the bottom of a deep pit. His 
    power is the greater to pardon, his grace to overcome, when there is most 
    occasion for these being displayed; it is the worst of diseases, that do 
    best proclaim the Physician's skill, when a cure is effected.</p>
<p align="justify">From what has been just now observed, we may see and 
    admire the divine condescension, that Christ is so willing to take the 
    sinner in, when he sees himself cast out at all doors, can get rest nowhere 
    else; that he will give him rest, and embrace the sinner, when he sees he 
    can do no better, when he can make no other shift.—Hence also learn, how to 
    make an excellent use of the badness of your case, even to take op these 
    stumbling-blocks, and break up heaven's door with them; to make a virtue of 
    necessity, and the more that the burden presseth, the more readily to go to 
    Christ with it. True, it is never right coming to Christ, which sense of 
    misery alone produces; but love may thus crown a work which terror begins, 
    and which when from the Holy Spirit it leads to. In a word, you are 
    absolutely inexcusable, that come not to Christ, be your case what it will.</p>
<p align="justify">I now go on to what was proposed,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Which was, to explain the nature of that rest which 
    Christ graciously promises, and which he actually gives to such laboring and 
    heavy-laden sinners, as truly come to him. And here it must be observed, 
    that there is a rest which they may have in Christ; a rest here, and a rest 
    hereafter. In this life there is a fourfold rest to be had in Christ.—A 
    rest,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In respect of sin. The rest Christ gives from sin is 
    twofold.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A rest from the guilt of sin. Guilt is a poison, 
    infecting the conscience, which makes it so to smart that it can get no 
    rest, as in the case of Cain and Judas, and also with those, Acts 2:37, 
    "They were pricked in their hearts." This, when it festers and becomes 
    immoveable, is the gnawing worm in Hell. Christ gives rest from it, Hebrews 
    9:4; his blood purges the conscience from dead works. The conscience, when 
    like the raging sea, is stilled by him: Isaiah 57:18, 19, "I have seen his 
    ways, and will heal him; I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him 
    and to his mourners. I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace to him 
    that is far off, and to him that is near, says the Lord; and I will heal 
    him." The soul finds this rest in the wounds of Christ, for, "by his stripes 
    we are healed," Isaiah 53:5. The blood of Jesus Christ, God's own Son, 
    cleanses from all sin. The soul diped in this fountain is washed from this 
    poison, and is delivered from this sting of guilt.—There is rest,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) From the reigning power of sin: Romans 6:14, "For 
    sin shall not have dominion over you." Sin on the throne makes a confused 
    restless soul, like the raging sea, continually casting out mire and dirt. 
    Christ, by his Spirit's efficacy, turns sin off the throne, and restores 
    rest to the soul. He casts down these Egyptian taskmasters, and thus the 
    soul enters into his rest: Hebrews 4:10, "For he who is entered into his 
    rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his." In the 
    day of the soul's coming to Christ, he acts like a King, setting all in 
    order in the kingdom, that was a mere heap of confusion before his accession 
    to the throne.—There is in Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Rest from the law; not that he makes them lawless, but 
    that he takes off them the insupportable yoke of the law, and gives them 
    ease.—He does so,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) From the burden of law-duties, which are exacted in 
    all perfection, under the pain of the curse, while no strength is furnished 
    with which to fulfill them: Rom 7:4, "Wherefore, my brethren you also are 
    become dead to the law by the body of Christ." This is the yoke on all men's 
    necks naturally; Christ put his neck in this yoke, and bare it, satisfying 
    the law's demands completely, and so frees all that come to him from this 
    service. Christ carries his people without the dominions of the law.—He does 
    so,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) From the curse of the law: Galatians 3:13. "Christ 
    has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us." 
    Romans 8:1. "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in 
    Christ Jesus." These that are come to him, he takes from off them that curse 
    which they are under, and gives them his blessing, which he has merited; 
    carries them from Mount Sinai to Mount Zion, where they hear the blood of 
    Jesus speaking peace, silencing the demand of vengeance, and affording a 
    refuge for the oppressed.—There is in Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Rest from that weary labor in which persons are 
    engaged when in quest of happiness, leading the souls to the enjoyment of 
    God: Psalm 116:7, "Return unto your rest, O my soul! for the Lord has dealt 
    bountifully with you." The soul, restless in seeking happiness among the 
    creatures, he leads to God, the fountain of all perfection, opening their 
    eyes, as he did Hagar's, to see the well, and bringing them into the 
    enjoyment of all good in him, uniting the soul with himself; where,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The soul finds a rest of satisfaction from Christ, 
    which it can find in no other quarter whatever, for the soul finds a rest of 
    satisfaction from him, when by faith it is set on the breasts of his 
    consolations. In these there is an object adequate to all the desires of the 
    soul answering all its needs; thus, Proverbs 14:14, "A good man shall be 
    satisfied from himself." There is the triumph of faith in the enjoyment of 
    God: Philippians 4:18. "But I have all and abound."—The soul finds,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A rest in him of settled abode, insomuch, that the 
    soul goes not abroad as it was accustomed, among the creatures for 
    satisfaction; John 4:14, "But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give 
    him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in 
    him a well of water springing up to everlasting life." Christ becomes 
    precious to the soul. Like the released lady, that did not so much as look 
    on or take notice of Cyrus, notwithstanding of the noble part he acted, but 
    on him (her husband) who said, he would redeem her with his own life. "The 
    kingdom of Heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field, the which when 
    a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof, goes and sells all that he 
    has, and buys that field."—There is in Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Rest in respect of troubles. Christ gives rest,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) From troubles in the world, now and then, when he 
    sees meet: Psalm 34:19, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the 
    Lord delivers them out of them all." Zion's God reigns, be on the throne who 
    will; and when he speaks peace, neither devils nor men can create his people 
    trouble; for, Lamentations 3:37, "Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, 
    when the Lord commands it not? There is no such security from trouble as the 
    godly have, but that is from Heaven, and not from earth. Therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ gives rest in trouble: John 16:33, "These 
    things I have spoken unto you, that in me you might have peace. In the world 
    you shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the 
    world." You may, nay, you shall, meet with troubles, but he can make you get 
    sweet rest in your souls; even when you are on a bed of thorns as to the 
    outward man, he can give his people a sweet rest even in troubles. How can 
    these things be? may some say.—In answer,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Christ gives his people in trouble an inward rest, 
    that is an inward tranquility of mind in midst of trouble: Psalm 3:1–5, 
    "Lord! how are they increased that trouble me? many are they that rise 
    against me. Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in 
    God. Selah. But you, O Lord, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter 
    up of mine head. I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of 
    his holy hill. Selah. I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for the Lord 
    sustained me." Christ can make the believer as a vessel of water tossed here 
    and there, yet not jumbled. There was a greater calm with the three children 
    in the furnace, than with the king in the palace, Daniel 3:24. Fear may be 
    on every side when there is none in the center, because Christ makes a 
    blessed calm in their hearts.—Christ gives in trouble,</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] A rest of contentment: "I have learned, (says Paul, 
    Philippians 4:11,) in whatever state I am, therewith to be content." This is 
    not only the duty, but the privilege of believers. If the lot of the godly 
    be not brought up to their spirit, Christ will bring their spirit down to 
    their lot; and there must needs be rest there, where the spirit of the man 
    and his lot meet in one: Psalm 37:19, "They shall not be ashamed in the evil 
    time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied."—Then follows,</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] A rest of satisfaction in the enjoyment of better 
    things. What though the world has a bitter taste in their mouths? Christ can 
    hold a cop of consolation to them in that very instant, the sweetness of 
    which will master the bitterness of the other: "Your sorrow (says he, John 
    16:20,) shall be turned into joy." "Our rejoicing (says Paul, 2 Corinthians 
    1:12,) is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and 
    godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have 
    had our conversation in the world." They are not indeed stocks, to be 
    unmoved with troubles, but their sorrow is so drowned in spiritual joy, that 
    it is "but as sorrow," 2 Corinthians 6:10, "As sorrowful yet always 
    rejoicing;" even as the joy of the wicked is "but as joy." Troubles may 
    raise a mutiny of lusts within, but the peace of God quells them: "It keeps 
    their hearts and minds through Jesus Christ,"—Christ gives,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) A rest in confidence of a blessed issue: 2 Timothy 
    1:12, "For the which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless, I am 
    not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded, that he is 
    able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day." The 
    soul in Christ has the promise to rest on; and however dark a side the cloud 
    may have, faith will see through it; though they may sink deep, they will 
    never drown, who have a promise to bear them up.—Thus, you see, they rest in 
    Christ in trouble; and this rest is a most secure rest, where people may 
    rest confidently: Isaiah 26:3, "You will keep him in perfect peace, whose 
    mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you." The wicked may have rest, 
    but not with God's good will; therefore the more rest, the more dangerous is 
    their case: 1 Thessalonians 5:3, "For when they shall say, peace and safety, 
    then sudden destruction comes upon them, as a woman in travail, and they 
    shall not escape." But there is perfect security in Christ, and that in the 
    worst of times, Song 3:7, 8. Again, it is a rest that is so rooted, that the 
    soul can never be deprived of it: Isaiah 32:17, "And the work of 
    righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness, 
    and assurance forever." How soon is the rest of the wicked broken, their 
    candle put out! But this, although it may meet with some disturbance by 
    temptations, as the clouds may go over the sun, yet it shall be as sure as 
    the sun fixed in the firmament; it will be proof against the disturbances of 
    the world, against the temptations and accusations of the devil; yes, 
    against the demands of justice, and the threatenings of the law. Then in the 
    life to come, he will give them all complete rest who come to him: Hebrews 
    4:9, "There remains, therefore, a rest for the people of God." He will give 
    their bodies rest in the grave, Isaiah 57:2, and both soul and body rest in 
    Heaven hereafter; and that is a rest beyond expression.</p>
<p align="justify">If it should be inquired, Who is it that gives this rest? 
    this is answered in our text; Christ says to such laboring and heavy-laden 
    sinners, and he is able to make good his word, "I will give you rest." The 
    gift of this rest is his prerogative; they that obtain it must get it out of 
    his hands.—For illustrating and confirming this, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That all creatures cannot give rest to a restless 
    soul. Not anything in them, or the whole of what can be afforded from them, 
    can give it: Ecclesiastes 1:2, "Vanity of vanities, says the preacher, 
    vanity of vanities; all is vanity." Men, the best of men, cannot do it. 
    Ministers may be directed to speak a word in season, but the Lord himself 
    can only make that word effectual, 2 Samuel 12:13, compared with Psalm 51. 
    Nay, angels cannot do it, Exodus 33:2, compare verse 15. It requires a 
    creating power: Isaiah 57:18, "I have seen his ways, and I will heal 
    him."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. There can be no rest to the soul without returning to 
    a reconciled God, for it is impossible the soul can find true rest 
    elsewhere; and there is no returning to God but by Christ: John 14:6, "I am 
    the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes unto the Father, but by me." 
    He is the only ladder by which the soul can ascend to Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is the great Lord Treasurer of Heaven. The 
    fullness of power is lodged in him: Matthew 28:18, "All power is given unto 
    me in Heaven and in earth." There is nothing that any can get from Heaven in 
    the way of spiritual favor, but what comes through his hands: John 5:22, 
    "The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son." 
    Jesus also has the keys of Hell and death, Revelation 1:18.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He is the store-house, where the treasure is laid up, 
    and out of which all needful supplies come: John 1:16, "And of his fullness 
    have all we received, and grace for grace."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">5. The glorious types illustrating this: Joseph, Genesis 
    41:40–44; Joshua, that brought the people to the rest in Canaan.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">6. That high character which be sustains: Hebrews 12:2. 
    He is the "author and finisher of our faith."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is reasonable it should be so, he has 
    purchased this rest with his blood: and therefore there is an high propriety 
    that he should be the giver, the dispenser of this glorious blessing.—In the</p>
<p align="justify">IV. And last place, it was proposed to make some 
    practical improvement of the whole. To enlarge here, however, would be 
    improper, as a practical improvement has been made of the several parts of 
    the subject all along, as they have been considered. At the same time, your 
    attention may be called to the following brief hints. From what has been 
    observed, you have had set before you,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A melancholy picture of the miserable state of all 
    mankind by nature;—they are "laboring and heavy laden," they have various 
    burdens lying on them, the burden of sin, the burden of the law, a burden 
    often of fears, of terrors, arising from the former; and while thus heavy 
    laden, they are laboring, striving to ease themselves of their burdens, 
    struggling hard to get rid of them, while after all they are only laboring 
    in vain in the fire, wearying themselves in the greatness of their way; are 
    spending their "money for that which is not bread, and their labor for that 
    which satisfies not," instead of obtaining the least ease or quiet. Their 
    situation is in this way rendered more and more grievous and distressing, 
    their burdens become heavier than they can bear, and their labor is rendered 
    quite intolerable.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We may learn a special ingredient in the misery of 
    those that thus labor, and are heavy laden. They are under the law as a 
    covenant of works, which requires the full tale of brick, without affording 
    the least straw with which to make them. They are under most grievous 
    taskmasters, who are constantly saying, Give, give, while they are unable to 
    work; and, what is still worse, they are without Christ, without God, and so 
    without hope in the world. It is Jesus only that can help them; while afar 
    from him, and enemies to him, they have no other prospect than that of 
    perishing eternally.—But,</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is hence opened up a door of hope, even for such 
    as are laboring and heavy laden, whatever their characters or conditions 
    have been, or at present may be, though they may have long labored in vain, 
    and spent their strength for nothing. However heavy, numerous, and continued 
    these burdens may be, though in their view their condition may not only be 
    distressing and deplorable, but even almost desperate, there is here a door 
    of hope opened up to such. On Jesus is their help laid; in and from him it 
    is to be found. He is saying, "Look unto me, and be you saved, all you ends 
    of the earth; for I am God, and besides me there is no Savior." "Hearken you 
    stout-hearted, and you that are far from righteousness." Nay, he speaks to 
    such expressly by name; without excluding a single individual, whatever his 
    present character or condition be, his gracious words are, "Come unto me, 
    all you" the whole of you, and each of you "that labor, and are heavy laden, 
    and," in coming to me without perhaps, "you shall have rest."</p>
<p align="justify">In the last place, there is pointed out to us what is the 
    indispensable duty of all the hearers of the gospel. It is to come to Jesus; 
    to comply with the gracious call and invitation here given. It is true, this 
    in the text is addressed only to the laboring and heavy laden; but is not 
    this a character common to all the hearers of the gospel? Are not all more 
    or less in this situation? A situation so far from being desirable, that it 
    is exceedingly uncomfortable. If such, then, would consult their present or 
    eternal welfare; if they would hearken to the gracious call, the kind 
    invitation which Christ gives them; if they would obey heaven's great 
    command, it must be admitted, that it is their bounden duty to come to 
    Jesus, that is, to believe on him; for it is only in the exercise of faith 
    as coming to him, and according as faith is in exercise, that any can be 
    freed from their heavy burdens, or be released from that vain and irksome 
    labor in which they are engaged.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all such, then, be exhorted to cease from the labor 
    which satisfies not; from these fruitless attempts which they are engaged in 
    to rid themselves from these heavy burdens that they are weighed down under. 
    Be exhorted to come to Jesus, cast all your burdens and your cares over upon 
    him. He is able and willing to sustain both you and your burdens, whatever 
    they are. Come to him, then, as you are, as laboring and heavy laden. There 
    is the most cordial welcome afforded to all such; the greater your burdens, 
    and the more pressing your necessities are, in the way of putting your case 
    unreservedly in his hand, and under his management, you may in due time 
    assuredly expect a comfortable issue. He hates putting away. Whoever will 
    may come, and him that comes unto him, he will in no wise cast out. "Come 
    unto me" says he, "all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give 
    you rest."</p>
