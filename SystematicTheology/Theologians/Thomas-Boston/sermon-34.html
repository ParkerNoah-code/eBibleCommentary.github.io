<p align="justify"><br/>
    Hebrews 13:14, "For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to 
    come."</p>
<p align="justify">HEAVEN ever moves, yet is that the place of our rest; 
    earth ever rests, yet is that the place of our travel, where we rest not. 
    Time runs with a rapid course, and carries all men swiftly down the stream. 
    It admits of no delay, and whether we sleep or wake, we are carried forward, 
    to be sent forth within a little into the vast ocean of eternity, and to 
    land us either in Heaven or Hell. Whether we will or not, we must before 
    long bid farewell to the world; and were it with man as it is with the 
    beasts, who when they are dead are done, we might sit at ease, suffering 
    ourselves to be carried away with the stream at all adventures. But then man 
    begins to live, when he is dead and gone; and, therefore, having here no 
    continuing city, what remains but that we direct our course to one that is 
    to come, and which is the great thing our text aims at. In which consider:</p>
<p align="justify">1. A supposition. The apostle plainly supposes our 
    absolute need of a continuing city, that is, a place of true happiness and 
    rest; for so it must be understood, for, otherwise, Hell is of the same 
    continuance with Heaven. Man is capable of happiness, the desire of it is 
    interwoven with his nature. No man is insensible that he labors under some 
    great defects, and every man sees the need he has of something to give him 
    perfect rest and satisfaction; and therefore the soul, like an hungry 
    infant, sucks wherever it comes, and finding no rest in one thing, goes to 
    another; and never can attain true rest, until it be perfectly carried to 
    God himself, to take up its everlasting rest in him.</p>
<p align="justify">We have next a position consisting of two parts: 1. That 
    the continuing city is not to be found in this world; our rest is not here. 
    Here we do but sojourn for a time, and no sooner we come into it, but as 
    soon we begin our journey to go out of it again; and, like the rising sun, 
    haste forward to the going down. We begin then to die, when we begin to 
    live; and death follows our life, as the shadow does the body, until it at 
    length overturns us. Then the tale is told, and the fable of life in the 
    world is ended. 2. That the continuing city is to come. There is a place of 
    perfect happiness and rest for the children of men, though not here. The 
    present world affords many fine cities, but the world to come has only that 
    "continuing city." Heaven is that continuing city, Hebrews 12:28, in which 
    there are many mansions for the heirs of glory, when come home from their 
    travels.</p>
<p align="justify">We have also in the text, the practice of the godly, most 
    important to both parts of the position. They admit the conviction of this 
    world's emptiness, and live under the sense of it. They look upon the world 
    as it is in itself, as indeed affording no continuing city to them. They 
    say, "we have here no continuing city," we see none, we seek none, we expect 
    none in it; but they seek that which is to come. The Greek word is 
    emphatical, and signifies to seek with all our might; to seek with great 
    care and solicitude. They do not sit down, and faintly wish for it, but set 
    themselves earnestly by all means to obtain it. Their former question, "Who 
    will show us any good?" is turned to that, "What shall I do to be saved?" 
    While others are taken up about present things, they are laboring to procure 
    to themselves a blessed immortality.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The connection. These words are given as a reason 
    or motive to stir up to the duty proposed, verse 13, namely, that we ought 
    to be denied to the world, take up Christ's cross, and patiently bear all 
    reproaches for him. For why? says the apostle, "we have no continuing city 
    here;" and before long we shall be out of the reach of enemies; and even at 
    this time we are seeking other things than the world can afford.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. We have no continuing city in this world; but 
    it is the duty of all, and the practice of the godly, earnestly to seek 
    after the continuing city above. We shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show that we have no continuing city here.</p>
<p align="justify">II. In what respects Heaven is a continuing city.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall open at large the seeking of this continuing 
    city.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. The reasonableness of the point. We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show that we have no continuing city here. This is 
    evident,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because the dissolution of this world is approaching, 
    Psalm 102:6; 2 Peter 3:7–12. It had a beginning, and it shall have an end. 
    The day will come, when the earth, and all things therein, shall be burnt 
    up. It was a dreadful day when Sodom was burned, but it will be much more 
    dreadful when all the cities of the world shall be consumed. Sodom destined 
    to the flames, was no city for Lot to continue in; and seeing this world 
    must also be burnt up, may we not conclude we have no continuing city in it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because we must all remove from it by death. Death is 
    settled by a fixed decree. "It is appointed unto all men once to die." One 
    generation passes away to give place to another. Every birth and every death 
    is an argument to persuade us that we have no continuing city here. Every 
    child that is born, comes into the world with a warning away in its hand. 
    Every dying person lets us see the way which we are to follow. There is room 
    enough on the earth, notwithstanding all the vast numbers that have been 
    before us. We must all answer the summons of death. It will not pity the 
    poor, be bribed by the rich, nor boasted away by men of might.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Because of the uncertainty of all things here below, 
    though we should last, and the world also. All worldly things stand on two 
    lame legs, uncertainty and insufficiency, and therefore are not to be 
    depended upon. There is nothing here that can satisfy the soul. He spoke 
    like a fool, who said, "Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years, 
    take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry." Though these things were 
    sufficient, yet are they uncertain. They perish with the using; like the 
    apples of Sodom, fair and fresh without; within full of sulphur, and, being 
    handled, fall to ashes.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because the Lord never designed it for a continuing 
    city. The Lord made it as a stage to serve for a time, to be taken down when 
    men had acted their parts upon it. It was the place for the trial of the 
    children of men. Heaven was the place prepared for the godly before the 
    foundation of the world; and Hell was prepared of old, for others. This 
    earth was only a narrow neck of land, to be swallowed up of eternity. We 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show in what respects Heaven is a continuing city.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The city itself is continuing. "It is a building of 
    God; an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. It is a kingdom 
    which cannot be moved." Though the footstool may be set aside, the throne 
    must continue. That city prepared before the foundations of the world were 
    laid, must endure when the foundations of the world are overturned. It is a 
    sure purchase that is made in the city above; for when the cities below 
    shall be laid in ashes, this shall stand and flourish.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Lord of the city is a continuing Lord, even Jesus 
    Christ. He died once, but shall die no more. He has fought the battle for 
    his people, and has reached the crown, and is set down on the throne. He 
    sends his people such news as Joseph sent to his father: "God has made me 
    lord of all Egypt, come down unto me, tarry not." Jesus continues for 
    evermore.</p>
<p align="justify">In respect of his natures, Revelation 1:17, 18. The human 
    nature which he took on, he never did, and never will put off. Death made a 
    separation between his soul and body, but not between his natures. The 
    saints shall forever see the human nature united to the divine nature; the 
    man Christ at the right hand of God.</p>
<p align="justify">In respect of his offices. He will be the prophet of that 
    city forever. He who gave them the light of grace, shall give them the light 
    of glory. He is an everlasting priest, even a priest for ever. It is true, 
    he will offer no more sacrifice, "for by one offering he has perfected 
    forever them that are sanctified." But he will eternally exhibit that 
    sacrifice, and intercede for his people, Hebrews 7:26; this is the 
    everlasting security of the saints. He will be king there forever, for of 
    his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The citizens of that city are continuing. "Life and 
    immortality are brought to light by the gospel." There is no death there. 
    The garments of glory shall never be put off Death entered paradise, but 
    cannot enter this city, where the Lord of life reigns in his glory, 1 
    Corinthians 15:53, 54.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The abode of the citizens in this city is continuing. 
    Adam was cast out of the earthly paradise, the Jews out of Canaan. But every 
    saint "shall be made a pillar in this temple of God, and he shall go no more 
    out." Heaven is the rest that remains for the people of God. They may have 
    many a weary step in the wilderness, but when once come home they shall go 
    no more abroad.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The privileges of it are continuing; they shall never 
    be retrenched. Who can count the privileges which the citizens enjoy there! 
    The people of God in this world are high privileged with the favor of God, 
    and peace with him, pardon of sin, adoption, sanctification. They shall have 
    all these in their utmost perfection, to be continued forever. Their 
    peculiar privileges in Heaven are such as these: none of the miserable 
    effects of sin are there. "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; 
    and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall 
    there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away." No bodily 
    pain, no soul distemper, no desertion there. The Zion above will not 
    complain that the Lord has forgotten her, or that God covers himself with a 
    cloud, for there shall be no night there.</p>
<p align="justify">There shall be no sinning there, for there the spirits of 
    just men are made perfect. The body of sin and death dies with the death of 
    the body. The most holy person on earth sins, but the least star in Heaven 
    shall be without spot. Lamps of Hell shall then wonder to see themselves 
    shining lamps of glory. There shall not be even the possibility of sinning 
    there. Adam when created had no sin, but the saints in the city above shall 
    not be capable of sinning. They shall be forever confirmed in a sinless and 
    happy state. We have told what is not in it, but to tell you what is in it 
    is more difficult. We may, by attempting it, darken counsel by words without 
    knowledge. Take only these two words: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God: 
    and it does not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when he shall 
    appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And so shall we 
    ever be with the Lord." These are words which the inhabitants of Heaven only 
    are fit to explain.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The work of that city is continuing work. They rest 
    not night nor day, singing praises to him that sits upon the throne. The 
    harps of the people of God are not always in their hands now; sometimes they 
    are hanged upon the willows. Their work there will be eternal recreation and 
    perfect pleasure. This teaches us that we must be made meet for Heaven, and 
    serve our apprenticeship here in the ways of holiness, before we can be 
    admitted into that continuing city.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The rest, quiet, and safety of that city are 
    continuing. "It is a kingdom that cannot be moved." There are four things 
    that put a city in hazard, but none of them are here. Enemies laying siege 
    to it without. This puts the church in hazard here, and therefore there are 
    watchmen set on the walls; but no enemy can approach to the city above. The 
    devil and his army cannot come near it. Want of provision within, occasions 
    hazard; but there shall be no lack there, for rivers of pleasures that never 
    run dry, abound there, Revelation 7:16, 17. The inhabitants of a city 
    disagreeing among themselves is very hazardous. This was as hurtful to the 
    earthly Jerusalem as the Roman army. But there can be no mutiny in this 
    city. Then shall that be perfectly accomplished, "They shall not hurt nor 
    destroy in all my holy mountain, says the Lord." The sad divisions among the 
    Lord's people strike at the root of Christianity, by muttering as much as 
    that Christ is not come, Isaiah 11:6–8. Therefore our Lord prays, that his 
    people "all may be one, as you Father are in me, and I in you, that they 
    also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you have sent me." 
    Finally, mismanagement of the governor may bring danger. Wisdom will save a 
    city, and folly ruin it. Here is infinite wisdom at the helm, and how can 
    they miscarry. We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To open up at large, the seeking of this continuing 
    city. Here we shall show what it supposes; wherein it consists. What do they 
    seek that are rightly seeking? and Finally, the properties of this seeking.</p>
<p align="justify">1. What this seeking supposes. 1. It supposes the want of 
    a continuing city. None will seek what they do not want. When man sinned he 
    lost God, and so a right to Heaven; this all men, by nature, are under. And 
    he who is thus seeking is sensible of his loss, and is under conviction that 
    the world can afford none such; unless it were so, he would never seek it. 
    Every serious seeker of Heaven looks on the world as a wilderness, and 
    himself as a pilgrim and stranger on the earth, Hebrews 11:13, 14. But alas! 
    few are under this impression concerning the world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The faith of a continuing city; that there is a place 
    of happiness and rest. They believe "that there remains a rest for the 
    people of God." They see that there is a land afar off, and that it is 
    attainable by mortals. The faith of this is more rare than most men imagine. 
    Were there a place in the world where men might live in all manner of 
    prosperity, free from all evil, and all welcome to it that would go; would 
    not men flock thither, if they really believed it?</p>
<p align="justify">3. A sense of the need of it. Wise men will not seek that 
    of which they have no need. The seeker of Heaven sees the need he has of it. 
    He is one of a more noble spirit than to be satisfied with the husks which 
    the earth affords. The earth may serve the body during this mortal life; but 
    he knows he has a soul that must live eternally, and a body that must be 
    raised up again; and that this world can do him no service in these things.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The soul turning its back upon the world. The person 
    who seeks Heaven, with Paul, "forgets the things that are behind." "He is 
    coming out of the wilderness, like pillars of smoke;" and answers that call, 
    "come with me, from Lebanon, my spouse." We cannot seek both, more than 
    serve two contrary masters. Our arms are too short to grasp both Heaven and 
    earth at once. If you seek Heaven, let earth go.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Wherein does this seeking consist? It consists in 
    these two things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. In earnest desires after it. "But now they desire a 
    better country, that is, an heavenly." The soul desires to be there in due 
    time. Their heart is there, for their treasure is there. Their souls are 
    reconciled to Heaven by the power of grace. They have seen the beauty of the 
    holy land, and heavenly city; though not with their bodily eyes, yet with 
    the eyes of faith. They have been captivated with the map of it in the Word 
    of God. They desire it, because Christ is there; and there glory dwells, and 
    holiness reigns forever. "Our conversation is in Heaven; from whence also we 
    look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ." Most men have no such desires. 
    They would quit their part in paradise, if God would let them stay on this 
    side of Jordan.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In suitable endeavors for it. The want of this holds 
    many out of Heaven. "The desire of the slothful kills him; for his hands 
    refuse to labor." If wishes would carry men to Heaven, who would go to Hell? 
    But there are difficulties in the way to it which they cannot digest, and 
    therefore they intermeddle not with it. But they who seek it aright, turn 
    the face of their souls that way, and labor for it. "Let us labor, 
    therefore," says Paul, "to enter into that rest, lest any man fall, after 
    the same example of unbelief." Strivers only, are right seekers. "Strive," 
    says our Lord, "to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, 
    will seek to enter in, and shall not be able." "The kingdom of Heaven 
    suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."</p>
<p align="justify">3. What do they seek, that are rightly seeking?</p>
<p align="justify">1. They seek the Lord of the city. The command is, "seek 
    the Lord while he is to be found, call upon him while he is near." Jesus the 
    Lord of it is himself "the way, and the door;" none can enter but by him, 
    John 14:6. Jesus is to the true seeker the greatest beauty of the upper 
    house, Psalm 73:25. The name of the city is, "the Lord is there;" and this 
    draws the soul of the believer hither. And if Christ were not there, Heaven 
    would not be Heaven to the believer. "Being risen with Christ, they seek the 
    things which are above, where he sits at the right hand of God."</p>
<p align="justify">2. A right and title to it. By Adam's sin, we forfeited 
    our right to it, so we have our title to seek. We are commandeed to "seek 
    first the kingdom of God and his righteousness." The soul sees itself 
    miserable, whatever it have, if it have no right to that city. Hence Christ 
    is precious. A match with the heir of all things is very desirable, seeing 
    by him we are made citizens there. "For through him, we have access by one 
    Spirit unto the Father; and are made fellow-citizens with the saints, and of 
    the household of God."</p>
<p align="justify">3. A conformity to it; even the kingdom of God to be 
    within us. As every man labors to conform himself to the manners of the 
    court where he desires to be, so the Christian "has his conversation in 
    Heaven," and desires to be more and more changed into the image of the 
    Savior. Heaven must come down into us, before we can get up to it. If our 
    Father be in Heaven, we will strive to be like him. Can we look on these to 
    be seeking Heaven, who mind nothing but the world and their lusts; in whose 
    thoughts, words, and actions, there is nothing of Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Evidences for the city. The soul will not only seek a 
    right to it; but to know his right. Hence they will be crying, "show me a 
    token for good." When their interest is darkened, their hearts are filled 
    with sadness; and when they behold it, their souls rejoice, when they can 
    say, "For we know, that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were 
    dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal 
    in the heavens." A man that is seeking to buy houses or lands, will labor to 
    get good evidences of his right to them.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The possession of it in due time. "Let us labor, 
    therefore, to enter into that rest." One time or another, you will be at 
    Paul's wish, "a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far 
    better." Christ gives it as an encouragement to his people, "I go," says he, 
    "to prepare a place for you;" and therefore they seek and wait until their 
    minority be past, that they may enter heirs to that glory. "Desiring to be 
    clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall close with a word of use of what has been said. 
    Bestir yourselves, then, to seek after the continuing city. Are there not 
    many among us, who have neither right to, nor evidence for Heaven; who live 
    here as if this were their rest, as if they were never to remove; who, if 
    death were to seize them this day, know not where they would lodge through 
    the long night of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider the motive in the text: "we have no continuing 
    city here." We must continue forever, but not here. Were we to die like the 
    beasts, we might live as they do; but we have never-dying souls. O consider 
    well, that you must remove, that you may seek in time a continuing city. 
    Death is posting on. Our life is but a vapor, a shadow, a nothing. The grave 
    we must visit, there is no continuance here.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The properties of this seeking. How must we seek, if 
    we would succeed? This is a necessary question, for our Lord tells us, "many 
    will seek to enter in, and shall not be able;" and Paul tells us, "that a 
    man is not crowned unless he strive lawfully." There may be much seeking to 
    little purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They that rightly seek the continuing city, seek it 
    laboriously. "They labor to enter into that rest." They must not only open 
    their months as beggars, but ply their hands as workmen seeking their daily 
    bread, who earn it with the sweat of their brow. "We must seek it as silver, 
    and search for it as for hidden treasures." Many would be fed like the 
    birds, who neither sow nor gather into barns; and be clothed like the 
    lilies, who neither toil nor spin. They would receive Heaven if it would 
    fall down into their mouths, but cannot think of working for it. They have 
    something else to do. It is true, our labor and pains will not bring us 
    there; but there is no getting there without it, Proverbs 21:25. For 
    consider, the several notions of the way to Heaven, all importing true 
    labor. We must work; yes, "work out our own salvation," or otherwise we lose 
    what we have done. It is as the work of the gardener, which is not easy. 
    "Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy, break up your fallow 
    ground, for it is time to seek the Lord, until he come and rain 
    righteousness upon you." It is the running of a race that requires patience 
    and much eagerness, "for we must press toward the mark, and so run that we 
    may obtain." We must wrestle and fight for it, for Heaven has a strait gate, 
    and cannot be entered with ease. We must strive to enter, yes press into it, 
    and take it by violence. We must put forth our utmost strength, as those who 
    are agonizing, Luke 13:24, and at last overcome, Revelation 3:12. These are 
    the metaphors by which the Christian's exercises are described, and they 
    certainly denote real labor.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider also the types of the way to Heaven. Many a 
    weary step, and many a bloody battle had the Israelites, before they could 
    settle themselves in Canaan. Jerusalem stood on a hill, and was surrounded 
    with hills; many a weary step had some of them to take before they won it, 2 
    Samuel 5:6; and when they came there, they had the hill of God to ascend, 
    even Mount Moriah, where the temple stood, hence that Psalm 24:3–6.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides, slothfulness is the pathway to Hell, Proverbs 
    13:14, and 20:4. The sluggard is an unprofitable servant to himself and his 
    master. For an idler to get Heaven, is a sort of contradiction. Heaven is a 
    reward, and therefore supposes working. Heaven is rest, a keeping of a 
    sabbath, and therefore supposes previous toil.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Voluntarily. "The Lord meets him that rejoices and 
    works righteousness." When men do nothing in religion but by compulsion, 
    they cannot succeed. God's people are a willing people, and he cares not for 
    compelled prayers, or forced endeavors, when the hands go without the heart. 
    Men naturally are enemies to Heaven; and until Heaven be in their heart 
    instead of the world, they will never seek it to purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Diligently. "The soul of the diligent shall be made 
    fat." We will lose it, if we seek it not diligently. "By much slothfulness 
    the building decays." Men are busy for the world; the devil is busy to keep 
    us out of Heaven, and shall not we seek it diligently. But most men are of 
    Pharaoh's principle, that religion is only a work for them that have nothing 
    else to do, hence no diligence among them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Vigorously. We are commanded to ask, to seek, to 
    knock. It is not easily got. Faint attacks will not break open the gates of 
    this city. It is requisite we summon together all the powers of our souls, 
    "and whatever our hand finds to do, do it with all our might." The iron is 
    blunt, therefore we must exert the more force. Fervency in seeking, is 
    necessary to make it effectual. It is the effectual fervent prayer of a 
    righteous man that avails much.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Resolutely, as Jacob for the blessing. We seek what we 
    cannot want, and therefore must steel our foreheads, and run through 
    difficulties. "Skin for skin, all that a man has, will he give for his 
    life." The people that hearing of the Anakim, their hearts failed, were 
    obliged to turn back into the wilderness. They that mind for this city, 
    "must have their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace," 
    that they may go forward through the rugged way.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Constantly. "We must be steadfast and immoveable, 
    always abounding in the work of the Lord." We must not seek only by fits and 
    starts; that makes our seeking uneasy. Hot and cold fits are signs of a 
    distempered body. This work is for term of life; "no man putting his hand to 
    the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." "The just 
    shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no 
    pleasure in him." Deserters are shamefully punished, while prisoners of war 
    are treated with respect.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Seek it quickly, without delay, for we know not how 
    soon our sun may go down. "We must work the works of him that sent us, while 
    it is day; the night comes, when no man can work." Your glass is running. If 
    your time be done, before your interest in Heaven be secured, it will be a 
    heavy case. Hell is replenished with those that resolved to be better 
    afterwards.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Seek evangelically, that is, in a gospel way. 
    This comprehends seeking, first, from a principle of new life, called the 
    life of Jesus, 2 Corinthians 4:10. Secondly, from a sweet motive of love to 
    God, even the love of Christ constraining us; and thirdly, from a noble end, 
    the glory of God, the honor of the Redeemer, and glory of his grace, and our 
    own salvation. Finally, doing all in borrowed strength; traveling "through 
    the wilderness leaning on our beloved, denying ourselves, rejoicing in 
    Christ Jesus; and having no confidence in the flesh." We shall now,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Show the reasonableness of the point. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Why it is the duty of all thus to seek after the 
    continuing city.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because none of us have a continuing city here. Our 
    old tabernacle is ready to fall down about our ears, what then should we be 
    doing, but seeking that building of God. Hence we must remove, is it not 
    then highly reasonable we should seek where we may take up our eternal 
    lodging.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is the command of God, whose commands we are not to 
    dispute, but to obey, "for a son honors his father, and a servant his 
    master." Now what is his command? It is, "Strive to enter in at the strait 
    gate." What a cord of love is such a command, where duty and interest are so 
    linked together.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because perfect happiness is only to be found there. 
    That is the place where the soul-satisfying treasure only is to be found. 
    "Lay up for yourselves, then, treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor 
    rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal." You 
    will never be able, by any means, to extract happiness from earthly 
    enjoyments. Solomon had run round the world and viewed all, and what is his 
    report, even "vanity of vanities, all is vanity." The very nature of the 
    soul is such, that nothing under the sun can satisfy it; yes, the very erect 
    form of the body teaches us to seek Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a dreadful contempt of Heaven, not to seek it. 
    It was the sin of the Israelites, "that they despised the pleasant land." It 
    is God's mansion house, the land where glory dwells. Not then to be at pains 
    to attain it, is a sin near akin to the sin of the devils, "who kept not 
    their first estate, but left their own habitation." Yes, it is a contempt of 
    the blood of Christ, the price by which Heaven was purchased. O sirs, prefer 
    not, in your practice, the world to the glory of Heaven. Observe Hebrews 
    12:14–16. Will men say that they prize Heaven, when they will not be at 
    pains to secure their title to it?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, There is no getting there, without seeking it 
    thus. There is no reaching the treasure of glory without digging for it. 
    "For if you live after the flesh, you shall die; but if you through the 
    Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live." If men must have 
    yet a little sleep and a little slumber, outer darkness will be their 
    waking-place, Luke 13:24.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let us show why it is the practice of the godly. They 
    seek this city,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because they have been convinced that they have no 
    continuing city here. By the Spirit of the Lord, the gracious soul "has seen 
    an end of all perfection;" has got a sight of the vanity and emptiness of 
    created things, and this has turned the soul back again from the broken 
    cisterns, to the fountain of living water. They have seen that excellency in 
    Christ, which has darkened the glory of created things.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because their treasure is in Heaven, Matthew 6:21. If 
    a man's treasure be in his coffers or in his barns, his heart will be there 
    also; if in Heaven, his heart will be there. Christ is the believer's 
    treasure, and he is there; an eternal weight of glory is his treasure, and 
    it is also in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because Heaven is the only rest for the godly. The 
    world is the place of their toil and pilgrimage. They have trouble from 
    without and from within, while here; but their rest is remaining for them 
    above, Hebrews 4:9. They say to one another, as Naomi did to her 
    daughters-in-law, "the Lord grant you, that you may find rest, each of you 
    in the house of her husband." Rest is sought by every one, and seeing the 
    godly look not for it here, they must needs be looking for it there.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because this seeking is the native product of a new 
    nature. The old nature carries the man downward, the new nature upwards, 
    toward Heaven. Grace is an active principle come from above into the heart, 
    and carrying the soul up to its own source. Everything desires its own 
    preservation and perfection, now glory is the best preservative and 
    perfection of grace. It is a fountain that will not be stopped, but will 
    cast up its waters. "It is in them a well of living water, springing up to 
    everlasting life."</p>
<p align="justify">APPLICATION. IS it so, that here we have no continuing 
    city? Then we may be</p>
<p align="justify">1. Informed and convinced of several particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Then we must all die, and be as water spilt on the 
    ground. Here our tent is set down, but not to continue here. The pins of the 
    tent must be loosed, and man must go to his long home. Before long you shall 
    be arrested within the four posts of a bed, not to come forth, until you be 
    carried to the grave. Death will settle down on your eyelids. The fairest 
    face shall be pale, and the breath shall go, and the body crumble to ashes, 
    for here we have no continuing city.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Life in this world is but a short preface to eternity, 
    an inconsiderable point between two vast terms. The world lasted some 
    thousands of years before we were born in it; and how long after we are 
    gone, who knows; but then there is an eternity to succeed. O! that we could 
    so tell our handbreadth of days as to apply our hearts to wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is well with them who are gone to Heaven. "Blessed 
    are the dead who die in the Lord, from henceforth; yes, says the Spirit, 
    that they may rest from their labors." Rest is desirable, they had it not 
    here; they have got it now. Their weary days and nights are now at an end. 
    Sickness and trouble shall be to them no more. Weep not for them, but for 
    yourselves that are yet on the troublesome sea; we are abroad, they are at 
    home.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Behold here the vanity of all things below, and the 
    folly of valuing ourselves on account of them. When death comes, we must bid 
    them an eternal farewell, and leave what we have to others; and they to 
    others again, until the fire at the last day consume all. Some have a 
    beautiful tent, others a black and uncomely one; but against night, all are 
    taken down.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Their case is to be pitied and not envied, who have 
    their portion in this life. What good did the rich man's treasure do him in 
    Hell? Though a man act the part of a king on a stage, if he have nothing 
    when the curtain is drawn and the play ended, he is in a pitiful case. Alas! 
    the world does with many, as with the young man, it brings an eternal 
    eclipse on their souls.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, See the folly of men who are neglecting to secure 
    their title to Heaven. O sirs! we are quickly carried down the stream, 
    before long we will be in eternity. Why then are you not making it your 
    business to seek a continuing city, seeing here we have none?</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of trial. Hereby you may try yourselves, whether 
    you be truly religious or not. How does the pulse of your affections beat? 
    What is it that you are seeking, is it Heaven or the world? I told you in 
    what this seeking consists, and upon this I would propose two questions:</p>
<p align="justify">1. What desires have you after Heaven? Are your souls yet 
    reconciled to it? Could you get an abode here forever, would you desire to 
    remove? I fear there are many would even be content to settle down on this 
    side of Jordan. They desire Heaven, but not for contempt of the world, but 
    fear of Hell. But a gracious soul cannot be content with this their sinful 
    condition in the world, to want uninterrupted communion with God, which is 
    only to be enjoyed above.</p>
<p align="justify">2. What endeavors are you using to get it? Simple wishes 
    for Heaven will never come speed. Many wish for Heaven but work for Hell. If 
    this be not your main work to seek the continuing city, you will never get 
    there. But alas! what little pains do most men take to get Heaven? If coming 
    to the church, giving the compliment of a morning and evening prayer to 
    God—cold and dead suits—will bring them to Heaven, they will be sure of it; 
    but they will never see it, if they cannot reach it without cutting off 
    right hands, mortifying their lusts, and taking it by violence.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Of exhortation. From this I may press several 
    duties upon you. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be content with such things as you have. Nature is 
    content with little, grace with less; but corruption enlarges the soul as 
    Hell, that it never says it has enough. Though a stranger get but bad 
    accommodation on a journey, it pleases him to think that he is going 
    homewards, he is not to stay with it. You are on your way te eternity. It is 
    of little consequence whether a traveler have a cane in his hand, or a rough 
    stick; either of them may serve, and both are laid aside at the journey's 
    end.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do not sit down upon the world's smiles. If the world 
    court you, do not give it your heart, but tell it you are not to stay. O! it 
    is hard to keep the heart from falling in love with a smiling world; hard to 
    carry a full cup even; to take a large draught of carnal comforts, and not 
    to fall asleep. Before long, the richest shall be on a level with the 
    poorest; and when the fool, who sets his heart on his wealth, comes to die, 
    he cannot answer the question, Whose shall these things be, which he has 
    provided?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Bear afflictions patiently. You are posting out of the 
    place of afflictions. If you be not in Christ, before long the cross will be 
    turned into an unmixed curse. If you be in Christ, before long all tears 
    shall be wiped away from your eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">4. What you do, do quickly. Beware of delays, they are 
    very dangerous. Our great work is to do good, and to get good. Ply your work 
    with all speed and diligence. Parents do good to your children; before long 
    they may be taken from you, or you from them.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Seek the continuing city that is to come, O! set 
    yourselves to this work in good earnest; apply to it with all diligence. 
    Young and old, rich and poor, you must all go out of this world. O! strive 
    to secure your lodging in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider you are all seeking something. Man is 
    a restless creature, always crying give, give. The river runs as fast when 
    it is overflowing its banks, as when it is going in its proper channel. The 
    watch moves as fast when it is going wrong, as when it is going right. The 
    spider is at pains as well as the bee. Alas! many men are like the spider; 
    it consumes its affections to make its web. They exert themselves wholly for 
    their bodies, and neglect their souls. O what folly is this!</p>
<p align="justify">2. The devil is seeking to keep you out of Heaven. He is 
    constantly seeking whom he may devour. He wants not skill to contrive means 
    for your ruin. He has had experience for several thousand years in that 
    trade. He wants not malice nor cunning. And will not you be at pains for 
    your own salvation?</p>
<p align="justify">3. You have loud calls to this work. You have the call of 
    the word. Wherefore has the Lord instituted ordinances among you, but for 
    this end? A master does not light a candle for his servants to play 
    themselves at it. You are not shut up in the dark, muffled up in clouds of 
    ignorance. The night is over, the day shines. Go forth then to your work and 
    to your labor, until the evening. The voice of providence calls loudly to 
    you. God seems to be on his way against these lands, for their contempt of 
    the gospel. And, I dare say, men under the gospel cannot but sometimes have 
    their convictions.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Our abode here will be very short. Before long, all of 
    us shall be in an unalterable state. Some are at the borders of the grave; 
    all are going forward. Our life is a vapor, and our days a shadow that 
    passes away. Let us then work the works of him that sent us, while it is 
    day: the night comes, when no man can work. Amen.</p>
