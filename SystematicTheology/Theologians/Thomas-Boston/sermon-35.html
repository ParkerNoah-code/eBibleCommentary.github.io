    Hebrews 4:11, "Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man 
    fall after the same example of unbelief."</p>
<p align="justify">HERE have we no continuing city, this is not the place of 
    our fixed abode; all men are in motion heavenward or Hellward. These that 
    are going downward, may sit still; they go with the stream, and before long 
    shall reach the ocean of God's wrath; these that are going upward, must row 
    against the stream, and must be at work until they arrive at Immanuel's 
    land. Rest here is too dear bought, at the rate of everlasting trouble. Let 
    us, then, labor here, that we may enter into that rest which is to come. In 
    these words, there is, First, An exhortation: Second, A motive pressing it.</p>
<p align="justify">In the exhortation we may consider: 1. The dependence of 
    it upon what goes before, intimated in the particle therefore; showing that 
    it is an inference from some preceding doctrine. In the latter part of the 
    third chapter, he shows that unbelief kept the disobedient Israelites out of 
    God's rest; both out of Canaan, and Heaven typified thereby, chapter 4.</p>
<p align="justify">1. He lets them see, that they had an offer of that 
    eternal rest, as well as the Israelites in the wilderness had; because both 
    had the gospel, only the Israelites in the wilderness did not believe it, 
    verse 2. He proves there was a rest remaining for the people of God, from 
    verse 3; and lays down the conclusion, verse 9. This he confirms verse 10, 
    which some understand of believers, and these go two ways: 1. Some take it 
    for these that are now in Heaven, who cease there from sin. 2. Some take it 
    for believers on earth, who are in the way to eternal rest, and so have in 
    part ceased from sin. Others understand it of Christ, of whose exaltation he 
    speaks, chap 1:3, and frequently in this epistle. Christ, as the believer's 
    head, is entered into Heaven, he has gone there as our forerunner, and has 
    now ceased from the work of redemption, finished on the cross, even as God 
    rested on the seventh day from his work of creation. This I take to be very 
    probable. From the whole, he does most natively infer the exhortation in the 
    text.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The great thing which we should have in our eye, that 
    rest, namely, of which David speaks, Psalm 95:11; that rest which remains, 
    verse 9. The apostle shows, that the rest of which David spoke was not the 
    rest of the Sabbath; for that rest of the Sabbath, in which God ceased from 
    the work of creation, was long since over and gone; the rest which David 
    means, was not so, verse 3–7. Neither was it the rest of Canaan, given the 
    people by Joshua, for the same reason, verse 8; therefore, it is a rest yet 
    to come, and that peculiar to the people of God. This rest is nothing else 
    but Heaven, or the state of glory, which the Lord gives to his people, being 
    taken out of this world. It is eternal life, Revelation 14:13. This is that 
    rest from which unbelievers are excluded, Hebrews 3:19.</p>
<p align="justify">3. What we are to aim at, in reference to that rest; "to 
    enter into it;" that is, to be partakers of it. The reason of this phrase 
    is, that Heaven and eternal life is ordinarily held out by a garden or 
    paradise, a house, a city, a kingdom, into which we are to enter by certain 
    ways, posts, and doors. By grace we come to glory.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The means to be used, in order to our entering, is 
    laboring. Labor we must, for Heaven will not fall down into our months, 
    while lying on the bed of sloth. They that will not work, must not eat bread 
    in the kingdom of God. Drinking of the rivers of pleasures, which are at 
    God's right hand, is reserved for laborers only, not for loiterers. The 
    Greek word is very emphatical, and signifies laboring with intenseness of 
    mind, carefulness, and haste; accordingly it is diversely translated. It 
    primarily denotes haste, Mark 6:25. That which people hasten, after they are 
    intent upon it; so we may better understand that, Mark 6:25, "She went in å 
    èÝùò, immediately (denoting haste,) ìåô óðïõäç ò, with haste;" (denoting the 
    intenseness of her mind on the thing.) They also go vigorously about it, 
    sparing no pains, and exert to their utmost. Hence, 2 Peter 1:10, the word 
    is rendered, give diligence. They are also very solicitous and careful that 
    they may not lose it. Hence, 2 Peter 1:15, it is rendered, I will endeavor; 
    see also 2 Corinthians 8:16. The apostle, then, having made choice of this 
    Greek word, we may improve it in its full extent, without stretching it 
    beyond his intention.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Observe the order of the labor and the rest. In the 
    way of God's appointment, and of the godly's choice, the labor is first, 
    then comes the rest. It is quite contrary with the wicked. The Chaldeans 
    measured their natural day otherwise than the Israelites. They put the day 
    first, then the night; the Jews counted the night first, then the day 
    follows. So the wicked begin with a day of rest, and end with eternal toil; 
    the godly begin with a night of toil, and end, or rather continue in eternal 
    rest. O that we may follow God's order!</p>
<p align="justify">6. Observe the end and design of this labor, it is rest. 
    Men work in their young days, and lay up, that they may rest in old age. So 
    does the Christian. The wicked also labor that they may rest; but there is a 
    vast difference both between their labor and rest. Their labor is in sin, 
    and their rest is there; but sought in vain, "for in the fullness of their 
    sufficiency they are in straits." But the godly have their labor in grace, 
    their rest in glory, and between these there is an infallible connection; 
    who, then, would refuse that labor, which ends in that rest.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The persons exhorted to labor; us, which includes the 
    apostle and all the Hebrews, whom he exhorts today to hear God's voice, and 
    whom he alarms by the example of the ruin of their predecessors; so that 
    this exhortation belongs to all the visible church, godly and ungodly. Some 
    have entered the avenue leading to glory, some have not; both are called to 
    labor to enter.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The motive pressing the exhortation. It is taken from 
    the danger of not laboring. Consider here,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That of which people are in danger, and which will 
    come upon them, if they labor not to enter, falling; that is, falling short 
    of Heaven, and missing salvation. He has a respect to the people's falling 
    in the wilderness, being destroyed there, so as they could never reach 
    Canaan, Hebrews 3:17; so shall all slothful persons fall with respect to 
    Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The great cause of ruin, that is, unbelief or 
    unpersuadableness. Unbelief is the great cause of the ruin of the hearers of 
    the gospel, and that which cuts the sinews of true diligence, so as people 
    under the power of it cannot labor.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A confirmation of the certainty of their ruin; "after 
    the same example of unbelief." Others read, "into the same example;" as if 
    he had said, lest they be a sad example of divine vengeance to others, as 
    the Israelites were before them. But our own reading is most agreeable to 
    the scope; as if he had said, lest they fall as the Israelites did, and 
    split on the same rock. There are examples of imitation, these we want not; 
    and examples of caution and warning, such were the Israelites in the 
    wilderness.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The universality of the danger; any man. No man is out 
    of hazard for none that labor not can stand.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The connection of this with the exhortation; lest any 
    man; (Greek,) that none may fall; importing that the hazard of falling short 
    of Heaven ought to quicken our endeavors after salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINES. I. Heaven is a rest, into which those that now 
    labor for it shall be at length received.</p>
<p align="justify">II. It is the necessary duty of all that hear the gospel, 
    to labor to enter into that rest. I shall begin with this second doctrine. 
    In handling this, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what it is to labor, or in what the Christian's 
    labor consists.</p>
<p align="justify">II. For what it is that we are to labor.</p>
<p align="justify">III. How we should labor.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. That we must labor, in order to our entering into 
    rest.</p>
<p align="justify">V. Why we must labor in this spiritual work in order to 
    our entering Heaven. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what it is to labor, or in what the 
    Christian's labor consists.</p>
<p align="justify">I take up this, in these four things hinted in the 
    explanation of the words:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The mind must be intent on the business of salvation. 
    There must be a serious bending of the soul to it and application of the 
    mind, as he who is laboring to gain a city by storm. "The kingdom of Heaven 
    suffers violence, and the violent take it by force." Heaven is a rest for 
    the soul, and therefore the soul must be at work before it come there. Mere 
    bodily labor profits nothing here, for it is not of that kind of work that 
    may be carried on without application of mind. Toys and trifles may be so 
    managed, but weighty business cannot. Here the mind must be intent on the 
    end, that is, the rest. Heaven must be in the eye. So was it with our 
    forerunner: "For the joy set before him, he endured the cross and despised 
    the shame." The man that is on a journey applies his mind to his journey's 
    end, and often sees it before he comes at it. He who intends to take a city 
    fixes his mind on it, and will not be diverted from his purpose; so is it 
    with him that labors for salvation. The mind must also be intent on the 
    means that lead to the end. It is entering for which he labors. No man can 
    be accounted a laborer for a good crop, who neglects the ploughing and 
    sowing of his ground; and the means leading to salvation are such as will 
    not be effectual without the mind be intent on them. "Strive," says our 
    Savior, "to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek 
    to enter in, and shall not be able."</p>
<p align="justify">Now this application of the mind to the business of 
    salvation imports, 1. An impression of the weight of that matter upon the 
    spirit. No wise man will labor for a trifle; and no man will labor for 
    salvation, but he who has a deep impression of its importance; hence is it 
    that so few labor this way. Most men are at no tolerable pains about their 
    salvation. Some will not want an hour's rest for salvation, that will want a 
    whole night's rest for something of the world. The reason is plain; the 
    world appears great, and Heaven little in their eyes; therefore men's hearts 
    must be pricked, that their sense of feeling may be raised, before they will 
    be solicitous about their salvation. There are two things that make 
    salvation weigh with them. There is first a treasure of wrath on the one 
    hand, Romans 2:5, which is growing daily, by the increase of sin. The cup of 
    wrath seems to them too full, that they should be able to drink it off. The 
    vengeance of God appears a load too great for their shoulders, hence they 
    are ready to say, who can abide with everlasting burning. A second thing is 
    a weight of glory on the other hand, 2 Corinthians 4:13. Here they see in 
    what true happiness consists. Will a weight of gold make a sluggard labor; 
    and will not a weight of glory, seen by an eye of faith, make a Christian 
    labor. This application imports, 2. An habitual minding of that business, 
    Religion is the believer's trade, hence his conversation is in Heaven. As 
    for others, the curse of the serpent is upon them, on their belly do they 
    go, licking the dust of the earth; and when the frame of the new creature is 
    such, that it looks heavenward natively, the unrenewed, like the beasts, 
    continually look down; "their God is their belly, and they mind earthly 
    things." They labor for the meat that perishes, and will not seek after God. 
    But if salvation be our study, it will be often in our thoughts; and the 
    question that occupies our attention will not be, who will show us any good? 
    but that, what shall we do to be saved? In this application of the mind, 
    there is, 3. The heart's being set upon salvation, 2 Corinthians 5:9. The 
    scattered affections of the soul are gathered together from off the variety 
    of objects which the world affords us, and are fixed here, Psalm 27:4. Most 
    men cannot labor for salvation, because they run themselves out of breath in 
    pursuit of the world; hence a twofold evil follows for their souls. 1. A 
    great aversion to the duties of religion and the concerns of the soul. The 
    full soul loathes an honey-comb; as a man that has filled himself in his own 
    house, has no appetite for the feast to which he is invited, and the more 
    so, if new come off a journey, and worn out with fatigue; hence the man, if 
    he go to duty, he is dragged to it. 2. Unfitness for duties of religion. The 
    cream and life of the man's affections are already spent on the world and 
    his lusts, so that nothing is left for God and his soul but the lame and the 
    sick, so that he cannot labor, and so must lose, unless some faint attempts 
    will do the business.</p>
<p align="justify">But if we would labor for salvation, we must draw our 
    hearts to the work, from off other objects; salvation will be our great 
    desire, and with Mary we will choose the better part; our hearts will draw 
    our hands to work. It is true, even the wicked desire salvation, but there 
    are these defects in their desires of it, 1. They are nature's own work; 
    they come up without the overcoming power of the Spirit of Christ. They are 
    like weeds and wild oats, that grow without ploughing or sowing; nothing of 
    that mighty power there, Ephesians 1:19, hence they cannot actuate a man to 
    supernatural duties, for these are beyond their sphere. 2. His desires 
    overleap the true means. He loves the gold, but he cannot endure to dig. He 
    loves to reap, but he cannot endure to plough, because of the cold. 3. He 
    desires it absolutely, but not comparatively. Give him sin and safety, too, 
    they are welcome; but he will rather make shipwreck of his soul, than part 
    with his lusts; but he who has his heart set on salvation, will part with 
    all to gain it, Matthew 13:45, 46.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In this labor there is painfulness and diligence. He 
    does not only think on it, but work for it; his desires are backed with 
    suitable endeavors. We must not sit down and wish for Heaven with folded 
    hands. These desires are, like Rachel, beautiful indeed, but barren. "The 
    soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing." There must be true pains 
    here, and vigorous endeavors, that will make the soul to breathe, and pant 
    and sweat, to obtain the desired salvation; and this implies the engaging 
    with the duties of religion, as the way to Heaven. If we mind for Heaven, we 
    must go in the path road, following the footsteps of the flock, Hebrews 
    12:14. They that do not labor at God's work, cannot expect his rest. It 
    implies also, that no mean must be left unemployed, in order to the 
    attaining of salvation; it is a matter of life and death, and all that a man 
    has he will give for his life. They that labor for salvation will seek 
    everywhere, and turn every stone, until they find it. He is a painful 
    Christian, not he who will do some things, with Herod; but he who will not 
    refuse the hardest piece of work, in order to the obtaining of his desire. 
    Sloth may well carry a man half way to Heaven, but the laborious Christian 
    leaves the sluggard by the way, for this diligence also implies constancy in 
    the way of the Lord. A Christian must be always employed. Salvation is a 
    web, into which we must weave the whole thread of our lives. The man that 
    minds for Heaven, is a laborer indeed, whose work is never at an end, until 
    he enter to his eternal rest. He can never want work as long as he is out of 
    Heaven, and as long as there is a devil and an ill heart to interrupt his 
    work. It is the mark of a hypocrite, that he will not delight himself in the 
    Almighty, nor always call upon God. Many professors are no more laborers for 
    Heaven, than a man who will occasionally, for his diversion, go to take hold 
    of a plough is a ploughman. Religion is not their chief business. Finally, 
    this diligence implies real vigor; whatever they do, they do it with all 
    their might: "They search for wisdom, as for hidden treasures." There is a 
    following of the Lord fully, over the belly of all oppositions and 
    discouragements. The man labors for salvation, as working for his life 
    itself, for indeed he sees his all is at stake. No opposition will make him 
    give over; if he faint he will rise again, and more vigorously renew the 
    attack. There is such a faintness in all the endeavors of many for Heaven, 
    that with the fearful who have no heart, they are excluded; Revelation 21:8.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In this labor there is haste. Our work must be done 
    speedily, for the time proposed for our laboring is but today. "Today, if 
    you will hear his voice." There is an unbelieving haste, that will not wait 
    God's time; but this true haste is not to let his time slip. Delays are 
    dangerous in all matters, but damnable in soul matters; therefore David 
    would not venture on it, but says, "I made haste, and delayed not to keep 
    your commandments." Therefore, says the apostle, labor with all haste to 
    enter into that rest.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But how can one haste to Heaven, can he go 
    there before death, or must he hasten his own death? ANSWER. No. But the way 
    is long, and the entry to it is far out of our natural way. We must hasten 
    by a speedy entrance upon the way to it, by a speedy conversion to God. They 
    that are near conversion, are said, "not to be far from the kingdom of God." 
    They who forsake the world lying in wickedness, have to enter into that 
    rest, and get into the avenue of grace, from whence they shall certainly 
    reach glory. We must also make haste, by a speedy progress in the way. There 
    are many steps between us and Heaven. We have need to go forward, and work 
    out our begun salvation with fear and trembling. There are many corruptions 
    to mortify, and graces to strengthen. Two things make men that are wise 
    labor with haste: 1. Time is flying. "Our days are swifter than a post; they 
    flee away;" and when gone, cannot be recalled. Time is bald in the hind 
    head. That which was, will be no more. Yesterday has taken its eternal 
    farewell. The candle that is burnt out to snuff, cannot be lighted again. No 
    medicine will cure that wound, no oratory will persuade it to return; crowns 
    and kingdoms will not buy it back again. Time past is out of their power, 
    the time to come is not theirs. Their only time is the present, what wonder 
    then they make haste. 2. Death is approaching, and there is no return from 
    it back again to this life, to rectify what was formerly done amiss, Job 
    14:14. There is no place for laboring there, Ecclesiastes 9:10; Heaven and 
    Hell are for other work than this. If the infant come to the world dead, the 
    open world will not revive him; and if death catch the soul idle, it shall 
    never have occasion to labor more, but under the wrath of God.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is in this labor carefulness and holy anxiety 
    about salvation, in the managing of the work, Philip. 2:12. Now this 
    implies, 1. The turning of the soul from anxious cares about the world, to a 
    holy solicitude about the salvation of the soul. When a man begins to labor 
    for Heaven, "who will show us any good?" is turned to, "what shall I do to 
    be saved?" For the man now knows that truth, "what is a man profited, if he 
    should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" The mind of man is too 
    narrow to be taken up about two such different objects at the same time. No 
    man can serve two masters. We may as well at once grasp Heaven and earth in 
    our arms, as be solicitous about both. It implies also a fear of falling 
    short of Heaven. I do not mean a fear of despondency, for that cuts off 
    laboring, and it is hope that feeds these laborers; nor yet a doubtfulness 
    as to the event, as when a man is racked with doubts, whether he shall be 
    saved or damned. This indeed is the man's case, when the Lord begins first 
    to deal with him, and is of good use to stir him up to labor; for here is 
    fear mixed with hope, and it is the work of the Spirit of God, Romans 8:15. 
    This is also the case of the people of God sometimes after conversion; but 
    this doubting is not their duty then, as not being from God's Spirit, "for 
    they have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear." But that in the 
    text is urged as duty, and there is a fear of falling short competent to 
    assured Christians, Hebrews 4:1, which is a spur to diligence. So Paul, 2 
    Corinthians 5:1–11. Noah had a promise of safety, yet "was he moved with 
    fear," Hebrews 11:7.</p>
<p align="justify">They ought to fear the thing, as Noah did the deluge; so 
    as to avoid everything that may expose them to it, and to do every tiling 
    that may contribute to their safety. It is not kindly assurance, but carnal 
    presumption that makes a man like the leviathan, to count darts as stubble, 
    and laugh at the shaking of the spear. No, he who seriously considers the 
    power of God's wrath, and that it is in itself possible for him to perish, 
    must needs tremble at the thought of Hell, and run to Christ, who alone can 
    deliver him from the wrath to come. That God can destroy both soul and body 
    in Hell, though he will not, is enough to make the heart quake.</p>
<p align="justify">It implies likewise, an earnest desire to be set and kept 
    on the way to Heaven. Men may labor to little purpose, if they be not on the 
    right way. "The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he 
    knows not how to go to the city." And when there are so many byways whose 
    end is destruction, the thoughts of this must needs make the soul anxious to 
    know where he is, and therefore he will be consulting the way-marks, 
    examining his way, and striving to steer his course to the right or left 
    hand, according as he may be directed by his counselors. He may come to 
    several steps in the way, with which he is not acquainted; these will put 
    him to a stand, not knowing to what hand to turn himself, whether that be 
    present duty or sin, but then he will lift his eyes to the Lord for 
    direction, Jeremiah 10:23; Proverbs 3:6; whereas others ramble forward at 
    random, and fall, to their ruin. There is here also a fear of mismanagement 
    in his work. The laborer for Heaven should work, and does best work with a 
    trembling hand. It was the fundamental maxim of the heathen moralists, have 
    confidence in yourself. But I may say the Christian maxim is, have no 
    confidence in yourself. He who trusts in his own heart is a fool. This makes 
    them circumspect to forecast dangers, to walk warily, like a child beginning 
    to walk, or a man recovering of a broken leg, Isaiah 38:15. They have an 
    anxious heart and earnest care about their work, seeing they work for 
    eternity. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show for what we are to labor. It is to enter into 
    the heavenly rest. This is that which we are to have in our eye, and to 
    which our endeavors are to be directed. We are not called to work for 
    nothing; but as Heaven is attainable, we are to labor that we may enter into 
    it. In speaking to this, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show some Scriptural notions of Heaven, to which this 
    of entering does agree.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What it is to enter into the heavenly rest.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Some steps in the way, by which we must labor to 
    enter.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I shall consider this laboring to enter, as it 
    respects our preparation for Heaven. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show some Scriptural notions of Heaven, to which 
    this of entering does agree.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Heaven is held out under the notion of a garden or 
    paradise. "Jesus said to the thief on the cross, today, shall you be with me 
    in paradise." Sinless Adam lived in the earthly paradise, sinless saints 
    shall live in the heavenly. It is a paradise for pleasures, in it "are 
    rivers of pleasures." Not one, but many Edens or pleasures. Here is the tree 
    of life, and on this tree are fruits in the greatest variety, abundance, and 
    excellence. We live now in a wilderness, we are to labonr to enter into a 
    paradise.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A house. "We have a building of God," says Paul, "an 
    house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." Solomon built a 
    magnificent house for Pharaoh's daughter; Heaven is that glorious house 
    which Christ the true Solomon has gone to prepare for his people. It is his 
    father's house, even the house of his kingdom; a house in which there are 
    many mansions fitted up for receiving all that ever shall come there; and 
    though not all, nay though not the most now present, shall ever come to it; 
    it is not for want of room, but for want of laboring to enter into it, for 
    it has a straight gate that discourages many.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The temple typified by that at Jerusalem. "Christ 
    entered not into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of 
    the true; but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for 
    us." It is called the tabernacle, Revelation 21:3; yes, the holiest, Hebrews 
    10:19, 20. Canaan was the glory of the world; Jerusalem was the glory of 
    Canaan, and the temple was the glory of Jerusalem. Now all these are a 
    ruinous heap; but no change here, "for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb 
    are the temple of it." How did the saints of old value the tabernacle and 
    temple, but as they were only shadows of the heavenly. In it, we shall have 
    Christ the true ark, in whom the law is fulfilled; the cherubim; the society 
    of angels; the golden candlestick; yes, the Lamb is the light thereof; the 
    incense altar Christ, by whom we are made priests to God, Revelation 1:6; 
    the table, in communion with God. Into this temple it is that we are to 
    labor to enter.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A city glorious for magnificence and beauty, largely 
    described, Revelation 21. The saints in glory are not penned up in a garden, 
    house, or temple; but walk at liberty in a city which God has prepared for 
    them, Hebrews 11:16. This is the city of the living God, which shall never 
    see ruins; here there is no hazard from within, no danger from without, 
    Revelation 21:25, 27. Into this city must we labor to enter, there to dwell 
    as citizens forever.</p>
<p align="justify">5. A country; even a better country than the best here 
    below, Hebrews 11:16. What toil did the Israelites undergo, that they might 
    enter into, and possess Canaan! Behold you are called to labor for a 
    heavenly country, in which nothing is wanting. This is the country in which 
    we are but sojourners, but Heaven is a country where we may live forever at 
    rest.</p>
<p align="justify">6. A kingdom, Matthew 25:34; a kingdom that cannot be 
    moved, Hebrews 11:28. The best kingdoms on earth are liable to sad 
    convulsions and shakings, but here is no hazard. Sin is not there; no vapors 
    inclosed in the affections of the earth, to make an earthquake there; and no 
    violence can come from without. Here all the subjects are kings, each with a 
    crown on his head. What need of penal laws here, where none of the subjects 
    can ever err? Who would refuse any labor to enter into this kingdom, where 
    they shall be welcome to the best of it, even to the throne, Revelation 
    3:21. We are,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what it is to enter into the heavenly rest. 
    There is a fivefold entering into Heaven and life, for which we must labor.</p>
<p align="justify">I. There is an entering into Heaven by the covenant. The 
    covenant of grace is the outer court of Heaven. Of this everlasting 
    covenant, ordered in all things and sure, David says, "this is all my 
    salvation and all my desire." Surely, then, Heaven was in it. The covenant 
    is the chariot in which Christ carries his people to glory. This chariot 
    cannot stop by the way, so that they who are once in it, shall as surely 
    come there, as if they were there already. They "are in hope of eternal 
    life, which God who cannot lie promised before the world began." So then we 
    must labor to be within the bond of the covenant. Faint wishes will not 
    carry you up into it. But, 1. You must close with Christ; make up the match 
    deliberately and sincerely between Christ and your souls. Take hold of 
    Christ, and you take hold of the covenant, Isaiah 42:6, and 27:5. You must, 
    2. Break covenant with your lusts, saying, with Ephraim, "What have I to do 
    any more with idols?" Many pretend to have covenanted with God at 
    communions; but it plainly appears, that of the chariot in which they are, 
    the devil is the driver; for they are a stain to religion, and cannot resist 
    temptations, "but are taken captive by the devil at his will." No wonder 
    that persons hasten after other gods, when the devil drives them. Quit them 
    we must, or quit the covenant, and so quit Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is an entering by faith. "Now faith is the 
    substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Faith is 
    the very being of things hoped for, it realizeth these things that to us, as 
    yet, have no being. Now we enter into Heaven two ways by faith: 1. In so far 
    as faith lays hold upon Christ, and unites us to him, John 6:54. Faith 
    embracing Christ, enfolds Heaven, for he is eternal life; "He is the true 
    God, and eternal life." Faith makes us one with Christ, who is now in 
    Heaven; in respect of which union, the apostle doubts not to say, that 
    believers are in Heaven already. "God," says he, "has raised us up together, 
    and made us sit together in heavenly places, in Christ Jesus." The new and 
    living way is the only way which faith treads. Labor then for true faith, 
    and an interest in Christ thereby. Never satisfy yourself with a faith of a 
    lower efficacy. Say not you cannot believe, the great defect is in your 
    will. "You will not come to me," says Jesus, "that you may have life." 
    Stretch out the withered hand to Christ; protest you shall never be 
    satisfied until he put forth mighty power to make you believe, and never 
    quit the throne until you get it, if you should dig your grave at it, Luke 
    18:39–43. 2. In so far as faith lays hold on the promise in which Heaven is 
    wrapped up. "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but 
    having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them." 
    Embraced them, that is, the things contained in them. An allusion to 
    mariners, who when they see the land, though afar off, yet joyfully salute 
    it. God's word is as good security as actual possession. And as men, by 
    charter and seisine, may enter into possession of lands which they never 
    saw, so the believer by faith may get possession of Heaven. Labor we then to 
    get hold of the promise by faith, which we must do by taking hold of Christ; 
    "for in him all the promises are yes, and in him amen, to the glory of God 
    by us."</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is an entering by hope. "Which hope we have as 
    an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that 
    within the veil." Therefore salvation is attributed to hope, Romans 8:24. 
    Faith goes out as a conqueror, and hope divides the spoil. Ask these that 
    have been plunged in despair, and they will tell you that they were in Hell, 
    even when on earth. Despair brings up Hell into the earth, and hope brings 
    down Heaven. Hope is indeed enjoyment anticipated, and excites the same joy, 
    delight, and delight, that enjoyment does, as you may see in things of the 
    world; only the difference is, in worldly things, the expectation is sweeter 
    than the enjoyment; in heavenly things, it is the reverse. We must then 
    labor for this well grounded hope, that the Spirit of God causes us to place 
    on his word, and that purifies the heart. Hope of Heaven, is compared to a 
    building founded upon a rock, Matthew 7:24; and this is a building on which 
    true pains must be taken: 1. In pulling down the old. It is no easy thing to 
    get down the old hopes, and to clear the foundation, leaving not one stone 
    upon another. This is hard work, many times ministers batter at it, and 
    still it stands, until God himself comes up, 2 Corinthians 10:4, 5; 
    oftentimes it is never pulled down, until death come and batter it down. 
    Like the mole, they will never open their eyes, until they come to die, Luke 
    16:23. But down it must be, for there is no building sure upon the old 
    foundation, Luke 15:17. Again, true pains must be taken in rearing up the 
    new. It is as easy for many now to hope for salvation as it is to breathe, 
    the reason is, they are both nature's fruit. But were once the old hopes 
    gone, it will not be easy to get up the new. It is as in the case of a 
    malefactor with the rope about his neck, laying his head over the ladder, 
    and one tells him of a pardon; how hard is it to hope or believe until he 
    see it, and sometimes the Lord does not suddenly let them see it. Ah! the 
    brand is in the fire, how hardly can it think to escape; what a conflict, 
    then, between hope and despair!</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. Better then we hold as we are. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. At best you will not hold long at it, for, 1. God 
    may make your life in sin a Hell to you, your name Magor Missabib. He can 
    wrap these filthy garments of your sin in brimstone, and then set them on 
    fire about your ears, as in the case of Judas. It is with the consciences of 
    the wicked, as with iron out of the fire a little; which you would not 
    suspect to be hot, until some water be poured on it, then it appears hot by 
    its hissing noise; so when some drops of wrath fall on a guilty conscience, 
    the noise will be dreadful.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, were your hopes fixed with bands of iron and 
    brass, and their foundation as deep as the center of the earth, death will 
    make such an earthquake in your soul, as shall not leave one stone upon 
    another, but shall cast it out, and sink it in the bottomless gulf of 
    eternal despair, Job 18:14. Once more, in keeping it up, it is easy to many 
    to keep up their hopes, because their hope is another tower of Babel, raised 
    up against Heaven, where the devil is master builder, and down it shall not 
    go, if the powers of Hell can hold it up; but the new godly hope is a fort 
    built against the inroads of Satan, which therefore the devil will not cease 
    to attack. It must stand against rains, floods, winds, Matthew 7:25. 
    Sometimes the child of God is ready to surrender, and to cast away his 
    confidence. Sometimes it is ready to be taken with strong hand, Lament. 
    3:18. David found this work not easy, Psalm 42: Labor then we must, thus to 
    enter.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is an entering by obedience. "I know," said 
    Jesus, "that his commandment is life everlasting." There is a personal way 
    to Heaven, that is, Christ. "I am," says he, "the way." Also a real way to 
    Heaven, that is, the commands of God, called everlasting life, because they 
    certainly land the soul in Heaven, and there is an infallible connection 
    between true obedience and glory. Christ is a captain as well as a Savior, a 
    king as well as a priest, and must be obeyed as well as believed in, Hebrews 
    5:9. They that would enter Heaven, but not by the way of obedience, must 
    resolve to get in over the walls, but come not in by the door; that is, they 
    shall never see it; "for without holiness no man shall see the Lord." We 
    must follow the footsteps of our blessed Lord and the flock, who all entered 
    Heaven this way; though in different respects, he by, and they in, 
    obedience. Here then we must labor to enter, and it is not every sort of 
    obedience that is the entry to Heaven. There must be labor, and it will cost 
    true pains: 1. To fall upon the way of true obedience. For alas! many do 
    much, but to no purpose. "The labor of the foolish wearies every one of 
    them, because he knows not how to go to the city." It is not easy to fall on 
    the way of universal obedience, to have respect to all God's commandments. 
    How much labor do some take in running to sermons, communions, prayers, and 
    yet still out of this way. Still it remains true, one thing he lacks. 
    Someone or more lusts still keep their ground, though he makes them change 
    their name, and calls them infirmities, while indeed they are reigning sins, 
    because his heart is knit to them. So deceitful are our hearts, that we have 
    great need to labor to fall on this way. "O that my ways were directed to 
    keep your statutes. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect to all 
    your commandments."</p>
<p align="justify">Nor is it easy to fall on the way of gospel obedience. 
    One man takes up himself when he comes to age, or to get a family. Another 
    gets his conscience alarmed, and he can get no rest until he turn over a new 
    leaf. Another has been under sore pangs and throws, but like Ishmael, he is 
    born before the time of the promise, and his law wounds get a law plaster. 
    And thus they hold on, seeking to enter Heaven by the gate of law obedience, 
    which, like the east gate of the sanctuary, Ezekiel 44:2, is inaccessible. 
    But we should labor to fall on the way of the gospel, where the wheels of 
    the soul are oiled with love, Hebrews 6:10; and faith and a renewed heart 
    are the springs of obedience, and the glory of God the chief end.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, it is not easy to hold on the way of obedience. 
    Some seem to walk with Christ a while, who at last turn apostates, John 
    6:66. Some fall off into the ditch of profanity, others into formality. 
    Sometimes they are sprightly professors, but at last, like worn out horses, 
    they fall down in the way, serving for nothing but stumbling-blocks to the 
    blind. Their hearts grow cold, their affections wither, their consciences 
    become stupid, and at length they are cut off, and cast over the hedge. To 
    hold on, then, in the way, is one thing for which we must labor; for while 
    we are on it, we will have the wind in our face, and it will be much if we 
    be not made either to sit down or go backward, and so create new work to 
    ourselves.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, There is an entering into Heaven by actual 
    possession, which in respect of our souls is at death, and in respect of our 
    bodies will be at the resurrection, which is the full and final entry, to 
    which all the rest are subservient. This entrance is that solemn entering 
    into the king's palace, Psalm 45:15, which shall also be most joyful. "For 
    the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and 
    everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and 
    sorrow and sighing shall flee away." They shall have angels to carry their 
    souls to Abraham's bosom, Luke 16:22, and shall enter Heaven as a bride 
    going into the marriage chamber, Matthew 25:10, where the marriage shall be 
    solemnized through all eternity. Then comes the time when the children of 
    God, cast out of the earthly paradise by sin, enter the heavenly, when they 
    shall bid farewell to the cottages of clay, and enter into the house not 
    made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Then these priests enter the 
    holiest of all; come into their city, and their native country, and enter as 
    heirs to their kingdom, their minority being over and past. We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To mention some steps in the way, by which we must 
    labor to enter.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must labor to get grace; this is the first step. 
    "Let us have grace," says Paul, "whereby we may serve God acceptably, with 
    reverence and godly fear." There is a ladder by which we must mount to 
    Heaven. The black state of nature, is the ground on which all men were once 
    standing; grace is the first remove, the first step of the ladder. The man 
    has now no other power, but the power of nature, but hereby he ought to 
    labor, to get grace. This is plain from Scripture, where the unregenerate 
    are commanded "to make them a new heart," Ezekiel 18:31, "to circumcise 
    themselves to the Lord," Jeremiah 4:4; Deuteronomy 10:16; "and to labor for 
    the meat which endures to everlasting life." Though God's commands are not 
    the measure of our strength, yet they are the measure of our duty.</p>
<p align="justify">This must needs be the first step; but many overlook 
    this, and so lose all their pains. They endeavor to perform duties for 
    salvation, but neither for grace, nor from grace. This makes all their 
    attempts for Heaven vain and fruitless, for they still leave the soul in the 
    same state of condemnation and enmity to God as before; for as they can 
    never atone for one sin, so they can never mortify one lust; only grace can 
    mortify corruption. It also makes their attempts faint and languid, and at 
    last they are ready to give over. Duties never flow freely from that soul, 
    where grace is not as a fountain to supply them. They are like the wick in 
    the lamp, that burns away quickly, where there is no oil about it, Matthew 
    25; Job 27:10. Now to get up this step is not easy, there must be labor at 
    it. It is a rising out of the grave; it is a casting off of nature, and 
    getting on a new nature; it is a second birth, which will not be without 
    pangs, and throws, and struggles. </p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But we cannot work grace in ourselves. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Though you cannot sow the seed, yet you may 
    prepare the ground, Jeremiah 4:3. You may examine your state; you may see 
    you have no grace, yourself lost and undone without it, which may break and 
    rend your hearts; and you may strongly desire it, and cry for it 
    importunately, and never take rest until you get it; and when you are doing 
    thus, God may do for you what you cannot do for yourselves, even he who is 
    found of them that seek him not. But if you do not do thus, you will be 
    condemned for contempt of grace, as well as for the want of it; and it will 
    be a worm in your conscience in Hell, that you did not do what you might 
    have done for the getting of grace, and that you began your work at the 
    wrong end. It is true, we cannot say God has obliged himself to give grace 
    to such, but there is a possibility of success, which in such a case must 
    determine any man to the work that acts rationally, as in the case of the 
    lepers at the gate of Samaria. There is a probability of it, also, from the 
    merciful nature of God, his surprising souls with converting grace; and 
    never was there any who were so taken up for grace, that ever we heard did 
    not obtain it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must labor to exercise grace in the gracious 
    performance of duties. "Work out your own salvation with fear and 
    trembling." As the former step sets us on the way, this carries us forward 
    in it. It is not enough to get grace, but we must make use of it. Grace is 
    an active principle. Some gracious souls fall asleep in the way, but they 
    must awake, rise again, and fall to work. And to do this will cost labor and 
    pains, for often the temper of the body is a great hindrance to the exercise 
    of grace. Some have a cheerful, light temper to struggle with, so that it is 
    hard for them to exercise godly sorrow; some a melancholy temper, so that it 
    is hard for them to believe and rejoice in Christ; there is likewise always 
    a mixture of the contrary corruption, which will be active in the soul: "For 
    the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and 
    these are contrary the one to the other; so that you cannot do the things 
    that you would." Satan also is a great enemy to the exercise of grace, if he 
    cannot kill the man he will endeavor to set him asleep.</p>
<p align="justify">A third step; growing in grace. This we must labor for. 
    Grow in grace is the divine command. It is the Christian's great work to be 
    going forward from strength to strength, still to be adding a cubit to his 
    spiritual stature, until he come to the measure of a perfect man in Christ. 
    This also will cost labor. It will not be easy to get a warmer love, 
    stronger faith, deeper humility. This will require much traveling between 
    Heaven and earth for supply; much watchfulness over what we have obtained. 
    See how Paul expresses it under the notion of running a race, Philippians 
    3:13, 14.</p>
<p align="justify">A fourth step; assurance of grace and glory. For this we 
    should labor. "Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure." 
    This will enable us to say, "we know whom we have believed, and are 
    persuaded that he is able to keep that which we have committed unto him 
    against that day." In this way we may also know the things freely given us 
    of God. This will cost labor, even to climb up to this top of Pisgah, to get 
    a sight of the land afar off. There must be pains here, to walk closely with 
    God, examine our hearts, apply our case to the Scripture, and to wrestle for 
    the testimony of the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Perseverance in grace to the end; for only such 
    shall be saved. This will cost labor to hold out all the days of your life, 
    and never to quit God's way while you live, but to live in the Lord always, 
    until you come to die in him.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I shall consider this laboring to enter, as it has a 
    respect to our preparation for that eternal rest in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">The man that is to go abroad is a busy man, putting all 
    things in order for his voyage; and he who is making for his night's rest in 
    bed, is not idle; and he who is to enter into the possession of eternal 
    rest, has much work on his hand preparatory thereto. And thus to labor to 
    enter into the heavenly rest implies,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The solid faith of eternal life, even of this truth, 
    "that there remains a rest for the people of God." He who is thus laboring, 
    has a firm persuasion, that his rest is not here; but that he must go over 
    Jordan, and that there is certainly a rest in the other world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A sincere desire to be partaker of that rest, after 
    this troublesome life is over. He is one that looks for Christ's appearance, 
    and waits until his change come, earnestly desiring to be admitted into that 
    rest.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Resolute endeavors to enter there, by God's own way, 
    which has already been described.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Frequent thoughts of that eternal rest. It is often in 
    his mind. He looks on himself as a pilgrim and stranger, and one posting 
    away to his unalterable state. Thus the man is put on to make all ready for 
    that voyage. Now if we would do this, we must,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Labor to get our hearts more and more loosed from sin. 
    Heaven's gate is strait, it will not take in a man with a burden of sin upon 
    his back. A camel may as soon go through the eye of a needle, as a man with 
    a load of unmortified corruption on his back enter Heaven. If it be on his 
    back, yet if it be loose, it will then fall off, and he will get in; like 
    Joseph, he will escape, leaving his mantle behind him, which hangs loose on 
    his shoulders. Sin is fastened in our souls by nature, as with bands of iron 
    and brass. Converting grace looses it at the root, but it must be loosed 
    more and more, by the daily practice of mortification. "For if you live 
    after the flesh, you shall die; but if you, through the Spirit, do mortify 
    the deeds of the body, you shall live."</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must labor to keep a pure conscience. "And herein," 
    said Paul, "do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of 
    offence, toward God, and toward men." As a man will labor to have his 
    accounts cleared, and to lay down a way for the payment of his debts, who is 
    to go off the country, never to return. The want of this, makes many of 
    God's children to cry that death would not sist execution. For, as the man 
    whose stomach is gnawing with hunger, is not meet to go to bed; so the man 
    whose conscience is oppressed with guilt, is not meet for entering into the 
    rest of Heaven. This will be a continual labor to you. Two things are to be 
    done for this purpose: 1. You must labor to keep yourselves from all sin, so 
    far as is possible. 2. Because it is impossible to keep from it perfectly, 
    therefore you must be making continual recourse to the blood of Christ. Make 
    particular application for those sins that wound the conscience, and for 
    daily infirmities that are past knowledge or counting. "How much more shall 
    the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without 
    spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living 
    God."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Labor to keep waking and waiting for your 
    transportation into that rest, Luke 12:35–37. The elect of God are not fit 
    for that rest, while they lie with the world in wickedness, therefore God 
    sends them converting grace; he makes a stir in their souls, that they 
    cannot rest, until they have some evidence that Christ is theirs. But 
    ordinarily, after this they fall asleep, Matthew 25:5; therefore there is a 
    new labor to get out of this security. The day was, when you could not sleep 
    without some evidence of the Lord's love; but now you think the main work is 
    done, and you have yet much time, so are not waiting. O! but a surprise in 
    this matter is heavy; if death finds you asleep when it comes and arrests 
    you on a bed, you may be saved, yet so as by fire. Labor, therefore, with 
    old Simeon, to wait for the consolation of Israel, and then you shall meet 
    death with a song. "Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, 
    according to your word." Waiting for this rest has a twofold advantage. It 
    makes a man diligent in making all ready for his departure. The wise virgins 
    arose, and trimmed their lamps. They that have truly learned to number their 
    days, will apply their hearts unto wisdom. The servant that is thinking his 
    Lord delays his coming, will eat and drink with the drunken. Again, this 
    waiting makes a man welcome the grim messenger, and embrace death in his 
    arms, Job 14:14, 15. So that though nature cannot but shiver at the first 
    sight of such an enemy to nature; yet faith beholding its commission, will 
    salute it with old Simeon, Luke 2:29. The soul will see Christ at the back 
    of the messenger, and so say, "This is our God, we have waited for him."</p>
<p align="justify">4. To keep up communion with God in duties, and in the 
    constant course of our lives. This is to have a Heaven on earth. "Our 
    conversation is in Heaven." The philosophers say well, that happiness 
    consists in operation. Heaven is not a rest in idleness, but a working rest. 
    We should then labor to inure ourselves to the work which we are to have 
    above. In this world, we are as it were apprentices at the trade of 
    communion with God, that when our time is out, we may set up in the New 
    Jerusalem; for there is working, "there they rest not day nor night." There 
    remains, says the apostle, Hebrews 4:9, a rest; the keeping of a Sabbath, 
    which is no idle day to those that are spiritual. Here is work for you; you 
    have your trial-piece to make, O Christians! Try now the singing of one of 
    Zion's songs in a strange land.</p>
<p align="justify">5. To get our hearts weaned from the world. The man that 
    is going abroad, he is busy taking leave of his friends. Christ has given 
    you the first call already, that you may take leave of them all. "Come with 
    me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me, from Lebanon." Let it not then be to 
    do, when the next call comes. When the corn forsakes the ground, it is ready 
    for the book; and when the apple is ripe, a little shake makes it with ease 
    fall from the tree. It will not be easy to get our hearts weaned from the 
    world, for we are born with it in our hearts. Only sovereign grace can make 
    such an earthquake in the soul as will shake it out. Labor to be loosed even 
    from lawful enjoyments, to be crucified to them, Galatians 6:14; and while 
    you use them, do it with fear, like the dogs of Egypt, who, when they come 
    to the Nile, lap their water, running for fear of the crocodiles in the 
    river.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Labor to dispatch the work of your day and generation 
    with all speed. There is a twofold work we have to do. 1. Our salvation 
    work. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." This must be 
    dispatched. Of this we have spoken before. 2. The work of our day and 
    generation, Acts 13:36. The former respects our eternal salvation, the 
    latter God's glory in the world; the first for ourselves, the next for God. 
    To every one God has carved out a certain piece of work, which should be 
    performed before working time be done, Ecclesiastes 9:10. The apostle sets 
    this work before you. "As we have therefore opportunity," says he, "let us 
    do good unto all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith." 
    Are you a parent, then bestir yourselves in time for your children, that 
    they may be the Lord's. Are you a master of a family; can you do anything 
    for the church of God? does God put any opportunity of doing him service in 
    your hand? then dispatch your work. Before long the opportunity may be taken 
    out of your hand; and it is an unworthy thing for a man to say, I was not 
    aware of this, as many do in a dying hour.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Labor to die daily. "I die daily," said Paul. We 
    should as it were habituate ourselves to dying, and be frequently making an 
    essay of dying. This was Job's practice, Job 17:13, 14. Ask yourselves what 
    you would do, if you were just to expire; and do the same. A Christian 
    should be frequently making his testament. When you go to a duty, do it as 
    if it were the last you were ever to do on earth. When you awake in the 
    morning, do as if you were to have the grave for your next bed; and when you 
    lie down at night, so compose yourselves as if you were never to awaken 
    more. So it may be.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Labor to get your hearts made willing to die, and to 
    long to be partaker of that rest. "I am," says Paul, "in a strait between 
    two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better." 
    For this you must labor, it is not easy to attain it. A fit of passion 
    indeed, may make some desire to be gone, as Jonah; but soon would they 
    shrink back, should the Lord take them at their word. But would you be thus 
    willing, then labor to lay all your cares on the Lord by faith, and to trust 
    him with your worldly concerns, Philippians 4:6; Jeremiah 49:11. Faith makes 
    the soul rest in God, in midst of perplexing difficulties. You must also 
    keep up due thoughts of the body of sin and death. Keep its ugliness ever in 
    your eye, this will make you long to be rid of it, Romans 7:24; and truly, 
    none fitter for rest than that soul that is groaning under the body of 
    death. Labor also to taste the sweetness of the enjoyment of God by faith. 
    The more that a soul gets of this, the more it would have. These heavenly 
    influences carry the soul heavenward. Finally, clearness as to your interest 
    in Christ, is a noble preparative for that rest, and to make us willing to 
    depart. Here is work enough for you; and when you have done it, you will 
    find you have done nothing more than was necessary. We now go on to the</p>
<p align="justify">III. General head. To show how we should labor. The 
    apostle tells us, that a man is not crowned except he strive lawfully. Great 
    labor may be to no purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We should labor willingly and cheerfully. "You, Lord, 
    meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in 
    your ways." God loves a cheerful giver. When people do nothing in religion, 
    but as reluctant slaves from the force of the whip, it is very unacceptable 
    to God. His people are a willing people, and he cares not for forced work, 
    when the hands work without the heart. If people work not willingly here, 
    where will they do it? It is for your own salvation you are working. God is 
    a good master. Christ's yoke is an easy yoke to a renewed heart. "His 
    commandments are not grievous" to those who obey them from love. Get then 
    the new nature, and then this work will be natural and easy to you, as 
    streams flow easily from a fountain.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Diligently. "The soul of the diligent shall be made 
    fat." The slothful man is the waster's brother. How busy will a man be to 
    gain something of the world; he will rise early, and sit up late. How busy 
    is the devil to prevent our entrance into that rest, and shall we not be 
    diligent that we may enter. Consider well the eyes of the great Master are 
    upon you, for he is every where present. He sees you in the church, in the 
    closet, in the family, and in all places, Psalm 139:7–10.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Labor with all your might, Ecclesiastes 9:10. We have 
    a great work to do. Feeble attempts will not accomplish it. It is requisite 
    that we summon together all the powers of our souls. The iron is blunt, we 
    must wield it with more strength. He who asks a thing coldly, courts a 
    denial; and he who works carelessly, and faintly here, portends want of 
    success.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Resolutely; like Jacob, who would not let the angel go 
    until he blessed him. We labor for what we cannot want, and therefore must 
    put on a resolution to face, and to run through all difficulties. "The 
    kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force." "Skin 
    for skin, yes, all that a man has, will he give for his life." The 
    Israelites when they heard of the Anakim in Canaan, their hearts fainted, 
    they were discouraged, therefore they never saw the land; only Caleb and 
    Joshua, who followed the Lord fully, were allowed to enter.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Constantly. "The righteous shall hold on his way, and 
    he who has clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger." "We must be 
    steadfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord." We must 
    not take our work by fits and starts; that is the thing which makes it so 
    uneasy to many; whereas constancy would make it easy to us, and uneasy to be 
    out of this work. Hot and cold fits are signs of a distempered body, so 
    unsteadiness in religion is an evidence that all is not right within. This 
    warfare and work is for term of life. "No man that puts his hand to the 
    plough and looks back, is fit for the kingdom of God." "For if any man draw 
    back," says God, "my soul shall have no pleasure in him." Deserters are 
    shamefully and severely punished, when prisoners of war are honorably 
    entertained. We are laboring against the stream, and therefore cannot 
    intermit our work without loss. "Look then to yourselves, that we lose not 
    those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."</p>
<p align="justify">6. With fear and trembling, Philip. 2:12. Keep a holy 
    dread, and reverential fear of God always on your spirits. Fear him as a 
    witness to all you do. He sees what, and how you do. He must be a bold 
    servant indeed, that will neglect his work, or go about it slightly, while 
    his master's eye is upon him. Fear him also, as him from whom you have all 
    your ability for working, lest he should be provoked to withdraw his 
    influences from you. And fear him as your judge, who will one day reward you 
    according to your works. Remember your work will be brought to light, and 
    what you do will be weighed in the balance of the sanctuary.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Quickly; without delay, for you know not how soon your 
    sun may go down. "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is 
    day: the night comes when no man can work." Your glass is running, and if 
    your time be done before your work, it will be a heavy case.</p>
<p align="justify">8. You must refuse no piece of work which God puts into 
    your hands. "Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all your 
    commandments." Many are like servants who, when they are hired, will promise 
    to do all things; but when it comes to the push, the sluggard will not 
    plough because of the cold. You must not carve out your own work, but let 
    Christ carve it out for you, saying, "Lord, what will you have me to do?"</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Evangelically; which comprehends the acting from 
    a principle of a new life of grace, called the life of Jesus, 2 Corinthians 
    4:10. Next a sweet principle of love to God, "For the love of Christ," says 
    Paul, "constrains us." Again it comprehends a noble end, the glory of God, 
    the honor of the Redeemer, the glory of his grace, and our own salvation. 
    Finally, A doing of all in borrowed strength, leaning upon our beloved, and 
    denying ourselves. "For we, as Christians, must be the circumcision which 
    worship God in the spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence 
    in the flesh." We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To show that we must labor in order to our entering 
    into that rest. I shall evidence this by these considerations following:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider the several notions under which the 
    Christian's life and the way to Heaven is held forth, all of them implying 
    true pains and labor. It is a working, John 6:27, "Labor not for the meat 
    that perishes." (Greek,) "work." Here he who works not, shall not eat. Yes, 
    it is a working out of our own salvation; a bringing the work to perfection, 
    otherwise what is done will be lost, 2 John 8. It is compared to the work of 
    the gardener, which you know is not easy, ploughing, sowing, reaping, Hosea 
    10:12, especially considering that they are both the laborers, and the 
    ground that is labored. The Christian is a spiritual soldier, he must fight, 
    2 Timothy 4:7; yes, and overcome, Revelation 3:21. Heaven has a strait gate 
    by which to enter in, and therefore cannot be entered with ease. Men must 
    press into it, Luke 16:16; and take it by storm; yes put forth their utmost 
    strength as they that are agonizing. Luke 13:24, as wrestling upon life and 
    death. They have a wrestling life of it, Ephesians 6:12, such as makes all 
    the body to shake again. It is a real fight, 1 Corinthians 9:26. It is the 
    running of a race, Hebrews 12:1; which requires patience and perseverance, 
    and great eagerness; for they must so run as to obtain the prize. They must 
    pursue holiness, Hebrews 12:14; as one that earnestly follows a person 
    flying until he catch him; or that pursues the prey, until he seize it. The 
    apostle says, 2 Corinthians 5:9, we labor; the word signifies to labor most 
    earnestly, as an ambitious man for honor; and what will not such do, to gain 
    their point?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider how the way to Heaven was typified under the 
    Old Testament. Canaan was a type of Heaven, and to what labor were the 
    Israelites put, before they could reach that land, though it was promised to 
    them. This I take to be aimed at in our text. Many a bloody battle they 
    fought, before they got possession. Many a temptation and trial they met 
    with, that laid many of them by. The taking of the castle of Zion, 2 Sam, 
    5:6. Another eminent type of it, was the ascent into the temple, which was 
    seated upon a hill, even Mount Moriah, 1 Kings 10:5. Many a weary step had 
    some of them before they got to Jerusalem, Psalm 84:6, 7; and when they came 
    there, they had to ascend unto the hill of God, Psalm 24:3, the mount of the 
    Lord's house, a type of Heaven. What a wrestling had Jacob, before he got 
    the blessing, Genesis 32; and wherefore this, but to teach us what we have 
    to do, Hosea 12:4.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider how the Scripture supposes this labor. In 
    that the Christian is held forth as a man lying groaning under a heavy 
    burden, Romans 7:24; and can such an one be at ease. Again it exhorts us not 
    to weary and faint, Galatians 6:5; what need of this, if we must not labor? 
    It prescribes remedies against these, and directs us "to consider him that 
    endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we be wearied 
    and faint in our minds." It also calls upon us to increase our stock, which 
    will not be done by idleness. "Occupy until I come." We are also promised 
    strength for working, Isaiah 40:29–31. Finally, Heaven is held forth to us 
    as a reward; a reward not for, but according to, our works. "Knowing that of 
    the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the 
    Lord Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Consider how the Scripture represents the sluggard and 
    his temper to us, as most hateful to God, and as one that is lost by his 
    sloth, Proverbs 13:4; 20:4; and 21:25. The sluggard is the unprofitable 
    servant, Matthew 25:26–30. He is unprofitable to himself, unprofitable to 
    his master, as neglecting his two great works above mentioned. Mark his 
    sentence, he loved darkness to sleep in it. He shall have enough, for his 
    portion shall be in outer darkness. For carnal mirth, he shall have weeping 
    and wailing. He would not plough because of the cold. In Hell he shall have 
    it so, as he shall gnash his teeth.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Whom God intends for Heaven, in them he puts an active 
    principle of grace. It is as natural for grace to bring forth good works, as 
    for a good fruit tree to bring forth good fruit. True grace will not hide, 
    more than a fountain, which if it be stopped at one place, will find vent at 
    another. The Spirit is in believers, as a well of living waters, springing 
    up to everlasting life. Therefore, if you think to be saved without 
    laboring, conclude you shall be saved without grace. If you cannot be saved 
    without grace, no more can you without laboring.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, To enter Heaven without labor is a contradiction; 
    and so impossible. Heaven is a reward, and necessarily pre-supposes working. 
    Moreover, it is a rest which is a relative term, and has necessarily labor 
    pre-supposed to it. "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from 
    henceforth: yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and 
    their works do follow them." Heaven cannot be Heaven to idlers, for it 
    cannot be a rest to them. The word in the text signifies a ceasing or 
    desisting, therefore they must be laboring before. It is the keeping of a 
    sabbath that remains to the people of God; therefore there must be working 
    through the week of our life. Let us now,</p>
<p align="justify">V. Show why we must labor in this spiritual work, in 
    order to our entering Heaven. Negatively; not because by works we must merit 
    Heaven, for the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
    Our working is the way to the kingdom; not the cause of our reigning; 
    Christ's working was that. Men lose their labor, while they offer it to God 
    as their righteousness. The price of Heaven, to them that will buy it for 
    themselves, is perfect obedience; according to the King's book of rates. "If 
    you will enter into life, keep the commandments." Now we can never make up 
    this sum, unless we can satisfy for bygone sins, and perfectly obey for the 
    time to come. But we must labor, because,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the command of our great Lord and Master, whose 
    command we are not to dispute, but to obey. "Why call you me," says he, 
    "Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? A son honors his father, and 
    a servant his master; if then I be a Father, where is mine honor? and if I 
    be a Master, where is my fear?" In whatever state man be, he is still a 
    creature, and as a creature owes obedience to his Creator. Though you have 
    shot the gulf, as to condemnation, yet you are still under his law. The 
    queen is on the right hand; but she is standing, in token of subjection to 
    him as her Lord, Psalm 45:9.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The glory of God requires it. "Let your light so shine 
    before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which 
    is in Heaven." Now his glory is our chief end, 1 Corinthians 10:31. Our 
    souls and bodies are his, and therefore ought to be employed in his service. 
    It glorifies God before the world, when a man is at all pains to get there, 
    where God has his throne. The way that we glorify God, is by declaring his 
    perfections before the world. Now God has stamped his image on the gracious 
    soul; but this is hid, until, by good works in the life, it be displayed. 
    And moreover, the laborious Christian glorifies God, in so far as, by his 
    course of life, men know what a God he is, whom he serves. His carefulness 
    to get on Christ's righteousness, shows him a just God; the Christian 
    fleeing from sin, preaches God's holiness; and his secret conscientious walk 
    speaks God's omniscience and omnipresence.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because there is an infallible connection between 
    laboring and the rest. Laboring is the only way we can attain it. There is 
    no reaching the treasure of glory without digging for it. "If we live after 
    the flesh, we shall die;" "and without holiness, no man shall see the Lord." 
    If men must have yet a little sleep, outer darkness will be their landing 
    place. Heaven is a place of rest for laborers, not for loiterers. By an 
    eternal decree, this is the fixed way to Heaven. "For we are his 
    workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, unto good works; which God has before 
    ordained, that we should walk in them." Good works are the seed, after which 
    only we can expect the harvest of glory, Galatians 6:7, 8; and laboring must 
    needs go before a reward.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because otherwise, we pour contempt on the heavenly 
    rest. It was the sin of the Israelites, Psalm 106:24, 25. This rest is God's 
    special mansion house; the palace of the great King, purchased by the blood 
    of the Son; the place for which the Holy Spirit prepares souls. If we labor 
    not for it, this says we think it not worth the pains. How will men labor 
    for the things of the world, yet will not be at pains for Heaven. Is not 
    this a real preferring of the world to that glory? Mark the apostle's 
    exhortation, Heb 12:14, 15; with the reason of it, verse 16.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Because it is difficult work you have to do, and 
    therefore we should set ourselves to laboring, for it is heart work. Much of 
    religion is inwardly, and the heart must be brought up to every piece of 
    work; and none ever tried that, but must say it is indeed difficult. Again, 
    it is work in which you have all that you did before to undo. Sinner, what 
    have you been doing, but laboring to keep yourself out of that rest? You 
    have been platting cords to bind yourself in the pit. You have been weaving 
    your whole life into one web of sin. Now you must open all out again, by 
    repentance and fleeing to Christ. Besides it is a work in which you must 
    undo; for there are that labor to keep you out of that rest, the devil, the 
    world, and your own corrupt hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">Now for APPLICATION.—I exhort you in the words of the 
    text, "Let us labor, therefore, to enter into that rest." Old and young, we 
    would call you here to your work. This is a great purpose, on which we would 
    insist; and to make way for what is to be said to stir you up, I would lay 
    some evidences before you to show that there is little of this laboring 
    among us.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Infrequency in the duties of religion. Many live utter 
    strangers to the duty of prayer, particularly in secret. These that are 
    praying persons, how easily are they satisfied; maybe once a day, maybe 
    twice, though God put other opportunities in their hands. Religion is their 
    least work, not their business.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The unconcerned way of performing duties. How dead and 
    cold are we for the most part, in the duties of religion. In hearing, though 
    our ears be open, our hearts are shut; in prayer, the heart leaves the 
    tongue. We pray as if we cared not whether we be heard or not. Duties are 
    rather managed as a task, than as a privilege. How few labor wrestling for 
    the blessing, and are afterwards concerned to know how they succeed?</p>
<p align="justify">3. The want of desire after the heavenly rest. Rest is 
    sweet to the laboring man. Will not the traveler desire the place to which 
    he is going, and the laboring man desire his rest. And so will the 
    Christian; his treasure is in Heaven, and his heart will be there also. But 
    alas! the language of the hearts of many is, with that profane cardinal, who 
    said he would give up his part in paradise for certain specified enjoyments 
    on earth. No doubt many would make a bargain with God on lower terms, and 
    let him keep his Heaven to himself, so that he would permit them to live on 
    this earth, and shift for themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The little appetite after spiritual food. Laboring men 
    can readily take their meat, their work gives them an appetite; and so the 
    man that is laboring to enter will desire the influences of grace, the 
    communications of the Spirit, and fellowship with Christ, that he may be the 
    better fitted for his work. And so his work is to be frequently drawing 
    strength from the fountain of it. "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, 
    to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God."</p>
<p align="justify">5. The little progress that the most make in the way to 
    Heaven. Alas! some are gone backward, and are fallen from their first love. 
    Many are like the door on the hinges, still where it was some years ago. How 
    few are there, that are adding a cubit to their spiritual stature? And are 
    these laboring to enter, who are never a whit farther forward than they 
    were? Surely continual dropping wears the rock, and labor overcomes all 
    difficulties. For motives to this labor take the following:</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider that in other things you do not refuse 
    to labor. You are not such as live idle and at ease. Now God is putting a 
    piece of work in your hands; will you labor for others, but not for him?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider the work and labor which you have for your 
    livelihood. You are not as many; who sit down to eat and drink, and then 
    rise up to play. No; in the sweat of your brows you earn your bread. When 
    you have wrought to weariness, all has enough to do to procure you a 
    maintenance, though coarse; and within a little you shall die, and that body 
    for which you labor will molder into pieces of dust; and of all your labors 
    you shall carry nothing hence, Ecclesiastes 5:15.</p>
<p align="justify">But ah! may not many say, they have made me keeper of 
    another's vineyard, but mine own vineyard have I not kept. I have been busy 
    laboring the ground, but mine own heart has been neglected; I have been 
    wearied cutting down the harvest of others, but as yet mine own seed for 
    glory is not sown. I have managed a house, but neglected mine own soul. I 
    have toiled these many years for my body, but neglected my soul. And what 
    wisdom is in this? For consider, 1. The body is mortal, your soul is 
    immortal. Were you to die like a beast, you might live like a beast, and 
    only eat, drink, sleep, and work. But you have an immortal soul, that will 
    live when your body dies. It will be vigorous when your tongue begins to 
    faulter, and your breath comes to take its last farewell; and will be going 
    to the judgment when your friends are closing your eyes, and preparing for 
    your burial. Will you then labor for the body, and not for the soul?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Your soul craves far more than your body. While the 
    body is active, a little will serve it for food and clothing; and after 
    death, a small piece of ground, which none will grudge it. But the soul 
    cannot be so easily satisfied. Nothing less than an infinite good can 
    satisfy the soul. He was a fool indeed, who spoke of his soul, as of his 
    swine, saying, "Soul, you have goods laid up for many years; take your ease, 
    eat, drink, and be merry." Nothing but the eternal enjoyment of God can 
    satisfy the soul, that is the only breast that can stay this hungry child.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Your soul is of far more worth than the body. Is a 
    spiritual substance to be laid in the balance with a piece of dust? The soul 
    is the diamond in the ring, the jewel in the cabinet. To lose the soul by 
    caring for the body, is to lose the foot to save the shoe, Matthew 16:26. 
    What a poor bargain had Judas of his thirty pieces! And what a poor bargain 
    have they at death who, like the spider, work out their affections, and in a 
    moment they and their labors are swept away into darkness!</p>
<p align="justify">4. The true way to care for the body, is to labor for the 
    soul. Were there no resurrection of the body, the course of the world were 
    more tolerable; but now they do quite mistake the point; for caring thus for 
    the body at the neglect of the soul, they do but fatten the body for the day 
    of slaughter; laying it down full of sin, to be raised full of wrath, for 
    fuel to God's vengeance. In this sense, that is true, which we have Matthew 
    10:39; "He who finds his life shall lose it, and he who loses his life for 
    my sake shall find it." But would we labor for our souls, we should then lay 
    up for our bodies, Philippians 3:19–21. Make these reflections when you are 
    at your labor.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We are all laborious creatures. The greatest idler on 
    earth is in some respect busy. When your hands are doing nothing, yet your 
    hearts are busy. Our life is nothing but a continued succession of actions, 
    as the fire continually burns, and the rivers continually run. Now God does 
    not require of us to do more work, but only other work. To do more than we 
    do is in some sense impossible, for we are ever doing. The soul of man is 
    like a watch, where the wheels go as fast when it moves falsely, as when it 
    goes true. Seeing then we are ever traveling, why may we not rather hold the 
    King's highway, than be wandering, as the blind, hither and thither.</p>
<p align="justify">6. While we labor not to enter into this rest, we are 
    laboring about trifles; like Martha, we are careful and troubled about many 
    things; and like Ephraim, feeding on the wind, and following after the east 
    wind. What are riches, but the name of nothing, Proverbs 23:5. Honors, but 
    as a fair bubble that children blow up. In all which, we but load ourselves 
    with thick clay; and when we come to cast up our accounts we may say, "We 
    have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth 
    wind." And we answer Solomon's question with shame and blushing, "What 
    profit has he who has labored for the wind?" What a fool was he who 
    pretended to lead out an army to fight the enemy, and all he did was to make 
    them gather shells by the sea-side? What a fool was he who busied himself 
    catching flies, while he should have minded the affairs of the empire. 
    Laborious idleness, and solemn trifling, are very unfitting a Christian.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. Your profession and your vows call upon you to 
    labor to enter. You have been professing yourselves believers in Christ, and 
    followers of him. You are therefore called upon "to fight the good fight of 
    faith, and to lay hold upon eternal life."</p>
<p align="justify">You were professing your union and communion with Christ, 
    and therefore labor to enter his rest. The head is gone to Heaven, why will 
    not the members labor to follow? Idle members, or such as trifle away their 
    time, are very unsuitable to a head that labored so hard for their 
    salvation. There is sap in the vine; must the branches hang on it withered, 
    shall they not bring forth fruit? If not, take heed you be not lopped off, 
    and cast over the hedge. Show your faith by your works, your union with 
    Christ by your spiritual labor. You were professing your near and special 
    relation to him. Are you Christ's children, then mind you are to labor, for 
    he brings up no idlers. The heathens exposed those children that they judged 
    would not be useful for the commonwealth. Christ's spouse must labor to be 
    with her husband, else she gives a shrewd sign of a whorish heart. His 
    servants must all labor, and his soldiers must fight for the kingdom above.</p>
<p align="justify">You professed your turning your back on the world and 
    your lusts. What must you do then, but labor to enter into that rest; and as 
    you were called, so to come away with him. Will you look back again to the 
    flesh-pots of Egypt? Know what a look cost Lot's wife. Have you set your 
    face towards Canaan, and will you not labor to enter there?</p>
<p align="justify">You were at a spiritual feast; you have got your meal to 
    fit you for your work; then up and be doing. The Passover was eaten by the 
    Israelites with their loins girded, and their staves in their hands, as 
    ready to go forward; so ought it to be with us. He feeds his people, not for 
    slaughter, but for work. There is a banner in Christ's banqueting-house, 
    that the guests may know their work which they have to do.</p>
<p align="justify">You were getting a full covenant sealed, influences of 
    grace, strength against corruption, all confirmed to you. It is but a mock 
    if you labor not, and so improve them. Why went you to seek strength, if you 
    intend not to use it? What need have you of influences if you mind not to go 
    in the strength of them?</p>
<p align="justify">You were devoting yourselves to the Lord; you have lifted 
    up your hands to the Lord, and you cannot go back. If you do, God will abhor 
    you, the devil will find you more work than before, and you will be a 
    reproach to religion, and you will never sin at so cheap a rate as before.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. Your time is short; before long, all of us 
    shall be in an unalterable state. By the course of nature, some are at the 
    borders of the grave, many in their, declining state; to all of us our time 
    is uncertain, for graves of all sizes are in the churchyard. One generation 
    passes away, another comes in its stead. There is room enough in the earth, 
    notwithstanding of the vast numbers that came to it before us. Every child 
    that is born, comes to us with a warning away, telling us to provide our 
    lodging elsewhere. Death will neither be boasted nor bribed. Our life is a 
    vapor, our days a shadow, an handbreadth, soon passed over, yes a mere 
    nothing. Is our time short, then it will soon be over, and therefore,</p>
<p align="justify">We must labor now or never. The night comes, in which no 
    man can work. Time for working will soon be gone, how can we be at ease, 
    while so much of our time is past, and so little of our work done? Yet are 
    not there many on whom the shadows of the evening are begun to be stretched 
    out, and yet they know not where they will take up their eternal lodging?</p>
<p align="justify">Before long our labor will be over, and we will come to 
    that eternal rest. If the work be hard, yet it is not long. He who is tired 
    with his journey, will recover his spirits, when he sees he is near the end 
    of it; and the shadows of the evening make the laborer work heartily, 
    knowing that it will soon be done. The apostle tells us, our afflictions are 
    but short, our weeping is but for a moment. For yet a little while, and the 
    laughter of fools, which is but as the crackling of thorns under a pot, will 
    go away in a blaze, and the sorrows and labors of the Lord's people will be 
    at an end. The watchmen will be called in from the posts, the soldiers will 
    lay by their swords and put on their crowns, and the laborers will bid an 
    eternal farewell to their painful labors, and enjoy their reward.</p>
<p align="justify">I add, that in some sort, less pains will serve in 
    religion to save you, than men take in sin to damn them. For consider, 
    religion contracts our work, it brings it to one thing, Psalm 27:4; Luke 
    10:41, 42. Sinners have the devil, the world, and the flesh, to please. The 
    work of religion also is of a piece. Sin not so. All the graces of the 
    Spirit go together in sweet harmony, but our lusts are quite contrary to one 
    another; and as they war against grace, so they war among themselves; so 
    that the sinner is dragged by one lust one way, by another another way. And 
    how uneasy is it to work to different masters. This is what sinners do, and 
    only religion can give ease here.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. Your time is uncertain, as well as short. We 
    have no security of life, but are tenants-at-will; when the Lord may call us 
    away we know not, Matthew 25:44, 46. A moment's delay here, may be an 
    eternal loss. What an unsure thing is life to depend upon! How many have 
    projected great things to be done in the time to come; but death has come 
    unlooked for, and that day their thoughts have perished. What remains, but 
    that we should quickly set ourselves to work, and with all diligence hold at 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 5. The devil is busy to keep you out of that rest. 
    He goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Though you be 
    idle, he is not idle. He is an industrious adversary. He will be careful to 
    put other work in your hand, and to suit his temptations to your corrupt 
    inclinations. If he can keep you out of Heaven, and accomplish your ruin, he 
    will do it. He is an enemy that wants not skill to contrive means for your 
    ruin. He has had several thousand years' experience of the art of ruining 
    souls. He wants not malice enough to make him act vigorously; and he has 
    plenty of cunning to deceive. His power is great, but limited. He may be 
    counteracted, but it will cost labor. By the shield of faith properly 
    wielded, "We shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one." 
    Learn then of the devil the worth of your souls.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 6. You have weighty calls to this work and labor.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You have the call of the word and ordinances. 
    Wherefore has the Lord sent you his gospel, but for this end. Does a master 
    light a candle for his servants to play themselves? God has lighted his 
    candle among you. The work of ministers is to call you to labor for the 
    salvation of your souls. You are not shut up in the dark, nor muffled up in 
    clouds of error and ignorance. The darkness is over, the light is come; the 
    night is over, the day breaks, and the sun is up; be not then as the beasts, 
    but quit yourselves as men, Psalm 104:22, 23.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You have the call of providence. What may be the 
    conduct of providence towards each of you in particular, you ought to 
    observe. I dare not but say, that the dispensation of providence towards 
    this congregation at this time, calls us to stir up ourselves and to set 
    about our work. The state of affairs also, in this land at this day, has a 
    loud call to us. Many are afraid of a stroke to these nations; and while 
    such great affairs are in agitation, it is unaccountable to be idle and 
    unconcerned.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The call of conscience. It is scarcely to be supposed, 
    that men who live under such gospel light as we do, but that sometimes they 
    have their convictions, when even heathens have theirs, Romans 2:14, 15. 
    Does not conscience often tell the sluggard, that a little more sleep may be 
    fatal to him. O hear the excitements of your conscience to duty, that you 
    may not have to endure its gnawings.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, If you labor not, you will never see Heaven. 
    "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek 
    to enter in, and shall not be able." Here consider, that without laboring, 
    you will not be meet for it. In Heaven there is eternal work; you should 
    inure yourselves to it then, while on earth. "They rest not there day and 
    night." How uneasy it is for a man to work who has spent most of his days in 
    idleness; and how unfit are idlers for Heaven; and unless you be meet for 
    it, there you cannot come. God makes his people "meet to be partakers of the 
    inheritance of the saints in light." Consider also, that falling short of 
    Heaven is certainly getting Hell. There is no middle place. Now who can 
    dwell with everlasting burnings? O how dreadful will the thoughts of 
    slighted salvation be to the damned?</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 1. I am but young, it is time enough. ANSWER. 
    Begin when you will, you will find work enough to occupy all your days. 
    Youth is the best time for that great work; and sure I am, it is far more 
    reasonable to give the best of our days to God than to the devil. But there 
    are graves of all sizes. You know not if ever you shall be old. If you get 
    not something of religion when you are young, seeing you are brought up 
    under a gospel ministry, it will be a thousand to one if you get anything of 
    it when you are old. If you should get it then, you will have but little 
    time to serve the Lord, and little strength for that little time.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Some say they are old now, and are not able. ANSWER. 
    Consider how you have spent your former days. Some never minded God nor 
    religion while strength lasted, and now strength is gone in a great measure; 
    you have the more need now to be at pains, "lest you shall lie down in the 
    dust, with your bones full of the sins of your youth." As for those that 
    formerly have been at pains, beware that you think not that is enough. To 
    you Jesus says, "Be you faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of 
    life." None are excepted from labor that will enter; and put the case that 
    your temporal life were lying at the stake, what would you do? But it is the 
    least part of religion that consists in bodily exercise, the most weighty 
    and important part of it consists in soul exercise.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Some say they have another thing to mind. They have an 
    ill world to wrestle with, and have much ado to get through it, and obtain a 
    livelihood. ANSWER. It will be sad to wrestle with the world here, and with 
    the wrath of God hereafter. Have you not a soul to wrestle for? Alas! many 
    do in this, as some who, when a house is on fire, to save their clothes, 
    they lose their lives. That is the wrong way to get a through bearing. The 
    safest way is to labor for your souls, and trust to God for your bodies. In 
    this way "bread shall be given you, and your water shall be sure." "For 
    godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that 
    now is, and of that which is to come." You that are servants, will work your 
    master's work, and trust that he will pay you what he has promised; why do 
    you not work God's work, and trust his promise as much?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Some say they do indeed resolve to be laborious 
    Christians after this. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Is this work so easy, that you will needs have it 
    to be harder, before you put hand to it. Assure yourselves, the longer you 
    delay, you will find the harder work of it. The devil comes alone at first, 
    at length his name is legion; and it is always hard to turn out old 
    possessors. Sin is like waters, the farther from the head the greater they 
    grow, as Ezekiel 47:3–5. But again, you are not sure that you shall see 
    another day. We are agreed about the necessity of laboring; the only thing 
    is, God says do it now; you say you will do it afterwards; but the time to 
    come is not yours. "Repent," said the Jewish doctors, "only one day before 
    your death." It is wisely said then, "Repent this day; for it may be you 
    shall die tomorrow." Once more, God's grace is not at your disposal, for the 
    outward call may cease, or it may grow more faint. Conscience and the 
    motions of the Spirit may cease; and if all should continue, you cannot 
    assure yourselves of grace to close with them after this moment.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Others say, the business is not so great but it may be 
    soon done; it is but to cry to God for mercy, to believe and repent, and we 
    may do that on a death-bed. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. How do you know that you shall get a death-bed, 
    that you shall not in a moment drop down into the pit? Are there not some so 
    suddenly snatched away, that if a bare cry for mercy would save them, they 
    cannot have opportunity for it. But if they should get leave to cry, it is 
    not so easily got, Luke 13:24. Again, do you think believing and repenting 
    so easy? Then I say, why do you not believe and repent now? Will you not 
    please God in a thing you can so easily do? If you will not do for God what 
    you think you can do so easily, what confidence can you have to look for his 
    favor. Again, I think common sense should teach men at least once to try 
    that on which they mind to venture their eternal state, which if it misgive 
    they eternally perish. If a man were to be let down a steep rock upon a 
    rope, would he not first try if it would bear his weight? Will you then try 
    faith and repentance; and if you have that faith and repentance, that will 
    secure your souls, they will put you on laboring. But it is not so easy to 
    get them as you suppose. True faith and repentance are above nature's reach, 
    Ephesians 1:19, 20; Acts 4:34. When conscience is awakened, though it is 
    easy now for some to presume, yet then it is not, as we see in Judas. The 
    blind mole, when dying, may recover its sight. Do you not observe that a 
    death-bed has oft enough to do with itself? Are not some persons taken away 
    in the rage of a fever, deprived of their senses? Is it time to turn to God, 
    when you cannot turn yourself on your bed; or to secure your soul, when 
    every member of your body is pained.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Some say all this is needless, for they have no power 
    in themselves to do anything. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Wicked men do but mock us in making this 
    objection, for they think not as they speak. To evince this, tell me, did 
    you never resolve to labor? Had you never in all your life one serious 
    thought concerning your souls? Did you never put off the motious of the 
    Spirit with delays? Wherefore do you lean to your own works? Again, no man 
    does all he can, or is able to do. There are many things you are able to do 
    without special saving grace, and yet you will not do them. Does the devil 
    beat drums in your ears while you are hearing the word, that you cannot 
    listen to it, nor apply it? Does he hold fast your doors, and bind you to 
    one another, that you cannot go alone, and meditate on it? Does he forcibly 
    stretch out your legs, and lay a band on your tongues, that you cannot bow a 
    knee to God, nor cry to him for your souls? Do then what you are able, and 
    look to God for grace, and never rest satisfied until he has put you on the 
    way of laboring. Would a master take this for an excuse from his servant, 
    that he has no power to work until God act and move him? Why this is a most 
    certain truth. Yet he must set himself to it, and look to God for his 
    concurrence. Upon the whole then, let me charge your consciences with that 
    word, Why stand you here all the day idle?</p>
<p align="justify">7. Some say there are but few at such pains about 
    religion, and these are a crowd of mean people. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. These might be just prejudices against religion, 
    if Christ had not foretold that it would be so, Matthew 7:13, 14; Matthew 
    11:25; 1 Corinthians 1:26, 27. But I had better go to Heaven with the 
    poorest on earth, than to Hell with nobles, rich men, and the greatest wits 
    of the age. If the Scripture be true, it is but few that will be saved. This 
    work honors any man, but no man can honor it.</p>
<p align="justify">Now to make this labor easy to you, I would recommend,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To keep the encouragements to the work in your eye; 
    particularly such as these, the example of these that have gone before you, 
    and have got safe to the journey's end. These have made it appear the work 
    is possible, and the reward certain. You are not the first that have taken 
    Heaven by storm. There is a cloud of witnesses before you. Again, that God 
    accepts of sincere obedience, though the work be not perfect; if the workman 
    be so, that is sincere, the Lord accepts the work. "For if there be first a 
    willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man has, and not according 
    to what he has not." Now that heart is sincere, where there is not an 
    allowance of any known sin. Another encouragement is, the help promised and 
    ready for those that sincerely labor. "It is God that works in them, both to 
    will and to do of his good pleasure." If you do the things that please him, 
    you are not alone, he is with you. There is also the great reward that is 
    promised; and we are to have "respect unto the recompense of reward." It is 
    no wonder people labor for a rewarding God, whose hands are as full of 
    rewards as his mouth of commands.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Live by faith. Faith has a mighty influence on our 
    laboring. Faith entitles us to that rest, and faith brings supplies for that 
    labor from the Mediator. It provides for all the rest of the graces of the 
    Spirit. A faith of the principles of religion, and a faith relying on the 
    Mediator, are most useful.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Labor to get and keep up love to Christ. Love is the 
    loadstone of obedience. It makes everything easy for the attaining of what 
    is beloved, as in Jacob's love to Rachel.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Look upon that laboring as your interest, as well as 
    your duty. Duty, considered as a mere task, is a weary business. O wonder 
    that there is a possibility of entering that rest, and that you may in such 
    a way attain to it.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be constant in that labor. The great uneasiness 
    flows from the interruptions in that work. To stand still is to backslide, 
    and produces a new work to make up our lost ground, and constancy creates 
    easiness; what is at first hard, by continued custom becomes easy.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That Heaven is a rest into which, those that 
    now labor for it shall be received. I have several times had occasion to 
    discourse of Heaven. I will at present only point at a few things.</p>
<p align="justify">I. In what respect Heaven is a rest?</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a rest from sin. Sin is a toil to a gracious 
    soul. Satan often gets God's children set to his work now; but were they 
    once there, they shall sin no more, for the spirits of just men are made 
    perfect. They shall then be freed from all commission of sin, from the 
    indwelling of it, inclination to it, yes, or possibility of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. From all misery, outward or inward; no pain nor 
    sickness; the poor shall be as easy there as the rich; no desertion, nor 
    hidings of God's face. The wrath to come shall not come near their dwelling.</p>
<p align="justify">3. From the works of their wilderness state. They shall 
    not be put to gather the manna in societies for prayer, or in public 
    ordinances; but they shall be fed to the full with the product of the land 
    falling into their mouths without toil; no prayers, mourning 
    self-examination, nor mortification there. Faith gives place to sight, and 
    hope to fruition.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a rest, in that it is the fulfillment of all the 
    desires of the soul. There they shall have the perfect enjoyment of God, and 
    uninterrupted communion with him. This is the point to which the soul 
    inclines; as the needle in the compass, to the north. Until it comes there, 
    it is restless; but when there, it rests; for he is the ultimate end, and it 
    can go no farther. The soul can understand, will, desire, no more. "Whom 
    have I in Heaven but you? and there is none on earth that I desire besides 
    you."</p>
<p align="justify">II. What sort of a rest is Heaven?</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is an active, or working rest. Their works follow 
    them in this sense. It is not a place where the soul may sleep out an 
    eternity; but they rest not day nor night, yet their work is a rest. They 
    will wonder evermore, and yet with delight they will rejoice evermore 
    without any surfeit, and praise without being weary of the exercise.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A perfect rest; a rest for soul and body both. The 
    Israelites when they got free of Pharaoh's taskmasters, yet in the 
    wilderness had sore toil, but then came to Canaan; so the people of God, 
    they get some rest by conversion, but their great rest is reserved for 
    glory. When they came to the typical rest, there were thorns left for their 
    eyes, and pricks for their sides, but none in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Eternal; it shall never be disturbed. "They shall be 
    ever with the Lord." Their glory is eternal, their crown fades not away. 
    When they shall have been millions of years in their beds of glory, there 
    shall be none to create them the least disturbance, but forever they shall 
    rest in the bosom of God.</p>
<p align="justify">O then take heed you fall not short of this rest, Hebrews 
    4:1.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider that the most of us, at least, have none of 
    the pleasantest lives in the world. You work, you toil, and win your bread 
    with the sweat of your brows. The world is a deceiver to many of us; now to 
    fall short of this rest after this, is to have a continual winter, two 
    hells, neither rest here nor hereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All of us have some hopes of this rest. Hope deferred 
    makes the heart sick; but the eternal frustration of it will be a death, an 
    arrow sinking through the heart. To fall out of a hoped-for rest, will sink 
    the soul to the bottomless gulf of despair.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We have this rest in our offer. The King of glory 
    declares his willingness to match with us, and to bring us into the holy 
    land. To be excluded out of an offered rest, will make the soul for ever 
    restless, and gnaw it as a worm.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is not the least rest in Hell, not a drop of 
    water. They must needs be forever sinking that are sent to a bottomless pit. 
    The smoke of their torment ascends, the worm never dies there, the fire is 
    never quenched. Let us then labor to enter into that rest.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Lest any man fall, after the same example of unbelief.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That unbelief is the great thing that makes 
    hearers of the gospel fall short of Heaven. It is by this they stumble, 
    fall, and destroy themselves; even as by it the Israelites fell short of 
    Canaan. To confirm this point, consider unbelief two ways:</p>
<p align="justify">I. As it rejects the Word of God. "They despised the 
    pleasant land, they believed not his word." God has made a revelation of his 
    will unto sinners, in his word, faith believes his word, unbelief rejects 
    it, and so in effect says God is a liar. What can be expected then, but that 
    the God of truth avenge himself on this affront, by shutting the unbeliever 
    out of Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Unbelief rejects the doctrines of the word. We see how 
    far it has proceeded with some this day, that it has steeled their foreheads 
    with as much impiety and impudence as to reject the Word of God openly; and 
    to disbelieve all these truths that reason teaches not. The same root of 
    unbelief is in us all by nature, and reigns there, where grace has not 
    captivated the heart to the obedience of the truth. That this unbelief is 
    even there, where it is not professed, is clear, if we consider how few 
    there are, that have had the inward illumination of the Spirit of Christ to 
    discover to them these truths in their heavenly luster, John 6:45. Most men 
    have received the principles of religion, merely by the benefit of their 
    education; and so their belief rests upon human testimony, which is no 
    foundation for divine faith, and therefore they are still unbelievers, 
    Matthew 11:25; and 16:17. Again, how many make shipwreck of their faith, 
    even of fundamental principles, in a time of temptation, especially in a 
    time of suffering, 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12. That house must be built on the 
    sand, and that faith must be ill founded, that cannot abide a storm. Often 
    it has been seen, that they that could dispute for the truth, could not 
    suffer for it; while others that could not dispute, could suffer. What is 
    the reason, but "that God has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, 
    and has revealed them unto babes." Another proof of prevailing unbelief is, 
    the inconsistency of most men's lives with their professed principles. Many 
    a man that pretends a sound head has an unsound heart. You may as easily 
    bring east and west together, as many men's practice and their principles; 
    therefore God may say to them, as Delilah to Samson, "How can you say, I 
    love you, when your heart is not with me." Every person believes fire will 
    burn them, and therefore none cast themselves into it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Unbelief rejects the promises of the word. God has 
    made great promises, but unbelief looks upon them only as fair words. They 
    that receive these promises, are by them made partakers of a divine nature; 
    but surely men possessed of such a nature are very rare, for as the apostle 
    says, "all men have not faith," that is, few men. The Israelites had a 
    promise of entering Canaan, but did they believe it? No; they said, "God had 
    brought them to the wilderness to kill them." The promises are as silver 
    cords sent down from from Heaven, to draw sinners to the promised land; but 
    unbelievers cast these cords away from them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Unbelief rejects the threatenings of the word. Men are 
    of stubborn natures; God has therefore hedged about his law with 
    threatenings of wrath. As men traveling in deserts carry fire with them, to 
    drive away wild beasts from attacking them, so God threatens men, to keep 
    them from sin; but sinners generally are more beastly than beasts, and will 
    touch the smoking fiery mountain, though they should be thrust through with 
    a dart; and will make promises of safety to themselves, in opposition to 
    God's threatenings, Deuteronomy 29:19, 20. If we consider narrowly, we will 
    find unbelief of the truths of God at the bottom of almost all these sins 
    that ruin souls, as the mother that brings them forth, Hebrews 3:12. I will 
    instance this in a few, what more bloody sin than unconcernedness about the 
    state of our souls. Few are concerned to inquire into that, whether there be 
    a change made on them, that is saving or not. They live as they were born, 
    and are like to die as they live. Now, what is the cause of this but 
    unbelief, which makes them say, "we are rich and increased with goods, and 
    have need of nothing," and know not that they are wretched, and miserable, 
    and poor, and blind, and naked. Do these persons believe the sinfulness and 
    misery of a natural state? Do they believe they cannot please God, that they 
    are full of sin, and everything they do is sin? that they are under the 
    wrath and curse of God, and that there is no salvation without regeneration, 
    and no regeneration but that which makes a new creature?</p>
<p align="justify">Again, presuming on the mercy of God, they live in their 
    sins out of Christ, and yet they hope for mercy. Do these believe that God 
    is such an one as he has revealed himself to be? Do they believe him to be 
    just and holy, and that he will by no means clear the guilty. They overturn 
    the very foundation of the gospel; for if mercy could have been had for 
    mercy's sake, what needed Christ die.</p>
<p align="justify">The text intimates to us, that it is unbelief that cuts 
    the sinews of the labor here enjoined. What idler would not dig, if he 
    thought to find a gold mine that should be his own? How do men sweat and 
    work, in order to get a livelihood, and these same persons will not be at 
    pains for Heaven. Surely if they believed the one as well as the other, they 
    would not refuse. By the continuance of an unholy life, men show that they 
    do not believe that "without holiness no man shall see the Lord." Do they 
    think Hell to be a real place of torment, or only a bugbear?</p>
<p align="justify">II. Consider unbelief as rejecting Christ. When men had 
    by their sin excluded themselves from Heaven, God sent Christ into the 
    world, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have everlasting 
    life. Now unbelief rejects him, and casts him off, who is the only Savior, 
    Acts 4:12.</p>
<p align="justify">Unbelief questions, yes and denies the soul's need of 
    Christ. It puffs up men with conceit of themselves, so that it is a 
    difficulty to get them to submit to be carried to Heaven. "Going about to 
    establish a righteousness of their own, they have not submitted themselves 
    to the righteousness of God." Strange indeed, that the patient will refuse 
    to submit to a cure, or a naked man to receive clothes.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes unbelief denies the infinite merit of Christ, 
    and with Cain says, as the margin has it, Genesis 4:13, "My sin is greater 
    than can be forgiven." O! but it goes ill down with an unrenewed heart, to 
    expect life out of death, and satisfaction to justice by another. They that 
    have believed according to the exceeding greatness of God's power, have 
    found this very difficult.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes it denies Christ's willingness to save and help 
    the sinner. Hence we find the leper believing his power, but doubting his 
    will: "If you will, you can make me clean." Men think it easy to believe 
    Christ's willingness to save them, until the conscience be enlightened, and 
    then this monster sets up its head. Now rejecting Christ, it must needs make 
    men fall short of Heaven. For by this mean,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It keeps the soul in a state of condemnation. "He who 
    believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name 
    of the only begotten Son of God." It keeps the soul under the curse of the 
    first covenant, lays them open to the justice of God, in so far as it makes 
    the soul turn its back upon the city of refuge. The soul is kept naked, 
    having no righteousness in which it can stand before the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It keeps the soul in a state of impotency to do 
    anything to purpose for its salvation. It shackles the man so as he cannot 
    labor, nay, nor move heavenwards. "Without me," says Jesus, "you can do 
    nothing." No influences of grace, to help to resist temptations, can the 
    unbeliever have; for unbelief blocks up the way of communication between 
    Heaven and earth, Jeremiah 17:5, 6; Matthew 13:58. The unbeliever may pray, 
    but God regards not his prayers, "for without faith it is impossible to 
    please him."</p>
<p align="justify">3. In a state of separation from God; for there is no 
    access to God, but by Jesus Christ. "No man comes unto the Father but by 
    him." Faith lays hold on him in whom the Father is well pleased. But as all 
    they that were out of the ark perished in the waters; so all they that are 
    out of Christ shall perish in everlasting misery.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Under the guilt of all its other sins. If a man 
    believe, he will be saved, whatever his sins have been; for faith transfers 
    the guilt upon Christ, which the river of his blood washes away: but if not, 
    he is damned: for unbelief rivets all other guilt.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Take heed, then, there be not in you an evil heart 
    of unbelief. Here is the enemy that kills its ten thousands; that makes 
    foolish virgins fall down to Hell from the threshold of Heaven. It signifies 
    little what lusts be borne down, if this set up its head and prevail; if 
    there be any hazard, it is from this quarter; yet how many are there that 
    will mourn and confess other sins, but this that wounds Christ's heart most, 
    touches their hearts least. Seek it out then, lest if it be with you 
    undiscerned, it lock you out of Heaven at last.</p>
<p align="justify">The example of others that have fallen by unbelief, 
    should quicken us to all diligence about our salvation. By unbelief the 
    Israelites fell in the wilderness, and never saw the promised land. By 
    unbelief, many that have a flourishing profession have turned apostates from 
    God; see these, John 6:60, 66. The Jews fell out of the visible church by 
    this, Romans 11; and by this, hypocrites in all ages have fallen short of 
    Heaven. For this end they are recorded, that we may escape the rocks on 
    which others have split. Our hearts are all alike by nature; "as in water, 
    face answers to face; so the heart of man to man." We may stumble on the 
    stumbling stone on which others have broken to pieces, if we do not take 
    heed.</p>
<p align="justify">See then what use we are to make of the sin and ruin of 
    others.</p>
<p align="justify">They are not matters of sport or talk, to spend the time; 
    but fearful examples placed before us, to bid us always beware. Sure, as a 
    fall from a high place is the most dangerous; so for us to fall over others 
    that have fallen, and whose fall should make us take heed to our feet, will 
    make us fall very deep into the bottomless pit. The first unbelievers may 
    say, though they heard, yet they saw not the danger; but after such direful 
    examples, we cannot but say, as we have heard, so have we seen. Amen.</p>
