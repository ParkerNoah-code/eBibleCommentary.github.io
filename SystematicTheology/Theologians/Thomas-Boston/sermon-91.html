<p align="justify"><br/>
    Psalm 110:3 "Your people shall be willing in the day of your power."</p>
<p align="justify">OUR Lord Jesus Christ is this day erecting his standard 
    in this place, requiring us to submit ourselves to him. But, Oh! how averse 
    are sinners to submit to him; were it left to their own will, he should be a 
    head without a body, and though he travailed long and sore, yet should have 
    no issue; but God has otherwise secured it. "Your people shall be willing in 
    the day of your power."</p>
<p align="justify">This is spoken to Christ, by David, in the spirit of 
    prophecy. That it belongs to Christ, no Christian can doubt; for here David 
    in spirit calls him Lord. The Jews, denying the divinity of the Messiah, 
    could not extricate themselves from that difficulty. "If David then call him 
    Lord, how is he his son?" But to us it is easy, for as he was man, he was 
    the son of David, and came after him, but he was more than man, being God he 
    was David's Lord, and so was before him. He is in this Psalm held forth as a 
    priest having an everlasting priesthood; and as a king, who has Jehovah for 
    his confederate, who sets him at his right hand, even on his throne, after 
    he had overcome death, Revelation 3:21. He is placed upon his throne, with a 
    promise that his enemies shall be made his footstool; which imports his 
    absolute victory over them, and the eternal disgrace that shall lie upon 
    them. The footstool is a piece of state, that both raises and eases him that 
    sits upon the throne.</p>
<p align="justify">In the second verse it is plain David speaks, and so 
    continues; "The Lord shall send the rod of your strength," that is, the 
    gospel in power, "out of Zion," Micah 4:2. Your kingdom shall begin there, 
    but it shall extend itself to the nations. But how shall he reign that has 
    so many enemies? He shall set up his kingdom in the midst of them. But shall 
    he have no kindly subjects? Yes he shall. "Your people shall be willing in 
    the day of your power."</p>
<p align="justify">There is here, 1. Something supposed. Namely, that Christ 
    has a people in the world where he erects his standard, that he has a 
    special relation to, and interest in. Your people, even his people, Matthew 
    1:21. The elect who are his, by gift from the Father, John, 17:9, and by 
    purchase, he has bought them with his blood, John 10:15. It is supposed 
    also, that he finds these unwilling to submit to him, as well as the rest of 
    the world. The corruption of the will, is common to them with others. They 
    are not only as infants who do not know their Father; but as rebellious 
    children, who yield no obedience to him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is something here ensured to the mediator, 
    respecting this people of his; namely, that these unwilling people shall be 
    willing, Hebrew, willingnesses; which imports that they shall submit to him, 
    and give away themselves to him; acknowledge the right which Christ has to 
    them, and be his people by their own consent. It imports that they shall do 
    this cordially, with all their heart; it shall not be a lying to him, as 
    hypocrites do; it shall not be a forced pretext only, but their wills shall 
    be cast into the mold of his will, and in point of practice conformed to the 
    will of his commandments. See Isaiah 49:18, and 55:5.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is the time when, and the way how this shall be 
    done. "In the day of your power." That is, in a day of the gospel's coming 
    with power. "For the gospel is the power of God unto salvation." There is a 
    power which is Christ's that makes them willing, that is the power of 
    Christ's spirit, different from moral suasion, 1 Thessalonians 1:5. This 
    power opens the heart, dissolves the stone in it, melts down the old will 
    and renovates it. Nothing less can do it, nor break the iron sinew in their 
    necks. Then there is a day for this power, a time appointed from eternity, 
    at which everlasting love that was under a cloud, shall flash out on the 
    faces of these children of darkness, and bring them forth to marvelous 
    light. The gospel sometimes it is but like wild fire, that gives light, but 
    does not burn up that on which it falls, but in this day it is big with 
    power, and so brings forth children to God.</p>
<p align="justify">What follows, is diversely rendered, and interpreted too. 
    It seems to me to point at these things: 1. The beauty: the spiritual beauty 
    of those that are thus made willing; they shall stand before him in the 
    beautiful garments of holiness, as so many priests unto God. 2. The 
    suddenness of this change, as if that beauty of theirs had fallen from the 
    womb of the morning as the dew, Micah 5:7. And 3, the multitude of converts 
    who are Christ's youth, or young men being born again.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That Christ has a people in the world that 
    shall be willing in the day of his power, cordially submitting to him. I 
    shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Touch at that corruption of the will, with which 
    Christ finds his people, as well as others possessed.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Speak of the willingness of the soul submitting to 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I will touch a little at the day of power.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to touch at that corruption of the will, with 
    which Christ finds his people, as well as others possessed, when he comes in 
    a day of power.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a weakness in their will, they cannot will 
    what is spiritually good and acceptable to God. They cannot produce one act 
    of the will that is holy, until grace change their wills, no more than a 
    dead man can produce his own resurrection. For we are by nature without 
    strength. "It is God that works in you both to will and to do of his good 
    pleasure. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think anything of 
    ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God." They may with the foolish 
    virgins, Matthew 25 will grace, but they do but desire it in a carnal 
    manner.</p>
<p align="justify">2. An aversion to good. We are naturally backward, and 
    therefore must be drawn. How unwilling is the fish to be drawn out of its 
    element into another, so are we to leave our own ways. "You will not come to 
    me," says Jesus, "that you might have life."</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a proneness to evil, a woeful bent of the 
    will carrying it to sin. "My people," says God, "are bent to backsliding 
    from me." Hence they are mad upon their idols. Place Christ and the devil, 
    life and death, duty and sin, before them, leave the will to itself, it will 
    naturally run to the evil, as the water runs down a steep place.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is a contrariety in the will, to the will of 
    God. "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject 
    to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Hence it is enough for us in this 
    state to will anything, that God forbids it. Even the heathen confessed that 
    men were disposed to desire unlawful things, and to rush upon things 
    forbidden. Strip sin naked of all profit and pleasure that may attend it, 
    yet the sinner will court sin for its own sake.</p>
<p align="justify">5. There is contumacy in it, the will is willful or 
    obstinate in evil. The man will not be turned, though he should run upon the 
    sword point of vengeance. "Cast away from you all your transgressions, 
    whereby you have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit; 
    for why will you die, O house of Israel." Unrenewed sinners, like the 
    Leviathan, "count darts as stubble, and laugh at the shaking of the spear." 
    Yes, they say, in opposition to the curse, "we shall have peace, though we 
    walk in the imagination of our heart, to add drunkenness to thirst."</p>
<p align="justify">This is that corruption which we have derived from Adam, 
    by whose fall all the faculties of our souls were corrupted and distorted: 
    and our will in particular made wholly the devil's captive, not to be 
    delivered but by a day of power.</p>
<p align="justify">We now proceed:</p>
<p align="justify">II. To speak of the willingness of the soul submitting to 
    Christ. "Your people shall be willing." What a wonderful change is this! The 
    same soul that was unwilling before, is now willing. What makes the change? 
    They are made, they do not make themselves willing. The Lord changes their 
    wills, takes away the evil qualities of their will, and gives new qualities. 
    "A new heart also," says he, "will I give you, and a new spirit will I put 
    within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh; and I 
    will give you an heart of flesh." Thus the power of God infallibly 
    determines their wills; yet not blindly, but so as they see what most 
    reasonably should turn the balance in their choice. For, in every step God 
    deals with them as rational creatures, giving them a peculiar illumination 
    to proceed. We shall particularize and illustrate this, by showing what they 
    are now willing to do, and how this willingness in every step is produced. 
    1. They are willing to part with sin. "Ephraim shall say, what have I any 
    more to do with idols." They were never more willing to swallow the sweet 
    morsel, than now they are to part with it. Their hearts were glued to their 
    idols, now a day of power melts the glue, and the soul is content to part 
    with sin, cursing the day that ever they met. The soul that held fast sin 
    and refused to let it go, would give a world to be quit of it. Never was 
    there a man that had drunk a cup of poison, that would more willingly have 
    vomited it, than such a soul would now part with sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, how comes this wonderful change? Surely the man is 
    made willing. There must needs be a power there, to make the man loath above 
    all things, what before he loved above all things. This is plain, if you 
    consider that the man was joined to his idols, and unable to turn from them. 
    "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?" Then may you 
    also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. His sin was so rooted in his 
    heart before, that no threatenings, no promises could separate him and it. 
    Surely it must be strong wind that rends the rocks, and lays the tall cedars 
    upon the ground; and since he is willing to part with sin, surely he has 
    seen and felt something, which he did not see nor feel before. Yes,</p>
<p align="justify">He has felt an uneasiness of conscience rising from the 
    guilt of his sin. Sin has become uneasy to him, and begun to work and sting 
    him. Like Peter's hearers, he is now pricked in his heart. Unless the soul 
    were ripped up, how would it thus as it were cast forth its affections. This 
    uneasiness has become intolerable. "A wounded spirit who can bear." His 
    bosom beloved has been very troublesome, or why would he cast it out?</p>
<p align="justify">He has also seen something in God, which he never saw 
    before. The man would never have been willing to have parted with sin, 
    unless he had seen happiness locked up in the enjoyment of God, and that sin 
    separates him from that God, and will separate him from him for evermore if 
    retained. But the soul sees itself lost and undone without God, and he is 
    sure that he is liable to his wrath and curse for it, and is not able to 
    abide with everlasting burning, or dwell in devouring flames.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are willing to go out of themselves, to be 
    divorced from their first husband the law; to cast off all confidence in 
    their attainments and duties; to come to Christ stripped naked and empty, 
    with nothing in them or on them to recommend them to him but misery Their 
    language is, "For your name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is 
    great."</p>
<p align="justify">Now surely there must be power here. Naturally we take 
    the spider's motto, each, saying, I am indebted to myself alone. The 
    covenant of works is ingrained in our natures. Work and gain, do and live, 
    is the first principle of all Adam's posterity. They were bred merchants, 
    and they are ashamed to beg: and though their stock is gone, yet they will 
    rather drive a trade of small wares than none at all. Coming out of our own 
    righteousness is a death, a dying to a husband. "My brethren," says Paul, 
    "you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should 
    be married to another, even to him that is raised from the dead, that we 
    should bring forth fruit unto God." Does the spider sweep away its own web, 
    which it spins out of its own affections? Does a mother cast out the fruit 
    of her own womb? or will a loving wife put herself to death, that she may be 
    free of her husband. And so we are made dead to the law, as it is in the 
    original. And therefore the willing soul sees that the best of their duties 
    cannot procure the favor of God. Isaiah 64:6, 7; Philippians 3. They see the 
    emptiness and worthlessness of all they do. Hence they cannot but loath 
    themselves as for their sins, so for their duties.</p>
<p align="justify">They see and feel an obsolute need of the Lord Jesus 
    Christ and his righteousness. The person finds he is sick, and therefore 
    needs a physician; that he is naked, his fig leaves will not cover him, and 
    therefore the Lord God must make him a garment, "even a white clothing that 
    he may be clothed, and the shame of his nakedness not appear."</p>
<p align="justify">He sees also, that he has nothing in him, or about him to 
    recommend him to Christ. Many spoil all, by thinking they have something 
    that cannot but engage Christ to take their cause in hand, as their tears, 
    prayers, repentance, deeds of charity. But the truly willing soul takes 
    David's plea, Psalm 25:11. And comes as he is invited, without money, that 
    he may take the water of life freely; lost he should meet with the 
    entertainment of Simon Magus, and hear it said, "your money perish with you, 
    because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."</p>
<p align="justify">He sees, moreover, that God and Christ should do him no 
    wrong, though he should not be accepted, but be suffered to perish. He will 
    say with the centurion, "I am not worthy that you should come under my 
    roof." He will justify God come of himself what will, Psalm 51:4. And thus 
    if the soul should meet with a disappointment it will leave its complaint 
    upon itself. And upon the back of any refusal will say, "true and righteous 
    are your judgments, O Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are willing to take Christ as their Savior, and 
    to submit to his righteousness. God proposes in the gospel a spiritual 
    marriage between his Son and sinners, Matthew 22. Most men refuse the offer, 
    but the willing soul heartily consents to the bargain and makes Christ its 
    choice for all, instead of all, and above all; and takes him for a husband, 
    as the captive woman marries the conqueror. The soul is well content to 
    venture its salvation upon this bottom alone, Philippians 3:9. To appear 
    before God in the garment of his righteousness, to seek life in his death, 
    and healing only in his wounds.</p>
<p align="justify">Now there must be a power to make the soul thus willing. 
    Every man naturally is an enemy to Christ, and therefore as long as the soul 
    can make any shift it will not come; there must be a drawing power; yes, 
    such a power as wrought in Christ, when God by his mighty power raised him 
    from the dead. The soul being thus willing it follows,</p>
<p align="justify">That such a soul has seen a transcendent excellency in 
    the Lord Jesus Christ. It has seen him to be the pearl of great price. 
    Sometimes like others, they said to the Christian, what is your beloved more 
    than another beloved? But surely now they see a beauty in him that 
    captivates their hearts and makes their souls love him. The veil covering, 
    or face covering is taken away, and their eyes see the king in his beauty; a 
    beauty that dazzles their eyes, that darkens all created glory, as the 
    rising sun makes the stars disappear.</p>
<p align="justify">They have got also a satisfying view and discovery of the 
    continuance of salvation through a crucified Savior, else their souls could 
    not acquiesce in it. The mystery of Christ is folly to the natural man when 
    he comes near to look on it, but the willing soul gets another sort of a 
    discovery of it, "determines to know nothing, save Jesus Christ and him 
    crucified." You know the world's opinion of the mystery of Christ crucified. 
    "It was to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness." And 
    that still remains true. "Blessed is he whoever shall not be offended in 
    Christ." Two things made the world stumble at the gospel way of salvation. 
    Its supposed unsuitableness to the divine perfections, this is the bane of 
    the Jews, Socinians and others. Its supposed unsuitableness to the case of 
    men, this stumbled the heathens. To expect life from one crucified seemed a 
    most gross absurdity to them. All natural men are in the dark as to this 
    still, therefore they reject him. And therefore I conclude that the man that 
    is made willing has got a view of the suitableness of this contrivance to 
    the divine perfections. They have seen in it the manifold wisdom of God. Men 
    that are not careful about their souls will venture them on they know not 
    what; but a man that is in earnest about salvation, will never venture it on 
    that bottom that is not made of God for that end. The man sees he has to do 
    with a God that is wise, just, and powerful, as well as merciful: therefore 
    as no man will venture to sea in a ship that cannot hold out water, so the 
    soul in earnest cannot venture unless it see the plan suitable to the 
    wisdom, justice, and power of God. To such "Christ is the power of God, and 
    the wisdom of God."</p>
<p align="justify">He has also got a view of its suitableness to his own 
    case. Men that see the worth of their souls will not take a remedy at random 
    for their perishing souls, lest it be found poison instead of medicine. 
    Wherefore the soul looking about in the day of distress, and finding nothing 
    in the world but miserable comforters, Christ discovers himself to that 
    soul, and the soul seeing his suitableness resolves to venture here as upon 
    one able to save, and every way fitted for their needs. Matthew 13:45, 46.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The soul is willing to take on the yoke of Christ's 
    commandments. Its language is, "Lord, what will you have me to do?" Having 
    fled from the fiery law on Sinai, he is content to stand at Zion, and 
    receive the same commands. He is willing to stoop and take on Christ's 
    burden, and is sorry he cannot bear it better. The ears that were shut 
    before are now opened. "Speak, Lord, for your servant hears." Holiness is 
    now the desire of his soul. Now,</p>
<p align="justify">There must be a power here, what else could break the 
    iron sinews in their necks, and tame the bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. 
    The wild donkey could never be tamed until now, surely then the month is 
    come. Hence it is evident the willing soul sees a beauty in holiness, a 
    righteousness in the commandments of God, and a loathsomeness in sin. He 
    considers all God's precepts concerning all things to be right; and he hates 
    every false way. If sin be as sweet as before, if they see no beauty in 
    holiness, surely they are not the willing people; and it is needless to them 
    to pretend to the feeling of a power, unless they would make it appear that 
    God makes men willing without reason.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The soul is willing to bear Christ's cross, to cleave 
    to him and his ways, and to follow him through fire and water, Luke 
    14:25â€“33. All that he has is at Christ's service, houses and lands, 
    relations and life also. The smiles of the world cannot bribe him, nor the 
    frowns of it drive him away. He is content to own Christ, when despised and 
    rejected of men. Now there must needs be a power here to make a man thus 
    willing, not only to suffer, but to suffer for him, for his glory, and to 
    keep up his standard in the world; rather to suffer for him, than to sin 
    against him. "Thus it is given to them in the behalf of Christ, not only to 
    believe on him but also to suffer for his sake." Hence sin is more bitter to 
    the willing soul than death, and all the sufferings to which they can be 
    exposed, Ecclesiastes 7:26. Certainly both are bitter. Now, when both are 
    laid before them, and they choose sufferings, this says, that sin to them is 
    most bitter. Here is the ruin of many professors in a time of trial, sin was 
    never the most bitter thing to them, though it has been bitter; and 
    therefore the Lord fits his people for suffering, by letting them experience 
    the bitterness of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Christ is sweeter to the willing soul, than all 
    the pleasures and profits of a world, else they could never be willing to 
    forego these for Christ, Philippians 3:8, 9. Alas! many never felt so much 
    sweetness in Christ as in a lust, hence they let him go, and return to their 
    lusts again. Some get half a view of Christ's preciousness, hence a 
    half-willingness, a hankering after him. But still the world and their lusts 
    are sweeter, and therefore like Orpha, they depart from him weeping.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The willing soul is willing to go away with 
    Christ, for altogether, home to his Father's house. I am not saying they are 
    all absolutely willing to die. They perhaps want assurance of a safe lodging 
    place. But this I say, if Christ would carry them away to his Father's 
    house, they would be content to bid farewell to all below, and go with him.</p>
<p align="justify">Now there must be power here, that reconciles a man to 
    Heaven, to everlasting communion with God. "Giving thanks unto the Father, 
    who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light." 
    Hence it is evident, the willing soul is one that has a transcendent love to 
    Christ, and a desire of communion with him; even of such a communion as may 
    never be overclouded nor interrupted. They are unwilling to want it, and 
    their souls long for it. We shall now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Touch a little at the day of power.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Though the gospel may be long preached unto a people, 
    yet there are some special seasons that may be looked on as days of power. 
    The same power does not always accompany the word. Days when the gospel is 
    new to a people, days of persecution, days when there is a spirit of prayer 
    poured out, and times of sealing ordinances, these are more likely than 
    others to be days of power.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is an appointed time for the inbringing of all 
    the elect of God, and that is the particular day of power to them. As it was 
    to the Israelites, when at the end of the appointed time, "even the 
    self-same day, it came to pass that all the host of the Lord went out from 
    the land of Egypt." He who appointed the time of their natural birth, 
    appoints also the time of their spiritual or new birth. There is a day and 
    hour, in which everlasting love will dawn on the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A dark night usually goes before this day of power. 
    The soul is led to the place of execution before the pardon be given out; 
    they are cast down before they be lifted up; conscience is awakened, the 
    heart pained, before peace and health be diffused through the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Whenever this day of power comes, the soul is made 
    willing, the fort of the heart is taken, and the King of glory enters in 
    state, turns out the old inhabitants, and puts in new. And there are three 
    things done in that day. 1. Christ gives the conquering stroke, and by an 
    Almighty power opens the prison door, and so it is the day of the captives' 
    deliverance. 2. The spirit of Christ is at work travailing to bring them 
    forth, and so it is their birth-day. 3. Christ gains the bride's consent, 
    and so it is their marriage day.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 1. Pray earnestly for a day of power. There are 
    three things we much need, and which a day of power would do for us. 1. It 
    would revive the graces of the spirit in the Lord's people among us, that 
    are decayed and languishing. A marriage day is a feast day for the 
    bridegroom's friends, in which the bridegroom bestows gifts upon them. The 
    Lord's people have need to be made more willing, to have the backwardness to 
    duty taken off their spirits. 2. It would bring in many new friends to 
    Christ, would bring many out of the devil's kingdom, into the kingdom of 
    God's dear Son. 3. It would make enemies, that are none of Christ's 
    purchase, to feign submission, and put a stop to the open profanity 
    abounding in our day. Psalm 81:15.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 2. Show yourselves Christ's people, by 
    submitting to him. This day he is erecting his standard in this place, and 
    we invite you in his name, to stand out no longer against him, but come to 
    him and receive him, and give up yourselves to him. Motives,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider what you are, while you submit not to Christ. 
    You are under strange lords. If you be not Christ's subjects, you are the 
    devil's slaves; you are the servants of sin. And what is it you are so fond 
    of, that you prefer it to Christ: is it pleasure or profit? "What is a man 
    profited, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what 
    shall a man give in exchange for his soul."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider Christ is an exalted king. He is placed at 
    the Father's right hand, on his throne. Will you deny him a lodging in your 
    heart? The rejecting of Christ, in his humiliation, was grievously punished 
    upon the Jews, what then shall become of the neglectors of an exalted 
    Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">3. He is a priest as well as a king. It is only by virtue 
    of his sacrifice and intercession, that you can get mercy. Finally, you must 
    stoop to him sooner or later. "We must all stand before the judgment seat 
    of Christ. To him every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess." If you 
    submit not willingly, he will make you his footstool. He is a merciful king.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Try whether you be really such as submit honestly 
    to Christ. Especially you that are to sit down at the Lord's table, see if 
    you be a willing people. Try your willingness.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Your willingness if right, will be a supernatural 
    willingness, made by a day of power. Wild oats grow without labor, but bread 
    corn requires labor and pains. Willingness lightly gained, lightly goes. So 
    it was with the stony ground hearers, and those who received the seed among 
    thorns. The child that never found any bitter thing on the breast, easily 
    returns to it; and the soul that is willing to take Christ, but never felt 
    the bitterness of sin, it is like it will not long stay with him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is accompanied with understanding. The willing soul 
    makes an understanding choice. An error in the person, (in marriage), makes 
    it null. Many in their pretended choice of Christ, make a blind choice, not 
    knowing him, hence they run away from him again. Malachi 3:1, 2.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is deliberate. The soul sits down and counts the 
    cost, but a rash consent will be retracted.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is an absolute willingness. Philip said to the 
    eunuch, "if you Believe with all your heart, you may be baptized. And he 
    answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." That is 
    to believe with the whole heart, when the soul makes choice of Christ and 
    his ways, because of their inward beauty, which they would do, were there no 
    Hell. But alas! many are willing to take Christ just to be a bridge, to 
    carry them over the water of God's wrath.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is for the present. Real willingness will 
    admit of no delay. Matthew 8:21, 22.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 1. I fear I am none of Christ's people. ANSWER, 
    If you be one of the willing people, surely you are one of his.</p>
<p align="justify">2. I fear Christ is not willing. ANSWER, That is a 
    dreadful reflection on his veracity. Do you think that he mocks you while he 
    invites you, and promises you a welcome reception. Nay, know if Christ had 
    not been willing, you had not been willing, "we love him, because he first 
    loved us." It is he who has made you willing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. But I cannot get my heart made willing. O how backward 
    is it, and averse to stoop. ANSWER, Is that your exercise and burden? It is 
    a good sign. Are you willing to be made willing? that is some degree of 
    willingness. Do you see that beauty in Christ, that hatefulness in sin, that 
    you are grieved that your soul cleaves so fast to it, you are of that 
    willing people. Amen.</p>
